"Wilkie, Andrew, MP",IND,2017-10-26,"



Mr WILKIE
 (Denison) (09:33):  I seek leave to move the following motion:


That this House:


(1) notes that:


(a) a fifth Crown Casino whistleblower has now made allegations consistent with earlier whistleblowers about serious misconduct at the Casino;


(b) one of the allegations is that one or more machines manufactured by Xcite were illegally tampered with, to reduce the payout to gamblers, through the removal of the ""gamble button"", a feature which allows users to bet on their winnings, and that the relevant button was replaced by a blank plastic cap;


(c) this modification is inconsistent with the regulator's approval of this type of machine and is therefore illegal;


(d) to verify the veracity of these latest allegations, one of the Member for Denison's staff visited the Casino at approximately 10 pm on Sunday, 22 October and confirmed this machine was operating on the floor of the Casino on the river side, near the membership office, but when that member of staff revisited the Casino on Wednesday, 25 October at approximately 4 pm the machine had been replaced by a different machine and the first machine was nowhere to be found;


(e) the illegal machine disappeared after the Member for Denison raised allegations concerning Crown Casino in the Parliament, which is clear evidence of someone covering up criminal activity; and


(f) there is a record of this episode which will be forwarded to police and the Victorian gambling regulator as soon as possible;


(2) further notes, that it is reasonable to assume that the misconduct in question is not unique to Crown Casino and extends to the poker machine industry broadly; and


(3) calls on the Government, and the Opposition, to immediately support a parliamentary inquiry into the casino industry so that those who allege misconduct, and representatives of the industry, can have their say in an open and transparent way and so that the community, including the 17 million who visit Crown Casino annually, can be witness to this.




Mr Pyne:
  The government won't be giving leave for the motion to be moved, but we won't shut down the suspension motion if the member for Denison wishes to move it as a suspension.




Mr WILKIE:
  Then I move:


That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Denison from moving the following motion immediately—That this House:


(1) notes that:


(a) a fifth Crown Casino whistleblower has now made allegations consistent with earlier whistleblowers about serious misconduct at the Casino;


(b) one of the allegations is that one or more machines manufactured by Xcite were illegally tampered with, to reduce the payout to gamblers, through the removal of the ""gamble button"", a feature which allows users to bet on their winnings, and that the relevant button was replaced by a blank plastic cap;


(c) this modification is inconsistent with the regulator's approval of this type of machine and is therefore illegal;


(d) to verify the veracity of these latest allegations, one of the Member for Denison's staff visited the Casino at approximately 10 pm on Sunday, 22 October and confirmed this machine was operating on the floor of the Casino on the river side, near the membership office, but when that member of staff revisited the Casino on Wednesday, 25 October at approximately 4 pm the machine had been replaced by a different machine and the first machine was nowhere to be found;


(e) the illegal machine disappeared after the Member for Denison raised allegations concerning Crown Casino in the Parliament, which is clear evidence of someone covering up criminal activity; and


(f) there is a record of this episode which will be forwarded to police and the Victorian gambling regulator as soon as possible;


(2) further notes, that it is reasonable to assume that the misconduct in question is not unique to Crown Casino and extends to the poker machine industry broadly; and


(3) calls on the Government, and the Opposition, to immediately support a parliamentary inquiry into the casino industry so that those who allege misconduct, and representatives of the industry, can have their say in an open and transparent way and so that the community, including the 17 million who visit Crown Casino annually, can be witness to this.


There is a pressing need to suspend standing orders and for the parliament to deal with what I will now call the Crown Casino scandal. No longer are we talking about untested allegations by anonymous whistleblowers. Now we have a credible witness, a senior member of my staff, who went to the casino on two occasions at my direction. On the first occasion he saw an illegal machine in operation on the floor of the casino. It was a machine where a button had been removed and a function had been removed from that machine with the sole intent of increasing the revenue from that machine and decreasing the payout to poker machine gamblers. When he went back to the casino several days later, the machine had been removed and was nowhere to be found. So not only do we now have a credible witness—not hearsay; this is a man I will stand by and stand behind; I will vouch for what he tells me—who is a witness in recent days to an illegal poker machine on the floor of Crown Casino, but we also have a credible witness to a criminal cover-up with the removal of that machine as a direct result, obviously, of the allegations I've been airing in the parliament last week and this week.


All of a sudden all of the whistleblowers—five have now approached me—and all of their allegations, so far untested, are now to be seen in a different light, because at least one of those allegations, the one allegation I could easily check, we did check and it was found to be true. So I now am shifting from saying these are allegations which need to be explored, to saying quite clearly and unambiguously at least some of those allegations are correct and Crown Casino is guilty of criminal behaviour.


So far the response in this place has been, 'It's all someone else's problem.' Well, it's not someone else's problem. It is our business. One of the allegations is of money laundering. That is a serious criminal offence. We can only speculate at the purpose of that money laundering. Is it to do with drug running? Is it to do with terrorism? Who knows what it's to do with? That should concern us.


One of the allegations is about the competence of the Victorian regulator, another reason for federal intervention. It comes back to the point that, when it comes to poker machine regulation in this country, we simply cannot trust the state and territory governments to regulate it effectively. And no wonder, because they are deeply conflicted. The state and territory governments receive about one-quarter of the money that's lost on the poker machines in this country. There's over $10 billion a year lost, and about one-quarter of that goes to the state and territory governments. They can't be trusted on the one hand to enjoy that revenue and want to see more of it, and on the other hand to ensure the industry is run well and the welfare of members of the community is protected.


There is a pressing need for this parliament to act, and the way we can act is to establish a parliamentary inquiry. This is the ideal way, the perfect way, to let those who have made allegations, and others, and representatives of the industry who will want to defend their industry, to come out of the shadows, to stand in the open in front of members of the parliament, in front of the media, in front of the community and say what they have to say and to say it in a safe environment, because those witnesses will have the protection of the parliament.


I've now had dealings with five separate whistleblowers about Crown Casino, and some of them are scared. People say, 'Why don't they just go to the police?' Put yourself in their shoes. Making allegations against one of this country's biggest and richest and most powerful corporations—of course they're scared for their safety! We know the sorts of allegations that also circulate about the rough and tumble that you'll see in some parts of the gambling industry in this country. No wonder people are scared. They're worried for their safety. They're worried for the safety of their families. They're worried for their job prospects in the future. There are any number of reasons why they don't want their identity to be known, but they come to people like us to do stuff like this, because the justice system, the police, the regulators, the state and territory governments are not doing their jobs well enough.


So far the call for an inquiry has fallen on deaf ears. Both the government and the opposition are refusing to weigh into this. I don't doubt there are some really good people in this place, some really good people in the government and some really good people in the opposition: people who care about the community and don't like the current shape of the gambling industry in this country. But, systemically, you're all compromised because the major parties receive millions of dollars in donations from the gambling industry. Crown Casino alone in the last five years has paid three-quarters of a million dollars to the major parties in political donations. And what a great return on that investment Crown has so far gotten from the government and the opposition, both of which are running a hundred miles from the call for a parliamentary inquiry. You know, $750,000 buys a lot of influence in this place, and so far it has bought a refusal to have a parliamentary inquiry.


As of today, it's no longer hearsay; it's no longer untested allegation; it's no longer anonymous whistleblowers. It's me standing here saying that I have a senior member of staff who walked into Crown Casino within the last week and saw an illegal machine on the floor of the casino—a criminal act by Crown Casino. That same member of staff went back several days later and the machine was gone and was nowhere to be found. In the motion, I've even identified where the machine was originally sited. The cover-up of a crime is a crime.


The time has come for the government and the opposition to show that they have not been bought by the gambling industry, that they haven't been bought by Crown Casino. Today is the day for them to stand up and show the community that they are their own men and women and that they haven't been bought off—bribed, in effect—by the poker machine industry and by Crown. I again call on the government and the opposition—the good people among you—to say to your leaders that now is the time for a parliamentary inquiry and that it's not good enough to leave an investigation to the police and the regulator. Let's have a proper inquiry. Let's shine some sunlight on this. Let's get to the bottom of it.



The SPEAKER:  Is the motion seconded?

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2017-10-26,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (09:46):  I second the motion. The Greens demand a full inquiry into these scandalous allegations at Crown and will not rest until we get one. If ever there was a case for this parliament to say, 'We're going to put aside the business that we're otherwise dealing with to deal with a matter of national urgency,' it is this. We don't currently have a national anticorruption watchdog like some states have. We don't have a national ICAC, so we can't ask such a body to look into it. We should have one, but we don't, because Labor and Liberal won't support the establishment of one. We can't trust the state governments, because the state governments are the biggest gambling addicts of all. They're the ones who profit from the misery of people whose lives are broken as a result of gambling. They profit from it and they're in cosy with the casino operators, so we can't trust them to look at it. And, critically, in this case it's alleged that the state regulators have turned a blind eye or have been involved in it. So that is a classic case of where the federal government needs to step in, where there are allegations not only of wrongdoing at a casino but of wrongdoing involving the regulators themselves.


So we need to step in and have an inquiry, and a full inquiry, where people can front up and give their evidence under parliamentary privilege. You have to have guts to be a whistleblower in this country. If you stand up, you worry that you might face repercussions. Whistleblowers have come forward. They've come forward to the member for Denison and made some very, very serious allegations. We should drop everything to take those allegations seriously, because they involve breaches of federal law, they involve state regulators not doing their job and they involve Crown Casino committing a crime. Those are the allegations.


We've asked for a full parliamentary inquiry to be established and we haven't got one. Why? It is because the only thing spinning faster than the poker machines is the revolving door between this place and the casino industry. There are members of this parliament who probably can't wait to get out of their job so they can go and take up a cushy job somewhere else, as previous MPs who have gone and got a job lobbying for the casino industry have done in the past. They are continuing to profit from people's lives being broken and made a misery. So, when former members of this place front up on behalf of big business and say, 'No, we'd like you not to have an inquiry,' lo and behold, that's what happens. And when the casinos make big donations to the Labor and Liberal parties, the old parties, they expect a return. Well, today the casinos have hit the jackpot. They're getting payday. They're getting the return on their donations, because the old parties in the parliament are in collusion, steadfastly refusing to investigate these allegations.


Think about some of the things that this parliament has decided to inquire into before and the fact that the government are prepared to spend tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars on a royal commission into unions or into previous government schemes—the insulation schemes, for example. They're prepared to spend money on that. They're prepared to spend money on that for political purposes and political outcomes, but when it comes to something the public genuinely cares about—casinos and the gambling industry, who make their money out of breaking people's lives—people want action. But, sadly, time and time again we see big money dictating what happens in this place. This parliament should act in the public interest, not in the interests of a few private donors.


This parliament has been captured by the big end of town. If the government wants to show that it's serious about transparency and the Labor opposition thinks that transparency is important, now's your chance. Now's your chance, Labor and Liberal parties, to show that honesty is more important than money. Support this motion. Support the establishment of a full inquiry. Let's shine a light on what is happening in casinos, because these allegations are getting stronger and stronger, the evidence is mounting up and we need to shine some sunlight.



The SPEAKER:  The question is that the motion be agreed to.




A division having been called and the bells having been rung—




The SPEAKER:  The question is that the motion moved by the member for Denison be agreed to. As there are fewer than five members on the side for the ayes in this division, I declare the question negatived in accordance with standing order 127. The names of those members who are in the minority will be recorded in the Votes and Proceedings.


Question negatived, Mr Bandt, Ms McGowan, Ms Sharkie and Mr Wilkie voting aye.

"Porter, Christian, MP",LP,2017-10-26,"



Mr PORTER
 (Pearce—Minister for Social Services) (09:58):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


This bill will establish legislation for a Commonwealth Redress Scheme, which we'll call simply 'the scheme', for survivors of institutional child sexual abuse. With this bill the government introduces a best-practice, simple and supportive redress scheme.


Children placed in the trust of our society's institutions were some of the most vulnerable members in our community and the fact that must be confronted is that many children were sexually abused by the very people charged with their care and protection. No child should ever experience what we now know occurred. That is why it is time for all institutions and all governments to take responsibility for what has happened.


The establishment of the scheme is an acknowledgement by the Commonwealth government that sexual abuse suffered by children in institutional settings; operated by a number of governments state, territory and federal and by a number of non-government institutions was wrong, a shocking betrayal of trust; and simply should never have happened.


The Redress Scheme in this bill is designed to recognise the suffering survivors have experienced, to unequivocally accept that these events occurred and to ensure that each institution that has been responsible for abuse in their institutional settings must take responsibility for that abuse.


The Commonwealth government acknowledged the need to provide public recognition of the suffering experienced by survivors and investigate the inadequate responses provided by institutions through the establishment of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. The royal commission's Redress and civil litigation report recommended the establishment of a national redress scheme for survivors of institutional child sexual abuse. All governments and individual institutions were directed to make amends and take responsibility for the shameful acts inflicted on children while in their care. Critically, the royal commission determined that the payment of redress must align with institutional responsibility for the harms that were suffered and so redress should occur on what has become known as a responsible entity basis.


The royal commission identified more than 4,000 institutions where sexual abuse took place. More than 2,000 survivors reported sexual abuse in a Catholic institution, 500 survivors reported abuse in Anglican institutions and more than 250 reported abuse in institutions run by the Salvation Army. In total, the royal commission estimated that almost 40,000 survivors were sexually abused in institutions run by non-government bodies such as those run by churches and charities and 20,000 survivors were sexually abused in state and territory government run institutions. More than 6,500 people who gave private evidence said more than one person had abused them.


These estimates are, very sadly, merely a window into the scale and breadth of historical institutional child sexual abuse in Australia. It is vitally important to survivors that responsible governments and responsible institutions participate in this scheme and provide redress on a nationally consistent basis for survivors.


The royal commission has heard evidence of thousands of Australians who when vulnerable children were subject to the most horrendous sexual abuse in institutions throughout Australia. The psychological, physical and emotional injuries inflicted on these children were inevitably severe and are capable of long-lasting destabilising effects on survivors for the rest of their lives. In spite of the severity of the damage done, many survivors have not sought or have not obtained any kind of acknowledgement or redress for the harm suffered.


There is evidence that some survivors take years, even decades, to disclose their experience of child sexual abuse. It may also take years or decades for survivors to identify a connection between the abuse they suffered as a child and its impact on them as an adult. By the time many survivors feel ready to seek acknowledgment and compensation from a responsible institution, the natural passage of time is an enemy to traditional mechanisms operating effectively to hear and find the existence of common-law damages, and in many instances this traditional compensatory process is simply not feasible for survivors or may simply no longer be available.


The long-term impacts of child sexual abuse can leave many survivors much less able to confront institutions directly and they remain at great risk of retraumatisation. For some, the legality of traditional compensatory processes 'triggers' the memories to an extent that abuse becomes relived.


The sexual abuse we know was inflicted on children by the very institutions that were charged with their care and protection means that the acts, and the often inadequate responses of both primarily responsible institutions and governments, were shameful. This is why redress is so badly needed.


The establishment of a Commonwealth Redress Scheme demonstrates critical national leadership by acknowledging the wrongs of the past and providing a just response to survivors. It is also an important step towards healing and ensuring governments and institutions take the appropriate steps to safeguard against these heinous, criminal acts being repeated in the future. This bill responds to the royal commission's redress recommendations and the Commonwealth government's commitment to establish the foundation for a nationally consistent Redress Scheme.


All responsible institutions and each state and territory and the Commonwealth government should be ashamed of what occurred on their watch and I urge all of them to join with the Commonwealth's best-practice approach to delivering redress that is set out in this legislation; to survivors that redress must be given in as fair and timely a manner as possible. The Commonwealth Redress Scheme will create a consistent approach, based on the essential and critical principle that 'the responsible entity pays'. If an institution bears real responsibility for the harm, that institution must rightly pay the costs of providing redress for that harm. Matching responsibility with redress is the critical condition for creating a better Australia where these types of outrages are far less likely to occur. No institution should expect another to pay for its often shameful conduct.


Detailed negotiations with states and non-government institutions are continuing in order to ensure maximum coverage for survivors across Australia. By establishing this Redress Scheme, the Commonwealth is ensuring that its own survivors will be able to access redress from 1 July 2018.


The scheme will provide survivors with three elements of redress, comprising:


1. a monetary payment of up to $150,000 as a tangible means of recognising the wrong that survivors have suffered;


2. access to counselling or psychological services of their choice throughout their lives; and


3. a direct personal response from the institutions responsible, where that is sought by the survivor.


The scheme will adopt a survivor focused and trauma informed approach; access to redress will be simple and support will be available throughout the application and acceptance process.


Survivors will not pay income tax on monetary payments they receive through the scheme and payments will not be directly garnished to recover any outstanding debts that may exist to the Commonwealth. Neither will payments be considered income for the purposes of determining social security and veterans' entitlement payments.


The scheme is not intended to supplant or detract from the enduring and important criminal law or common law avenues to seek justice. It is intended, however, to provide a survivor with a means to access a sense of and process in justice, through monetary redress and through restorative supports. It is intended in this sense to be faster, simpler and less distressing for survivors and provide governments and institutions with the means to deliver justice to their survivors.


In developing this legislation, we consulted with, and listened to, a broad range of stakeholders on the development of the scheme and this bill. The bill aligns with the views of the independent advisory council on redress (including many survivor groups), jurisdictions and non-government institutions.




Overview of the scheme



Under this bill, redress will be available for survivors of child sexual abuse that occurred in Commonwealth institutional settings. It will also provide redress to survivors abused in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory when these jurisdictions opt in or if they are ultimately compelled to do so by the Commonwealth.


The scheme will be established in 2018 and will run for 10 years, with all applications to be finalised by 30 June 2028, however the scheme can be extended if there is a cogent need to do so.


From March 2018, a dedicated telephone helpline and website will be available to provide information on a preliminary basis about the scheme. These services will also connect survivors with specialist community based support services including legal, financial and other social supports.


From 1 July 2018, the scheme will commence accepting applications from survivors of institutional child sexual abuse for which the Commonwealth and other participating governments and institutions are responsible.




Eligibility



For a person to be eligible for redress they must have suffered sexual abuse where a participating institution is responsible and where it occurred when the person was a child before the scheme's commencement on 1 July 2018.


While a person must have suffered sexual abuse to be eligible, the scheme will also acknowledge related non-sexual abuse, for example physical abuse. Sexual abuse, of course, rarely occurs in isolation and it is important to deal with the whole of the survivor's experience as it pertains to the requisite sexual abuse.


A person may only make one application for redress, so if they have suffered more than one instance of abuse, applications should disclose all instances in their application. This means that once a decision has been made on an application, a person will not be able to make additional applications to the scheme. This, again, is to ensure the speed and simplicity of the scheme and that the totality of the applicant's experience can be properly considered.


While there are no applicant age restrictions, applicants must be living. Families will not be able to lodge an application on behalf of a deceased relative. However, if a survivor dies after lodging a complete and eligible application, their estate will receive the redress payment due to the survivor.


For an application to the scheme to be approved and an offer of redress to be made, the operator must make a determination that there is a reasonable likelihood that the survivor is eligible. Reasonable likelihood is a lower evidentiary threshold than a balance of probabilities test which is generally applied in civil legal processes.


To be entitled to redress, a person must accept their offer and, in doing so, release the participating institution deemed responsible from civil liability in relation to abuse within the scope of the scheme.




Monetary payment



The amount of the monetary payment will be determined by looking carefully and closely at all of the circumstances of each person and applying consistent criteria. The maximum amount of redress payable under the scheme will be $150,000.




Access to counselling or psychological services



Eligible survivors will be provided with access to counselling or psychological services in addition to the assistance already provided by the Commonwealth through Medicare. Consistent with the royal commission's recommendations, the scheme will provide survivors with flexibility to access the counselling or psychological services of their own choice. This will empower survivors to make decisions about their own counselling needs and will support them to maintain existing therapeutic relationships.




Direct personal response



Survivors will also have the opportunity to receive a direct personal response from the participating institutions responsible for the abuse. A direct personal response is a statement of acknowledgement, regret and apology and will be delivered to survivors by the relevant participating institution after the survivor has accepted the offer of redress.


The response may be delivered through a range of mechanisms including face-to-face meetings with an appropriate representative of the institution or through written engagement with the survivor. The participating institution will be required to make quite clear what they are willing to offer by way of a direct personal response to survivors and what that process will involve.


The direct personal response will give the survivor the chance to be directly acknowledged and to tell their personal story of what they experienced and the way in which it has impacted upon them. Through this process, a participating institution can develop a shared understanding, a critical understanding, of what happened to the survivor and the harm that was caused, which will enable the institution to consider what else it may need to do to prevent such abuses and harm occurring in the future.




Deed of release



Before survivors receive redress, the survivor will accept their offer by signing an acceptance document in the form of a deed of release. Accepting an offer of redress has the effect of releasing the responsible participating institutions from any further liability for instances of sexual abuse and related non-sexual abuse of the person the subject of the redress payment.


This means that the survivor by a transparent agreement will, upon accepting the offer of redress, undertake not to bring or continue any civil claim against the responsible participating institution or institutions in relation to the specific abuse.


Ensuring the availability of redress for survivors is dependent on the extent to which states and territory governments and non-government institutions decide to join the scheme. The deed of release is perhaps the most important feature in terms of encouraging those critical institutions to opt in to the scheme and thus it is a mechanism by which we can ensure greater coverage for survivors as without it institutions may be exposed to paying compensation through civil litigation in addition to providing redress under the scheme and so might decline to opt in to the scheme.


The release will never preclude any criminal liabilities of the institution or alleged perpetrator, nor provide release in relation to any other abuse outside the scope of the scheme.


A survivor may have previously signed a deed of release for money received in relation to institutional child sexual abuse. Importantly, the rules of the scheme will contain, as a foundational principle for entry, that institutions will need to waive reliance on a prior deed of release signed by a survivor.


Any relevant prior payments made by participating institutions in relation to the abuse within the scope of the scheme will be subtracted from the redress payment. In essence, survivors who have received a previous payment related to circumstances the subject of the present redress application would receive an effective 'top-up' to the previously received payment up to the total redress amount determined under the scheme. If a survivor's monetary payment is reduced to nil as a result of past redress payments, the assurance is that they will still be entitled to access counselling or psychological services or receive the direct personal response available under the scheme.




Responsibility for abuse



The scheme is based on the critical principle of 'responsible entity pays', which was a key recommendation of the royal commission. A participating responsible institution will be expected to pay for redress for their survivors, along with a proportionate share of the administrative costs. This is the best way to ensure fairness and justice for survivors and prevent the prevalence of the conditions of immorality derived from irresponsibility that gave rise to these terrible events in the first instance.


For a participating institution to be responsible, the abuse must have occurred in circumstances where the institution was primarily or equally responsible for the abuser having contact with the person who is the survivor. In making this determination, the following criteria will be considered:


whether the abuse occurred on the premises of the institution, where activities of the institution took place, or in connection with the activities of the institution;


whether the alleged abuser was an official of the participating institution when the abuse occurred; and


whether the participating institution was responsible for the care of the survivor when the abuse occurred.


A participating institution is primarily responsible for an alleged abuser having contact with a survivor if the institution is solely, substantially or primarily responsible for that contact, even if there are other institutions that, in a minor or tangential way, might also have responsibility for that contact. In such cases, the institution will be required to pay the full amount of redress, that is the institution will pay the full 100 per cent share of redress even if some other institution might have been responsible in a minor or tangential way.


A participating institution will be considered equally responsible where they are equally responsible with one or more other institutions for a child having contact with an alleged abuser. In these cases the responsibility for funding redress will be shared equally and each responsible institution will be required to pay an equal 50 per cent share of redress.


This structure is designed as the best means of achieving a simple, clear, non-legal scheme which avoids all the complexities associated with exhaustive allocations of divided responsibility that causes great cost and time to be expended in civil litigation. The Commonwealth Redress Scheme rules will further define the extent of institutional responsibility as cases are assessed under the scheme. This will allow the scheme to deal with any unanticipated issues that might arise over the 10-year life of the scheme.


With respect to the issue of funder of last resort, in cases where a government is considered equally responsible, they—the government—may be determined to be the funder of last resort. This will occur when the other equally responsible participating non-government institution:


does not exist and does not have a meaningful and substantive connection with an 'umbrella' or 'subsuming' modern organisation; or


the responsible institution does exist but is unable to pay redress because they have been deemed insolvent.


Where a funder of last resort arrangement is determined to exist, the government that shares the responsibility will pay the full amount of redress by paying the equal share of redress the participating non-government institution would have otherwise paid.


The scheme will provide for the development of agreed categories of cases where responsible governments will share responsibility with an institution and will be a potential funder of last resort. If a case falls into an agreed category, the relevant government will automatically be determined to be equally responsible and therefore liable for redress.


Where a case does not fall into a specified category, other factors will be considered, including: who was responsible for the care of the child; the employment of the abuser; and the placement of the child in the institution at the time of the abuse such that an obligation on the institution could be inferred.


With respect to the issue of shared financial obligation, in cases where there are multiple instances of child sexual abuse which occurred across multiple institutions, the scheme operator will decide which was the responsible institution in each case. Each responsible institution will contribute a share of the redress for the survivor. The redress contribution will be apportioned in accordance with the severity of each instance of abuse.


With respect to information use, disclosure and mandatory reporting, the bill includes provisions for the use and disclosure of information under the scheme. This will ensure all aspects of the scheme's ability to share and gather information is underpinned by law. Information sharing protocols have been balanced against the need for the scheme to have appropriate transparency and flexibility, with survivors' rights to privacy.


Information received by the scheme will be confidential and will not be able to be further disclosed or used for an unspecified purpose. Participating institutions will also be restricted in the ways that they can use protected information provided to them from the scheme operator. Misuse or unauthorised disclosure of scheme information may constitute an offence under legislation and would carry with it a penalty of imprisonment for two years or 120 penalty units, or both.


In keeping with mandatory reporting obligations, referrals to law enforcement authorities will not require the consent of the survivor or participating institutions and 'blind' reporting will occur (that is, where the individual survivor is de-identified).


With respect to independent decision makers, the Secretary of the Department of Social Services is the formal operator of the scheme. The bill will allow the scheme's operator to delegate decision-making responsibilities to appropriately qualified, independent assessors, who will be known as independent decision-makers. These independent decision-makers will be supported in their decision-making by recommendations from the dedicated redress recommendation team that will be located within the Department of Human Services.




The rules



With respect to the rules, the bill will include a provision to make legislative instruments known as the Commonwealth Redress Scheme Rules. The rules will set out additional requirements necessary for the implementation of the scheme and may cover matters such as: eligibility requirements or exemptions; determining the amount of payments for an eligible person under the scheme; and the form and manner of the direct personal response.


Before closing, there have been innumerable individuals who have contributed to the construction and the advice in preparing the principles for this bill, including those who sat on our independent advisory council. I'd like to personally thank them for their enormous assistance, input and forbearance through a difficult process. I'd like also to make some special mention of the member for Swan, who himself as a child endured some of the worst that these institutions had to offer. His insight, advice and assistance to me as a minister and his ability to act as a conduit with the survivors for whom this bill purely exists has been something for which I personally will be indebted to him for a long time.




Summary



In summary, the Commonwealth is showing national leadership by introducing a redress scheme that is flexible and as non-legal and as informal as the circumstances will allow. The scheme paves the way for all governments and institutions across Australia to take responsibility and provide long-awaited redress to survivors who suffered sexual abuse as children while in their care and protection. It is of course now time to acknowledge these shameful wrongs and finally provide survivors with the recognition they deserve. For these and other reasons, I commend the bill to the House.

That this bill be now read a second time.


This is the companion bill to the Commonwealth Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Bill 2017, which will establish a redress scheme for survivors of institutional child sexual abuse. The establishment of the scheme is an acknowledgment by the government that child sexual abuse suffered by children in Commonwealth institutional settings was wrong and should never have occurred.


This companion bill provides consequential amendments to Commonwealth legislation in light of the scheme. For example, amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 and Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 will ensure the payments are not income tested and will not reduce the income support payments of survivors who receive payments under the scheme. The payments will also be quarantined from the divisible property of a bankrupt to ensure that the survivor has the full benefit of their payment.

It is the case that this companion bill will also remove external review mechanisms, and allow disclosure of spent, quashed and pardoned convictions to the scheme. These amendments are essential to implement and maintain the integrity of the scheme. It will ensure the scheme remains survivor focused and trauma informed by being a non-legalistic process for survivors who have already suffered so much. I commend the bill to the House.

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (10:37):  On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present the committee's report entitledReport 468:Defence major projects report (2015-16): inquiry based on Auditor-General's report 40 (2016-17).


Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Ms BRODTMANN:
  by leave—Every year the Department of Defence and the Australian National Audit Office work together to produce a consolidated review of selected major Defence acquisition projects, with the resulting report called the Major Projects Report, or the MPR as it has come to be known. The MPR is then reviewed by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit.


The 2015-16 MPR has a total approved budget of approximately $63.7 billion, covering nearly 58 per cent of the budget within the Approved Major Capital Investment Program.


The MPR reviews risks, challenges and complexities facing major projects in general, as well as the status of the selected major projects in terms of cost, schedule and forecast capability.


This review of the MPR by the JCPAA also included consideration of ANAO audit report 11 (2016-2017) on the Army's armed reconnaissance helicopter—known more widely as the Tiger helicopter.


The ANAO found that the Tiger helicopter fleet has not yet delivered the original capability expected by the Australian government, and continues to experience higher-than-expected costs.


The Chief of Army declared final operational capability, or FOC, for the Tiger project in April 2016. The declaration was seven years later than planned, and was accompanied by nine operational caveats.


At the time of audit, the Tiger project had 60 capability deficiencies deemed by the Department of Defence to be critical.


The committee examined the ANAO's finding that the Department of Defence had not prepared the Tiger project data summary sheets 'on the basis of the guidelines', and that the project maturity score of the Tiger project did not 'accurately or completely represent the project's maturity' at the time of review.


The committee gave particular attention to the significance of the Auditor-General's qualified audit finding. Accordingly, the committee agreed to continue to monitor the Tiger project and related issues in future MPRs.


Previous committees have taken an interest in transparency across the project life cycle for projects reported in the MPR, and the committee has pledged to continue to maintain and enhance transparency where possible.


The committee also examined capability performance reporting and analysis, and noted the ANAO's demonstration that application of different analysis methodologies could yield vastly different results. The committee recommended that Defence review its procedures for the development of expected capability estimates and report back to the committee on the outcomes of the review within six months and with a progress report within three months.


Project maturity scores were another area of interest to the committee. Project maturity scores are designed to provide 'quantification, in a simple and communicable manner, of the relative maturity of capital investment projects as they progress through the capability development and acquisition life cycle'. In 2016 the committee recommended Defence make improvements in project maturity scores, and this year the committee has reiterated that recommendation, calling on Defence and the ANAO to commence discussions on updating project maturity scores. The committee has outlined a series of deadlines to progress these discussions.


The committee is pleased to note the downward trend of time lost over the course of projects, otherwise known as 'schedule slippage', but notes that projects should be properly classified at commencement to ensure that expectations around project delivery are realistic.


The committee also noted differing methodologies used by Defence to calculate cost per flying hour between the MPR and the audit into the Tiger helicopters project, recommending that Defence devise a single methodology, one single methodology, to enable clear comparisons to be made between documents or projects. The Department of Defence should provide this information to the committee prior to the first sitting week of 2018.


Progress has been made in improving transparency in the reporting of Defence major project expenditure over the years since the MPR was instituted, and incremental improvements occur year upon year thanks to the professionalism of the ANAO and Defence of Defence. In concluding, I would also like to extend my thanks to all members of the committee for their deliberations during this inquiry, and also to the secretariat.


I commend the report to the House.

Ms LAMB
 (Longman) (10:43):  Yesterday I was celebrating the visit from the shadow minister for defence, Richard Marles, when he visited Remembrance House in Burpengary to talk to a group of returned service men and women. Remembrance House is quite literally a house. It's actually a home, a place for veterans to live and adjust to civilian life. It's a great initiative. We're very fortunate to have one in Burpengary; it's one of two in the country. The other sits in the member for Herbert's electorate up in Townsville. At this meeting with the honourable member, the shadow minister for defence, Richard Marles, we were resoundingly told of how difficult it can be for veterans to find decent, secure work that matches their needs. And, as a strong advocate for the veteran community, I heard this loud and clear, and I have been taking action since.


I hold the position of the chair of Labor's Australian Jobs Taskforce, a caucus committee listening to people around the country involved in the job market: people in work who are looking for more work; people who are actually looking for any work at all; businesses; industry leaders; job service providers; and councils and state governments, of course. It's an initiative of the Labor Party to help shape policy that will move Australia forward. As I said earlier, listening to people is the only real way to formulate strong policy, particularly in this space of employment. So recently I have been holding a number of conversations with those in the space of employment for veterans, as part of this task force, and we've heard some very interesting things. We've been told in these conversations what the barriers are to people finding work and what support our veterans need in finding work, and of course we have been asking them what the solutions are to finding that work and helping them with that support. It's always good to get their views and their recommendations.


In the years that the Abbott and Turnbull governments have been in power, too little has been done for the veterans of Australia—in particular, too little has been done to help them find decent and secure work upon returning to civilian life. I'd have to say that, until Labor gets into power at the next election, I'm more than happy to lend a hand and support any changes that support veterans, no matter how small those steps are.


I'd now like to turn to schedule 4 of this bill. These changes are by no means sweeping reforms—the department has already been able to facilitate these employer initiative payments; this bill just legislates them—although, again, we'll welcome anything that helps our veterans. While strengthening the legislative foundation of payments is of course a good thing, it's not groundbreaking reform. What we really need, though, is this government to take a stronger, more considered and deliberate approach, making sure that meaningful policy enacts positive change for our veterans.


I also support changes in schedule 5 of this bill, which amends the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004, as well as the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 for Defence related claims. This schedule will facilitate information-sharing between the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission and the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation, with respect to certain service related compensation claims. The way that the system currently works is that, if someone's discharged for medical reasons, they have to undergo a medical. Then they have to go to the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation to organise payments. When they go there, they have to organise for another medical assessment. And then, if they go to the Department of Veterans' Affairs, they have to go through another. These amendments in schedule 5 of the bill go to making sure that the complicated and lengthy claims process for people seeking assistance from the department is smoothed and is easier for them. Enabling that sharing of information between the departments will assist the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation in making speedier superannuation benefits assessments and, in turn, assist the department in recognising a person's entitlement to incapacity payments. It's one of the issues with the current process. I've heard time after time that it's lengthy and it's complicated; for vulnerable people, it's additional stress that they just do not need. So of course I support schedule 5. As long as proper safeguards to protect veterans' privacy are in place, Labor and I are always supportive to changes to improve this process. So I'm happy and pleased to support this bill. I'm happy to support procedural processes that smooth the way forward and cut red tape for our veterans.

Ms MADELEINE KING
 (Brand) (10:49):  Before I speak on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 2017, I would like to briefly associate myself with and support the comments of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and those of the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, the member for Kingston, earlier this week in relation to the government's response to the recent Senate committee report on the inquiry into suicide by veterans and ex-service personnel, The constant battle: suicide by veterans.


It's a good thing that the government has accepted all the recommendations of the report, and Labor looks forward to continuing discussions with the government on the implementation of the recommendations. As someone who has a significant defence community—hosting, as Rockingham does, the largest naval base in Australia—veterans' concerns are of particular importance to me, and I welcome this action to address the tragic issue of suicide among the ex-service personnel and veteran community.


I'd also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the member for Kingston on her elevation to the Labor shadow cabinet. The member for Kingston and her office have been invaluable to me as an incoming member of parliament in the seat of Brand by assisting my office in the many and varied questions and issues that are raised by veterans and ex-service personnel and their families that live in my community. So I'd like to congratulate and thank the member for Kingston.


I'd like to speak in support of the Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 2017 and its amendments, that look to improve the operation of veterans' affairs legislation. The implementation of amendments that will clarify, improve or streamline the operation of the law as it applies to veterans' affairs and processes within the Department of Veterans' Affairs is a good move. My electorate of Brand, as I've said, is home to the Royal Australian Navy's largest base, HMAS Stirling, located just off the coast of Rockingham. Commissioned in 1978, HMAS Stirling now hosts 12 fleet units, including the RAN's Anzac class frigates, with Collins class submarines also stationed here. HMAS Stirling is home to more than 2,300 service personnel. HMAS Stirling and Garden Island, on which the base is, have changed a great deal since I was a young girl growing up just around the corner in Shoalwater Bay.


With many past and present servicewomen and men making the communities across Brand their permanent homes, this bill has the potential to improve the lives of many people in my electorate. This bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade for consideration and, given the number of schedules and the potential impact they will have on how veterans engage with the department, this referral was supported by Labor. We on this side supported this referral so that the legislation could be thoroughly examined and so that proposed changes would not leave veterans any worse off once enacted. I'm happy to support those proposed changes that will benefit the former servicewomen and men and their families who live in my electorate, and, of course, those across the country.


I'd like to turn to the amendments and what they'll mean for people affected. This bill deals with a number of different elements within the Veterans' Affairs legislation in its eight schedules. Schedule 1 amendments look to align the provisions of the Veterans' Entitlements Act under which the Veterans' Review Board operates and those similar provisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. This work to align these similar provisions will modernise the board's operation by ensuring the board provides a mechanism of review that is accessible, fair, economical, informal and quick; proportionate to the importance and nature of the matter; and promotes trust and confidence in the board's decision-making. The Veterans' Review Board provides independent merits reviews of decisions about pensions and allowances under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. This includes disability pensions, as well as rehabilitation, compensation and other benefits under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act.


Appearing before the board when dealing with matters relating to pension decisions, compensation issues and rehab issues can be a highly emotional and daunting experience for many veterans. The RSL, in its submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, made the point of stating that many veterans who lodge a claim:


… are often dealing with emotions associated with the loss of their military career, their inability or reduced ability to provide for their family, difficulty in obtaining employment post-service if they are injured or ill and strained relationships with family


Appearing before the board is not an easy or straightforward action for many. This should be recognised as we consider this bill.


Schedule 1 amendments also impose an ongoing obligation on both the claimant and on the Department of Veterans' Affairs during the period until the board has determined the matter, to lodge with the board a copy of any document that is in their possession relevant to the review that has not been lodged previously. The amendments provide the board with the power to vary or revoke a decision made under the alternative dispute resolution process, with the consent of the parties and where the board is satisfied that it is within its powers and otherwise appropriate to do so. It also requires the Repatriation Commission or any person representing the commission in a review to use their best endeavours to assist the board in fulfilling their legislated objectives. These are all positive measures.


However, it was proposed that section 6 of schedule 1 would give the Principal Member of the Veterans' Review Board the ability to dismiss an application for review should they be satisfied that the application, among other things, is misconceived, has no reasonable prospect of success or is otherwise an abuse of process. Stakeholders raised concern about this with the committee, and we on this side had concerns about this provision. The Veterans' Review Board is a less adversarial process than the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Veterans are not represented by lawyers before the board. Appearing before the board gives veterans a chance to have their say. It is their chance to be heard when otherwise they might not be. By taking this chance away from veterans, the government would fundamentally change how veterans engage with the board and how veterans perceive the board. I've been told by a senior advocate who appears before the Veterans' Review Board that most associations who represent veterans at the board would not support this change. People who work in this area, the volunteers who work to assist vets and their families were very concerned that, while a principal member is usually quite reasonable, there was a risk in introducing this change. There was a risk that a person could wrongly interpret documentation, leading to a veteran missing out on their right of review. For these reasons, advocates supported the process that is currently in place, as it is one where further advice can be sought and, in the process, can be used to further review a decision of the board.


The proposed change to section 6 of schedule 1 had the potential to deny veterans the opportunity to be heard. We have heard, again through the committee process, that the principal member would have been presented with the circumstances to use this power to dismiss an application for review only three times in the last seven years. Time and experience have shown that the process of review by veterans to the board is not one being misused by veterans, and legislating against veterans having an opportunity to be heard is not an action that I would support. There seems to be little point in doing so. It seems this section would deliver very little while, at the same time, causing unnecessary upset and anxiety in the ex-service personnel community. The Kwinana, Rockingham and Port Kennedy RSL sub-branches in my electorate of Brand would also prefer this section be removed from this bill. We understand that the government, following the Labor opposition's urging, is now moving an amendment to remove this section. We welcome this change, as no doubt will advocates as well, as it recognises the unique nature of the Veterans' Review Board. I am very pleased to see the removal of this section.


Amendments in schedule 2, however, will work to benefit veterans by simplifying and streamlining processes. The current time it takes to appoint staff to the Specialist Medical Review Council—three months or longer—will be addressed. The long delay can affect the council's ability to do its very important job. The council's an independent body where vets who have issues with the decisions of the Repatriation Medical Authority regarding the content of a statement of principles can go for review. The statement of principles' content is in respect of the particular kind of injury or disease or death suffered by the veteran, and this amendment will assist in more timely decisions being made for veterans—and that is a good thing.


Other streamlining measures will enable the Specialist Medical Review Council to adopt electronic lodgement of requests for reviews. That means a hard copy will no longer be required, and so requests for review will not have to be lodged at a Department of Veterans' Affairs office. This measure is broadly supported. Mind you, in particular parts of my electorate, we do have a lot of difficulty getting internet coverage, and the NBN's a long way away, so some veterans living in communities in Baldivis will still have to go to the Department of Veterans' Affairs office because the infrastructure is not in place for them to be able to use this modern provision of electronic lodgement.


In regard to the electronic lodgement provision, the community has commented it should not be used to the detriment of veterans when submitting claims, appeals or reconsiderations. No doubt, for those who can undertake electronic lodgement, it'll be beneficial for those people in a single-claim situation, but there may be complications if a complex issue is involved. I understand such complications can arise around understanding statements of principles and with the different standards of proof required in different situations. It is important that people who choose to use, or are able to use, this new electronic lodgement method do so knowing they can still seek advice from an advocate should they need it; but, for those who do not require additional support and advice, this amendment in introducing a new, more efficient electronic lodgement of request for review does have the potential to benefit veterans who are, indeed, able to access the internet at all.


Other amendments in this bill will allow for the provision of financial assistance to people attending a Specialist Medical Review Council hearing to make an oral submission. This measure will see individuals, as well as representatives of organisations and any necessary attendants accompanying them, being able to receive financial assistance to attend a hearing to make an oral submission. We've received positive feedback on this measure. I've been told it will ensure a better process as it ensures the hearing is as informed as possible of the reasons for the applicant pursuing the review. I'm told there is a chance that the panel might not have all the relevant information before them when making their decision. I'm also told that hard copies of complex claims are not circulated in their entirety and that documents, once lodged, have, sadly, become lost or misplaced. Making it financially possible for a veteran or their representative to attend a hearing and make such an oral submission will help alleviate the stress when these things happen, and this is a positive step.


Another good step in the bill is a measure that would give the minister the power to make arrangements with foreign governments to cover the provision of benefits and the payment of benefits. With this bill, in schedule 3, the minister can enter into agreements in relation to reciprocal arrangements with Veterans' Affairs matters. This amendment will broaden the countries with which Australia can enter agreements beyond the Commonwealth. Veterans' reps in my electorate are supportive of this measure as it is beneficial to veterans who no longer live in Australia. At the moment, only payments payable under the Veterans' Entitlements Act are covered by existing agreements. This bill will now cover allied veterans and Defence Force members with the type of service equivalent to that covered by the VEA. The means that the agreements will relate to payments and treatment provided by the Repatriation Commission or the MRCC. We are supportive of this measure that will extend agreements so that veterans are covered, regardless of the legislative framework.


We hear from veterans and advocates about the lengthy and complicated claims process that people can face when seeking assistance. Labor supports the changes that will assist people in this process to make their lives easier, bearing in mind the need to ensure adequate safeguards are in place to protect veterans' privacy. One way this bill will do this is by addressing the doubling and sometimes the tripling of the requirement for veterans to undergo medicals when they engage in the system. The situation at the moment is that a veteran who was medically discharged needs to undergo a medical and then, when they go to the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation to organise their payments, they undergo another medical, and this may be followed by a third medical when they go to the Department of Veterans' Affairs for assistance. The amendments in this bill will enable information to be shared between the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation and the Department of Veterans' Affairs. This will enable the CSC to access relevant claims information held by the department. Information would include relevant medical and rehab information which would assist the CSC to make quicker superannuation benefit assessments. This will, in turn, assist the department in determining a person's entitlement to incapacity payments. The upside of such sharing would be a more timely outcome for veterans at a vulnerable and stressful time in their lives.


Schedule 7 looks to eliminate the unnecessary delays in administrative issues that are caused when certain veterans' affairs portfolio legislative instruments need to be amended to incorporate changes in non-disallowable instruments. Each individual instrument will no longer need to be lodged in parliament. One such example is when a new rehabilitation appliance becomes available. Availability of the new equipment is delayed, as a legislative instrument that incorporates the document under which the applicant may be provided the equipment needs to be amended to refer to the policy document's changed date. Eliminating such delays would have a real and beneficial impact on veterans' lives and should be supported.


Labor supports the measures in this bill which go to streamlining and improving the law as it improves the processes that affect veterans' lives. With the amendments the government is planning on moving, we on this side of the House offer our support of the legislation. Once again, I congratulate the Minister for Veterans' Affairs on his work and that of his department in this regard, and also the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, the member for Kingston, and her office for all of their work in this portfolio.

"Dick, Milton, MP",ALP,2017-10-26,"



Mr DICK
 (Oxley) (11:04):  I rise to support the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 2017. In doing so, I want to recognise the great work on both sides of the chamber. It is a true demonstration of the commitment that I think this whole House has to veterans in our community. Listening to my colleague and friend the member for Brand, I know her deep connection to the ADF through her family and also through her work as a local MP. I echo the sentiments she finished her comments with today about service and recognising the good work of the minister and the shadow minister.


I want to spend a little time highlighting the fact that the bill before the House is a clear demonstration that when good ideas are put forward and when simplification is delivered, both sides of the parliament can work together. In the last two weeks, I've probably spoken in the House of Representatives and Federation Chamber more than I have done since I was elected. I've spoken about a range of issues, on a range of portfolio allocations and on a number of local issues, but I have particularly taken time to read and understand this bill because I know it demonstrates to the wider Australian community that when both sides of politics work together and when both sides of the House of Representatives can join forces we can make a huge difference. Contrast that with some of the unfortunately divisive debates and divisions we've seen through the week. This bill before the House today gives a clear indication and a clear pathway forward for dealing with complicated issues surrounding veterans in our community.


I want to acknowledge the member for Herbert, who is in the House today, and her powerful speech on this bill yesterday and her strong advocacy as a representative of a large number of serving ADF and personnel in Townsville. Listening to the member for Herbert and talking to her about the advocacy she does when she's in the community in her electorate, I know how important it is that government gets it right.


Listening to the minister's second reading speech and also to the ministerial statement which was delivered to the House back in August, I know there are around 291,000 Australians that the Department of Veterans' Affairs supports. Just over half of these people are veterans or currently serving members of the ADF, around 48 per cent are women, around 82,000 are widows or widowers, and around 2½ thousand are children of veterans. Today, more than 203,000 of DVA's clients are 65 years old or older, while about 23,000 are under the age of 40. They represent every aspect of service, they represent every walk of life and they are across the whole of our nation, in every corner of our cities and towns.


In my electorate of Oxley, I'm very proud to be able to work alongside the RSL and veterans' organisations. I know every single member of the House works hard to advocate the interests of these people and, more importantly, the services that our serving and former serving men and women need in order to participate and to make sure their lives are honoured, and also to assist the transitions that many people go through as they leave the ADF. In the past 12 months, over 1,400 members of the ADF have separated from the forces for reasons not of their choosing. Ten years ago, just over 740 members separated involuntarily. How we help these men and women, how we provide for their transition and how we look at support for people when they are in the broader community is critical to the work that we do as members of parliament and also as community leaders.


We know that the Veterans' Review Board plays an important role in the merits review of decisions by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. As the shadow minister, the member for Kingston, indicated, Labor is supportive of the changes proposed in this bill which clarify, improve and streamline the operation of the law and processes within the department.


One of the first things I did when I was elected to this place was to invite the shadow minister to my electorate to meet with veterans and to meet with the local RSLs in my community. It was very clear from that initial meeting that government has a critical role to play in the ongoing support of veterans. I had been to a number of services over the years. I had met with a number of groups in my former role as a Brisbane city councillor, but it was being elected to this place and understanding and listening to the trauma and the difficulties that former members of the ADF and their families—particularly their families—suffer and go through.


As the son of a World War II veteran who served in the Navy as a signalman, I could always listen to my father talk about his experiences. That was a time when perhaps, following from when he left the Navy, often issues weren't discussed. Often there were times when men and women who served in the armed forces simply said: 'Well, that was wartime. We'll leave that behind. You don't need to talk about that. Get on with your life.'


Luckily, those times have changed. Today's amendments broadly set out a goal and an achievement to make sure that veterans who need support, who perhaps have served and are dealing with complicated issues, have accessibility improved. This bill today is not just about making it fairer; it's about making it more economical and informal and having a quick turnaround for a whole range of services. It promotes public trust and confidence in the decisions that we need to make and that the board needs to make. It's important that the process is as easy as possible for veterans to have a fair hearing on the merits of the decisions made.


There are a number of elements to the bill. It's divided into eight schedules. A number of speakers have gone through those schedules in detail, as did the minister and the shadow minister. I'm going to focus on one or two today. I know the veterans in my community and those who have come to my office seeking assistance have reflected a concern that the current system causes unworkable administrative issues and, sadly, unnecessary delays. We know from listening to the debate and following this closely, as I have, that the shadow minister has conveyed some of these concerns to the government.


After section 155(8), the bill inserts a proposed new subsection (8A), which gives the power to the principal member to dismiss an application for review if it is frivolous or vexatious, has no reasonable prospect of success or is otherwise an abuse of process. As the shadow minister said in her statement, we thank the government for removing this proposed subsection. As the member for Brand indicated, we did share the concerns conveyed by the veterans community and the RSL, who indicated a strong view on behalf of veterans that this proposed subsection should be removed, so we welcome this change. It reflects the unique nature of the Veterans' Review Board.


One of the other great opportunities I've had, apart from meeting and working closely with veterans in my community, was to be able to go onto the ground and visit our troops and our serving personnel when I visited the Middle East through the ADF Parliamentary Program. I was able and privileged to spend time with members of the Defence Force serving in the Middle East. We were able to visit the bases in the Middle East, to visit Afghanistan and to spend time in Kabul. This enabled me as a representative to see very clearly, firsthand, what our men and women go through on a daily basis. You can read about it, you can turn on the television, or you can log on and sometimes view what's happening, but, when you are able to visit a country at war and you see the dangers, the sacrifices and the sheer hard work that our men and women go through every single day, it puts a brand-new perspective on things. That experience left me with a greater respect for the Defence Force and the incredible sacrifices they make.


Currently, there are around 1,700 ADF personnel deployed to the Middle East region. Our Defence Force personnel remain active in advising, assisting and training Iraqi security forces and training and advising the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces in Afghanistan. I was privileged to be able to go and meet them and have a greater and deeper understanding of just what the ADF are doing to assist the men and women serving in the military there to lead, hopefully, to peace and recognition in that region. Our troops are not only doing an incredible job representing our country but, as I said, are working side by side with the local forces to train and equip the Afghan army. Above all, it was amazing. I was honoured to see the professionalism and commitment of our serving personnel on display 24/7.


I know that our troops are the best in the world and incredibly dedicated to serving our country. But I also know that in my own local community there are many ADF families that are separated from their loved ones. I cannot imagine the trauma, difficulties and fears those family members go through from day to day not knowing due to operational issues where their family members are and whether they are safe. The reputation of the ADF and their families and peacekeepers extends beyond our borders and to accompanying nations who also have personnel serving in the region.


From my own experience on the ground, from working with our veterans groups, I understand how critical and important it is to streamline medical and treatment processes for veterans. As I said in my earlier remarks, I have hosted round tables with the shadow minister. This week we saw the elevation to the shadow cabinet of the member for Kingston as our spokesperson for veterans' affairs. That's a very clear and powerful demonstration of strong leadership by an alternative government and by Bill Shorten, the Leader of the Opposition. We are sending a clear message, when it comes to veterans, that there is strong bipartisan support. The minister and the shadow minister worked closely in cooperation. I was incredibly pleased to see Labor taking a positive step to include the issues of veterans in the shadow cabinet. That sends a message to the wider community that we not only take their issues seriously but, if we are privileged to serve the nation as a future Shorten Labor government, we will have a veterans' affairs minister sitting at the table making the major decisions—as it should be.


I acknowledge all the work of members of parliament in this place. We are very privileged to have on my side of the chamber the member for Solomon, Luke Gosling OAM, and the member for Eden-Monaro, Mike Kelly OAM, who have demonstrated their commitment to public service in this place and also in the Australian Defence Force. I know from talking to the members for Solomon and Eden-Monaro the difficulties veterans go through when they leave the force, the difficulties for their families. We heard this week the ministerial statement on suicide within the ADF, and I was so pleased to see both sides of politics joining forces to acknowledge the rates of suicide are too high and, more importantly, that there is a plan going forward and more work to be done.


I thank the minister and the shadow minister for their efforts in working constructively together on this piece of legislation. I look forward to voting for this to see improvements for our ADF personnel. But the job is not finished. As a member of parliament, I will continue to advocate and represent to make sure the interests of our serving ADF men and women are looked after now and in the future.

"Butler, Terri, MP",ALP,2017-10-26,"



Ms BUTLER
 (Griffith) (11:18):  This is a very important bill and, as the member for Oxley has just told the House, it is a great example of bipartisanship and collaboration between the minister and the shadow minister. I pay tribute to the shadow minister. She's been an excellent shadow minister for veterans' affairs and her diligence has seen the elevation of the Veterans' Affairs portfolio to the shadow cabinet, which I think emphasises the significance of the portfolio from the perspective of the opposition.


Labor is supportive of changes in this bill which will clarify, improve or streamline the operation of the law and processes within the Department of Veterans' Affairs. This bill is an omnibus bill. It contains eight schedules which deal with a variety of elements in the legislation. It's fair to say that through the interventions of the shadow minister, amendments will be proposed that will significantly improve the operation of this bill in the interests of veterans and ex-service personnel.


I do want to talk a little about the importance of veterans and veterans' support, including in my own community. I also want to touch on, as the member for Oxley did, the recent ministerial statement in respect of suicide amongst veterans and ex-service personnel, to emphasise the importance of continuing to respond to suicide within that community and to provide support. I'm really fortunate as a member of parliament to have had, for the entire time I have been a member, constant and regular engagement with ADSO to talk about veterans' issues. The local representatives of ADSO were one of the first groups to contact me after I was elected at a by-election in February 2014, seeking to set up regularly scheduled meetings, which we did set up. I want to thank them for the work they have done and continue to do around the country, not just in my electorate, actually helping members of parliament to understand the issues that are unique to and that face the community of veterans and ex-service personnel. I particularly wanted to thank, from ADSO, Ted Chitham and Ross Clelland. They have been quite tenacious and unrelenting in seeking to raise with me several issues that are relevant to the lives of veterans and ex-service personnel. I know they will have seen and noted the work that's been done in respect of suicide in the community, for example.


I also wanted to thank the late Peter Snowdon, who was one of the first of the ADSO representatives to visit me. It was very sad to lose Peter from our community, and the veterans' community lost a very good advocate when Peter passed. I want to acknowledge his work as an advocate for veterans' interests and as somebody who would come to my office and talk to me about these really difficult issues. Occasionally, he would send an email directly to me raising any number of issues. We often disagreed, but he was always so positive about it, so willing to engage in a spirited debate and discussion, and such a great supporter of ADSO's continued engagements with members of parliament. I do miss him and I'm very sorry for the community's loss of Peter.


I'm also fortunate to have in the electorate of Griffith the Greenslopes Private Hospital, which is a veterans' hospital and has been a veterans' hospital since it was established. Greenslopes Private Hospital staff are well known in the community for the work they do with veterans. Their very beautifully put together Anzac Day service, which is a service at dawn that is so well attended by the local community, gets hundreds and hundreds of people. They have an amazing Catafalque party from the local Anglican church grammar school, a beautiful choir from Somerville House that perform every year exceptionally well, and very, very senior representations from the local community and the veterans' community. It's not just the work they do in commemoration and acknowledgment; it's the work they also do in the real issues facing veterans today, and I'm speaking particularly about the work that that foundation does to support post-traumatic stress disorder research.


The Greenslopes Private Hospital also auspices the Gallipoli Medical Research Foundation, which is doing a lot of work in relation to PTSD, including a study in relation to Vietnam veterans which I have referred to in this chamber before. The study found that one in three Australian veterans from the Vietnam War developed PTSD, and that participants with PTSD had four times the chance of having had a heart attack in the past; two times the risk of stomach ulcers; more than triple the risk of acting out their dreams while asleep; almost twice the tendency for restless legs; and increased daytime fatigue and sleepiness, as well as two times the risk of suffering sleep apnoea; double the chance of reflux; a greater tendency to report constipation, diarrhoea and irritable bowel syndrome; and lower levels of good cholesterol, which contributes to an increased risk of heart disease. The ramifications of developing PTSD are physical and psychological, and it is very important that organisations like the Gallipoli Medical Research Foundation continue their work of providing an evidence base about what can be done for veterans who have developed PTSD as a consequence of their service.


I also want to mention the work that is being done by the many RSL sub-branches—and you couldn't talk about the work that's being done for veterans without doing so—in my electorate of Griffith. Being an inner suburbs seat in Brisbane, we're fortunate that we have a range of organisations that provide support for veterans, and we have a range of RSL sub-branches. I couldn't possibly do all of them justice in the short time left to me, but I did want to mention a couple of the RSL sub-branches that I've visited recently.


The first is the Holland Park sub-branch. Every sub-branch is special, but this one is special in a particular way. It's a very naval sub-branch of the RSL. It's led by Sonja and Alan Hellier, who are well known in RSL circles in Queensland. They are both excellent people. Someone said to me the other day, 'What Sonja Hellier doesn't know about welfare for veterans could fit on a postage stamp,' and I think that's pretty accurate. She is a wealth of knowledge for the local community in relation to veterans and welfare. The two of them, together with the committee for that RSL, do so much great work to bring the community together and bring the RSL membership together, and I really want to acknowledge them. I went to the sub-branch's lunch recently. We heard from a really interesting speaker who'd came to military service quite late in his life—not that late, but not as a young person. That's the sort of thing they do. They bring people together; they bring diverse viewpoints together. And, of course, I also always see them every year at the commemoration of the Voyager disaster at St Mary's at Kangaroo Point, which is a very moving service. So I want to acknowledge them both for the work that they do in our community.


Another sub-branch that I've visited recently is the Norman Park RSL sub-branch. Again, it's very special. It's a sub-branch focused on nashos. They have a really great, active sub-branch with, again, excellent commemorations on Anzac Day and, of course, Remembrance Day, which is forthcoming. The nashos came up with a really lovely idea, which was to seek to obtain from the Australian War Memorial a sapling of a Lone Pine and have that planted right behind the memorial at Norman Park. It's a beautiful memorial, so I was very pleased to donate the sapling from the Australian War Memorial. Recently, I met with the leadership of the sub-branch, Brian and Margaret Besgrove, and also with Ken Cork, who'd been the motivating instigator of the Lone Pine project, for a small ceremony in relation to the planting of that Lone Pine.


I do encourage other RSL sub-branches to have a look at what the Australian War Memorial can do in terms of providing Lone Pine saplings. Obviously, for my own electorate, I'd be very, very pleased to assist those who don't have them to obtain Lone Pine trees. It is a really beautiful acknowledgment, particularly as we are commemorating the Centenary of Anzac over these few years in the current period. The nashos sub-branch at Norman Park is a really beautiful sub-branch. So much work is being done there for the welfare of veterans and ex-service personnel. I went to one of their recent lunches as well where we had a really great turnout and a great opportunity to talk about some of the issues of concern to veterans, and a few other issues as well, of course.


In acknowledging the importance of responding to the needs of veterans and ex-service personnel, I did want to mention those organisations. As I say, they are certainly not the only RSL sub-branches in my electorate. There are many of them, and each one of them is unique. Each of them has a specific interest or focus. I went to the Greek RSL sub-branch a little while ago now for a commemoration in Brisbane city. It was a beautiful commemoration for the Greek community as well. I'd better stop because I can't possibly list every single RSL sub-branch in the electorate in this one speech, but I do acknowledge them all for the work that they do.


Like the member for Oxley, I have had family members who have had active service in World War I and World War II, and I do think it is important, whenever we talk about veterans' affairs in this place, to stop and acknowledge what that really means: what active service has meant, what involvement in peacekeeping operations has meant and what it has meant to be a member of the Defence Force, for all ex-service personnel—people who volunteered to make great sacrifices for the country. We owe them a great debt of gratitude, and that willingness, the voluntary nature of it and the sacrifices made, whether in active service or not, ought to be acknowledged at every opportunity when veterans' affairs matters are being considered in this parliament, and I do so now.


I also wanted to touch on, as I said, the bipartisanship around suicide prevention for veterans and ex-service personnel. The minister did make a statement and there was bipartisan support for that. There's a recent Australian government response to a Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee report in relation to suicide by veterans. It's very pleasing to see that the government has accepted the recommendations of that report and has signalled an intention to undertake a range of measures with a view to preventing suicide amongst veterans and ex-service personnel. All of us in this House of Representatives will have heard from local veterans of the loss of friends that they have suffered as a consequence of suicide. All of us will have attended events, like the event that was held here at parliament in recent months, to commemorate suicide amongst veterans.


So it is incredibly important of course that the minister—having published a response to the committee's report, accepting the recommendations that have been made—now vigorously seek to implement all of those recommendations which he has accepted. We know that, in order to get things done in this place, you need vigorous application to the cause. You need constant follow-up. I'm quite confident that the minister and the shadow minister will continue to pursue, with vigour, measures that will improve our response to suicide amongst veterans and ex-service personnel and that that will improve suicide prevention amongst that community as well. It's a very important bipartisan approach that needs to be taken in relation to those issues.


I did want to say just a couple of things about the bill. As I said at the outset, it is an omnibus bill. There have been a couple of particular amendments to the bill that have been inspired by the concerns raised by the Labor opposition, including in respect of the Veterans' Review Board's ability to dismiss an application for review, which caused some concern in the ex-service community. I'm very pleased that the shadow minister was able to lead negotiations for amendments that will deal with some of the concerns that have been raised. I'm also very pleased that this is such a wide-ranging bill that will have such bipartisan support in moves to improve the lives of the veterans and ex-service community. Accordingly, Labor is supportive of the changes which streamline or improve the operation of the law, as far as it does improve processes for veterans, and, in light of the amendments that the government is planning to make, we'll support the bill.

"Kelly, Mike, MP",ALP,2017-10-26,"



Dr MIKE KELLY
 (Eden-Monaro) (11:33):  It is a great pleasure to speak on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 2017 in the context of the bipartisanship that has been demonstrated on this issue. I think the most enjoyable experience that I've had in this parliament has been working on security matters on the intelligence and security committee and on issues to do with veterans with members of the coalition. In particular, I think the Minister for Veterans' Affairs has really had his heart in his portfolio. I still would continue to advocate for, though, and support the suggestions by Neil James and the Australia Defence Association that the minister has got too much on his plate, that there should be more people in the portfolio and that the minister should be able to concentrate on the personnel and veterans' issues, and obviously the cybersecurity issues that are also in his space really need greater focus and concentration by support from another person in the portfolio.


The minister's doing a very fine job, despite those limitations. In particular, I really welcome his support for the bipartisan work of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee in relation to veteran suicide. That was one of the issues, apart from family experience with that subject, that led me to work with the member for Berowra in establishing a parliamentary friendship group on the prevention of suicide. I'd like to thank the Minister for Health, who is at the table, for his support, and the shadow minister. They have been avid participants and have kept extremely open minds about the types of issues that have been raised in that forum, which have direct relevance to suicide issues for veterans, as well.


We'll be together again in Beersheba in a few days time, celebrating the victory at Beersheba and commemorating the service and sacrifice of our men in the field in that battle 100 years ago on 31 October. It is particularly poignant for me, as there were members of my own family in the light horse. They, both of my grandfathers, were back again in the Second World War. They were looked after by the Jewish community in the area while they were fighting in the Middle East, particularly in Syria and Lebanon. They went on to suffer great traumas, one as a prisoner of the Japanese on the Burma-Thai railway and the other with severe injuries he suffered in New Guinea. I learn a lot from the family experiences that I've been exposed to as to some of the worst aspects of the traumas that veterans have had to go through.


Every generation of our family has served in the army, going back to the Crimean War, the Indian mutiny, the Afghan War, the first and second world wars, my own service and my father's service—even uncles and aunts. So it is something that I have a lot of understanding of, from the personal experience that's been passed on to me. Since I've entered parliament that has been greatly expanded by the fact that I represent nearly 3,000 veterans in Eden-Monaro, who have an average age of about 66 now. Some of the stories from them have been quite tragic. One of them involved a veteran who had been a prisoner of the Japanese. His wife endured tremendous hardship for 40 years after he returned home after the Second World War, with his terrible nightmares and his resorting to self-medication with alcohol. She endured great hardships. He'd wake up in the middle of the night, strangling her, thinking she was a Japanese soldier. It came to a point where she just couldn't take that any more. Her life was at risk. She was advised that she needed to move out of the household, which she did. Her husband passed away but she wasn't entitled to war widows support, which she desperately needed. We tried to get her some ex gratia payments to support her. Unfortunately, she went into hospital for a hip replacement operation and contracted septicaemia and died in hospital. We were never able to achieve that for her, but her case highlights another aspect we need to look at in these processes.


The veterans in my community have raised so many issues with me about the whole issue around process: the point-of-entry experience and trying to get around the complexity of making a claim, with the adversarial aspects of it. We need to have a benefit-of-the-doubt approach to these things. They have raised all these issues with me, but as I was sitting here a couple of minutes ago, waiting to speak in this debate, I received an email from a veteran which really sums it up. I'll just read that letter to me. It's from Tony Cullinan, who says:


Dear Mike,


I am a member of your constituency living in Bega.


I have a lot of service injuries and they are getting progressively worse. I am in varying degrees of pain a lot of the time.


I own a small business and get by, but it’s pretty tight.


I have a lot of depression and anxiety around my injuries.


I’ve been sitting here for the last hour waiting to be linked into a directions hearing with the VRB—


the Veterans' Review Board—


which was supposed to take place at 10. I called at ¼ passed 10 and a lady was surprised and said she would get back to me. I’ve heard nothing and I am sitting hear waiting.


There are no advocacy services in Bega and I have been hooked into Woden – but it’s a long way and they don’t really know what’s going on for me. I really feel overwhelmed by all of this.


Respectfully,


Tony Cullinan


That pretty much sums up the experience of the veterans who have approached me. I am obviously very pleased to see an attempt to address these issues, with this legislation in particular.


On the concern that we raised about the principal member process, I'm really delighted the government's picked that up. It really continued to embed in this process the adversarial issue and denied members the ability to have their day in court and be heard, genuinely and openly, so I'm delighted that section has been removed.


Also, I'm really delighted with the aspects that we've been dealing with recently and are promoting in terms of employer incentive scheme payments. That transition process is such a difficult one for all ex-members. You come from a completely different cultural environment—a completely different family-like environment within Defence—and you move into the general community and perhaps bring with you some mental baggage which you know nobody around you understands. And you speak a completely different language, in many cases. I've experienced a lot of this myself. We needed to address more aggressively the issue of that transition, so I'm pleased to see that's happening and that the government's implementing some measures.


In my own region, I'd like to highlight two things that I'm really pleased with. One is Remount, a Yass based organisation that works with veterans. They have broken important ground. They take Remount members and employees and they do great work in dealing with ex-military members who are suffering from stress related injuries through their service, such as PTSD, by getting them to work with horses and having that experience. We know that a lot of association with animals and pets has been a great way to help our veterans deal with their issues, so I really want to salute Remount. They are sponsored by Lockheed Martin. I'm very pleased that we're seeing some of the defence industry companies helping us and getting involved now with these issues, knowing that they really do owe their own input into these processes of dealing with our veterans. Well done, Remount at Yass and Lockheed Martin.


I was at the Snowy Hydro the other day and talked to Gabrielle Curtin. She raised with me a program that they have where they have transitioning services for men and women and get them into employment. It's great to see them taking that active role. It is another great example of what the Snowy Hydro has done for our country. There are so many ways. They're taking that responsibility.


It's part of the general culture in our region to support our service veterans. It has the highest voluntary participation rate in the country. You will see a lot of effort in the community to try to assist veterans and honour them. Just the other day, we had the opening of a lovely rock memorial in Bega to the Lucas family. It was an experience that has not been replicated anywhere in the world, as far as we know: there were 10 boys in the Lucas family and nine of them joined up and went to World War II. It was a tremendous sacrifice by that family. Some did not come home from their service. The unique history in our region is something that we celebrate and honour.


Another example is the Union Jack memorial that you pass on the way to Tumbarumba. It's not a memorial to the flag, the Union Jack. There used to be a town called Union Jack and, during the First World War, every male of military service age was killed in the First World War. Their names are listed on that memorial. The town was effectively destroyed by a war 12,000 kilometres away because the surviving family members had to move away. It's very special for our region and I appreciate the measures that are being taken to render more federal government support.


There are a couple of issues. I say this in the spirit of highlighting problems we still need to address and where I think we're going down the wrong track. There were previous proposals to eliminate the Department of Veterans' Affairs and move it into Human Services. It was raised in an ACCI paper that my predecessor published when he was head of ACCI. Some work was being done on that when the coalition came to government. We're seeing it actually playing out in relation to Veterans' Access Networks. The Veterans' Access Network here in the ACT was shut down. It served a lot of veterans from across the border. The services have been shifted into the nearby Centrelink office on Bowes Street.


We're of course well aware of the problems we've had with Centrelink: the attempts to automate services, the delays and problems. We just had a story appear—I think it was yesterday—about the delays that have left recipients unable to pay for rent or food and about complaints having jumped to more than 50,000 in the past financial year alone. It seems that this is an attempt to remove the 'human' from Human Services, and it's causing so much stress and anxiety.


My electorate offices have been absolutely inundated with these issues emerging from Centrelink. We've basically become an adjunct to that office. We've had people in great stages of stress and anxiety who in fact have been suicidal, and my office workers have been doing such a wonderful job relieving that stress and anxiety by basically getting in and doing what Centrelink should have been doing for them and working with points of contact.


It gives me great concern when we're attempting to shut down our vans, shut down the human contact that veterans, in particular in rural and regional areas, really need. You really need a human to go to and talk to and lean on. The isolation that's already there in rural and regional areas can greatly exacerbate the problems these veterans suffer from. To shut down these vans is really the wrong way to go, and I ask the minister to get that one on his agenda too. It's just not right to try and push this into Human Services and Centrelink. These veterans really resent that as well. They do feel that the special nature of their service and their issues warrants them being dealt with in a unique way, and it's an insult to their service and to them to push them into this. But, as I said, it comes back to that broader issue that we're experiencing at the moment with Centrelink in general.


I think that issue needs to be addressed for the general community as well. They're losing jobs in those Centrelink offices in our region too, and it's part of the grievance that's going on out there in rural and regional Australia—particularly rural and regional New South Wales—at the moment. I was handing out at the Gundagai booth at Gundagai High School a couple of weeks ago for the by-election there. There was a 43 per cent swing against the government in that booth. It's just been a perfect storm of issues that they're concerned about: removal of services from their communities, loss of jobs associated with that and forced mergers. They feel that they're under siege from governments at state and federal levels and they're turning to other parties, which is a trend that is not to be encouraged when you think of who some of those other parties might be. So it's incumbent on all of us, the government and the opposition, to listen to what's going on out there in rural and regional areas and to understand that it's pointless complaining about phenomena like shooters parties, One Nation or whatever without understanding there is a set of grievances that underpin that which have to be addressed.


Those grievances are at the moment greatly affecting my veterans, who we're representing in this debate today. On their behalf and for their interests I would urge the government to back away from what's going on with Centrelink: certain attempts to cut pensions and support in energy supplements and the like, which affect the veterans as well, and attempts to cut back on educational support for war orphans and war widows in some previous budgets. I'm glad to see we've moved away from that, but there's more work to be done, and the government will have our full support in broaching those issues.


I'm looking forward to maybe having further discussions on this with the minister when we're in Beersheba in the coming days. I urge Australians to look back at that service, at that history and at that battle, because it's not well known amongst a lot of Australians. I really take this opportunity to commemorate that service. (Time expired)

"Husar, Emma, MP",ALP,2017-10-26,"



Ms HUSAR
 (Lindsay) (11:49):  It's always important to rise and stand in support of our veterans and always good to follow the member for Eden-Monaro, who is a proud veteran himself. The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 2017, which seeks to clarify, improve and streamline the operation of law for veterans and their entitlements, is incredibly important. Labor, obviously, supports any measures undertaken to support veterans and ensure they are no worse off with the changes to the legislation.


We all know that to be a member of the Australian Defence Force is to dedicate your life and your service to the care and defence of our country—it is incredibly important work that they do. Like everyone in this place, I'm incredibly grateful and thankful for their work. I did see this firsthand on my recent deployment to the Middle East. Our defence personnel have a rich and defining place in shaping our identity and our culture. Mateship, a fair go, courage and sacrifice are all of the hallmarks of these very, very special people. Those that have served deserve our uttermost respect and admiration, but, most importantly, they deserve our support upon their return. As they return to civilian life, we owe them and their families the best possible services and care. Young women and young men returning from conflict require the stability, security, support and opportunity to get back on their feet.


From the First World War, when 300,000 Australians departed our shores—the war where the Anzac legacy would be born on the shores of Gallipoli and where Australia's involvement in battles such as Fromelles and Pozieres and the Battle of the Somme would see the Australian spirit, our courage and our mateship shine through—nearly 17,000 of our serving personnel, sadly, did not return home. But our debt of gratitude to returning veterans was forged through these battles as they fought to keep Australia safe and for our way of life. To this day, the veterans who return have seen their mates make the ultimate sacrifice. They have stood on the front line to defend our nation. We absolutely owe it to our veterans to provide them with the best support and care, and the wellbeing of veterans and their families is absolutely paramount. Their issues must be dealt with compassionately and correctly the first time around and not be put through administrative processes, which is currently the case. There are currently just under 60,000 Australians serving in our defence forces and an estimated 329,000 living veterans. The Department of Veterans' Affairs supports approximately 291,000 people, with 203,000 being over the age of 65 and 23,000 under the age of 40, and we will certainly see that number of young veterans increase with our ongoing involvement in the Middle East region.


In my electorate, there are just under 1,000 veterans, as recorded at 17 June this year, receiving assistance through the department, and this includes any current or former serving members eligible for compensation, income support or health treatment under the main veterans' entitlement legislation. This figure excludes ex-service personnel who are ineligible for or who have not sought assistance from the department. Five hundred and seven of these veterans are receiving a disability pension and, in addition, there are 311 war widow pensioners. So the electorate of Lindsay does have a significant need to support our veterans, and I'm pleased that, by and large, my community does support our veterans.


From the representations that I receive and the discussions I have had in my community and on my visit to Afghanistan last year, those serving and veterans need support to transition back home. Some veterans find it very difficult to blend in with our communities and are often affected by physical health issues, deterioration of mental health, lack of financial support and difficulties finding meaningful employment when they return. The Department of Veterans' Affairs is aware that on any given night across Australia over 3,000 veterans are homeless, affected by their selfless service to our nation. Our veterans have been through enough. They have done everything for their country that we have asked of them and more. To give them the run-around and the third degree to have their matters processed is simply unacceptable.


The legislation seeks to modernise and improve the operations of the Veterans' Review Board, which can only be a good thing for veterans. The legislation seeks to provide a mechanism of review that is accessible, fair, just, economical, informal and quick. It is proportionate to the importance and complexity of the matter and promotes public trust and confidence in the decision-making of the board. The removal of bureaucratic barriers and red tape benefits veterans to ensure their claims are heard in a timely and low-cost manner. No veteran deserves an unfair hearing, and we need to maintain an effective mechanism for review.


But veterans are right to be concerned about privacy, given this government's less than stellar track record and blunders when dealing with IT and data security. I've seen firsthand the difficult and stressful work of defence personnel, and that's why I believe their transition to civilian life should be much, much more secure. They are well trained; they are highly skilled and well organised. They are great assets to all types of businesses and the community at large, but they struggle to find employment and to readjust to life at home, far away, thankfully, from distant war zones and constantly being on edge to protect our nation. This is why it's important to help and act when it's required. Many of these veterans with positive attributes on the table have to readjust. They have to deal with their memories and actions of serving the nation. We need to assure them that we will provide a strong and positive safety net.


I had the opportunity, as I said earlier, to spend time with troops, visiting four bases during my tour of Afghanistan as part of the ADF Parliamentary Program in July. This commendable initiative provides an opportunity to engage very, very closely with members of the ADF and experience the challenges and rewards of service life. The program also offers a chance to see firsthand the diverse capabilities of our Defence Force in action.


When I was there, above all, our troops wanted to know that their contribution is, firstly, supported and, more importantly, highly valued. Having performed in and participated in some of the drills that we put our men and women through and having performed some of the work they do, in a very, very minor capacity, I've got to say it is incredibly nerve-racking. It is intense. It drives up even some of the most dormant feelings of anxiety. A war zone is not a pleasant place to be. Being one of the most protected persons in that war zone, as I was, was comforting, but I'm not the one out there risking my life.


It is incredibly important that we support them. It is our duty to absolutely recognise them. Our serving men and women had a couple of thoughts for me to bring back, and on my return I was pleased to present those to the Minister for Defence.


I am committed to ensuring that our service men and women are supported not only during their service but back into civilian life. Last week I also had the privilege of attending a dinner at the Royal Military College Duntroon as part of our program, where I got to engage some more with Aaron Bell, who was in my office as part of the exchange program. Certainly, I got to benefit from having his knowledge and experience with the Defence Force. With the memories of my trip to Afghanistan in mind, it has been a great opportunity to share experiences and insights into a very different world to what we imagine. During my visit to the Middle East, the troops told me of their longing for and personal attachment to their home back here and the difficulties in maintaining relationships back in this country. You can't talk to your family about what you've seen and what you've done over there, because there are insecure phone networks. The time zones are different, so you often are working at a time when your family might not be at home for you to speak to them. They might be at school when it is time for you have the opportunity to call them. There is a big gap for our serving men and women who are in the Middle East right now.


Their selfless sacrifice ensures our personal safety here in this country. Our veterans talk about the amount of money that is put into training them to build weapons, to shoot and to care for their soldiers and their personnel while they're in the battlefield. Everywhere I went, across all four bases, there was a huge and heightened sense of anxiety. The topic of discussion about veterans' affairs upon their return to Australia was absolutely the No. 1 issue. So, while they're out there serving and doing their bit for the country, making sure that we are safe and protected and that our way of life continues, our men and women in the Middle East are worried about what's going to happen on their return. I just think that is incredibly unfair. It's certainly not a concern that we should be taking lightly. I think that they've been through enough. The trauma they have experienced can lead to them having issues on return, including suicide, mental health issues and post-traumatic stress once they have returned home.


I have family members who were on the HMAS Voyager when it was struck. The things that I witnessed as a small child and a teenager that my uncle went through were quite horrendous, including him not being able to be in a room of an evening with no lights on and not being able to sleep in a dead silent, quiet space. Some noise always had to be going on because of the trauma associated with that accident that he was involved in. Potentially, the way in which that was handled upon their rescue and the way in which their contribution was seen were certainly not helpful to his recovery.


Between 2001 and 2015, 325 veterans took their own lives. It is an absolute national tragedy when anybody suicides, but in particular, when men and women through their service for this country see no other option than to take their own lives, that is an absolute national tragedy. When men and women who have served our nation, upon their return, suffer such deep mental and emotional pain that they take their own lives, we absolutely need to be doing more. We need to find ways to support them and to try to stop this from happening.


The representations from veterans that I receive in my office are about dealing with the department and accessing services and support back home. I know and support our local organisations and services in Lindsay that provide critical support and assistance to current Defence personnel, veterans and their families. I thank them for the service that they provide in our community.


I want to place on record my thanks to Legacy, which cares for around 80,000 veterans whose dependants range in age from less than 12 months to 109 years. Groups such as Legacy provide valued support to families during really difficult times. The Penrith RSL sub-Branch has 715 members. Penrith owes a great deal of gratitude to the Penrith RSL sub-Branch and its president, Mick McConnell. The sub-branch's good work includes: welfare for veterans; a drop-in centre opening in November—I'm looking forward to being part of that; a welfare officer helping veterans with their claims; and supporting over 400 war widows. The Penrith RSL sub-Branch finds more and more younger vets are seeking help who have higher rates of mental health issues. The older vets were, in many cases, treated poorly when they returned from Vietnam and other areas of conflict, so they are determined as a cohort not to let this happen to our younger returning vets.


The Penrith sub-branch is involved with the RAAF at Richmond and Glenbrook bases, and with the Orchard Hills Army and Navy cadets. The women's auxiliary, which is supported by the Penrith RSL sub-Branch, with Colleen Towle as the president, was formed in 1916 and continues now. Their job originally in World War I was to send comfort parcels to Penrith soldiers serving on the Western Front. The parcels consisted of items that we would look to send now but were probably different then—woollen socks, soap, cakes and other items that would be missed by our soldiers who were serving overseas at the time. We might have slight changes to the care packs, but they're still being sent. For many decades, the sub-branch has provided significant pension, welfare and hospital visits for members and members of other sub-branches. Now they hold annual Easter, Mother's Day and Father's Day raffles and other fundraising activities like their biannual gala auction, attending Anzac services, selling Anzac badges, attending the conference for the Central Council of RSL Women's Auxiliaries and also attending other auxiliary functions.


We also have the Penrith and Lower Blue Mountains War Widows' Guild providing a range of services to war widows, and it operates with significant volunteer input from its thousands of members. We have the Homes for Heroes program, which has built around nine rooms at Governor Phillip Manor for our homeless vets. The program offers a comprehensive rehabilitation service. For the support residents receive, they're required to give back to the program by doing voluntary work, mentoring other people and engaging in training and rehabilitation. Homes for Heroes does a wonderful job helping homeless young veterans to get back into mainstream life.


Other organisations supporting veterans in my electorate include: St Mary's RSL sub-Branch—Ron Blakely is the president and Tony Fryer is secretary; the Royal Marines Association division of Western Sydney; the Red Cross; Vietnam vets at St Mary's, which is also affectionately known as the Train; Nepean Legacy and Legacy Widows' Club Nepean; the Australian Light Horse Association; the wives of Vietnam vets with Maureen Clements; and the Nashos, of which John Taylor is the secretary and acting vice-president. I was incredibly honoured to take up my first role as patron with the Nashos.


I look forward to meeting more and more Defence Force personnel and to having the pleasure of welcoming Amanda Rishworth, the shadow minister, in November. I'm incredibly grateful to the Defence Force personnel I met on my trip to Afghanistan. We're still in regular contact—we're now friends officially on Facebook—and they often communicate with me when they're doing their jobs and going about their business. I'm very grateful for the information and advocacy that they provide to me on the issues that need to be changed.


I stand with all the veterans and service men and women of this country, and I will ensure that I will always work to achieve the best possible outcomes for them and their families.

Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Centenary of ANZAC, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Cyber Security and Minister for Defence Personnel) (12:04):  I thank the people who spoke on this bill with the best interests of veterans at heart and who spoke in a very bipartisan manner because, as all of us know in this place, veterans deserve all of our attention and for us to work in this place in a very cooperative way. I thank the shadow minister again for the way that she engages with me to make sure that we can deal with these issues in a bipartisan way.


I am pleased to present the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 2017. The bill comprises nine schedules that would implement several small but necessary amendments to veterans legislation to clarify, improve or streamline the operation of the law. Schedule 1 of the omnibus bill amends the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 to modernise and align the Veterans' Review Board's operations with those of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal following the amendments made by the Tribunals Amalgamation Act 2015. The amendments also support the alternative dispute resolution processes and the recent amendments to the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 which provide for a single appeal path for reconsidering decisions.


Schedule 2 would amend the provisions of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 concerning the Specialist Medical Review Council to improve the operation of the SMRC, streamline some of the SMRC's administrative arrangements and better reflect the manner in which its functions and processes have evolved over time. The proposed amendments would simplify the nomination and appointment process for councils, enable online lodgements of claims, streamline the notice of investigation requirements and give the SMRC an ability to pay the travel costs of applicants who appear before an oral hearing of the SMRC.


The proposed amendments in schedule 3 of the omnibus bill would enable international agreements to be made that would cover allied veterans and defence force members with service of the type for which benefits and payments, including rehabilitation, can be provided by the Repatriation Commission or the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission under the relevant acts. Currently, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs can only enter into an arrangement with the governments of countries that are or have been dominions of the Crown. This will enable the Minister for Veterans' Affairs to enter into agreements with a broader range of countries.


The proposed amendments in schedule 4 are intended to clarify that vocational rehabilitation assistance under an employer incentive scheme in the form of wage incentive payments is within the scope of the enabling provisions of the relevant legislation.


The proposed amendments in schedule 5 would amend subsection 409(2) of the Military Compensation Act 2004 and subsection 151A(1) of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (Defence-related Claims) Act 1988 to add the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation as a person to whom the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission may provide information for purposes allowed under the CSC's legislation. Those amendments would implement a recommendation by the 2011 Review of Military Compensation Arrangements intended to improve the information-sharing framework for incapacity and superannuation benefits between DVA and CSC and, therefore, reduce the time taken by DVA and CSC to process claims, which would better support injured former ADF members. In addition, enabling the CSC to use medical reports held by the MRCC to determine superannuation claims would also avoid the need to send ADF members for further medical assessment where DVA already holds relevant medical evidence that could be used by the CSC to determine superannuation benefits. ADF members would be spared from any retraumatisation from having to tell their stories. This is particularly significant for ADF members who suffer psychological conditions, including those that have arisen as a result of physical or psychological abuse.


Each of the sets of amendments is relatively modest. They enhance the operation of the department and will mean better outcomes for veterans. I thank members for their contribution to the debate and I commend this bill to the House.

"Rishworth, Amanda, MP",ALP,2017-10-26,"



Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston) (12:10):  As foreshadowed in my speech on the second reading, I would like to say that Labor will be supporting all of the government's amendments to this bill. Obviously, one of the amendments that we are very, very pleased about is the amendment relating to the Veterans' Review Board. This is, I think, an important amendment that addresses the concerns of the ex-service community and apprehensions that were discussed during the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee process. These changes are important to retain the unique nature of the Veterans' Review Board as a place where veterans can have their voices heard. So I do think that this amendment is suitable and, as mentioned in my speech on the second reading, has the benefit of removing the section that would limit the ability of veterans to be heard. This is, I think, an important measure, to keep faith with the veterans community. As I said also, Labor welcomes the aligning of the principles of the Veterans' Review Board with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, but it was important to us that the nature of the Veterans' Review Board be maintained. So we did bring this to the attention of the government, and I'm very pleased that the government has an amendment that will deliver that.


Also, I would note that there are amendments that the government has circulated which seek to restore the concessional pharmaceuticals to those veterans who had lost them as a result of the government's unfair asset-test changes. We do know that these changes to the asset test saw more than 13,000 Australians receiving a Veterans' Affairs pension losing part of that pension or indeed being kicked off the pension. While it has been two years too late, it is pleasing to see the pensioner concession card finally being restored to those who had lost it. But I would hope that the government continues to ensure that a wide range of concessions which were received by those part-pensioners who no longer receive them are still available. As to those concessions that were provided by councils, it is unclear what the government has done and how the government has pursued ensuring that those concessions are reinstated. It took two years to reinstate the Commonwealth benefits and it is my understanding that the states, in principle, have agreed. It is incumbent on the government to ensure that all concessions by all three levels of government are restored to this group of people, because Labor did not support this change. We were very, very clear, under the guidance of our great shadow minister, who made it very, very clear that we thought this was an unfair change. So I do hope that the minister responsible for the Department of Social Services preserves these concessions and ensures that they are reinstated for these people.


The remaining elements of these amendments seek to address some minor technical amendments. On the whole, we will support the government's amendments. We think they improve the omnibus bill and therefore they have our support.

Ms LAMB
 (Longman) (10:43):  Yesterday I was celebrating the visit from the shadow minister for defence, Richard Marles, when he visited Remembrance House in Burpengary to talk to a group of returned service men and women. Remembrance House is quite literally a house. It's actually a home, a place for veterans to live and adjust to civilian life. It's a great initiative. We're very fortunate to have one in Burpengary; it's one of two in the country. The other sits in the member for Herbert's electorate up in Townsville. At this meeting with the honourable member, the shadow minister for defence, Richard Marles, we were resoundingly told of how difficult it can be for veterans to find decent, secure work that matches their needs. And, as a strong advocate for the veteran community, I heard this loud and clear, and I have been taking action since.


I hold the position of the chair of Labor's Australian Jobs Taskforce, a caucus committee listening to people around the country involved in the job market: people in work who are looking for more work; people who are actually looking for any work at all; businesses; industry leaders; job service providers; and councils and state governments, of course. It's an initiative of the Labor Party to help shape policy that will move Australia forward. As I said earlier, listening to people is the only real way to formulate strong policy, particularly in this space of employment. So recently I have been holding a number of conversations with those in the space of employment for veterans, as part of this task force, and we've heard some very interesting things. We've been told in these conversations what the barriers are to people finding work and what support our veterans need in finding work, and of course we have been asking them what the solutions are to finding that work and helping them with that support. It's always good to get their views and their recommendations.


In the years that the Abbott and Turnbull governments have been in power, too little has been done for the veterans of Australia—in particular, too little has been done to help them find decent and secure work upon returning to civilian life. I'd have to say that, until Labor gets into power at the next election, I'm more than happy to lend a hand and support any changes that support veterans, no matter how small those steps are.


I'd now like to turn to schedule 4 of this bill. These changes are by no means sweeping reforms—the department has already been able to facilitate these employer initiative payments; this bill just legislates them—although, again, we'll welcome anything that helps our veterans. While strengthening the legislative foundation of payments is of course a good thing, it's not groundbreaking reform. What we really need, though, is this government to take a stronger, more considered and deliberate approach, making sure that meaningful policy enacts positive change for our veterans.


I also support changes in schedule 5 of this bill, which amends the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004, as well as the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 for Defence related claims. This schedule will facilitate information-sharing between the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission and the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation, with respect to certain service related compensation claims. The way that the system currently works is that, if someone's discharged for medical reasons, they have to undergo a medical. Then they have to go to the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation to organise payments. When they go there, they have to organise for another medical assessment. And then, if they go to the Department of Veterans' Affairs, they have to go through another. These amendments in schedule 5 of the bill go to making sure that the complicated and lengthy claims process for people seeking assistance from the department is smoothed and is easier for them. Enabling that sharing of information between the departments will assist the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation in making speedier superannuation benefits assessments and, in turn, assist the department in recognising a person's entitlement to incapacity payments. It's one of the issues with the current process. I've heard time after time that it's lengthy and it's complicated; for vulnerable people, it's additional stress that they just do not need. So of course I support schedule 5. As long as proper safeguards to protect veterans' privacy are in place, Labor and I are always supportive to changes to improve this process. So I'm happy and pleased to support this bill. I'm happy to support procedural processes that smooth the way forward and cut red tape for our veterans.

Ms MADELEINE KING
 (Brand) (10:49):  Before I speak on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 2017, I would like to briefly associate myself with and support the comments of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and those of the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, the member for Kingston, earlier this week in relation to the government's response to the recent Senate committee report on the inquiry into suicide by veterans and ex-service personnel, The constant battle: suicide by veterans.


It's a good thing that the government has accepted all the recommendations of the report, and Labor looks forward to continuing discussions with the government on the implementation of the recommendations. As someone who has a significant defence community—hosting, as Rockingham does, the largest naval base in Australia—veterans' concerns are of particular importance to me, and I welcome this action to address the tragic issue of suicide among the ex-service personnel and veteran community.


I'd also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the member for Kingston on her elevation to the Labor shadow cabinet. The member for Kingston and her office have been invaluable to me as an incoming member of parliament in the seat of Brand by assisting my office in the many and varied questions and issues that are raised by veterans and ex-service personnel and their families that live in my community. So I'd like to congratulate and thank the member for Kingston.


I'd like to speak in support of the Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 2017 and its amendments, that look to improve the operation of veterans' affairs legislation. The implementation of amendments that will clarify, improve or streamline the operation of the law as it applies to veterans' affairs and processes within the Department of Veterans' Affairs is a good move. My electorate of Brand, as I've said, is home to the Royal Australian Navy's largest base, HMAS Stirling, located just off the coast of Rockingham. Commissioned in 1978, HMAS Stirling now hosts 12 fleet units, including the RAN's Anzac class frigates, with Collins class submarines also stationed here. HMAS Stirling is home to more than 2,300 service personnel. HMAS Stirling and Garden Island, on which the base is, have changed a great deal since I was a young girl growing up just around the corner in Shoalwater Bay.


With many past and present servicewomen and men making the communities across Brand their permanent homes, this bill has the potential to improve the lives of many people in my electorate. This bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade for consideration and, given the number of schedules and the potential impact they will have on how veterans engage with the department, this referral was supported by Labor. We on this side supported this referral so that the legislation could be thoroughly examined and so that proposed changes would not leave veterans any worse off once enacted. I'm happy to support those proposed changes that will benefit the former servicewomen and men and their families who live in my electorate, and, of course, those across the country.


I'd like to turn to the amendments and what they'll mean for people affected. This bill deals with a number of different elements within the Veterans' Affairs legislation in its eight schedules. Schedule 1 amendments look to align the provisions of the Veterans' Entitlements Act under which the Veterans' Review Board operates and those similar provisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. This work to align these similar provisions will modernise the board's operation by ensuring the board provides a mechanism of review that is accessible, fair, economical, informal and quick; proportionate to the importance and nature of the matter; and promotes trust and confidence in the board's decision-making. The Veterans' Review Board provides independent merits reviews of decisions about pensions and allowances under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. This includes disability pensions, as well as rehabilitation, compensation and other benefits under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act.


Appearing before the board when dealing with matters relating to pension decisions, compensation issues and rehab issues can be a highly emotional and daunting experience for many veterans. The RSL, in its submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, made the point of stating that many veterans who lodge a claim:


… are often dealing with emotions associated with the loss of their military career, their inability or reduced ability to provide for their family, difficulty in obtaining employment post-service if they are injured or ill and strained relationships with family


Appearing before the board is not an easy or straightforward action for many. This should be recognised as we consider this bill.


Schedule 1 amendments also impose an ongoing obligation on both the claimant and on the Department of Veterans' Affairs during the period until the board has determined the matter, to lodge with the board a copy of any document that is in their possession relevant to the review that has not been lodged previously. The amendments provide the board with the power to vary or revoke a decision made under the alternative dispute resolution process, with the consent of the parties and where the board is satisfied that it is within its powers and otherwise appropriate to do so. It also requires the Repatriation Commission or any person representing the commission in a review to use their best endeavours to assist the board in fulfilling their legislated objectives. These are all positive measures.


However, it was proposed that section 6 of schedule 1 would give the Principal Member of the Veterans' Review Board the ability to dismiss an application for review should they be satisfied that the application, among other things, is misconceived, has no reasonable prospect of success or is otherwise an abuse of process. Stakeholders raised concern about this with the committee, and we on this side had concerns about this provision. The Veterans' Review Board is a less adversarial process than the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Veterans are not represented by lawyers before the board. Appearing before the board gives veterans a chance to have their say. It is their chance to be heard when otherwise they might not be. By taking this chance away from veterans, the government would fundamentally change how veterans engage with the board and how veterans perceive the board. I've been told by a senior advocate who appears before the Veterans' Review Board that most associations who represent veterans at the board would not support this change. People who work in this area, the volunteers who work to assist vets and their families were very concerned that, while a principal member is usually quite reasonable, there was a risk in introducing this change. There was a risk that a person could wrongly interpret documentation, leading to a veteran missing out on their right of review. For these reasons, advocates supported the process that is currently in place, as it is one where further advice can be sought and, in the process, can be used to further review a decision of the board.


The proposed change to section 6 of schedule 1 had the potential to deny veterans the opportunity to be heard. We have heard, again through the committee process, that the principal member would have been presented with the circumstances to use this power to dismiss an application for review only three times in the last seven years. Time and experience have shown that the process of review by veterans to the board is not one being misused by veterans, and legislating against veterans having an opportunity to be heard is not an action that I would support. There seems to be little point in doing so. It seems this section would deliver very little while, at the same time, causing unnecessary upset and anxiety in the ex-service personnel community. The Kwinana, Rockingham and Port Kennedy RSL sub-branches in my electorate of Brand would also prefer this section be removed from this bill. We understand that the government, following the Labor opposition's urging, is now moving an amendment to remove this section. We welcome this change, as no doubt will advocates as well, as it recognises the unique nature of the Veterans' Review Board. I am very pleased to see the removal of this section.


Amendments in schedule 2, however, will work to benefit veterans by simplifying and streamlining processes. The current time it takes to appoint staff to the Specialist Medical Review Council—three months or longer—will be addressed. The long delay can affect the council's ability to do its very important job. The council's an independent body where vets who have issues with the decisions of the Repatriation Medical Authority regarding the content of a statement of principles can go for review. The statement of principles' content is in respect of the particular kind of injury or disease or death suffered by the veteran, and this amendment will assist in more timely decisions being made for veterans—and that is a good thing.


Other streamlining measures will enable the Specialist Medical Review Council to adopt electronic lodgement of requests for reviews. That means a hard copy will no longer be required, and so requests for review will not have to be lodged at a Department of Veterans' Affairs office. This measure is broadly supported. Mind you, in particular parts of my electorate, we do have a lot of difficulty getting internet coverage, and the NBN's a long way away, so some veterans living in communities in Baldivis will still have to go to the Department of Veterans' Affairs office because the infrastructure is not in place for them to be able to use this modern provision of electronic lodgement.


In regard to the electronic lodgement provision, the community has commented it should not be used to the detriment of veterans when submitting claims, appeals or reconsiderations. No doubt, for those who can undertake electronic lodgement, it'll be beneficial for those people in a single-claim situation, but there may be complications if a complex issue is involved. I understand such complications can arise around understanding statements of principles and with the different standards of proof required in different situations. It is important that people who choose to use, or are able to use, this new electronic lodgement method do so knowing they can still seek advice from an advocate should they need it; but, for those who do not require additional support and advice, this amendment in introducing a new, more efficient electronic lodgement of request for review does have the potential to benefit veterans who are, indeed, able to access the internet at all.


Other amendments in this bill will allow for the provision of financial assistance to people attending a Specialist Medical Review Council hearing to make an oral submission. This measure will see individuals, as well as representatives of organisations and any necessary attendants accompanying them, being able to receive financial assistance to attend a hearing to make an oral submission. We've received positive feedback on this measure. I've been told it will ensure a better process as it ensures the hearing is as informed as possible of the reasons for the applicant pursuing the review. I'm told there is a chance that the panel might not have all the relevant information before them when making their decision. I'm also told that hard copies of complex claims are not circulated in their entirety and that documents, once lodged, have, sadly, become lost or misplaced. Making it financially possible for a veteran or their representative to attend a hearing and make such an oral submission will help alleviate the stress when these things happen, and this is a positive step.


Another good step in the bill is a measure that would give the minister the power to make arrangements with foreign governments to cover the provision of benefits and the payment of benefits. With this bill, in schedule 3, the minister can enter into agreements in relation to reciprocal arrangements with Veterans' Affairs matters. This amendment will broaden the countries with which Australia can enter agreements beyond the Commonwealth. Veterans' reps in my electorate are supportive of this measure as it is beneficial to veterans who no longer live in Australia. At the moment, only payments payable under the Veterans' Entitlements Act are covered by existing agreements. This bill will now cover allied veterans and Defence Force members with the type of service equivalent to that covered by the VEA. The means that the agreements will relate to payments and treatment provided by the Repatriation Commission or the MRCC. We are supportive of this measure that will extend agreements so that veterans are covered, regardless of the legislative framework.


We hear from veterans and advocates about the lengthy and complicated claims process that people can face when seeking assistance. Labor supports the changes that will assist people in this process to make their lives easier, bearing in mind the need to ensure adequate safeguards are in place to protect veterans' privacy. One way this bill will do this is by addressing the doubling and sometimes the tripling of the requirement for veterans to undergo medicals when they engage in the system. The situation at the moment is that a veteran who was medically discharged needs to undergo a medical and then, when they go to the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation to organise their payments, they undergo another medical, and this may be followed by a third medical when they go to the Department of Veterans' Affairs for assistance. The amendments in this bill will enable information to be shared between the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation and the Department of Veterans' Affairs. This will enable the CSC to access relevant claims information held by the department. Information would include relevant medical and rehab information which would assist the CSC to make quicker superannuation benefit assessments. This will, in turn, assist the department in determining a person's entitlement to incapacity payments. The upside of such sharing would be a more timely outcome for veterans at a vulnerable and stressful time in their lives.


Schedule 7 looks to eliminate the unnecessary delays in administrative issues that are caused when certain veterans' affairs portfolio legislative instruments need to be amended to incorporate changes in non-disallowable instruments. Each individual instrument will no longer need to be lodged in parliament. One such example is when a new rehabilitation appliance becomes available. Availability of the new equipment is delayed, as a legislative instrument that incorporates the document under which the applicant may be provided the equipment needs to be amended to refer to the policy document's changed date. Eliminating such delays would have a real and beneficial impact on veterans' lives and should be supported.


Labor supports the measures in this bill which go to streamlining and improving the law as it improves the processes that affect veterans' lives. With the amendments the government is planning on moving, we on this side of the House offer our support of the legislation. Once again, I congratulate the Minister for Veterans' Affairs on his work and that of his department in this regard, and also the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, the member for Kingston, and her office for all of their work in this portfolio.

"Dick, Milton, MP",ALP,2017-10-26,"



Mr DICK
 (Oxley) (11:04):  I rise to support the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 2017. In doing so, I want to recognise the great work on both sides of the chamber. It is a true demonstration of the commitment that I think this whole House has to veterans in our community. Listening to my colleague and friend the member for Brand, I know her deep connection to the ADF through her family and also through her work as a local MP. I echo the sentiments she finished her comments with today about service and recognising the good work of the minister and the shadow minister.


I want to spend a little time highlighting the fact that the bill before the House is a clear demonstration that when good ideas are put forward and when simplification is delivered, both sides of the parliament can work together. In the last two weeks, I've probably spoken in the House of Representatives and Federation Chamber more than I have done since I was elected. I've spoken about a range of issues, on a range of portfolio allocations and on a number of local issues, but I have particularly taken time to read and understand this bill because I know it demonstrates to the wider Australian community that when both sides of politics work together and when both sides of the House of Representatives can join forces we can make a huge difference. Contrast that with some of the unfortunately divisive debates and divisions we've seen through the week. This bill before the House today gives a clear indication and a clear pathway forward for dealing with complicated issues surrounding veterans in our community.


I want to acknowledge the member for Herbert, who is in the House today, and her powerful speech on this bill yesterday and her strong advocacy as a representative of a large number of serving ADF and personnel in Townsville. Listening to the member for Herbert and talking to her about the advocacy she does when she's in the community in her electorate, I know how important it is that government gets it right.


Listening to the minister's second reading speech and also to the ministerial statement which was delivered to the House back in August, I know there are around 291,000 Australians that the Department of Veterans' Affairs supports. Just over half of these people are veterans or currently serving members of the ADF, around 48 per cent are women, around 82,000 are widows or widowers, and around 2½ thousand are children of veterans. Today, more than 203,000 of DVA's clients are 65 years old or older, while about 23,000 are under the age of 40. They represent every aspect of service, they represent every walk of life and they are across the whole of our nation, in every corner of our cities and towns.


In my electorate of Oxley, I'm very proud to be able to work alongside the RSL and veterans' organisations. I know every single member of the House works hard to advocate the interests of these people and, more importantly, the services that our serving and former serving men and women need in order to participate and to make sure their lives are honoured, and also to assist the transitions that many people go through as they leave the ADF. In the past 12 months, over 1,400 members of the ADF have separated from the forces for reasons not of their choosing. Ten years ago, just over 740 members separated involuntarily. How we help these men and women, how we provide for their transition and how we look at support for people when they are in the broader community is critical to the work that we do as members of parliament and also as community leaders.


We know that the Veterans' Review Board plays an important role in the merits review of decisions by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. As the shadow minister, the member for Kingston, indicated, Labor is supportive of the changes proposed in this bill which clarify, improve and streamline the operation of the law and processes within the department.


One of the first things I did when I was elected to this place was to invite the shadow minister to my electorate to meet with veterans and to meet with the local RSLs in my community. It was very clear from that initial meeting that government has a critical role to play in the ongoing support of veterans. I had been to a number of services over the years. I had met with a number of groups in my former role as a Brisbane city councillor, but it was being elected to this place and understanding and listening to the trauma and the difficulties that former members of the ADF and their families—particularly their families—suffer and go through.


As the son of a World War II veteran who served in the Navy as a signalman, I could always listen to my father talk about his experiences. That was a time when perhaps, following from when he left the Navy, often issues weren't discussed. Often there were times when men and women who served in the armed forces simply said: 'Well, that was wartime. We'll leave that behind. You don't need to talk about that. Get on with your life.'


Luckily, those times have changed. Today's amendments broadly set out a goal and an achievement to make sure that veterans who need support, who perhaps have served and are dealing with complicated issues, have accessibility improved. This bill today is not just about making it fairer; it's about making it more economical and informal and having a quick turnaround for a whole range of services. It promotes public trust and confidence in the decisions that we need to make and that the board needs to make. It's important that the process is as easy as possible for veterans to have a fair hearing on the merits of the decisions made.


There are a number of elements to the bill. It's divided into eight schedules. A number of speakers have gone through those schedules in detail, as did the minister and the shadow minister. I'm going to focus on one or two today. I know the veterans in my community and those who have come to my office seeking assistance have reflected a concern that the current system causes unworkable administrative issues and, sadly, unnecessary delays. We know from listening to the debate and following this closely, as I have, that the shadow minister has conveyed some of these concerns to the government.


After section 155(8), the bill inserts a proposed new subsection (8A), which gives the power to the principal member to dismiss an application for review if it is frivolous or vexatious, has no reasonable prospect of success or is otherwise an abuse of process. As the shadow minister said in her statement, we thank the government for removing this proposed subsection. As the member for Brand indicated, we did share the concerns conveyed by the veterans community and the RSL, who indicated a strong view on behalf of veterans that this proposed subsection should be removed, so we welcome this change. It reflects the unique nature of the Veterans' Review Board.


One of the other great opportunities I've had, apart from meeting and working closely with veterans in my community, was to be able to go onto the ground and visit our troops and our serving personnel when I visited the Middle East through the ADF Parliamentary Program. I was able and privileged to spend time with members of the Defence Force serving in the Middle East. We were able to visit the bases in the Middle East, to visit Afghanistan and to spend time in Kabul. This enabled me as a representative to see very clearly, firsthand, what our men and women go through on a daily basis. You can read about it, you can turn on the television, or you can log on and sometimes view what's happening, but, when you are able to visit a country at war and you see the dangers, the sacrifices and the sheer hard work that our men and women go through every single day, it puts a brand-new perspective on things. That experience left me with a greater respect for the Defence Force and the incredible sacrifices they make.


Currently, there are around 1,700 ADF personnel deployed to the Middle East region. Our Defence Force personnel remain active in advising, assisting and training Iraqi security forces and training and advising the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces in Afghanistan. I was privileged to be able to go and meet them and have a greater and deeper understanding of just what the ADF are doing to assist the men and women serving in the military there to lead, hopefully, to peace and recognition in that region. Our troops are not only doing an incredible job representing our country but, as I said, are working side by side with the local forces to train and equip the Afghan army. Above all, it was amazing. I was honoured to see the professionalism and commitment of our serving personnel on display 24/7.


I know that our troops are the best in the world and incredibly dedicated to serving our country. But I also know that in my own local community there are many ADF families that are separated from their loved ones. I cannot imagine the trauma, difficulties and fears those family members go through from day to day not knowing due to operational issues where their family members are and whether they are safe. The reputation of the ADF and their families and peacekeepers extends beyond our borders and to accompanying nations who also have personnel serving in the region.


From my own experience on the ground, from working with our veterans groups, I understand how critical and important it is to streamline medical and treatment processes for veterans. As I said in my earlier remarks, I have hosted round tables with the shadow minister. This week we saw the elevation to the shadow cabinet of the member for Kingston as our spokesperson for veterans' affairs. That's a very clear and powerful demonstration of strong leadership by an alternative government and by Bill Shorten, the Leader of the Opposition. We are sending a clear message, when it comes to veterans, that there is strong bipartisan support. The minister and the shadow minister worked closely in cooperation. I was incredibly pleased to see Labor taking a positive step to include the issues of veterans in the shadow cabinet. That sends a message to the wider community that we not only take their issues seriously but, if we are privileged to serve the nation as a future Shorten Labor government, we will have a veterans' affairs minister sitting at the table making the major decisions—as it should be.


I acknowledge all the work of members of parliament in this place. We are very privileged to have on my side of the chamber the member for Solomon, Luke Gosling OAM, and the member for Eden-Monaro, Mike Kelly OAM, who have demonstrated their commitment to public service in this place and also in the Australian Defence Force. I know from talking to the members for Solomon and Eden-Monaro the difficulties veterans go through when they leave the force, the difficulties for their families. We heard this week the ministerial statement on suicide within the ADF, and I was so pleased to see both sides of politics joining forces to acknowledge the rates of suicide are too high and, more importantly, that there is a plan going forward and more work to be done.


I thank the minister and the shadow minister for their efforts in working constructively together on this piece of legislation. I look forward to voting for this to see improvements for our ADF personnel. But the job is not finished. As a member of parliament, I will continue to advocate and represent to make sure the interests of our serving ADF men and women are looked after now and in the future.

"Butler, Terri, MP",ALP,2017-10-26,"



Ms BUTLER
 (Griffith) (11:18):  This is a very important bill and, as the member for Oxley has just told the House, it is a great example of bipartisanship and collaboration between the minister and the shadow minister. I pay tribute to the shadow minister. She's been an excellent shadow minister for veterans' affairs and her diligence has seen the elevation of the Veterans' Affairs portfolio to the shadow cabinet, which I think emphasises the significance of the portfolio from the perspective of the opposition.


Labor is supportive of changes in this bill which will clarify, improve or streamline the operation of the law and processes within the Department of Veterans' Affairs. This bill is an omnibus bill. It contains eight schedules which deal with a variety of elements in the legislation. It's fair to say that through the interventions of the shadow minister, amendments will be proposed that will significantly improve the operation of this bill in the interests of veterans and ex-service personnel.


I do want to talk a little about the importance of veterans and veterans' support, including in my own community. I also want to touch on, as the member for Oxley did, the recent ministerial statement in respect of suicide amongst veterans and ex-service personnel, to emphasise the importance of continuing to respond to suicide within that community and to provide support. I'm really fortunate as a member of parliament to have had, for the entire time I have been a member, constant and regular engagement with ADSO to talk about veterans' issues. The local representatives of ADSO were one of the first groups to contact me after I was elected at a by-election in February 2014, seeking to set up regularly scheduled meetings, which we did set up. I want to thank them for the work they have done and continue to do around the country, not just in my electorate, actually helping members of parliament to understand the issues that are unique to and that face the community of veterans and ex-service personnel. I particularly wanted to thank, from ADSO, Ted Chitham and Ross Clelland. They have been quite tenacious and unrelenting in seeking to raise with me several issues that are relevant to the lives of veterans and ex-service personnel. I know they will have seen and noted the work that's been done in respect of suicide in the community, for example.


I also wanted to thank the late Peter Snowdon, who was one of the first of the ADSO representatives to visit me. It was very sad to lose Peter from our community, and the veterans' community lost a very good advocate when Peter passed. I want to acknowledge his work as an advocate for veterans' interests and as somebody who would come to my office and talk to me about these really difficult issues. Occasionally, he would send an email directly to me raising any number of issues. We often disagreed, but he was always so positive about it, so willing to engage in a spirited debate and discussion, and such a great supporter of ADSO's continued engagements with members of parliament. I do miss him and I'm very sorry for the community's loss of Peter.


I'm also fortunate to have in the electorate of Griffith the Greenslopes Private Hospital, which is a veterans' hospital and has been a veterans' hospital since it was established. Greenslopes Private Hospital staff are well known in the community for the work they do with veterans. Their very beautifully put together Anzac Day service, which is a service at dawn that is so well attended by the local community, gets hundreds and hundreds of people. They have an amazing Catafalque party from the local Anglican church grammar school, a beautiful choir from Somerville House that perform every year exceptionally well, and very, very senior representations from the local community and the veterans' community. It's not just the work they do in commemoration and acknowledgment; it's the work they also do in the real issues facing veterans today, and I'm speaking particularly about the work that that foundation does to support post-traumatic stress disorder research.


The Greenslopes Private Hospital also auspices the Gallipoli Medical Research Foundation, which is doing a lot of work in relation to PTSD, including a study in relation to Vietnam veterans which I have referred to in this chamber before. The study found that one in three Australian veterans from the Vietnam War developed PTSD, and that participants with PTSD had four times the chance of having had a heart attack in the past; two times the risk of stomach ulcers; more than triple the risk of acting out their dreams while asleep; almost twice the tendency for restless legs; and increased daytime fatigue and sleepiness, as well as two times the risk of suffering sleep apnoea; double the chance of reflux; a greater tendency to report constipation, diarrhoea and irritable bowel syndrome; and lower levels of good cholesterol, which contributes to an increased risk of heart disease. The ramifications of developing PTSD are physical and psychological, and it is very important that organisations like the Gallipoli Medical Research Foundation continue their work of providing an evidence base about what can be done for veterans who have developed PTSD as a consequence of their service.


I also want to mention the work that is being done by the many RSL sub-branches—and you couldn't talk about the work that's being done for veterans without doing so—in my electorate of Griffith. Being an inner suburbs seat in Brisbane, we're fortunate that we have a range of organisations that provide support for veterans, and we have a range of RSL sub-branches. I couldn't possibly do all of them justice in the short time left to me, but I did want to mention a couple of the RSL sub-branches that I've visited recently.


The first is the Holland Park sub-branch. Every sub-branch is special, but this one is special in a particular way. It's a very naval sub-branch of the RSL. It's led by Sonja and Alan Hellier, who are well known in RSL circles in Queensland. They are both excellent people. Someone said to me the other day, 'What Sonja Hellier doesn't know about welfare for veterans could fit on a postage stamp,' and I think that's pretty accurate. She is a wealth of knowledge for the local community in relation to veterans and welfare. The two of them, together with the committee for that RSL, do so much great work to bring the community together and bring the RSL membership together, and I really want to acknowledge them. I went to the sub-branch's lunch recently. We heard from a really interesting speaker who'd came to military service quite late in his life—not that late, but not as a young person. That's the sort of thing they do. They bring people together; they bring diverse viewpoints together. And, of course, I also always see them every year at the commemoration of the Voyager disaster at St Mary's at Kangaroo Point, which is a very moving service. So I want to acknowledge them both for the work that they do in our community.


Another sub-branch that I've visited recently is the Norman Park RSL sub-branch. Again, it's very special. It's a sub-branch focused on nashos. They have a really great, active sub-branch with, again, excellent commemorations on Anzac Day and, of course, Remembrance Day, which is forthcoming. The nashos came up with a really lovely idea, which was to seek to obtain from the Australian War Memorial a sapling of a Lone Pine and have that planted right behind the memorial at Norman Park. It's a beautiful memorial, so I was very pleased to donate the sapling from the Australian War Memorial. Recently, I met with the leadership of the sub-branch, Brian and Margaret Besgrove, and also with Ken Cork, who'd been the motivating instigator of the Lone Pine project, for a small ceremony in relation to the planting of that Lone Pine.


I do encourage other RSL sub-branches to have a look at what the Australian War Memorial can do in terms of providing Lone Pine saplings. Obviously, for my own electorate, I'd be very, very pleased to assist those who don't have them to obtain Lone Pine trees. It is a really beautiful acknowledgment, particularly as we are commemorating the Centenary of Anzac over these few years in the current period. The nashos sub-branch at Norman Park is a really beautiful sub-branch. So much work is being done there for the welfare of veterans and ex-service personnel. I went to one of their recent lunches as well where we had a really great turnout and a great opportunity to talk about some of the issues of concern to veterans, and a few other issues as well, of course.


In acknowledging the importance of responding to the needs of veterans and ex-service personnel, I did want to mention those organisations. As I say, they are certainly not the only RSL sub-branches in my electorate. There are many of them, and each one of them is unique. Each of them has a specific interest or focus. I went to the Greek RSL sub-branch a little while ago now for a commemoration in Brisbane city. It was a beautiful commemoration for the Greek community as well. I'd better stop because I can't possibly list every single RSL sub-branch in the electorate in this one speech, but I do acknowledge them all for the work that they do.


Like the member for Oxley, I have had family members who have had active service in World War I and World War II, and I do think it is important, whenever we talk about veterans' affairs in this place, to stop and acknowledge what that really means: what active service has meant, what involvement in peacekeeping operations has meant and what it has meant to be a member of the Defence Force, for all ex-service personnel—people who volunteered to make great sacrifices for the country. We owe them a great debt of gratitude, and that willingness, the voluntary nature of it and the sacrifices made, whether in active service or not, ought to be acknowledged at every opportunity when veterans' affairs matters are being considered in this parliament, and I do so now.


I also wanted to touch on, as I said, the bipartisanship around suicide prevention for veterans and ex-service personnel. The minister did make a statement and there was bipartisan support for that. There's a recent Australian government response to a Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee report in relation to suicide by veterans. It's very pleasing to see that the government has accepted the recommendations of that report and has signalled an intention to undertake a range of measures with a view to preventing suicide amongst veterans and ex-service personnel. All of us in this House of Representatives will have heard from local veterans of the loss of friends that they have suffered as a consequence of suicide. All of us will have attended events, like the event that was held here at parliament in recent months, to commemorate suicide amongst veterans.


So it is incredibly important of course that the minister—having published a response to the committee's report, accepting the recommendations that have been made—now vigorously seek to implement all of those recommendations which he has accepted. We know that, in order to get things done in this place, you need vigorous application to the cause. You need constant follow-up. I'm quite confident that the minister and the shadow minister will continue to pursue, with vigour, measures that will improve our response to suicide amongst veterans and ex-service personnel and that that will improve suicide prevention amongst that community as well. It's a very important bipartisan approach that needs to be taken in relation to those issues.


I did want to say just a couple of things about the bill. As I said at the outset, it is an omnibus bill. There have been a couple of particular amendments to the bill that have been inspired by the concerns raised by the Labor opposition, including in respect of the Veterans' Review Board's ability to dismiss an application for review, which caused some concern in the ex-service community. I'm very pleased that the shadow minister was able to lead negotiations for amendments that will deal with some of the concerns that have been raised. I'm also very pleased that this is such a wide-ranging bill that will have such bipartisan support in moves to improve the lives of the veterans and ex-service community. Accordingly, Labor is supportive of the changes which streamline or improve the operation of the law, as far as it does improve processes for veterans, and, in light of the amendments that the government is planning to make, we'll support the bill.

Dr MIKE KELLY
 (Eden-Monaro) (11:33):  It is a great pleasure to speak on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 2017 in the context of the bipartisanship that has been demonstrated on this issue. I think the most enjoyable experience that I've had in this parliament has been working on security matters on the intelligence and security committee and on issues to do with veterans with members of the coalition. In particular, I think the Minister for Veterans' Affairs has really had his heart in his portfolio. I still would continue to advocate for, though, and support the suggestions by Neil James and the Australia Defence Association that the minister has got too much on his plate, that there should be more people in the portfolio and that the minister should be able to concentrate on the personnel and veterans' issues, and obviously the cybersecurity issues that are also in his space really need greater focus and concentration by support from another person in the portfolio.


The minister's doing a very fine job, despite those limitations. In particular, I really welcome his support for the bipartisan work of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee in relation to veteran suicide. That was one of the issues, apart from family experience with that subject, that led me to work with the member for Berowra in establishing a parliamentary friendship group on the prevention of suicide. I'd like to thank the Minister for Health, who is at the table, for his support, and the shadow minister. They have been avid participants and have kept extremely open minds about the types of issues that have been raised in that forum, which have direct relevance to suicide issues for veterans, as well.


We'll be together again in Beersheba in a few days time, celebrating the victory at Beersheba and commemorating the service and sacrifice of our men in the field in that battle 100 years ago on 31 October. It is particularly poignant for me, as there were members of my own family in the light horse. They, both of my grandfathers, were back again in the Second World War. They were looked after by the Jewish community in the area while they were fighting in the Middle East, particularly in Syria and Lebanon. They went on to suffer great traumas, one as a prisoner of the Japanese on the Burma-Thai railway and the other with severe injuries he suffered in New Guinea. I learn a lot from the family experiences that I've been exposed to as to some of the worst aspects of the traumas that veterans have had to go through.


Every generation of our family has served in the army, going back to the Crimean War, the Indian mutiny, the Afghan War, the first and second world wars, my own service and my father's service—even uncles and aunts. So it is something that I have a lot of understanding of, from the personal experience that's been passed on to me. Since I've entered parliament that has been greatly expanded by the fact that I represent nearly 3,000 veterans in Eden-Monaro, who have an average age of about 66 now. Some of the stories from them have been quite tragic. One of them involved a veteran who had been a prisoner of the Japanese. His wife endured tremendous hardship for 40 years after he returned home after the Second World War, with his terrible nightmares and his resorting to self-medication with alcohol. She endured great hardships. He'd wake up in the middle of the night, strangling her, thinking she was a Japanese soldier. It came to a point where she just couldn't take that any more. Her life was at risk. She was advised that she needed to move out of the household, which she did. Her husband passed away but she wasn't entitled to war widows support, which she desperately needed. We tried to get her some ex gratia payments to support her. Unfortunately, she went into hospital for a hip replacement operation and contracted septicaemia and died in hospital. We were never able to achieve that for her, but her case highlights another aspect we need to look at in these processes.


The veterans in my community have raised so many issues with me about the whole issue around process: the point-of-entry experience and trying to get around the complexity of making a claim, with the adversarial aspects of it. We need to have a benefit-of-the-doubt approach to these things. They have raised all these issues with me, but as I was sitting here a couple of minutes ago, waiting to speak in this debate, I received an email from a veteran which really sums it up. I'll just read that letter to me. It's from Tony Cullinan, who says:


Dear Mike,


I am a member of your constituency living in Bega.


I have a lot of service injuries and they are getting progressively worse. I am in varying degrees of pain a lot of the time.


I own a small business and get by, but it’s pretty tight.


I have a lot of depression and anxiety around my injuries.


I’ve been sitting here for the last hour waiting to be linked into a directions hearing with the VRB—


the Veterans' Review Board—


which was supposed to take place at 10. I called at ¼ passed 10 and a lady was surprised and said she would get back to me. I’ve heard nothing and I am sitting hear waiting.


There are no advocacy services in Bega and I have been hooked into Woden – but it’s a long way and they don’t really know what’s going on for me. I really feel overwhelmed by all of this.


Respectfully,


Tony Cullinan


That pretty much sums up the experience of the veterans who have approached me. I am obviously very pleased to see an attempt to address these issues, with this legislation in particular.


On the concern that we raised about the principal member process, I'm really delighted the government's picked that up. It really continued to embed in this process the adversarial issue and denied members the ability to have their day in court and be heard, genuinely and openly, so I'm delighted that section has been removed.


Also, I'm really delighted with the aspects that we've been dealing with recently and are promoting in terms of employer incentive scheme payments. That transition process is such a difficult one for all ex-members. You come from a completely different cultural environment—a completely different family-like environment within Defence—and you move into the general community and perhaps bring with you some mental baggage which you know nobody around you understands. And you speak a completely different language, in many cases. I've experienced a lot of this myself. We needed to address more aggressively the issue of that transition, so I'm pleased to see that's happening and that the government's implementing some measures.


In my own region, I'd like to highlight two things that I'm really pleased with. One is Remount, a Yass based organisation that works with veterans. They have broken important ground. They take Remount members and employees and they do great work in dealing with ex-military members who are suffering from stress related injuries through their service, such as PTSD, by getting them to work with horses and having that experience. We know that a lot of association with animals and pets has been a great way to help our veterans deal with their issues, so I really want to salute Remount. They are sponsored by Lockheed Martin. I'm very pleased that we're seeing some of the defence industry companies helping us and getting involved now with these issues, knowing that they really do owe their own input into these processes of dealing with our veterans. Well done, Remount at Yass and Lockheed Martin.


I was at the Snowy Hydro the other day and talked to Gabrielle Curtin. She raised with me a program that they have where they have transitioning services for men and women and get them into employment. It's great to see them taking that active role. It is another great example of what the Snowy Hydro has done for our country. There are so many ways. They're taking that responsibility.


It's part of the general culture in our region to support our service veterans. It has the highest voluntary participation rate in the country. You will see a lot of effort in the community to try to assist veterans and honour them. Just the other day, we had the opening of a lovely rock memorial in Bega to the Lucas family. It was an experience that has not been replicated anywhere in the world, as far as we know: there were 10 boys in the Lucas family and nine of them joined up and went to World War II. It was a tremendous sacrifice by that family. Some did not come home from their service. The unique history in our region is something that we celebrate and honour.


Another example is the Union Jack memorial that you pass on the way to Tumbarumba. It's not a memorial to the flag, the Union Jack. There used to be a town called Union Jack and, during the First World War, every male of military service age was killed in the First World War. Their names are listed on that memorial. The town was effectively destroyed by a war 12,000 kilometres away because the surviving family members had to move away. It's very special for our region and I appreciate the measures that are being taken to render more federal government support.


There are a couple of issues. I say this in the spirit of highlighting problems we still need to address and where I think we're going down the wrong track. There were previous proposals to eliminate the Department of Veterans' Affairs and move it into Human Services. It was raised in an ACCI paper that my predecessor published when he was head of ACCI. Some work was being done on that when the coalition came to government. We're seeing it actually playing out in relation to Veterans' Access Networks. The Veterans' Access Network here in the ACT was shut down. It served a lot of veterans from across the border. The services have been shifted into the nearby Centrelink office on Bowes Street.


We're of course well aware of the problems we've had with Centrelink: the attempts to automate services, the delays and problems. We just had a story appear—I think it was yesterday—about the delays that have left recipients unable to pay for rent or food and about complaints having jumped to more than 50,000 in the past financial year alone. It seems that this is an attempt to remove the 'human' from Human Services, and it's causing so much stress and anxiety.


My electorate offices have been absolutely inundated with these issues emerging from Centrelink. We've basically become an adjunct to that office. We've had people in great stages of stress and anxiety who in fact have been suicidal, and my office workers have been doing such a wonderful job relieving that stress and anxiety by basically getting in and doing what Centrelink should have been doing for them and working with points of contact.


It gives me great concern when we're attempting to shut down our vans, shut down the human contact that veterans, in particular in rural and regional areas, really need. You really need a human to go to and talk to and lean on. The isolation that's already there in rural and regional areas can greatly exacerbate the problems these veterans suffer from. To shut down these vans is really the wrong way to go, and I ask the minister to get that one on his agenda too. It's just not right to try and push this into Human Services and Centrelink. These veterans really resent that as well. They do feel that the special nature of their service and their issues warrants them being dealt with in a unique way, and it's an insult to their service and to them to push them into this. But, as I said, it comes back to that broader issue that we're experiencing at the moment with Centrelink in general.


I think that issue needs to be addressed for the general community as well. They're losing jobs in those Centrelink offices in our region too, and it's part of the grievance that's going on out there in rural and regional Australia—particularly rural and regional New South Wales—at the moment. I was handing out at the Gundagai booth at Gundagai High School a couple of weeks ago for the by-election there. There was a 43 per cent swing against the government in that booth. It's just been a perfect storm of issues that they're concerned about: removal of services from their communities, loss of jobs associated with that and forced mergers. They feel that they're under siege from governments at state and federal levels and they're turning to other parties, which is a trend that is not to be encouraged when you think of who some of those other parties might be. So it's incumbent on all of us, the government and the opposition, to listen to what's going on out there in rural and regional areas and to understand that it's pointless complaining about phenomena like shooters parties, One Nation or whatever without understanding there is a set of grievances that underpin that which have to be addressed.


Those grievances are at the moment greatly affecting my veterans, who we're representing in this debate today. On their behalf and for their interests I would urge the government to back away from what's going on with Centrelink: certain attempts to cut pensions and support in energy supplements and the like, which affect the veterans as well, and attempts to cut back on educational support for war orphans and war widows in some previous budgets. I'm glad to see we've moved away from that, but there's more work to be done, and the government will have our full support in broaching those issues.


I'm looking forward to maybe having further discussions on this with the minister when we're in Beersheba in the coming days. I urge Australians to look back at that service, at that history and at that battle, because it's not well known amongst a lot of Australians. I really take this opportunity to commemorate that service. (Time expired)

"Husar, Emma, MP",ALP,2017-10-26,"



Ms HUSAR
 (Lindsay) (11:49):  It's always important to rise and stand in support of our veterans and always good to follow the member for Eden-Monaro, who is a proud veteran himself. The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 2017, which seeks to clarify, improve and streamline the operation of law for veterans and their entitlements, is incredibly important. Labor, obviously, supports any measures undertaken to support veterans and ensure they are no worse off with the changes to the legislation.


We all know that to be a member of the Australian Defence Force is to dedicate your life and your service to the care and defence of our country—it is incredibly important work that they do. Like everyone in this place, I'm incredibly grateful and thankful for their work. I did see this firsthand on my recent deployment to the Middle East. Our defence personnel have a rich and defining place in shaping our identity and our culture. Mateship, a fair go, courage and sacrifice are all of the hallmarks of these very, very special people. Those that have served deserve our uttermost respect and admiration, but, most importantly, they deserve our support upon their return. As they return to civilian life, we owe them and their families the best possible services and care. Young women and young men returning from conflict require the stability, security, support and opportunity to get back on their feet.


From the First World War, when 300,000 Australians departed our shores—the war where the Anzac legacy would be born on the shores of Gallipoli and where Australia's involvement in battles such as Fromelles and Pozieres and the Battle of the Somme would see the Australian spirit, our courage and our mateship shine through—nearly 17,000 of our serving personnel, sadly, did not return home. But our debt of gratitude to returning veterans was forged through these battles as they fought to keep Australia safe and for our way of life. To this day, the veterans who return have seen their mates make the ultimate sacrifice. They have stood on the front line to defend our nation. We absolutely owe it to our veterans to provide them with the best support and care, and the wellbeing of veterans and their families is absolutely paramount. Their issues must be dealt with compassionately and correctly the first time around and not be put through administrative processes, which is currently the case. There are currently just under 60,000 Australians serving in our defence forces and an estimated 329,000 living veterans. The Department of Veterans' Affairs supports approximately 291,000 people, with 203,000 being over the age of 65 and 23,000 under the age of 40, and we will certainly see that number of young veterans increase with our ongoing involvement in the Middle East region.


In my electorate, there are just under 1,000 veterans, as recorded at 17 June this year, receiving assistance through the department, and this includes any current or former serving members eligible for compensation, income support or health treatment under the main veterans' entitlement legislation. This figure excludes ex-service personnel who are ineligible for or who have not sought assistance from the department. Five hundred and seven of these veterans are receiving a disability pension and, in addition, there are 311 war widow pensioners. So the electorate of Lindsay does have a significant need to support our veterans, and I'm pleased that, by and large, my community does support our veterans.


From the representations that I receive and the discussions I have had in my community and on my visit to Afghanistan last year, those serving and veterans need support to transition back home. Some veterans find it very difficult to blend in with our communities and are often affected by physical health issues, deterioration of mental health, lack of financial support and difficulties finding meaningful employment when they return. The Department of Veterans' Affairs is aware that on any given night across Australia over 3,000 veterans are homeless, affected by their selfless service to our nation. Our veterans have been through enough. They have done everything for their country that we have asked of them and more. To give them the run-around and the third degree to have their matters processed is simply unacceptable.


The legislation seeks to modernise and improve the operations of the Veterans' Review Board, which can only be a good thing for veterans. The legislation seeks to provide a mechanism of review that is accessible, fair, just, economical, informal and quick. It is proportionate to the importance and complexity of the matter and promotes public trust and confidence in the decision-making of the board. The removal of bureaucratic barriers and red tape benefits veterans to ensure their claims are heard in a timely and low-cost manner. No veteran deserves an unfair hearing, and we need to maintain an effective mechanism for review.


But veterans are right to be concerned about privacy, given this government's less than stellar track record and blunders when dealing with IT and data security. I've seen firsthand the difficult and stressful work of defence personnel, and that's why I believe their transition to civilian life should be much, much more secure. They are well trained; they are highly skilled and well organised. They are great assets to all types of businesses and the community at large, but they struggle to find employment and to readjust to life at home, far away, thankfully, from distant war zones and constantly being on edge to protect our nation. This is why it's important to help and act when it's required. Many of these veterans with positive attributes on the table have to readjust. They have to deal with their memories and actions of serving the nation. We need to assure them that we will provide a strong and positive safety net.


I had the opportunity, as I said earlier, to spend time with troops, visiting four bases during my tour of Afghanistan as part of the ADF Parliamentary Program in July. This commendable initiative provides an opportunity to engage very, very closely with members of the ADF and experience the challenges and rewards of service life. The program also offers a chance to see firsthand the diverse capabilities of our Defence Force in action.


When I was there, above all, our troops wanted to know that their contribution is, firstly, supported and, more importantly, highly valued. Having performed in and participated in some of the drills that we put our men and women through and having performed some of the work they do, in a very, very minor capacity, I've got to say it is incredibly nerve-racking. It is intense. It drives up even some of the most dormant feelings of anxiety. A war zone is not a pleasant place to be. Being one of the most protected persons in that war zone, as I was, was comforting, but I'm not the one out there risking my life.


It is incredibly important that we support them. It is our duty to absolutely recognise them. Our serving men and women had a couple of thoughts for me to bring back, and on my return I was pleased to present those to the Minister for Defence.


I am committed to ensuring that our service men and women are supported not only during their service but back into civilian life. Last week I also had the privilege of attending a dinner at the Royal Military College Duntroon as part of our program, where I got to engage some more with Aaron Bell, who was in my office as part of the exchange program. Certainly, I got to benefit from having his knowledge and experience with the Defence Force. With the memories of my trip to Afghanistan in mind, it has been a great opportunity to share experiences and insights into a very different world to what we imagine. During my visit to the Middle East, the troops told me of their longing for and personal attachment to their home back here and the difficulties in maintaining relationships back in this country. You can't talk to your family about what you've seen and what you've done over there, because there are insecure phone networks. The time zones are different, so you often are working at a time when your family might not be at home for you to speak to them. They might be at school when it is time for you have the opportunity to call them. There is a big gap for our serving men and women who are in the Middle East right now.


Their selfless sacrifice ensures our personal safety here in this country. Our veterans talk about the amount of money that is put into training them to build weapons, to shoot and to care for their soldiers and their personnel while they're in the battlefield. Everywhere I went, across all four bases, there was a huge and heightened sense of anxiety. The topic of discussion about veterans' affairs upon their return to Australia was absolutely the No. 1 issue. So, while they're out there serving and doing their bit for the country, making sure that we are safe and protected and that our way of life continues, our men and women in the Middle East are worried about what's going to happen on their return. I just think that is incredibly unfair. It's certainly not a concern that we should be taking lightly. I think that they've been through enough. The trauma they have experienced can lead to them having issues on return, including suicide, mental health issues and post-traumatic stress once they have returned home.


I have family members who were on the HMAS Voyager when it was struck. The things that I witnessed as a small child and a teenager that my uncle went through were quite horrendous, including him not being able to be in a room of an evening with no lights on and not being able to sleep in a dead silent, quiet space. Some noise always had to be going on because of the trauma associated with that accident that he was involved in. Potentially, the way in which that was handled upon their rescue and the way in which their contribution was seen were certainly not helpful to his recovery.


Between 2001 and 2015, 325 veterans took their own lives. It is an absolute national tragedy when anybody suicides, but in particular, when men and women through their service for this country see no other option than to take their own lives, that is an absolute national tragedy. When men and women who have served our nation, upon their return, suffer such deep mental and emotional pain that they take their own lives, we absolutely need to be doing more. We need to find ways to support them and to try to stop this from happening.


The representations from veterans that I receive in my office are about dealing with the department and accessing services and support back home. I know and support our local organisations and services in Lindsay that provide critical support and assistance to current Defence personnel, veterans and their families. I thank them for the service that they provide in our community.


I want to place on record my thanks to Legacy, which cares for around 80,000 veterans whose dependants range in age from less than 12 months to 109 years. Groups such as Legacy provide valued support to families during really difficult times. The Penrith RSL sub-Branch has 715 members. Penrith owes a great deal of gratitude to the Penrith RSL sub-Branch and its president, Mick McConnell. The sub-branch's good work includes: welfare for veterans; a drop-in centre opening in November—I'm looking forward to being part of that; a welfare officer helping veterans with their claims; and supporting over 400 war widows. The Penrith RSL sub-Branch finds more and more younger vets are seeking help who have higher rates of mental health issues. The older vets were, in many cases, treated poorly when they returned from Vietnam and other areas of conflict, so they are determined as a cohort not to let this happen to our younger returning vets.


The Penrith sub-branch is involved with the RAAF at Richmond and Glenbrook bases, and with the Orchard Hills Army and Navy cadets. The women's auxiliary, which is supported by the Penrith RSL sub-Branch, with Colleen Towle as the president, was formed in 1916 and continues now. Their job originally in World War I was to send comfort parcels to Penrith soldiers serving on the Western Front. The parcels consisted of items that we would look to send now but were probably different then—woollen socks, soap, cakes and other items that would be missed by our soldiers who were serving overseas at the time. We might have slight changes to the care packs, but they're still being sent. For many decades, the sub-branch has provided significant pension, welfare and hospital visits for members and members of other sub-branches. Now they hold annual Easter, Mother's Day and Father's Day raffles and other fundraising activities like their biannual gala auction, attending Anzac services, selling Anzac badges, attending the conference for the Central Council of RSL Women's Auxiliaries and also attending other auxiliary functions.


We also have the Penrith and Lower Blue Mountains War Widows' Guild providing a range of services to war widows, and it operates with significant volunteer input from its thousands of members. We have the Homes for Heroes program, which has built around nine rooms at Governor Phillip Manor for our homeless vets. The program offers a comprehensive rehabilitation service. For the support residents receive, they're required to give back to the program by doing voluntary work, mentoring other people and engaging in training and rehabilitation. Homes for Heroes does a wonderful job helping homeless young veterans to get back into mainstream life.


Other organisations supporting veterans in my electorate include: St Mary's RSL sub-Branch—Ron Blakely is the president and Tony Fryer is secretary; the Royal Marines Association division of Western Sydney; the Red Cross; Vietnam vets at St Mary's, which is also affectionately known as the Train; Nepean Legacy and Legacy Widows' Club Nepean; the Australian Light Horse Association; the wives of Vietnam vets with Maureen Clements; and the Nashos, of which John Taylor is the secretary and acting vice-president. I was incredibly honoured to take up my first role as patron with the Nashos.


I look forward to meeting more and more Defence Force personnel and to having the pleasure of welcoming Amanda Rishworth, the shadow minister, in November. I'm incredibly grateful to the Defence Force personnel I met on my trip to Afghanistan. We're still in regular contact—we're now friends officially on Facebook—and they often communicate with me when they're doing their jobs and going about their business. I'm very grateful for the information and advocacy that they provide to me on the issues that need to be changed.


I stand with all the veterans and service men and women of this country, and I will ensure that I will always work to achieve the best possible outcomes for them and their families.

Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Centenary of ANZAC, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Cyber Security and Minister for Defence Personnel) (12:04):  I thank the people who spoke on this bill with the best interests of veterans at heart and who spoke in a very bipartisan manner because, as all of us know in this place, veterans deserve all of our attention and for us to work in this place in a very cooperative way. I thank the shadow minister again for the way that she engages with me to make sure that we can deal with these issues in a bipartisan way.


I am pleased to present the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 2017. The bill comprises nine schedules that would implement several small but necessary amendments to veterans legislation to clarify, improve or streamline the operation of the law. Schedule 1 of the omnibus bill amends the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 to modernise and align the Veterans' Review Board's operations with those of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal following the amendments made by the Tribunals Amalgamation Act 2015. The amendments also support the alternative dispute resolution processes and the recent amendments to the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 which provide for a single appeal path for reconsidering decisions.


Schedule 2 would amend the provisions of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 concerning the Specialist Medical Review Council to improve the operation of the SMRC, streamline some of the SMRC's administrative arrangements and better reflect the manner in which its functions and processes have evolved over time. The proposed amendments would simplify the nomination and appointment process for councils, enable online lodgements of claims, streamline the notice of investigation requirements and give the SMRC an ability to pay the travel costs of applicants who appear before an oral hearing of the SMRC.


The proposed amendments in schedule 3 of the omnibus bill would enable international agreements to be made that would cover allied veterans and defence force members with service of the type for which benefits and payments, including rehabilitation, can be provided by the Repatriation Commission or the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission under the relevant acts. Currently, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs can only enter into an arrangement with the governments of countries that are or have been dominions of the Crown. This will enable the Minister for Veterans' Affairs to enter into agreements with a broader range of countries.


The proposed amendments in schedule 4 are intended to clarify that vocational rehabilitation assistance under an employer incentive scheme in the form of wage incentive payments is within the scope of the enabling provisions of the relevant legislation.


The proposed amendments in schedule 5 would amend subsection 409(2) of the Military Compensation Act 2004 and subsection 151A(1) of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (Defence-related Claims) Act 1988 to add the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation as a person to whom the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission may provide information for purposes allowed under the CSC's legislation. Those amendments would implement a recommendation by the 2011 Review of Military Compensation Arrangements intended to improve the information-sharing framework for incapacity and superannuation benefits between DVA and CSC and, therefore, reduce the time taken by DVA and CSC to process claims, which would better support injured former ADF members. In addition, enabling the CSC to use medical reports held by the MRCC to determine superannuation claims would also avoid the need to send ADF members for further medical assessment where DVA already holds relevant medical evidence that could be used by the CSC to determine superannuation benefits. ADF members would be spared from any retraumatisation from having to tell their stories. This is particularly significant for ADF members who suffer psychological conditions, including those that have arisen as a result of physical or psychological abuse.


Each of the sets of amendments is relatively modest. They enhance the operation of the department and will mean better outcomes for veterans. I thank members for their contribution to the debate and I commend this bill to the House.

Mr KHALIL
 (Wills) (13:30):  I rise to speak of the abhorrent terrorist attack in the Somali capital of Mogadishu this past Saturday which killed at least 320 innocent civilians and injured 500 more. Al-Shabaab, an affiliate of al-Qaeda, has a history of launching bomb attacks against innocent civilians. This despicable attack is another setback in Somalia's decade-long struggle against these terrorists. The sheer scale of the loss of human life is mind numbing. It's the deadliest-ever attack on Somali soil and the deadliest terrorist attack the world has seen in many, many years.


It has greatly shaken the Somali community in my home state of Victoria, many of whom have themselves fled the violence in their homeland to seek refuge in Australia. Their population has grown from less than 250 in 1990 to almost 8,000 today and, during this period of significant growth, they've made remarkable contributions to Australian society and have affirmed their place in our proud multicultural society. Many would have family in Mogadishu, and they are deeply affected by these attacks.


It is saddening that there has been relatively minimal media coverage of these attacks. But here in this parliament, I, as an African-Australian MP, say that Somali lives matter, that African lives matter, and I call on the government to provide strong support not only to assist the Somali people to rebuild but to send a strong message to the Somali community here in Australia and worldwide that we as Australians stand united with Somalia and Somali Australians against this evil.

(b) by midday yesterday, the Employment Minister had five times denied that her office had been involved in leaking the raids;


(c) at the Prime Minister's Question Time briefing yesterday, attended by the Employment Minister and the Senior Media Adviser who has now resigned for leaking the raids, the Prime Minister, according to the Government's account, failed to ask a single question about the involvement of the Minister's office in leaking the raids;


(d) at 6.10 pm, Alice Workman of Buzzfeed reported that journalists received a leak about the raids from the Employment Minister's office before the raids began;


(e) at 7.30 pm, after the truth had been exposed, only then did the Employment Minister finally admit that she had misled the Senate on five separate occasions; and


(f) during the utegate scandal, the now Prime Minister himself said that misleading the Parliament ""is an offence that should result in the dismissal or resignation of a Minister. It is perfectly clear""; and

(a) sack the Employment Minister for breaching Ministerial Standards by repeatedly misleading the Senate; and


(b) explain to the House his involvement, his office's involvement and his Government's involvement in this serious matter where the publicly stated version of events doesn't add up.

"Shorten, Bill, MP",ALP,2017-10-26,"



Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (15:17):  This matter of public importance must start with this observation: Labor's criticism of the government's bungled raids is not about the integrity of the AFP; it's about the lack of integrity in this rotten government. Yesterday morning I said that these raids were the desperate action of a grubby government led by, quite frankly, a grubby Prime Minister—and I repeat that today. This isn't a throwaway line, but everything that has happened in the previous 36 hours, since I first made that statement, and everything that this government has done since yesterday morning confirms the truth that Australia has a grubby government and an increasingly grubby Prime Minister. During question time, this point was most clearly illustrated when the Prime Minister had a chance to defend Senator Cash. When the opposition moved a resolution condemning her, they did not defend her; they simply gagged the debate. Of course, the events this week—the unprecedented actions of this government—are occurring because this government is a desperate government running out of time.


Senator Cash should try and salvage what remains of her reputation by resigning immediately. After all, if she seeks inspiration on the matter she should listen to the words that her leader, the member for Wentworth, said during the 'Utegate' scandal in 2009. He said that misleading the parliament:


… is an offence that should result in the dismissal or resignation of a minister. It is perfectly clear.


But, like so many other issues under this current Prime Minister, we've seen a pattern of behaviour emerge again. What this Prime Minister and this government do is focus all their energy on their opponents and none on the people of Australia. What this government and this Prime Minister do, whenever confronted by a choice to take the high road for national interest and put people first, is always look for the low road of their self-interest and to attack their opponents.


We see the classic Turnbullian power play: wild, wild accusations, extreme language, big promises. You can just see him when he was a barrister with the clients the night before the case: 'We've got this in the bag. I'm the best that money can buy, and we've got this in the bag.' But the next morning, as we saw yesterday morning, we see that the case has changed. The facts are actually not as good—poor old client. 'Oh, my learned leader, the barrister, says—oh, the facts are changing. I'll be back to you in a moment.' You could just see the disappointed ranks of the government: 'But, dear leader, you said that we would win this. We've got Shorten where we want him. We have Labor where we want them. We have the unions where we want them.' And what happened? Classic overreach. Deep down, every member of the government knows that their Prime Minister lacks judgement.


What should the government have been doing this week? They should have been prioritising first home buyers, but instead they defend the negative-gearing tax interests. They are a government who, when they have the chance to pull the trigger on gas exports, instead spend their time defending their beleaguered Deputy Prime Minister. They are a government who, when they talk about workplace relations, always talk about unions and union representatives. They say they like the workers, but they've never seen a worker whose penalty rate they don't want to cut arbitrarily. I've got no doubt that they pop into 7-Eleven when the coffee maker at home is broken, and they get served by workers, but does it ever cross their born-to-rule elitist minds that maybe the workers who are serving them in these fast-food operations are not getting paid properly; they're the victims of wage theft? They love to talk about employment, but they never talk about casualised employment. They never talk about the people who are underemployed.



Mr Falinski interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Mackellar is warned.




Mr SHORTEN:
  You're better off keeping your mouth shut so we're still left to wonder if you're a fool, mate. Now, the test for the Prime Minister today is simple—



The SPEAKER:  The Leader of the Opposition will withdraw.




Mr Shorten:
  All right. I withdraw. Misleading the parliament just once is an offence that demands a resignation. But old Senator Cash, not content to mislead the parliament, misled it five times—five times! If she won't resign, the Prime Minister must sack her. He must put the national interest and the integrity of the parliament ahead of his own political interest.


But the problem is that this born-to-rule Prime Minister thinks that he is above the rules. This is the problem, the infection which infects the whole of the government. They think, these conservatives, that they're born to rule and that they're always right, no matter what the facts. The problem is: they are born to rule, but they're unfit to govern.


We know, we understand, that this isn't the minister's first offence; it was just her worst performance. Credit to Senator Cameron, Senator Watt and Senator Kitching, who pushed through a shameful and deliberate conservative filibuster to uncover the truth. Imagine if we had an employment minister who actually focused on the 700,000 Australians who are unemployed and the 1.1 million Australians who are underemployed, someone who cared about the fact that she presides over the lowest wage growth since records were kept or the 700,000-plus workers who are having their penalty rates cut? Imagine if we heard speeches from the government about workplace safety or industrial diseases or labour hire exploitation? Instead, this minister appointed a law-breaker to head up the ABCC and is now asking Australians to pay another $400,000 to pay his legal bills.


But it wasn't just Senator Cash who humiliated herself last night. They say that you don't get a second chance to make a first impression. In its first public outing, the Registered Organisations Commission has shown its true colours: nakedly political, grossly incompetent, shamefully partisan and hopelessly compromised. It must be amazing to Australians when they hear that the government can whistle up 13 police to chase up documents 10 years old within a day, based on an unknown caller. Imagine how many Australians are frustrated to hear that.



An honourable member interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  I remind the member that he's been warned.




Mr SHORTEN:
  They might be worried about law and order, their personal safety. No-one other than the government can get 13 police to chase up documents 10 years old, when ordinary Australians can't get the attention and the safety they want. This is a government not focused on the priorities of the people. But, of course, we know that this is a government that doesn't care about the conditions of ordinary people. We're not going to let the government off the hook for the abolition of the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal, putting pressure on drivers to cut corners and take risks. We've already seen a seven per cent increase in the rate of fatal crashes involving articulated trucks. And the consequences of letting ideological obsessions control industrial relations policy are that workplaces are less safe, wages are flat and the rip-offs and the rorts against workers continue.


Whilst this government spends every week obsessing about its political opponents, Australians suffer. In the last financial year, 55 million calls to Centrelink went unanswered—families looking for support, people with disability looking for help, and jobseekers trying to pick themselves up and get back into the employment market. This is a government that can't answer the phone to its citizens but can find their address to send the debt collectors to. And in The Courier-Mail today we see another cabinet leak, saying the Prime Minister's decided to turn his back on constitutional recognition for the First Australians. This is a government that never misses an opportunity not to represent and put the people first.


I have to say—and I don't mind admitting this, even as Leader of the Opposition—that, when the member for Wentworth rolled the former Prime Minister, I thought my job would get harder but I actually thought politics would get better. I think the Australian people genuinely thought it was a chance to put some faith and hope back into politics. But the Prime Minister, by all his actions ever since that event two years ago, has systematically destroyed the faith and hope of people who thought he'd be better than what he's turned out to be. And we know that the Prime Minister has a particular style of destruction: when all else fails him, he chases his opponents. Ask Peter King, the former member for Wentworth. Ask Brendan Nelson. Ask Tony Abbott. Ask Kevin Rudd. Well, I just want to advise the government on this fact: Australians have worked this Prime Minister out; they know he doesn't believe in anything except his own survival. That's just not good enough for Australia. Every day between now and the next election, we will put people first: we will stand up for better quality jobs, housing affordability, better energy prices and a fair go all round.

"Pyne, Christopher, MP",LP,2017-10-26,"



Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Leader of the House and Minister for Defence Industry) (15:27):  The coalition is not going to be lectured by the Labor Party about standards. I have been in this chamber for quite a while, and I could give you example after example of the Labor Party standing by some of the worst members the House of Representatives has produced—the member for Dobell being a classic case. But I don't even need to go back that far because right now, in the current Labor caucus, are two people who should not be in the positions they are in: Senator Kitching, who the Leader of the Opposition referred to earlier, and Senator Dastyari, who is back on the frontbench of the Labor Party. Senator Dastyari was required to stand down because he got donors to pay his personal bills for him. He didn't just fail to declare donations from Chinese donors, from foreign donors, to the Labor Party in some kind of administrative muck-up; he actually asked donors to pay for his own personal expenses!



Mr Champion interjecting—




Mr PYNE:
  As the member for Wakefield said, who is rarely in the House—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Irons
):  The member for Wakefield has already been tossed out once today; it can happen again.




Mr PYNE:
  Senator Dastyari was stood down. And now he's back. He was stood down for a matter of months. This week the Leader of the Opposition, incapable of standing up to the CFMEU, is even incapable of standing up to Sam Dastyari. So he's put Sam Dastyari back on the frontbench and he's in the decision-making team of the Leader of the Opposition's office.


Secondly, there is Senator Kimberley Kitching, the hand-picked candidate of the Leader of the Opposition to go into the Senate. She was hand-picked by the Leader of the Opposition against the advice of most of his frontbench from Victoria, including the member for Isaacs, who threatened to resign as shadow Attorney-General over the appointment of Kimberley Kitching but then didn't have the courage of his convictions. Senator Kitching was referred by the Heydon royal commission—the royal commission that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition says found nothing—to the DPP for criminal charges. In spite of knowing that, the Leader of the Opposition put her into the Senate, over the complaints and objections of some of his frontbenchers. She was referred to the DPP for possible criminal charges for aiding and abetting the false and misleading statements of six other HSU officials by sitting their right-of-entry test. Apparently, she bragged that she got 100 per cent in some of the tests, saying, 'Did another one—got 100 per cent again.' This is the person who the Leader of the Opposition thought should sit in the Australian Senate and who he is praising right now in the House for her pursuit of the Minister for Employment. 


But it's not just Senator Dastyari or Senator Kitching; the Leader of the Opposition himself has amongst the lowest standards of any Leader of the Opposition who's ever sat in that seat. The issue that we are debating today is the misuse of union members' money. The opposition thinks that the indiscretion of a ministerial staffer is a capital offence but that the misuse of union members' money is something that should be ignored. In fact, people who do it are promoted in the Labor caucus. The issues that we're discussing are the questions the Leader of the Opposition needs to answer about the donation of $100,000 to GetUp! in start-up money, when it was first getting started, when he was on the board of GetUp! and also the national secretary of the Australian Workers' Union. So, when he was secretary of AWU, $100,000 went to GetUp! from the AWU, and he was on the board of GetUp! when it got started. And, quite legitimately, members of the fourth estate have asking the Leader of the Opposition to answer questions about whether the correct processes were followed in the union, and he has refused to answer those questions. He has refused to cooperate, and the AWU has refused to cooperate. That is why the offices of the AWU in Melbourne and Sydney were raided—because the ROC had evidence, enough suspicion to suspect, that those documents could be destroyed. The ROC and the AFP obtained a warrant from a magistrate in Victoria, who agreed that they had good enough cause to have that suspicion that the offices should be raided. 


The AFP don't go around raiding union offices for the fun of it; they did it because they wanted to make sure the law was upheld. In the Labor Party, that is a capital offence as well, and their response to that has been to attack the AFP—to attack the integrity of the Australian Federal Police—which is utterly disgraceful. One day, perish the thought, the Labor Party might be back in office again, and the AFP will serve them as well as it has served this side of the House and the other side of the House over the last 30 or so years, with complete fairness to both sides. In fact, it was appalling that the AFP commissioner felt the need to defend the AFP by putting out a statement today. Andrew Colvin should not have been placed in this position by the Leader of the Opposition. He was placed in this position by the Leader of the Opposition and by the disgraceful statements of the member for Gorton about the AFP and its lack of integrity, accusing of it being a political tool of the government. 



A government member:  What a disgrace!




Mr PYNE:
  It was a disgrace, and it remains a disgrace. He says:


The AFP has this week been the subject of commentary and innuendo regarding its independence and the ability of AFP members to carry out their work objectively and without political interference. The AFP … undertakes its activities without fear or favour. The AFP rejects in the strongest terms any suggestion to the contrary.


The other two matters that have been discussed and that the Leader of the Opposition has failed to provide the facts about are the donation of $27,000 that Australian Super gave to the Australian Workers Union when the Leader of the Opposition was the National Secretary of the Australian Workers Union, was on the board of Australian Super and was the candidate for Maribyrnong. Amazingly—coincidently—not very long later, the AWU made a $26,000 donation to the Maribyrnong campaign.


The Leader of the Opposition refuses to answer questions about that. Which part of probity doesn't this Leader of the Opposition understand? Thirdly, in 2007 the Leader of the Opposition cut out the middle man: 'I'm sick of wasting time with Australian Super or the GetUp! organisation; I'll get a donation of $25,000 directly from the Australian Workers Union to the Maribyrnong campaign.' That was when he was the candidate for Maribyrnong and the National Secretary of the AWU.



Mr Hawke interjecting—




Mr PYNE:
  He cut out the middle man, as the assistant minister points out, and got the money transferred directly across. And this is the man who lectures us about standards and transparency and accountability? He has absolutely zero credibility.


Could I also say in relation to the defence of the AFP: what a disgraceful performance it has been. It is totally contrary, once again, to the Leader of the Opposition's past statements about the Australian Federal Police.




Mr Champion:
  Tell us about the New South Wales Liberal Party! Tell us about their donation history!




Mr PYNE:
  I would love to talk about the New South Wales Labor Party, but there isn't time to go through Eddie Obeid; Joe Tripodi; Ian Macdonald—is he still in prison? I think Ian Macdonald is still in prison, isn't he? I would love to talk about the New South Wales Labor Party, but I've only got so much time. Bill Shorten said in 2015—



Mr Champion interjecting—




Mr PYNE:
  Why don't you make another interjection? That last one was a great success. Bill Shorten said in 2015:


We recognise that the AFP is independent, they’ll make their own decisions about what they choose to investigate or not and that’s as it should be.


The Leader of the Opposition knows full well that the smokescreen he's trying to create is just that, a smokescreen to cover his embarrassment about his addiction to being connected to the union movement and his inability to stand up to the CFMEU or the AWU, or even Sam Dastyari or even Senator Kitching. If he won't stand up to the union movement, he won't stand up for the nation's interests.

Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (15:37):  Listening to the Leader of the House is like listening to Catweazle ranting about elec-trickery, the telling bone—the conspiracies. It is like a pantomime character getting excited: 'Look out! He's behind you!' But what was notably absent from that spirited defence was a single mention of the Minister for Employment, Michaelia Cash, and why she should remain in her position.


What we know for certain is this minister has misled the parliament five times, and she should go. If the Prime Minister had any courage, he would make her go. Don't forget, this is a Prime Minister who has already lost five government ministers: the former member for Mayo, the member for Fadden, the former member for Fisher, the member for Farrer and Senator Canavan. Today we're likely to get No. 6. Tomorrow we might get Nos 7 and 8. This Prime Minister is going to break John Howard's record for losing ministers—what an incredible achievement!


Only a Prime Minister who is weak, who doesn't have the confidence of his party, would be too gutless to take the action that is obviously necessary to anybody watching. We can only conclude that he's too weak to act because he doesn't have the support of his colleagues or that he was in it up to his neck. I've got to say, it really does not bear examination, does it? The Prime Minister summons the minister down to his office and says: 'There are all these very concerning reports this morning that you or your office have tipped off the media to a raid that happened yesterday. What have you got to say to that?' We are expected to believe that Guthrie Featherstone QC, MP asked just one question: 'Did you do it?', that the minister just answered: 'No. It wasn't me,' and that Guthrie Featherstone QC, MP didn't ask the obvious next question. This Prime Minister's so great at cross-examining that he wrote a book about it—The Spy Catcher Trial—talking about what a fantastic lawyer he is, but he didn't say, 'Actually, Minister, the reports aren't about you tipping off the media; the reports are your staff tipping off the media.' It absolutely beggars belief.


It is a classic tactic of those opposite to try and say that we have asserted this or asserted that. I have to be very clear about what the problem is here. It's often not the crime but the cover-up that gets you, and this is the case with this minister too. If she had been frank about the fact that her staff had done the wrong thing instead of misleading the parliament five times, instead of trying to drag out proceedings last night so she could get past the media cut-off times and past the dinner break, I think people might have a bit of sympathy for her. But the fact that she has persisted in misleading and persists with the same today makes our sympathy evaporate.


I have to be clear about this other element: the Leader of the House tried to imply that we are somehow criticising the Australian Federal Police. That is the very last thing that we are doing. We heard evidence just this week from the Federal Police that government cuts will:


… mostly apply to our discretionary funding. That is areas that fund a large portion of our anti-narcotics, our organised crime work, our general operation work, our fraud and anti-corruption.


In those circumstances, every Australian will be asking themselves why the Federal Police, who are so good at their work, so good at protecting Australians, instead of being out busting organised crime gangs, drug traffickers and gun traffickers are doing work that Star Track Express could have done: going down the road and picking up some documents because the ROC sent them to do so. This is an outrageous use of tightly stretched resources when we are hearing how tightly stretched those resources are.


What we know is that this government will always use taxpayers' resources to pursue political opponents. They will say anything. They will do anything, because this Prime Minister— (Time expired)

Mr FALINSKI
 (Mackellar) (15:42):  It is sad. Their concocted outrage can't even limp to the end of five minutes. To have the Deputy Leader of the Opposition stand here in this parliament and compare the AFP work to that of a Star Track Express courier is a disgrace. It's an absolute disgrace, and she should stand up here now and apologise to the hardworking members of the Australian Federal Police. The truth of the matter is this: those opposite would not have put this motion if Michaelia Cash was not a woman, if she was not an effective minister and if she was not calling their mates to account. The fact of the matter is that they can throw up as much dust as they like, they can make as much noise as they want over there but they can't obscure the fact that they are running away from the facts. They can't cover up the secret payments any longer. They can't cover up the secret deals, the self-interest and the corruption that is rampant in the Labor Party, rampant in the union movement and rampant in their associated entities. They can't win this argument. They can't convince anyone of their views, so they're left to do one thing and one thing only: try to confuse people. They try to claim the AFP's work is that of a Star Track Express courier, because what else would you expect of the party of Eddie Obeid, Ian Macdonald, Joe Tripodi, Bob Carr and Luke Foley?



Mr Champion interjecting—




Mr FALINSKI:
  The member for Wakefield wants to be heard. It's a shame he doesn't try as hard to be understood!


They're led by a man who complained when he was a minister in the previous government that his $300,000 salary wasn't enough, that he was underpaid. He is a person who is opposed to increased funding for schools, opposed to lowering taxes for small businesses, opposed to completing the funding for the NDIS that those opposite left dangerously unfunded, opposed to more jobs and higher wages, and opposed most of all to the legislation that would end corrupting benefit payments to unions. He, now, and the Labor Party now, say that a minister should resign because a staff member leaked a story about police raids on a union. Okay, fair enough.


So where were those opposite when Tony Hodges, a former member of Julia Gillard's media team, spread information in order to incite a riot against the then Leader of the Opposition, the member for Warringah? The same media unit then put out stories how Prime Minister Gillard's security team had to protect the poor frail member for Warringah. What a story. In full technicolour for everyone to see, the Prime Minister lost her shoe, and the Leader of the Opposition was escorted by AFP officers. But don't worry; I am sure if there had been some StarTrack couriers standing nearby they could have stepped in and done the job, according to the deputy leader. That's why Prime Minister Gillard resigned, of course. If you leak a story to a newspaper about a union getting raided, that's the same as inciting a riot against the Leader of the Opposition, right? Of course it is. They're the standards.



Mr Champion interjecting—




Mr FALINSKI:
  The member for Wakefield, back again; thanks for helping us out. The fact of the matter is there is nothing they won't say and do to obscure the facts here. The Leader of the Opposition stands up and talks about the poor quality of the coffee he gets in Melbourne and how poorly paid the person making the coffee is but, let's not forget, it was his Fair Work Commission, appointed by him, who he referred this decision to, that came to this decision. So there we have it. We have a party over there that can't remember anything and forgets everything, including the fact that they get payments from people like the CFMEU, including the fact they used to have a minister in New South Wales by the name of Eddie Obeid and the fact that they gave $100,000 to GetUP!

"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2017-10-26,"



Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR
 (Gorton) (15:47):  This is a very important debate we are having today because it goes to whether in fact the government has colluded with the media in order to expose raids by the Australian Federal Police. I want to make it very clear: the opposition support the Australian Federal Police. They are an independent statutory body and they had to do what they did because a warrant was issued. But let's be very clear about what we're talking about. This is the relationship between the government and the regulatory body it established for these purposes. At the time, when the government foreshadowed its interest to create the Registered Organisation Commission, Labor said we had concerns with this particular body because we said it would be used for political purposes. We said, instead, we would be very happy to see these responsibilities within the remit of ASIC and we argued that that should be the body that deals with serious alleged breaches by officers of registered organisations. We argued that would be the better place. We even explained to the crossbench before the legislation was enacted that the government would use this commission as its political tool to attack its political opponents, because that's the pattern of behaviour of this government since it was elected in 2013.


Let's outline the pattern we have here. We have a government that established a trade union royal commission in order to attack its political opponents. We have a government that's had two royal commissions and summonsed three Labor leaders, two of whom were prime ministers of this country. It is unprecedented that a government would actually set up these executive inquiries and call former Prime Ministers in that way, and yet, of course, that is what this government did. What they did with respect to the trade union royal commission was call the Leader of the Opposition. He sat in the dock for two days; he actually answered 900 questions. There were no findings against the Leader of the Opposition, despite the fact that the commission itself was discredited. It was discredited because we found out that the commissioner of the trade union royal commission was someone who had accepted an invitation to raise money for the Liberal Party at the same time as he was commissioner of the royal commission.


So the reality is this: this is a pattern of behaviour by this government to use state power to attack its political opponents. It did so with the establishment of that trade union royal commission and it's done so now by creating a standing commission, because that's what the Registered Organisations Commission is. It's a standing commission to investigate, ostensibly, registered organisations. But, of all its investigations and inquiries, which one hit the media? Of all the inquiries and investigations of this new body, which investigation was referred by the minister to the commission? Only one, and that is, of course, the one that relates to the allegations made against the AWU in an attempt to smear the federal leader and federal Labor. That is the only matter that's been referred by the minister.


Let's get the chronology right. The Prime Minister and the minister created the Registered Organisations Commission, the minister appointed the regulator of the commission, the minister referred the investigation of this matter to the commission, the minister's office leaked information about the raids of the investigation to the media, and then the minister suggested she had done nothing wrong and the minister suggested that her office had done nothing wrong, and she said so five times in the Senate. She misled the parliament on five occasions. It beggars belief that she did not know what her office was up to in relation to this matter, given the extent to which she was involved from the establishment of the agency to the referral of the investigation and, of course, to the collusion with the media in order to ensure that they elevated this matter by publicly broadcasting the raids.


There is no way that a reasonable person would conclude that the minister has been involved in anything other than gross abuse of ministerial power, and that's why she has to resign. That's why she has to resign: she has misused her office and, indeed, she has breached ministerial responsibility. If she does not resign and the Prime Minister wants to adhere to the Westminster system and ministerial responsibility, he must sack the minister. If he doesn't sack the minister, this government clearly shows it wants to continue this corrupt behaviour.

We've heard some frankly unbelievable claims by those opposite, trotting in here one after the other and sticking up for their union mates, as they do. It's laughable that today's MPI is about proper standards and accountability when those opposite, who claim to represent the workers of Australia, have failed to support our legislation to protect those workers, to protect union funds and to ensure that workplaces are safe. Let's look at our record. The government have done an exemplary job at exposing the criminal and often despicable behaviour of the union movement in this country. We were responsible for the introduction for the ABCC, removing the rotten apples from the building sites and ensuring that the construction sector once again becomes a functioning, workable industry. But did those opposite support that piece of legislation? No, they didn't.



Ms Husar interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER

Ms PRICE:
  What about corrupt payments? Did they support the corrupting benefits legislation? No, they did not. Did they support the government in stamping out under-the-table corrupt payments, criminal payments, from employers and unions? No, they did not. We have also established the Registered Organisations Commission, which was responsible for the recent raid on the AWU that we are discussing here today, but did Labor support that legislation? No, they did not. And why is that? We all know why, because those opposite dance to the tune of the union movement every day, day after day. As sure as night follows day, we know the rules.


It's worth reflecting on why the AFP raided the AWU. The Registered Organisations Commission opened their investigation into the Leader of the Opposition's union last Friday, but such is their experience and others' experience with the union movement, with their arrogance towards the rule of law, that the Registered Organisations Commission believed that, if they had requested the information, the information would have been destroyed. Let that just sink in. It's all quiet now; how wonderful!


How outrageous that those members opposite come in here, day after day, defending those organisations that display such a criminal lack of respect for our laws and our country's institutions that they would potentially destroy damning evidence against the man who wants to be the next Prime Minister! That is why the commission advised the AFP to raid the offices to collect those documents. The raid was conducted because the Registered Organisations Commission thought there was sufficient evidence of union wrongdoing in regard to the opposition leader's donation of $100,000 to GetUp! 10 years ago. That is why the AWU was raided.


But this is not the first instance of unions playing fast and loose with the rule of law, is it? We've seen this year CFMEU bosses in Victoria telling rallies of workers that they would find out where the ABCC inspectors lived and would target their children. Or how about the CFMEU walking off the job at the Lady Cilento Children's Hospital in Brisbane? That caused thousands of dollars in excessive government expenditure—



An opposition member interjecting—




Ms PRICE:
  What? That didn't happen? I'll take that interjection. And it delayed the project. How about the illegal Commonwealth Games industrial action where CFMEU officials threatened a safety inspector?


But don't take my word for it. We've got at least three former Labor prime ministers who have come out to talk about the despicable behaviour of the CFMEU. Kevin Rudd, only two days ago, told the Labor Party it should sever its ties with the CFMEU. Former Prime Minister Bob Hawke said last year that the ALP should sever its ties with the CFMEU, and also former Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating said that the party should reduce the power that the union has over it. I would suggest the current Leader of the Opposition take some advice from his predecessors. So as we, on this side of the House, have all said today, this MPI is truly ridiculous, and those in the Labor Party should hang their heads in shame for the comments they've made in this place today.


Everything we on this side of the House do is about protecting Australian workers. It's about protecting the workplace. It's about protecting their funds. Those opposite do everything in their power to protect the union movement, their union mates, while selling out the union members, as we've seen with the example of the workers at Cleanevent, and we know that they do this to protect their union mates, and we know that it's done to protect the rivers of gold that are given to them to help with their election campaigns. It is shameful that we even have to debate this today, and it is shameful that those opposite do not protect the workers that they claim, day in and day out, that they represent. Shame on you.

Ms ROWLAND
 (Greenway) (15:57):  When it comes to the failures of this government to respect proper standards and accountability, the Prime Minister's track record on the NBN is an absolute pearler. In 2013, this Prime Minister stood up with the then Prime Minister, looked the Australian people in the eye and said that they would deliver a National Broadband Network for $29 billion and have it finished by 2016. He declared that it would be open and it would be transparent. But then the first test came: the December 2013 strategic review. In this report it was revealed that the Prime Minister's multitechnology mix for the NBN had blown out from $29 billion to $41 billion. Did he offer any explanation as to how the high cost of the NBN had become even $12 billion more expensive overnight, or any explanation as to why it would now not be delivered until 2020? He offered no explanation whatsoever. Worse still, if you want to talk about proper standards and accountability, every key assumption in the 2013 strategic review remains redacted and blacked out. So much for the transparency promised by this Prime Minister. Even to this day, this government refuses to release that information.


Then we saw information emerge about further cost blowouts and delays and failures in the rollout with this Prime Minister's multitechnology mix—the rollout that was supposed to be 'faster, sooner and more affordable'. Here are some of the things that we learned. We started to learn about secret trials where the NBN had reduced the cost and time to deploy fibre. We began to hear about the cost of fibre to the node—about how this Prime Minister's copper NBN's cost was blowing out even further. We heard about how the cost of copper remediation had blown out by more than 1,000 per cent. We learned that the HFC network, which the Prime Minister touted as a game-changer, was actually not fit for purpose.


Did we see any transparency and accountability as a result of that? No. I'll tell you what we saw, Mr Deputy Speaker. We saw a raid. We saw an unprecedented AFP raid in the middle of an election campaign in Australia in 2016. We had the NBN chairman then publish a most politically charged opinion piece about that raid, defending the NBN's actions. Bear in mind that this is the hand-picked chairman of the NBN, hand-picked by this Prime Minister. This was despite advice from the nation's top public servant saying that doing so would breach caretaker conventions. Just to quote from an article at the time:


NBN chairman Ziggy Switkowski wilfully breached caretaker conventions during an election campaign and did so against the express advice of the nation's top public servant.


We see the full extent of these failures again revealed in the August 2015 corporate plan, where the NBN again blew out in costs from $41 billion to up to $56 billion. But did we get more transparency? We had scrapped external oversight of the NBN corporate plan.


So we have a project personally undertaken by this Prime Minister, who is so invested in it—the one in which he declared we would have full transparency and openness. We have seen nothing of that. This born-to-rule Prime Minister, who fancies himself as a genius, has been exposed on every front when it comes to the NBN. He has lurched from failure to failure. He was a failure as communications minister. He is a failure as Prime Minister. He stuffed up the National Broadband Network. Just look at the evidence. We dropped from 30th in the world for internet speeds to 50th. There has been a 160 per cent increase in complaints about the NBN from consumers. We are now placed last out of 28 countries in the world for broadband satisfaction. Last! Last in the world. This great Liberal hope, this champion of copper—he coveted the prime ministership his entire life—exposed as nothing more than shallow and glass jawed. In the immortal words of Paul Keating: you light him up, there's a bit of fizz, but then nothing. Nothing. (Time expired)

"Wicks, Lucy, MP",LP,2017-10-26,"



Mrs WICKS
 (Robertson) (16:02):  I'm pleased to speak on this matter of public importance because the people of my electorate on the Central Coast absolutely demand and expect proper standards and accountability from the government. Since the coalition came to government in 2013, including by winning the seat of Robertson, that's exactly what they've got from this government. We have been delivering on every single one of our commitments to my electorate and we can be held accountable to it by the people of Robertson while also being completely up-front about how we are transforming our critical region, which for six long years prior to September 2013 had been woefully neglected by the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd Labor government.


Let's compare and contrast. We're delivering 600 new jobs into Gosford with the ATO, a $45 million investment towards a world-class Central Coast medical school and medical research institute, the new state-of-the-art Woy Woy oval on the Peninsula, and many more projects that I don't have time to mention. The Central Coast, and the seat of Robertson in particular, is now seeing a real uplift thanks to this government. But we need to be fully aware of the flaws and the risks of the approach to accountability and proper standards taken by the members of the Labor Party. Under Labor, we need to ask ourselves: what did our region, the beautiful Central Coast, actually become known for? Do I even need to mention the former Labor member for Dobell, Craig Thomson? Do I need to mention the chaos of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd Labor years, which in Robertson was also reflected in the short-lived stints of Labor representative Belinda Neal—do you know who she is?—and Deborah O'Neill? Do I need to mention the failure to deliver or plan for more local jobs and better infrastructure? Do I need to remind members opposite, including the shadow minister, who ought to remember this, about the big red button that was pushed with great fanfare on Gosford waterfront by the then member for Gosford—




Ms Husar interjecting
—





The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Irons
):  I just remind the member for Lindsay that she's been warned.



Ms Husar interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  You've been warned already during question time, and I'm prepared to get you to leave the chamber if you keep interjecting.




Mrs WICKS:
  Let me just repeat this point, as it's clearly worth remembering: do I need to remind members opposite about the big red button that was pushed with great fanfare by Stephen Conroy and Deborah O'Neill on the Gosford waterfront? They said that fibre to the premise, rolled gold, high-speed broadband was coming to Gosford, only for the poor residents and businesses of Gosford to find out that 90 per cent of homes and businesses couldn't actually connect.


This Leader of the Opposition, just like during his time as a union boss, will say and do anything for the sake of politics while, at the same time, ignoring or brazenly voting against anything that actually delivers the critical reform our nation needs. Labor's approach is to respect its union bosses, ignore the decisions of an independent umpire and have no credible plans for jobs or small businesses. For example, for many years local small businesses have been competing on an uneven playing field against big businesses like Woolworths, McDonald's and KFC, as big businesses have negotiated enterprise agreements with big unions to lower Sunday penalty rates. The Leader of the Opposition has been totally hypocritical on this issue. As a union boss, he cut penalty rates to low-paid workers. The Leader of the Opposition is happy for big businesses and big union leaders to do deals cutting penalty rates, but it appears Labor quickly whistles to a different tune on penalty rates when an independent umpire does it for small business.


The Leader of the Opposition says he's against foreign workers, but his record of granting 457 visas shows that he brought foreign workers in at the expense of Australians looking for work. He said he was in favour of a cut in the company tax rate, but now Labor is opposing the coalition's company tax cut. Labor wants to attack Central Coast's small businesses and their employees by repealing the coalition's enterprise tax cut plans, and yet you can see how the coalition's plan is working. Just look at the fantastic response of local businesses in my electorate to the instant asset write-off. Close to 300,000 Australian small businesses have taken advantage of this, including more than 2,200 in my electorate.


We've got a strong record of delivering on reform, including strong changes in industrial relations, such as protecting firefighters from union takeovers and legislation to restore the rule of law and stop union thuggery in the building and construction sector. We've secured the passage of the corrupting benefits legislation that will bring an end to the dodgy deals done between employers and unions that do nothing to benefit workers, and much, much more. But, sadly, because the Leader of the Opposition always puts politics and his own interests ahead of the national interest, he cannot be trusted to deliver for our nation or for the Central Coast. Labor, it would seem, is short on standards and short on accountability.

"O'Neil, Clare, MP",ALP,2017-10-26,"



Ms O'NEIL
 (Hotham) (16:07):  It has been another shocking week for the government. The NBN is a flaming catastrophe; the budget is in bigger debt than it has ever been. This week the government has been busted massively underfunding the Australian Federal Police. And we've got a minister in the other place who has been shown up for misleading parliament yesterday five times, and probably by the end of the week we'll see a few more ministers out the door.


It is a basic sign of maturity to take responsibility when things go wrong, but that is not what we see from the Prime Minister. In fact, the finger is pointing at anyone he can find. It's Labor's fault. It's the unions' fault. But the biggest bait and switch that has been put this week in parliament, and which I want to speak to today, is the inference that by attacking the government, which as an opposition we are entitled and supposed to justly do, we are somehow attacking the integrity of the Australian Federal Police. That is wrong. I speak on behalf of all my Labor colleagues when I say how incredibly proud we are of the brave men and women who work in this incredible organisation. We represent a lot of people who put on uniforms and do incredible things with their daily work, but it is quite rare to come across a group of people who put themselves in danger, who put themselves in the line of fire, every time they get out of bed and put on a uniform, and go to do work protecting us every single day.


One of the most difficult areas of law that I have responsibility for in my party is the work we do with child exploitation, and that's been discussed this week. The Australian Federal Police are at the front line of that, and just about every other major security threat that we talk about in this parliament. Whether it's terrorism, whether it's the work that we do trying to fight drugs, trying to fight gun importation—all of these things—the Australian Federal Police is absolutely at the epicentre of.


We've heard a lot of frustrated commentary from those on the other side, who are getting up and talking about how much they are enamoured with the work of the Australian Federal Police. I say to those on the other side of the House that, if you were so committed to supporting the brave men and women who protect us on the beat every day, you would probably be making sure that you pay those officers properly. We know that the Australian Federal Police have not had a pay rise for more than two years. That means, in real terms, the people whose work you stand up and laud when you're talking about the incredible work that they do are actually going backwards, and that is because of your government and because of the cuts that you have made to that organisation. Earlier this year, the Australian Federal Police were offered a pay deal which would see them getting a very minimal pay rise; some officers, though, were going to go right backwards in pay, including a set of officers who were going to receive a $35,000-a-year pay cut. The organisation has refused that industrial agreement, but I want to read to you from a letter to the Prime Minister written by the head of the Australian Federal Police Association, Angela Smith. She writes:


As Prime Minister, you take every opportunity to praise the operational successes of AFP employees, yet this adulation rings hollow if those same employees are rewarded by cuts to their pay and entitlements.


Labor has not taken that view. We have fought for those police officers in their pay agreement and we hope that that will get a good outcome.


We saw the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police in estimates this week. I have to say that I feel a lot of sympathy for Commissioner Colvin as he tries to navigate a difficult situation, because the truth is that the government has cut $184 million from this organisation over the coming four years. He revealed in estimates this week that the organisation has lost 117 staff over the last year alone. How can the Prime Minister stand up in question time and say that he is so much in favour of this organisation? He speaks with one voice in this parliament and then he and the Minister for Justice go down to the cabinet room and do something absolutely contrary to those comments, and that is gut this organisation.


This week, the ABC came forward with a memo written by a senior Australian Federal Police officer which showed that, over the last period of time, 23 critical raids have not been properly investigated because the Australian Federal Police does not have the resources to do it. The ABC reported that there was a 1.6-tonne cocaine importation that could not be fully investigated by the Australian Federal Police due to lack of resources.


We are so supportive of this organisation—and we're genuinely supportive of the organisation. I only wish that the government's commentary about the Australian Federal Police was backed up by real support for those officers and funding for that organisation.

"Littleproud, David, MP",Nats,2017-10-26,"



Mr LITTLEPROUD
 (Maranoa) (16:12):  The theatrics of those opposite that we've seen over the last 24 hours are nothing more than a desperate attempt to take attention away from the very core of the issue that we are talking about—the very core of what has happened in the last 24 hours and why those raids were undertaken. The values and principles of the union movement have been shown up because a statutory authority saw fit to raid a union because they failed to provide the information that was required of them. Let's talk about the values and principles of the organisation and their link to the Labor Party. How can you say, in any fairness, that a fair organisation would do that? If they have nothing to hide, then why would they undertake those actions in such a public way? The reality is that this MPI is nothing more than just cheap theatrics to hide the Leader of the Opposition from the questions that he needs to answer about the actions that he took when he was part of the union movement—and the union movement and Labor are so intrinsically tied.


The standards and values of the CFMEU are seen in my home state of Queensland. We're seeing now the actions of the CFMEU at Oakey Creek up in Queensland, where they are saying the most abhorrent things about men's and women's children. You come in here with the sanctimony and the way in which you criticise this side for the way that we handle ourselves, yet you sit there and take money from the CFMEU and you defend the actions of these deplorable human beings who would dare to utter those words. Would you not hold them to account? If you had the morals and the values to stand up to that behaviour, then you should do that today. But you don't. You turn your back—you turn your back on the Australian people and you turn your back on the workers at Oakey Creek.


What a disgrace that you would tie yourself to an organisation that would say deplorable things about children. I'm a father of three young boys and I can tell you I would be absolutely disgusted if someone made those accusations, those assertions, about my children. If you are parents and you look deeply inside your heart instead of putting your heads down in shame, which you should, then you should stand up here today and say that those are not the actions of proper human beings that anybody should be associated with. That is an absolute disgrace to be associated with that sort of action. You should stand up and do that today, as should the Leader of the Opposition, not have a distraction. The Labor Party members are running around trying to distract everybody about the real core of the issues here, about the values and principles of the union movement in this country.


But let's think about what could happen if the Labor Party were to be put into parliament. Let's think about what impacts that would have on our nation, the absolute deplorable state that we will see in our economy and the values and principles that they will bring.



Ms Madeleine King interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order. The member for Brand has had a fair say.




Mr LITTLEPROUD:
  She has, Mr Deputy Speaker. These are the sorts of values and principles that they want to defend and they cannot defend those actions. The reality is, if we were lumbered with a Labor government after the next election, we would see these values and principles trickle down through our nation and that is not something that we can allow to happen.


Finally, because of the work that we in the government have done, we are pulling the economic levers to get growth within this nation. Over 800,000 jobs have been created on our watch. We are pulling the economic levers that are creating jobs. But because those opposite are so intrinsically tied to the union movement, because they are so part of the union movement, because they are part of the values and principles of the labour movement, they cannot understand how an economy works and they will bring those values and principles of big government. Those opposite don't understand that if you empower your nation, if you give people the environment and the infrastructure to create wealth and to create the jobs, they will do it for our nation because they are good people who understand what a hard day's work will do for them and for this nation. They are the principles and values this side uphold, every day of the week. Those low union movements that come out and attack children in this day and age are deplorable.


I'm proud to say that we on this side will hold firm on this. We will make sure that we won't be distracted from where we need to go in isolating the union movement and the actions that they've undertaken over the last years. This is something I'm proud to say that we will continue, despite the theatrics that we see from those opposite.

  I present the response. In the first ministerial statement on veterans and their families, I set out a challenge to the veteran and ex-service organisations to provide a response with a single voice. While this is not a response from all sections or all ex-service organisations, I commend those who have contributed to this response and their engagement with the government on my statement. The government thanks the Defence Force Welfare Association and the Alliance of Defence Service Organisations, including the RSL, for providing me with this response. It is a very good first step in engaging and representing the views of the wider veterans community. The same will be done next year, and I look forward to tabling a response and also outlining the government's position on this response that the ex-service organisations have provided the government.

Ms HUSAR
 (Lindsay) (16:25):  Labor supports the genuine, intuitive policies that acknowledge the problems and opportunities that are unique to remote and discrete communities. Because of the tireless efforts of Jenny Macklin and Linda Burney, we understand that a cashless debit system may be part of a solution. While I mention Linda Burney's name, I would just like to pass on my sincere condolences to my colleague Linda and thank her for all of her work and efforts in making sure that this system is got right. It's a shame that she isn't here today, but I am very privileged to stand up and honour the work that she's been doing.


We also understand that most people are quite capable of managing their own incomes. It is vital that we understand that it can be only a part of and not a holistic answer to complex historical problems. These problems vary from community to community, country to country and state to state. There is no one-size-fits-all answer. We need to develop the levers that provide access to support when and where it is suitable: programs that address alcohol and drug-related problems, not empty promises and half-baked attempts that may be more likely to hinder and not help. We need to listen to communities to find out what assistance they require and to tailor programs to suit specific localities. We also need to empower people to help themselves. One size does not fit all.


That is one of the reasons that Labor does not support a nationwide rollout of the cashless debit card. I also note that Labor only supported the rollout of the cashless debit card in 2015 after extensive consultation and the promise of additional programs designed to work in partnership with the trials. This position was decided after—and only after—consultation with community leaders. The development of a memorandum of understanding with the Ceduna community was also critical to this process.


At this point I note that some community leaders in Kununurra have changed their position on the card due to the lack of support programs wrapping around and actually working in their communities. We support local community action in delivering tailored programs that suit their needs: programs that complement the objectives of the cashless debit card. This is considered vital for the success of any trial. We need to understand the reasons for the shift in support in Kununurra.


I turn to the cost of these trials undertaken so far. As we have previously heard, the government has spent around $18.9 million on the East Kimberley and Ceduna trials alone. We believe the Senate inquiry will reveal whether this money has been well spent, but that is an extraordinary amount of money. It is also hoped this will shed light on the $7.9 million paid to Indue to manage the payment system. Surprisingly, ORIMA Research was funded to the tune of $1.6 million for research that in the opinion of many has questionable value as either indicator or research tool.


We rightly question the reason why this legislation is being brought forward when there are still so many questions that need to be answered. The 2016 census tells us that Australia's Indigenous population has grown by 17.4 per cent since 2011. That's an estimated 3.3 per cent of our total population, an estimated just under 800,000 people who are concerned about the implications of a rollout of a cashless debit card system. We need to be mindful of the implications of those trials and the psychological impact they have on every single Indigenous person, regardless of where they live. It is imperative that we take the actions of previous governments into account when we are discussing serious amendments, such as the one before the House today. It is also important to note that these populations are centred in the major cities, particularly in electorates like mine in Lindsay.


The impact of these trials is surely an underlying worry for many people in how they view their future. These are people who have suffered and have been hurt by our collective actions, however well-intentioned they may have been. These people need to be reassured of our commitment to the implementation of effective education, rehabilitation and training programs as essential. They are essential to ensure that the inequity, suspicion and historical dislocation is addressed in ways that are well researched, well resourced and effectively delivered.


While we know that most people have the ability to self-manage their incomes, we also understand that some people need a hand. Whether extending the rollout of the cashless debit card is the answer is yet to be fully understood. Labor is committed to consulting widely in the Hervey Bay and Goldfields areas. I reiterate that we mean proper consultation that includes working together with communities to ensure they get the programs they need and desire, and not lecture them. We will not lecture the communities we visit, but we will commit to listening, discussing and acting.

 (Macquarie) (16:30):  Some wonderful artists and writers were honoured this weekend in the Blue Mountains at the 25th Blue Fringe Arts Awards. These began as the Adrienne Brown Awards in 1992, in honour of Adrienne, who had schizophrenia and who found relief through her love of poetry, the arts and music. Her family recognised the valuable role that artistic expression played in their daughter's life, and from this emerged the Blue Fringe Arts Festival. Anyone who has a lived experience of a mental health issue is able to enter, and there are art, sculpture, photography, textiles and writing prizes.


The festival has an organising committee which includes representatives from Aftercare; Neighbourhood Centres across the mountains, including Springwood and Katoomba; Ability Links; and TAFE, as well as volunteers from the community and the artists themselves. They're generously supported by sponsors from local businesses including Botanical Art, Vivability, Bendigo Bank, Belle Property Leura, Mountain High Pies, Richards Financial Services and Blue Mountains Explorer bus.


The works were diverse and glorious, and I am the very proud owner of a beautiful charcoal piece called Shoal Bay Sunset by a young artist, Alan Bridges, which won the People's Choice Award and is now in my Parliament House office. Congratulations to all the artists involved and thanks to volunteers and sponsors for a quarter of a century of this important event.


I have just been talking about one of the many important roles our local Wentworth Falls TAFE plays in our community, as the host venue for the Blue Fringe Arts Awards. My electorate of Macquarie includes the Wentworth Falls and Katoomba TAFEs, specialising in things like outdoor education, hospitality and community health, and Richmond TAFE, which has a huge equine training capacity as well as venomous snakes training, landscaping, plus much more.


TAFE is one institution that has taken a battering in recent years, but it is vital to Australia having a skilled workforce and vital for people in the Blue Mountains and Hawkesbury to access further education. When Labor left office in 2013, there were around 420,000 apprentices; now it is 280,000. The population has grown, and yet apprentice numbers have fallen. Nationally, there was a 30 per cent cut in government-funded training at TAFE between 2013 and 2016.


TAFE teachers and students past and present tell me TAFE is in serious danger if changes are not made soon. In spite of the constant undermining of their positions, the dedicated TAFE teachers have hung in there, putting the needs of their students at the forefront. Let's talk about the students. The stories they tell me are inspiring, about how attending TAFE has helped them feel better about themselves, especially if they've been out of the workforce because of illness or because of caring for someone else. It has helped them feel more confident about their skills and helped them feel more motivated to seek work. TAFE gives people a second chance. We know it can transform lives.


We need to make sure it keeps doing this long into the future in a way that prepares people for future employment. We need to work with business and industry to ensure that alongside trade skills students get to solve problems, collaborate and create. They need great facilities to do that in and their teachers need to be recognised for the contribution that they make. I'm very fortunate to have in my electorate the New South Wales President of the TAFE Teachers Association, Annette Bennett. We are well aware of what needs to know done. We need to make sure TAFE is better at meeting the emerging needs of the 15- to 25-year-olds as they transition from school to work. We need to better meet the additional needs of students who have a disability or come from disadvantaged backgrounds so they can participate in an equal educational opportunity. We need to better address the needs of special equity groups such as Aboriginals, migrants and women returning to work or looking to participate in the Australian workforce.


Labor will do what needs to be done. For a start, Labor will return to vocational education and training the $637 million that was cut in the last budget. We have announced that we will secure funding for vocational education and training and ensure that at least two-thirds of it will go to the most trusted provider in the country, and that is TAFE. The remainder will go to only the very best providers in the private sector, because, at the heart of it, we need TAFE. It does more than any other educational institution in this space.

Ms MADELEINE KING
 (Brand) (10:00):  Mr Phillips is an 84-year-old constituent who has contacted my office on numerous occasions during his efforts to have a landline connected to his property. This might sound like overkill—a member of parliament being asking to help have a landline connected—but, through no fault of his own, Mr Phillips needs all of the help he can get. He is an 84-year-old. He moved to a new, smaller home on 4 September this year. He did everything required to ensure his services were connected to his new home. On 2 August he filled in the paperwork with Telstra for the landline at his old house to be disconnected and for a landline to be connected to his new home on 4 September. On 12 September, six weeks after he had filled in the required paperwork, Mr Phillips advised me that he had visited his local Telstra store four times to ask for the landline to be connected to his new home, in Calista. Telstra advised that a technician would attend Mr Phillips's new home on 18 September to install a landline. This was pushed out to 21 September. On 28 September, Mr Phillips attended my office again, distressed as Telstra still had not connected a landline. A technician had attended his home the day before but did not put the phone in the socket, and Mr Phillips was afraid to do this himself.


Telstra has advised us that the landline appeared to be working and a phone number had been issued and all that was needed was for Mr Phillips to insert the phone in the socket. My staff member had to go Mr Phillips's home with her own telephone to try Mr Phillips's phone and the second phone in the socket. Neither one connected and no dial tone was available. Telstra again told us that either NBN had taken over the area or the developer had not provided the wiring needed and the matter would be escalated. We were advised that on 10 October a technician would attend Mr Phillips's home on 13 October to install the landline. On 17 October, Mr Phillips once again visited my office, because he is still waiting for a technician to install a landline. Telstra has advised that the problem with installing a telephone for my 84-year-old constituent is that the area in Calista in which he lives has been handed off to NBN Co, and, whenever a provider processes an order for a new connection for a landline in this area, NBN immediately cancels the order.


To add insult to injury NBN is not scheduled to roll out in Calista until 2020. So we have Telstra trying to organise a service for Mr Phillips, with NBN knocking them back each time. Failure to install a landline in three months means he has to wait a further two to three years for a landline phone. This is 2017. Is this what the Prime Minister calls having the NBN rollout in hand. This government is a train wreck. It wrecks everything it touches, and the NBN is its champion disaster. I have listened to government members in this place, Liberals and Nationals, and they are unbelievable. They yell out across the chamber, 'I've got the NBN. My NBN is fine!' Jolly good, job done! Put your feet up and take a load off! Have a break! For God's sake, fix the NBN, fix this mess and do your job.

Mr HART
 (Bass) (10:44):  The intent of the Australian Grape and Wine Authority Amendment (Wine Australia) Bill 2017 is to mitigate some of the unfortunate consequences of the Turnbull government's decision to reduce the wine equalisation tax—the WET—rebate in their 2016 budget. In the 2016 budget, the Turnbull government announced two major changes to the WET: the reduction of the rebate cap from $500,000 to $350,000 and a declaration that only wine producers with a financial interest in a winery can claim the rebate. 


Reformation of the WET was long overdue. There was evidence that the system was being rorted by bulk and unbranded operators and creative entity structuring in order to access the rebate. The Winemakers' Federation of Australia said that it was compromised on three fronts: firstly, the ability of brokers, intermediaries and uncommercial arrangements to access the entitlement; secondly, the role of the rebate in delaying the correction of the supply and demand imbalance by underpinning the conversion of uncommercial grapes into bulk wine and ultimately low-equity cleanskins and home brands; and thirdly, the ability of New Zealand entities to access the entitlement on unfair preferential terms.


Reducing the perceived rorting of the WET rebate is something that certainly required attention. Unfortunately for the industry, the Turnbull government also saw it as an opportunity for a revenue grab—a tax grab that has hit the bottom line of winemakers very hard. The government initially planned to pocket $300 million from the first reform proposal that was put forward. Following significant industry backlash and expressions of concern from Labor, the government backed down and went back to the drawing board. This legislation is the result. The government still plans to pocket $160 million as a result of the reforms and the implementation of this industry support package.


The bill does a number of things. Firstly, it will formally change the name of the authority previously responsible for industry regulation, the Australian Grape and Wine Authority, to Wine Australia. It will also enable Wine Australia to implement all program activities under the Export and Regional Wine Support Package, including for the purposes of cider and international wine tourism. It will enable Wine Australia to administer grant programs for wine, including the cellar door grant. The grant programs are necessary to enable transition for wine, including from the previous scheme, but those programs may not be enough for transition. The wine support package and the cellar door grant were announced by the government in an attempt to allay fears from the industry to assist them in transitioning to their reforms of the WET. The wine support package will allocate $50 million for an export and regional wine support package. The program will allow entities with below $20 million annual turnover to claim 50 per cent of their promotional activities up to a cap of $50,000.


This fund unfortunately is limited, and the money will be allocated on a first-in best-dressed basis. It is also limited to marketing promotion in China, Hong Kong, Macau and the United States. There will be $10 million allocated for a wine tourism and cellar door program. This is a cash grant program allocated in part on the amount of sales at the cellar door. It is also capped and, if oversubscribed, every successful applicant's grant will be reduced by the proportion necessary to bring all applicants under the cap.


This WET legislation is of particular significance to my home state of Tasmania. I consider myself most fortunate not only to live in my electorate of Bass but also to represent an area of northern Tasmania that has a focus on wine, food and tourism. The Tasmanian wine industry is unique within Australia; 100 per cent of the product is premium product. That attention to detail—that focus on premium product—and the cellar door experience have also infected or transferred to the craft beer industry. I know there is a real and sensible link between the production of craft beer and tourism, but I think most people concede that the cellar door experience, particularly a cellar door experience in Tasmania, provided much of the inspiration for the potential represented by craft beer.


My electorate is blessed with some of the best sparkling wine in Australia, if not some of the best sparkling wine in the world, potentially. This has been recognised by some of the oldest producers of sparkling wine in Europe, who have chosen to establish or acquire vineyards in northern Tasmania. The acclaim for Tasmanian wine is widespread. For example, James Halliday, in the 2014 Australian Wine Companion, said that the best sparkling wines are now predominantly sourced from Tasmania. Anthony Rose, in the Independent, from the United Kingdom, said that Tasmania is rapidly becoming Australia's 'little Champagne'. Nevertheless, most of the producers within Tasmania are small producers. Some of the largest Australian wine producers do operate within Tasmania, but all of their product that is grown within Tasmania is premium product.


Whilst Labor recognises and supports the necessity for amendments within this legislation, particularly the changes made to the WET, it is very important, particularly for the premium producers of wine within my home state of Tasmania, to acknowledge and recognise that a disproportionate burden is imposed on the small premium producers as a consequence of this legislation. Eighty per cent of Tasmanian product derives from approximately 20 producers. The small producers in particular, as I said, will be hit very hard. There is a disproportionate effect of a reduction of the rebate for a small producer. While it might be the case that a very large producer of wine can absorb the reduction in rebate, notwithstanding that there is some financial effect across the whole industry, it is obvious, as a matter of financial necessity, that a small producer will be disproportionately disaffected. 


While the government seeks to ameliorate the effect of the reduction of assistance with the introduction of these grants programs, this in turn requires the parliament to take the government on trust that the grants program will be effectively run with the stated aim of supporting regional producers. These programs need to be well designed and money must be allocated on a merits basis. Labor will be watching this process closely. 


I can tell you that there has been considerable disquiet in the industry as a result of this process. Quite appropriately, the industry has asked whether the elements of this package align with the strategic focus of Wine Australia. That question has yet to be answered. The peak representative wine bodies within the states of South Australia, New South Wales, Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia have submitted a joint response to the draft grant guidelines. The organisations have been actively involved in discussions and consultation regarding the changes and are very keen to ensure that the grants programs are successful and that they support the long-term repositioning of their members in the Australian wine sector more broadly. This is essential for the premium wine industry of Tasmania. 


The cellar door and wine tourism grants are good in principle. However, the state wine organisations are very concerned about the impact of the proposed grant processes on organisational cash flow and the overall profitability of wine businesses. The potential impact on a wine business is that it would lose up to $150,000 from the bottom line immediately following the rebate reduction in 2018-19; yet it will not be able to access any additional top-up grant of $100,000 until November 2019. That is, of course, assuming the administration of the grant program will be effective and efficient. 


In addition to this, there is uncertainty over the potential for over-subscription, which must create additional pressure on financial planning and performance of the small businesses. Put another way, the grant programs which are designed to support regional producers need to recognise the potential effect of the withdrawal or reduction of the rebate and the potential difficulties in replacing at least a portion of that funding through the grant program. Again, the Export and Regional Wine Support Package is good in principle, but, as a response to the financial effect of the reduction of the rebate, the effect is still to be determined. The intention is that this will be restricted, and the competitive grants program is designed to support a collaborative, strategic approach towards attracting and maximising international wine tourism. 


The various state wine organisations have specific strategies and priorities which have been developed in partnership with their respective members and, I understand, the regional associations. The state wine associations may be in the best position to determine what will be the appropriate activities to support their members in their regions, particularly where these regions are negatively impacted by these and other changes. It is obvious, therefore, that any grant oversight and/or assessment process, to be effective and responsive, will need to have very good and clear insight into the views of the state wine organisations. The various state wine organisations are not-for-profit and are supported, in the main, by wine producers. As a consequence there may be difficulty with the proposed co-contributions which are proposed within the draft grant guidelines. I urge the government to work with the state wine organisations to ensure that the state wine organisations are able to access the funds which are intended to support their members for trade and tourism outcomes which are for the benefit of the wider industry and, of course, our regional communities. The proposed wine export grants are likely to be very quickly exhausted, according to industry feedback. It will be most appropriate that the government put in place real-time updates with respect to approved and pending applications so that the individual businesses can determine whether it's appropriate or not to submit a particular application. 


As I indicated earlier, Tasmania produces high-value wines, and when sold domestically they are taxed on their value at 29 per cent. The change to the WET rebate disproportionately affects Tasmania's wine producers, dominated by small premium producers. The state's wine industry has projected that production could triple over the next five years. I've been speaking with producers in my electorate who have had to question decisions on expansion and hiring plans as a direct consequence of this government's decision. The small to medium wineries, as I indicated earlier, will be most impacted by this. Rebecca and Tim from Holm Oak Vineyards in the Tamar Valley have put their expansion plans on hold. Shane and Fran from Delamere Vineyards, who have six full-time staff, have raised a number of concerns with respect to maintaining their current staffing levels.


Tasmania is proactive in marketing itself as a place to invest in the wine industry, particularly at the premium end. My home state enjoys and celebrates a national and international reputation as a leading producer of premium cool climate wines. The state consistently wins high praise, not to mention an array of medals from wine judges and critics alike. Industry and government need to work together to facilitate the expansion of the industry and further develop our reputation in wine and food tourism. The industry is seen as a priority sector with excellent growth prospects. Successive Tasmanian governments have consistently argued the case for securing value-added investment within the state.


Taxation measures, like these taxation measures, often affect behaviour of consumers and businesses, and these measures are no different. The initial proposal for the reduction of the rebate was, quite correctly, rejected. The two funds created as part of the rebate reforms—the $50 million Export and Regional Wine Support Package and the $10 million Wine Tourism and Cellar Door Grant program—are both necessary and appropriate. Labor supports them. It is, nevertheless, essential that the government does the hard work, in consultation with the industry at the national and state levels, to ensure that the administration of the grant program is effective. This is necessary to ensure that those who are disproportionately affected by the changes to the rebate receive appropriate assistance in transitioning to the new regime.


The premium wine industry in my state of Tasmania is now part of the identity of Tasmania. It has built a well-deserved reputation for excellence and innovation. The small producers need to have their voices heard through the state-based wine organisation—in this case, Wine Tasmania—and their interstate counterparts. It is also most important that the strategic focus of the grant program is aligned with the strategic focus of Wine Australia so that there is no inconsistency between the application of funds and the strategic interests of the industry as a whole.


This is very important legislation, particularly as it affects my home state. As I've said on a number of occasions, we have a predominantly premium based industry made up of small wine producers. Those small wine producers need an effective transition program. The transition program might not be so effective if those grant programs are not administered correctly. The government must continue to talk to the wine industry organisations at both state and national levels. It's essential for the reputation of Wine Australia that these programs are effective in transitioning to the new WET regime. This industry is too important in my home state to fail. It is a focus of industry expansion for the future. These taxation measures can't put any limitation on those expansions.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2017-10-26,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (10:58):  I welcome this opportunity to speak on the Australian Grape and Wine Authority Amendment (Wine Australia) Bill 2017. The bill will enable the authority to implement all program activities under the wine support package; it will enable the authority to administer grant programs for wine, including the cellar door grant; and it will change the name of the authority from the Australian Grape and Wine Authority to Wine Australia.


I've got a significant interest in wine, not just because I like to imbibe it but also because my sister is an internationally renowned winemaker—she is Australia's first female Master of Wine—and there are fabulous wineries in the capital region around Canberra. Now, it's a relatively young wine industry. While South Australia and Victoria were already established as wine regions by the end of the 1800s, Canberra had a few small, fairly unremarkable vineyards planted near Yass. Our fortunes changed when we had the great honour of our CSIRO scientists and other academics getting involved in the local wine industry. Dr Edgar Riek, a pioneer of the region, planted vineyards in 1971. He had a distinguished academic background, as many of the founders in the capital region wine district had, and he saw the potential in the region as a premium wine-growing area. He started the Canberra District Vignerons Association and instigated the National Wine Show, which is arguably the country's most important wine show. 


After Riek's initial plantings at Lake George in the early 1970s, others soon followed. International award-winning scientist John Kirk established Clonakilla in 1971. Ken and Judith Helm started their vineyard and winery in 1973—the famous Helm Wines. Like Kirk and Edgar Riek, Ken Helm has been instrumental in putting Canberra district, capital region, wines on the map with the cool-climate international riesling challenge that he conducts every year. It draws hundreds of people from all around the country and also from all around the world to the Canberra region. It is a very prestigious competition. Ken Helm has been the driving force behind it. We have a cool climate here, and we specialise in cool-climate wines. This is why Ken Helm has been a major driver of the riesling challenge and cool-climate wines more generally. 


In 1978, Sue and Dave Carpenter planted vines at Lark Hill winery at Bungendore. A decade later, Mount Majura's first vines were planted. In 1997, inspired by Riek, Jim Lumbers established Lerida Estate at Lake George, adjacent to Riek's original vineyard. There are many other winemakers in Canberra who are now producing wines. Bryan Martin, who was an assistant winemaker at Clonakilla estate, has used his expertise to establish Ravensworth at Mawson. Microwinery Eden Road shot to fame in 2009, winning the Jimmy Watson Trophy for its 2008 Hilltops Shiraz and the Best New Winery at the inaugural Sydney Morning Herald'sGood Wine awards in 2010. Guiding Eden Road wines is winemaker Nick Spencer. As many here in the chamber would know, Nobel Laureate and Vice-Chancellor of the Australian National University—none other than Professor Brian Schmidt—has established his vineyard, Maipenrai, at Sutton. His pinot noir has wowed the fans. Mount Majura was established in 1991 by winemaker Frank van de Loo, who has also been producing award-winning wines, particularly chardonnays, ever since. 


As I said, Canberra is well-known now around the world for producing internationally-renowned, award-winning wines—award-winning cool-climate wines. We are very proud of the winemakers here in the capital region. It is yet another reason to come to Canberra. As we heard this week, there are many reasons to come to Canberra. I've always known that Canberra is the best place in the world. I've always known that it is the best place in Australia to visit. We had that confirmed this week with Lonely Planet's Best in Travel 2018 nominating Canberra as one of the top three cities to visit in the world in 2018. I am not saying that it should be limited to 2018. I am saying: come on down to Canberra any year, because it is the best place in the world. Unfortunately, we came behind Seville and Detroit. In my view, we should have been ranked No. 1. That said, this ranking is the highest that has ever been achieved by an Australian city.


Lonely Planet's travel experts compile the top cities list based on strict criteria including topicality, excitement, X factor and unique experiences. For Canberra, next year is such a unique and exciting year, and the events our city will host include the 100th anniversary of the World War I Armistice, at the Australian War Memorial, which will be an extraordinary commemoration; and the first cricket test match at Manuka Oval. Both of these venues are in my wonderful electorate of Canberra.


We're claiming to be one of the coolest little capitals, and we are the coolest little capital because we offer a rich history; amazing world-leading design elements that are based on the principles of democracy, transparency and openness; culture and entertainment; world-class national institutions; and something for every type of traveller. The Lonely Planet website rightfully states that Canberra is 'criminally overlooked' and 'packs a punch' for the small city that we are.


Canberra boasts expansive open spaces, as we know, with those huge, gorgeous skies that are blue and beautiful even when it is about minus 10 degrees. Unlike other cities where it's grey in summer and grey in winter, it is blue sky for a lot of the time here in Canberra, even in winter. So we have these beautiful open spaces overlooking the Brindabellas, the ranges that you can see from every corner of our wonderful city. We have popular attractions, including this very building—this beautiful, iconic, Giurgola-designed building. We've got Questacon, Floriade and the Old Bus Depot Markets. The list goes on and on.


Countless new and modern places to eat and drink have followed the revitalisation of areas like Braddon and New Acton, and these suburbs add to the establishment of our hip and contemporary style. As we are talking about imbibing, I just want to mention we also are home to craft beers BentSpoke, Pact, Capital and Tortured Gum; craft beer taverns and breweries, as in the Wig & Pen; and craft gins and spirits, with Underground Spirits and the Canberra Distillery. Most of these breweries and distilleries are in my electorate. I want to give a shout-out to BentSpoke, who recently made it into the top 10 of GABS Hottest 100 Aussie Craft Beers. There is also Zierholz, in Fyshwick. 


This announcement by Lonely Planet adds further hopes of connecting Canberra internationally and encouraging tourists to visit Canberra, our nation's capital, which has so much to offer. Like all Canberrans, I cannot wait to welcome the world to our fabulous nation's capital.


Finally, as I mentioned earlier in my speech, my sister Meg is Australia's first female Master of Wine, an extraordinary achievement and one of which I am very proud. She's a winemaker who has travelled all around the world for the last 25 years, since she graduated with her degree from Roseworthy. She brought to my attention, when she was here just recently, the significant challenges that women in the wine industry still face. We know that women are increasingly moving into the wine industry. Women make up 50 per cent of winemaking and viticulture graduates, but women comprise only 10 per cent of the Australian wine industry workforce. So, even though 50 per cent of the graduates in this area are women, women are only 10 per cent of the workforce. With Australian wine exports now topping $2.3 billion, at June 2017, and the wine industry providing a major source of employment, particularly in regional and rural Australia, this is simply unacceptable. 


A survey of women in the wine industry by wine identity Jane Thomson last year revealed that 42 per cent of women knew or believed they were being paid less than their male counterparts. Two-thirds of women replied that they'd experienced sexist behaviour in the workplace, and one in four women had endured unfair treatment in regards to pregnancy, sick children or maternity leave. A quarter of the respondents believed that they did not have equal career opportunities in their workplaces. I know that my sister Meg and a number of women are getting together now to bring these shocking statistics to people's attention—because they are quite shocking, given the fact that women make up 50 per cent of graduates in this area but only 10 per cent of the actual wine industry workforce.


The wine industry has to change. That starts with shining a light on the lack of diversity. That is why this survey Jane Thomson has conducted is especially useful. We need to be asking the questions: why is female representation so much better overseas than in Australia? Why the lack of national and international recognition and exposure of Australian female winemakers? Why is there no critical mass of women on wine-judging panels? Why the dramatic attrition rate? We are talking about this extraordinary attrition rate just from graduation. Why the limited career paths? Why the perception that winemaking is a male industry?


We need to institute change, and that's why I welcome the Australian Women in Wine Awards that were held last month at Australia House in London. I commend the women who took out those awards. I'll just quickly run through a few of them. Winemaker of the Year was Virginia Willcock from Vasse Felix. Viticulturist of the Year was Jennifer Doyle from Jansz. Owner/Operator of the Year was Sarah Collingwood from Four Winds Vineyard. Workplace Champion of Change was Professor Eileen Scott from the University of Adelaide. Cellar Door Person of the Year was Jasmine Morgan from Caudo Vineyards. Researcher of the Year was Dr Christine Bottcher from CSIRO. Marketer of the Year was Ebony Tinkler from Usher Tinkler Wines.


These awards are a great way of shining a light on the achievements of female winemakers from Australia and on the fact that so many women are going overseas. We have got a huge brain drain in female talent here, because the opportunities and exposure just aren't here. The acknowledgement is just not here. That is why it is important that the Australian Women in Wine Awards are highlighting these achievements and focusing attention on the issue of the lack of diversity in this industry and the fact that we have so many women leaving Australia to go and work overseas. My sister was a classic example. As I said, she spent most of her early career working in France, Germany, South America, the UK and Eastern Europe. That was because the opportunities, particularly as a young graduate, just weren't there. She became what is known as a 'flying winemaker'. These awards are fantastic. They are acknowledging the achievements of Australian winemakers. It is unfortunate they actually have to take place overseas.


But what is happening at the domestic level also needs to be acknowledged. My sister has joined with a number of women from the Yarra Valley wine area to set up Yarra Valley Wine Women. Again, it is designed to highlight the achievements of women in this area. We've got more than 150 wine brands, 85 cellar doors and 65 wine production facilities. Within this pool is a group of women winemakers challenging the statistics of the industry average. Fortunately, there seems to be a critical mass there. This group manage 12 per cent of those 150 wine brands and have a collective 200 years experience in the industry. I say to those in the wine industry: I am watching, I will be calling this out and I will be shining a light on this issue. This is not the last conversation I will be having about the lack of diversity in the Australian wine industry.

"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",Nats,2017-10-26,"



Mr HARTSUYKER
 (Cowper—Assistant Minister to the Deputy Prime Minister) (11:13):  The Australian Grape and Wine Authority Amendment (Wine Australia) Bill 2017 amends the Australian Grape and Wine Authority Act 2013 to facilitate wine and cider tourism and cellar door development activities. These amendments are part of the reforms to the wine equalisation tax, WET, to bring greater integrity to the WET debate. As part of these reforms, the government is investing in a $50 million Export and Regional Wine Support Package and a $10 million investment in the Wine Tourism and Cellar Door Grant scheme. These were changes originally driven by industry. The government has consulted extensively with the wine and cider industries through the national and state wine associations on the development of the WET rebate reforms, the wine support package and the cellar door grant scheme.


The bill enables the authority to administer and fund all aspects of the wine support package and the cellar door grant scheme. The bill will also enable industry to refocus greater attention on the export and tourism markets, both internationally and domestically, through cellar door sales, which offer it the greatest opportunity for growth and sustainability. The bill also changes the name of the authority from the Australian Grape and Wine Authority to Wine Australia. The bill is important to industry and it is important that the parliament supports the industry in its endeavours to increase wine exports and international wine tourism. 


Question agreed to.


Bill read a second time.


Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment.

Reducing the perceived rorting of the WET rebate is something that certainly required attention. Unfortunately for the industry, the Turnbull government also saw it as an opportunity for a revenue grab—a tax grab that has hit the bottom line of winemakers very hard. The government initially planned to pocket $300 million from the first reform proposal that was put forward. Following significant industry backlash and expressions of concern from Labor, the government backed down and went back to the drawing board. This legislation is the result. The government still plans to pocket $160 million as a result of the reforms and the implementation of this industry support package.


The bill does a number of things. Firstly, it will formally change the name of the authority previously responsible for industry regulation, the Australian Grape and Wine Authority, to Wine Australia. It will also enable Wine Australia to implement all program activities under the Export and Regional Wine Support Package, including for the purposes of cider and international wine tourism. It will enable Wine Australia to administer grant programs for wine, including the cellar door grant. The grant programs are necessary to enable transition for wine, including from the previous scheme, but those programs may not be enough for transition. The wine support package and the cellar door grant were announced by the government in an attempt to allay fears from the industry to assist them in transitioning to their reforms of the WET. The wine support package will allocate $50 million for an export and regional wine support package. The program will allow entities with below $20 million annual turnover to claim 50 per cent of their promotional activities up to a cap of $50,000.


This fund unfortunately is limited, and the money will be allocated on a first-in best-dressed basis. It is also limited to marketing promotion in China, Hong Kong, Macau and the United States. There will be $10 million allocated for a wine tourism and cellar door program. This is a cash grant program allocated in part on the amount of sales at the cellar door. It is also capped and, if oversubscribed, every successful applicant's grant will be reduced by the proportion necessary to bring all applicants under the cap.


This WET legislation is of particular significance to my home state of Tasmania. I consider myself most fortunate not only to live in my electorate of Bass but also to represent an area of northern Tasmania that has a focus on wine, food and tourism. The Tasmanian wine industry is unique within Australia; 100 per cent of the product is premium product. That attention to detail—that focus on premium product—and the cellar door experience have also infected or transferred to the craft beer industry. I know there is a real and sensible link between the production of craft beer and tourism, but I think most people concede that the cellar door experience, particularly a cellar door experience in Tasmania, provided much of the inspiration for the potential represented by craft beer.


My electorate is blessed with some of the best sparkling wine in Australia, if not some of the best sparkling wine in the world, potentially. This has been recognised by some of the oldest producers of sparkling wine in Europe, who have chosen to establish or acquire vineyards in northern Tasmania. The acclaim for Tasmanian wine is widespread. For example, James Halliday, in the 2014 Australian Wine Companion, said that the best sparkling wines are now predominantly sourced from Tasmania. Anthony Rose, in the Independent, from the United Kingdom, said that Tasmania is rapidly becoming Australia's 'little Champagne'. Nevertheless, most of the producers within Tasmania are small producers. Some of the largest Australian wine producers do operate within Tasmania, but all of their product that is grown within Tasmania is premium product.


Whilst Labor recognises and supports the necessity for amendments within this legislation, particularly the changes made to the WET, it is very important, particularly for the premium producers of wine within my home state of Tasmania, to acknowledge and recognise that a disproportionate burden is imposed on the small premium producers as a consequence of this legislation. Eighty per cent of Tasmanian product derives from approximately 20 producers. The small producers in particular, as I said, will be hit very hard. There is a disproportionate effect of a reduction of the rebate for a small producer. While it might be the case that a very large producer of wine can absorb the reduction in rebate, notwithstanding that there is some financial effect across the whole industry, it is obvious, as a matter of financial necessity, that a small producer will be disproportionately disaffected. 


While the government seeks to ameliorate the effect of the reduction of assistance with the introduction of these grants programs, this in turn requires the parliament to take the government on trust that the grants program will be effectively run with the stated aim of supporting regional producers. These programs need to be well designed and money must be allocated on a merits basis. Labor will be watching this process closely. 


I can tell you that there has been considerable disquiet in the industry as a result of this process. Quite appropriately, the industry has asked whether the elements of this package align with the strategic focus of Wine Australia. That question has yet to be answered. The peak representative wine bodies within the states of South Australia, New South Wales, Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia have submitted a joint response to the draft grant guidelines. The organisations have been actively involved in discussions and consultation regarding the changes and are very keen to ensure that the grants programs are successful and that they support the long-term repositioning of their members in the Australian wine sector more broadly. This is essential for the premium wine industry of Tasmania. 


The cellar door and wine tourism grants are good in principle. However, the state wine organisations are very concerned about the impact of the proposed grant processes on organisational cash flow and the overall profitability of wine businesses. The potential impact on a wine business is that it would lose up to $150,000 from the bottom line immediately following the rebate reduction in 2018-19; yet it will not be able to access any additional top-up grant of $100,000 until November 2019. That is, of course, assuming the administration of the grant program will be effective and efficient. 


In addition to this, there is uncertainty over the potential for over-subscription, which must create additional pressure on financial planning and performance of the small businesses. Put another way, the grant programs which are designed to support regional producers need to recognise the potential effect of the withdrawal or reduction of the rebate and the potential difficulties in replacing at least a portion of that funding through the grant program. Again, the Export and Regional Wine Support Package is good in principle, but, as a response to the financial effect of the reduction of the rebate, the effect is still to be determined. The intention is that this will be restricted, and the competitive grants program is designed to support a collaborative, strategic approach towards attracting and maximising international wine tourism. 


The various state wine organisations have specific strategies and priorities which have been developed in partnership with their respective members and, I understand, the regional associations. The state wine associations may be in the best position to determine what will be the appropriate activities to support their members in their regions, particularly where these regions are negatively impacted by these and other changes. It is obvious, therefore, that any grant oversight and/or assessment process, to be effective and responsive, will need to have very good and clear insight into the views of the state wine organisations. The various state wine organisations are not-for-profit and are supported, in the main, by wine producers. As a consequence there may be difficulty with the proposed co-contributions which are proposed within the draft grant guidelines. I urge the government to work with the state wine organisations to ensure that the state wine organisations are able to access the funds which are intended to support their members for trade and tourism outcomes which are for the benefit of the wider industry and, of course, our regional communities. The proposed wine export grants are likely to be very quickly exhausted, according to industry feedback. It will be most appropriate that the government put in place real-time updates with respect to approved and pending applications so that the individual businesses can determine whether it's appropriate or not to submit a particular application. 


As I indicated earlier, Tasmania produces high-value wines, and when sold domestically they are taxed on their value at 29 per cent. The change to the WET rebate disproportionately affects Tasmania's wine producers, dominated by small premium producers. The state's wine industry has projected that production could triple over the next five years. I've been speaking with producers in my electorate who have had to question decisions on expansion and hiring plans as a direct consequence of this government's decision. The small to medium wineries, as I indicated earlier, will be most impacted by this. Rebecca and Tim from Holm Oak Vineyards in the Tamar Valley have put their expansion plans on hold. Shane and Fran from Delamere Vineyards, who have six full-time staff, have raised a number of concerns with respect to maintaining their current staffing levels.


Tasmania is proactive in marketing itself as a place to invest in the wine industry, particularly at the premium end. My home state enjoys and celebrates a national and international reputation as a leading producer of premium cool climate wines. The state consistently wins high praise, not to mention an array of medals from wine judges and critics alike. Industry and government need to work together to facilitate the expansion of the industry and further develop our reputation in wine and food tourism. The industry is seen as a priority sector with excellent growth prospects. Successive Tasmanian governments have consistently argued the case for securing value-added investment within the state.


Taxation measures, like these taxation measures, often affect behaviour of consumers and businesses, and these measures are no different. The initial proposal for the reduction of the rebate was, quite correctly, rejected. The two funds created as part of the rebate reforms—the $50 million Export and Regional Wine Support Package and the $10 million Wine Tourism and Cellar Door Grant program—are both necessary and appropriate. Labor supports them. It is, nevertheless, essential that the government does the hard work, in consultation with the industry at the national and state levels, to ensure that the administration of the grant program is effective. This is necessary to ensure that those who are disproportionately affected by the changes to the rebate receive appropriate assistance in transitioning to the new regime.


The premium wine industry in my state of Tasmania is now part of the identity of Tasmania. It has built a well-deserved reputation for excellence and innovation. The small producers need to have their voices heard through the state-based wine organisation—in this case, Wine Tasmania—and their interstate counterparts. It is also most important that the strategic focus of the grant program is aligned with the strategic focus of Wine Australia so that there is no inconsistency between the application of funds and the strategic interests of the industry as a whole.


This is very important legislation, particularly as it affects my home state. As I've said on a number of occasions, we have a predominantly premium based industry made up of small wine producers. Those small wine producers need an effective transition program. The transition program might not be so effective if those grant programs are not administered correctly. The government must continue to talk to the wine industry organisations at both state and national levels. It's essential for the reputation of Wine Australia that these programs are effective in transitioning to the new WET regime. This industry is too important in my home state to fail. It is a focus of industry expansion for the future. These taxation measures can't put any limitation on those expansions.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2017-10-26,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (10:58):  I welcome this opportunity to speak on the Australian Grape and Wine Authority Amendment (Wine Australia) Bill 2017. The bill will enable the authority to implement all program activities under the wine support package; it will enable the authority to administer grant programs for wine, including the cellar door grant; and it will change the name of the authority from the Australian Grape and Wine Authority to Wine Australia.


I've got a significant interest in wine, not just because I like to imbibe it but also because my sister is an internationally renowned winemaker—she is Australia's first female Master of Wine—and there are fabulous wineries in the capital region around Canberra. Now, it's a relatively young wine industry. While South Australia and Victoria were already established as wine regions by the end of the 1800s, Canberra had a few small, fairly unremarkable vineyards planted near Yass. Our fortunes changed when we had the great honour of our CSIRO scientists and other academics getting involved in the local wine industry. Dr Edgar Riek, a pioneer of the region, planted vineyards in 1971. He had a distinguished academic background, as many of the founders in the capital region wine district had, and he saw the potential in the region as a premium wine-growing area. He started the Canberra District Vignerons Association and instigated the National Wine Show, which is arguably the country's most important wine show. 


After Riek's initial plantings at Lake George in the early 1970s, others soon followed. International award-winning scientist John Kirk established Clonakilla in 1971. Ken and Judith Helm started their vineyard and winery in 1973—the famous Helm Wines. Like Kirk and Edgar Riek, Ken Helm has been instrumental in putting Canberra district, capital region, wines on the map with the cool-climate international riesling challenge that he conducts every year. It draws hundreds of people from all around the country and also from all around the world to the Canberra region. It is a very prestigious competition. Ken Helm has been the driving force behind it. We have a cool climate here, and we specialise in cool-climate wines. This is why Ken Helm has been a major driver of the riesling challenge and cool-climate wines more generally. 


In 1978, Sue and Dave Carpenter planted vines at Lark Hill winery at Bungendore. A decade later, Mount Majura's first vines were planted. In 1997, inspired by Riek, Jim Lumbers established Lerida Estate at Lake George, adjacent to Riek's original vineyard. There are many other winemakers in Canberra who are now producing wines. Bryan Martin, who was an assistant winemaker at Clonakilla estate, has used his expertise to establish Ravensworth at Mawson. Microwinery Eden Road shot to fame in 2009, winning the Jimmy Watson Trophy for its 2008 Hilltops Shiraz and the Best New Winery at the inaugural Sydney Morning Herald'sGood Wine awards in 2010. Guiding Eden Road wines is winemaker Nick Spencer. As many here in the chamber would know, Nobel Laureate and Vice-Chancellor of the Australian National University—none other than Professor Brian Schmidt—has established his vineyard, Maipenrai, at Sutton. His pinot noir has wowed the fans. Mount Majura was established in 1991 by winemaker Frank van de Loo, who has also been producing award-winning wines, particularly chardonnays, ever since. 


As I said, Canberra is well-known now around the world for producing internationally-renowned, award-winning wines—award-winning cool-climate wines. We are very proud of the winemakers here in the capital region. It is yet another reason to come to Canberra. As we heard this week, there are many reasons to come to Canberra. I've always known that Canberra is the best place in the world. I've always known that it is the best place in Australia to visit. We had that confirmed this week with Lonely Planet's Best in Travel 2018 nominating Canberra as one of the top three cities to visit in the world in 2018. I am not saying that it should be limited to 2018. I am saying: come on down to Canberra any year, because it is the best place in the world. Unfortunately, we came behind Seville and Detroit. In my view, we should have been ranked No. 1. That said, this ranking is the highest that has ever been achieved by an Australian city.


Lonely Planet's travel experts compile the top cities list based on strict criteria including topicality, excitement, X factor and unique experiences. For Canberra, next year is such a unique and exciting year, and the events our city will host include the 100th anniversary of the World War I Armistice, at the Australian War Memorial, which will be an extraordinary commemoration; and the first cricket test match at Manuka Oval. Both of these venues are in my wonderful electorate of Canberra.


We're claiming to be one of the coolest little capitals, and we are the coolest little capital because we offer a rich history; amazing world-leading design elements that are based on the principles of democracy, transparency and openness; culture and entertainment; world-class national institutions; and something for every type of traveller. The Lonely Planet website rightfully states that Canberra is 'criminally overlooked' and 'packs a punch' for the small city that we are.


Canberra boasts expansive open spaces, as we know, with those huge, gorgeous skies that are blue and beautiful even when it is about minus 10 degrees. Unlike other cities where it's grey in summer and grey in winter, it is blue sky for a lot of the time here in Canberra, even in winter. So we have these beautiful open spaces overlooking the Brindabellas, the ranges that you can see from every corner of our wonderful city. We have popular attractions, including this very building—this beautiful, iconic, Giurgola-designed building. We've got Questacon, Floriade and the Old Bus Depot Markets. The list goes on and on.


Countless new and modern places to eat and drink have followed the revitalisation of areas like Braddon and New Acton, and these suburbs add to the establishment of our hip and contemporary style. As we are talking about imbibing, I just want to mention we also are home to craft beers BentSpoke, Pact, Capital and Tortured Gum; craft beer taverns and breweries, as in the Wig & Pen; and craft gins and spirits, with Underground Spirits and the Canberra Distillery. Most of these breweries and distilleries are in my electorate. I want to give a shout-out to BentSpoke, who recently made it into the top 10 of GABS Hottest 100 Aussie Craft Beers. There is also Zierholz, in Fyshwick. 


This announcement by Lonely Planet adds further hopes of connecting Canberra internationally and encouraging tourists to visit Canberra, our nation's capital, which has so much to offer. Like all Canberrans, I cannot wait to welcome the world to our fabulous nation's capital.


Finally, as I mentioned earlier in my speech, my sister Meg is Australia's first female Master of Wine, an extraordinary achievement and one of which I am very proud. She's a winemaker who has travelled all around the world for the last 25 years, since she graduated with her degree from Roseworthy. She brought to my attention, when she was here just recently, the significant challenges that women in the wine industry still face. We know that women are increasingly moving into the wine industry. Women make up 50 per cent of winemaking and viticulture graduates, but women comprise only 10 per cent of the Australian wine industry workforce. So, even though 50 per cent of the graduates in this area are women, women are only 10 per cent of the workforce. With Australian wine exports now topping $2.3 billion, at June 2017, and the wine industry providing a major source of employment, particularly in regional and rural Australia, this is simply unacceptable. 


A survey of women in the wine industry by wine identity Jane Thomson last year revealed that 42 per cent of women knew or believed they were being paid less than their male counterparts. Two-thirds of women replied that they'd experienced sexist behaviour in the workplace, and one in four women had endured unfair treatment in regards to pregnancy, sick children or maternity leave. A quarter of the respondents believed that they did not have equal career opportunities in their workplaces. I know that my sister Meg and a number of women are getting together now to bring these shocking statistics to people's attention—because they are quite shocking, given the fact that women make up 50 per cent of graduates in this area but only 10 per cent of the actual wine industry workforce.


The wine industry has to change. That starts with shining a light on the lack of diversity. That is why this survey Jane Thomson has conducted is especially useful. We need to be asking the questions: why is female representation so much better overseas than in Australia? Why the lack of national and international recognition and exposure of Australian female winemakers? Why is there no critical mass of women on wine-judging panels? Why the dramatic attrition rate? We are talking about this extraordinary attrition rate just from graduation. Why the limited career paths? Why the perception that winemaking is a male industry?


We need to institute change, and that's why I welcome the Australian Women in Wine Awards that were held last month at Australia House in London. I commend the women who took out those awards. I'll just quickly run through a few of them. Winemaker of the Year was Virginia Willcock from Vasse Felix. Viticulturist of the Year was Jennifer Doyle from Jansz. Owner/Operator of the Year was Sarah Collingwood from Four Winds Vineyard. Workplace Champion of Change was Professor Eileen Scott from the University of Adelaide. Cellar Door Person of the Year was Jasmine Morgan from Caudo Vineyards. Researcher of the Year was Dr Christine Bottcher from CSIRO. Marketer of the Year was Ebony Tinkler from Usher Tinkler Wines.


These awards are a great way of shining a light on the achievements of female winemakers from Australia and on the fact that so many women are going overseas. We have got a huge brain drain in female talent here, because the opportunities and exposure just aren't here. The acknowledgement is just not here. That is why it is important that the Australian Women in Wine Awards are highlighting these achievements and focusing attention on the issue of the lack of diversity in this industry and the fact that we have so many women leaving Australia to go and work overseas. My sister was a classic example. As I said, she spent most of her early career working in France, Germany, South America, the UK and Eastern Europe. That was because the opportunities, particularly as a young graduate, just weren't there. She became what is known as a 'flying winemaker'. These awards are fantastic. They are acknowledging the achievements of Australian winemakers. It is unfortunate they actually have to take place overseas.


But what is happening at the domestic level also needs to be acknowledged. My sister has joined with a number of women from the Yarra Valley wine area to set up Yarra Valley Wine Women. Again, it is designed to highlight the achievements of women in this area. We've got more than 150 wine brands, 85 cellar doors and 65 wine production facilities. Within this pool is a group of women winemakers challenging the statistics of the industry average. Fortunately, there seems to be a critical mass there. This group manage 12 per cent of those 150 wine brands and have a collective 200 years experience in the industry. I say to those in the wine industry: I am watching, I will be calling this out and I will be shining a light on this issue. This is not the last conversation I will be having about the lack of diversity in the Australian wine industry.

"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",Nats,2017-10-26,"



Mr HARTSUYKER
 (Cowper—Assistant Minister to the Deputy Prime Minister) (11:13):  The Australian Grape and Wine Authority Amendment (Wine Australia) Bill 2017 amends the Australian Grape and Wine Authority Act 2013 to facilitate wine and cider tourism and cellar door development activities. These amendments are part of the reforms to the wine equalisation tax, WET, to bring greater integrity to the WET debate. As part of these reforms, the government is investing in a $50 million Export and Regional Wine Support Package and a $10 million investment in the Wine Tourism and Cellar Door Grant scheme. These were changes originally driven by industry. The government has consulted extensively with the wine and cider industries through the national and state wine associations on the development of the WET rebate reforms, the wine support package and the cellar door grant scheme.


The bill enables the authority to administer and fund all aspects of the wine support package and the cellar door grant scheme. The bill will also enable industry to refocus greater attention on the export and tourism markets, both internationally and domestically, through cellar door sales, which offer it the greatest opportunity for growth and sustainability. The bill also changes the name of the authority from the Australian Grape and Wine Authority to Wine Australia. The bill is important to industry and it is important that the parliament supports the industry in its endeavours to increase wine exports and international wine tourism. 


Question agreed to.


Bill read a second time.


Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment.

"Hart, Ross, MP",ALP,2017-10-26,"



Mr HART
 (Bass) (12:31):  I rise today to honour and reflect upon the life and influence one of Tasmania's leaders in education, Bruce Leslie Fairfax, who became tragically lost in bushland this month. There are many debates in this place about the transformative power of education. There is not enough said of, too few words offered for and not enough recognition of the educators who inspire and mould young brains, making learning fun, challenging stereotypes and preparing young people for the wider world and, most importantly, for an uncertain future. Sometimes popular culture goes close to identifying the special relationship and the special responsibility of a great teacher to his or her students. An example might be Robin Williams's performance in Dead Poets Society. One thing I can be certain of is that Bruce Fairfax was regarded by all who encountered him as an inspiring teacher for over three decades at Launceston Church Grammar School.


Bruce Fairfax was appointed as Director of Studies at Launceston Church Grammar School in 1988. Prior to that he taught at the Armidale School and Canberra Grammar. He was a master English scholar. He taught religion and philosophy. Like many who excel where others only serve, it was the manner of his contribution and the mastery of his subject and his rapport with his students that distinguished his role as a teacher.


I have a particular personal interest, having served on the board of Launceston Church Grammar School, and my son of the class of 2014 was taught by Bruce Fairfax. I've read many tributes from former students. They have been fulsome in their praise of Bruce Fairfax. I asked my son to collate a few of the observations from his peers in the class of 2014. From Jesse, 'I remember us having really off-topic, heated discussions about so many things, and then thinking we learnt nothing. But then you come to do assessments and realise the questions here and there point the conversation in the right direction and you knew exactly what you were on about'. From Warwick, 'It was quite common to see him not standing at the front the classroom but sitting amongst it or casually leaning on some furniture and listening to us speaking. In hindsight it feels like he spent most of the class listening, very occasionally steering conversation.' From Frances, 'He once out-ran me to the chapel. He would have been 63. He had a holistic approach to teaching which taught us as much about life as it did the topic of our study. Also I remember chatting with him about different running routes, which radio programs to listen to, current affairs, bushwalking adventures, good books and even chocolate slice recipes'. From Steven, 'He knew that learning was not teaching you how to do well in exams or getting honours degrees. He encouraged the pursuit of knowledge in whatever form it came. I also have fond memories of him breaking out into fluent Old English or some medieval language, at various stages.'


He was chief examiner of matriculation TCE English studies, a life member of the Tasmanian debating society, and he coached numerous parliamentary-shield-winning debating teams. Indeed, Bruce Fairfax would probably lament the standard of some of the contributions in this place, given the expectations and standards he often set for his students.


He is fondly remembered as a kindly, friendly man of integrity, always generous and always patient, but remaining spirited. He was directed by an unwavering internal compass, boldly directed towards doing what was right, something that was recognised by his students. These are qualities which are better imparted to others through conduct and observation rather than instruction. Each of us knows instinctively that greatness as a leader comes from being able to bring out the best in everyone. Bruce possessed this quality and used it to inspire all he encountered, whether students, colleagues or friends. It is significant that he remained a mentor to many students beyond their time at the school. 


He loved nature. He was a keen bushwalker. He refused to be limited by his Parkinson's disease, which he developed about a decade ago. He worked around and within that limitation. He is survived by his loving wife Louise. They were a remarkable couple, given that Louise is an accomplished orienteer, trail runner, bushwalker and mountain runner. They have two adult daughters, Yelena and Kirsten, and two granddaughters. He was reported missing on a walk to Duckhole Lake, one of Tasmania's 60 great walks. Over 60 people searched unsuccessfully for him. Staff, including the headmaster, of Launceston Church Grammar School, drove overnight to the south of the state to assist in the search. 


This was a man who left an indelible imprint on the school he served for over three decades. More importantly, he inspired generations of students, who loved to learn because of him. My deepest condolences are offered to Louise, Yelena and Kirsten. Vale Bruce Fairfax. He was an educator and inspiration to many.
