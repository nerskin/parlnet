"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2006-08-08,"—The last time this matter was before the Senate I had just started the summing-up speech for the second reading debate. For those who may be interested—I am not sure that all that many are—that was on 11 May 2006. The amendments in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Amendment Bill 2005 [2006] will ensure that Australians continue to have opportunities to see in Australia significant Indigenous cultural heritage objects that are owned by institutions overseas. The amendments will encourage international cultural exchanges. They will remove an uncertainty that would discourage overseas institutions from ever allowing items from their collections to be exhibited in Australia.
The amendments to the act will also provide for the repeal of the Victoria-specific provisions of the act, including the scheme for Victoria alone that is set out in part IIA of the act. In 1987 the act was extended to include provisions that would apply only in Victoria, at the request of the Victorian government of the day. These provisions now prevent new Victorian legislation for Aboriginal heritage protection coming into effect. The Victorian government wrote to the Australian government in 2005 to explore how this obstacle could be removed. All other states and territories have legislation to protect this heritage. The amendments remove the obstacle to Victorian legislation and allow a sensible sharing of roles and responsibilities for the protection of cultural heritage in Victoria. The proposal is sensible for the Australian government and for Victoria, and for more comprehensive and coordinated administration of Aboriginal cultural heritage in Australia. Following repeal of the Victoria-specific provisions the Australian government legislation will provide the same level of protection in Victoria that it provides for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage in other parts of Australia.
Senators Carr, Bartlett and Siewert all made the point that this bill does not fully address the recommendations made by the Evatt report. The government stands by its commitment to introduce improved legislation in this area in line with many of the Evatt report recommendations. In addition, Senator Siewert proposed several amendments to the bill. Senator Siewert’s first amendment seeks to exempt some instruments in this bill from the sunsetting provisions of the Legislative Instruments Act by amending the Legislative Instruments Act. This amendment is not needed because the exemption that Senator Siewert is referring to has been sought through regulations to the Legislative Instruments Act. The Department of the Environment and Heritage has already asked the Attorney-General’s Department to include declarations under sections 10 and 12 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 in regulations to the Legislative Instruments Act so that these will be exempted from the sunsetting provisions. This is the preferred approach to exempting instruments under the Legislative Instruments Act.
The second amendment proposed by Senator Siewert seeks to provide a review of the repeal of part IIA of the act. This would in effect amount to a review of the Victorian government legislation. A review of the effectiveness of the repeal would not serve a substantial purpose. As mentioned earlier, on repeal of the Victorian provisions the act will apply in the same way to Victoria as it does to the other states and territories. Justice Elizabeth Evatt reported on a broader review of Indigenous heritage protection in August 1996, and the government sees this as a much more sensible approach. The government will continue to consult with Indigenous groups and other stakeholders about Indigenous heritage protection.
I indicate to honourable senators that my friend and colleague Senator Chris Ellison will be doing the committee stages of the bill, for which I thank him. Having said that, I urge all honourable senators to support the bill.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2006-08-08,"—My question is to Senator Coonan, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. I refer the minister to the collapse of Telstra’s plans to roll out a fibre to the node network. Does the minister accept that Australia needs a significant fibre broadband infrastructure investment to bring the country back into line with our international competitors? Isn’t it true that the reason for the collapse of these talks was, in the words of Telstra executive Phil Burgess, the government’s confused, inconsistent and ultimately counterproductive telecommunications policies? As the minister for communications, will the minister finally accept responsibility for Australia’s status as a broadband backwater and for the government’s complete lack of policy for turning this situation around?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1,question
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2006-08-08,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Is the minister aware of recently released national broadband targets which suggest that 80 per cent of Australians will need to have access to 10 megabits per second broadband by 2010 in order for the economy to remain internationally competitive? Doesn’t this document call for ‘significant and meaningful changes in attitude and leadership from the government and policymakers’? In light of the collapse of Telstra’s fibre to the node plans, when will the minister, in her confused broadband policies, change her attitude and provide the leadership that is needed for Australia to remain competitive?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1,question
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2006-08-08,"—Thank you to Senator Conroy for the question. I must say that I am disappointed that Telstra has pulled out of talks with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission about the regulation of fibre to the node, which Telstra had proposed to roll out to five major cities. I think that is really the point, that there are a couple of furphies about the rollout of fibre. The first is, of course, that the fibre rollout would not have benefited all Australians, as has been claimed from time to time, but was only slated for major metropolitan cities, not even for big regional cities such as Wollongong and Newcastle. It would not even have been in Darwin under the current proposal. The reality is that the fibre proposal is certainly not the only game in town here.
Telstra did cite the ACCC’s alleged unwillingness to recognise the actual costs of Telstra’s fibre to the node investment as a reason for this breakdown. In fact, when setting access prices, the regulatory regime is very clear that the ACCC is required by law to take into account the costs of the investment and the legitimate commercial interests of the infrastructure owner, including the investment risk faced by the owner, and the need to provide incentives for investment. The ACCC has assured the government that it has always been prepared to consider both fair and reasonable access terms, as indeed it is legally obliged to do.
As to Senator Conroy’s suggestion that this proposal was only going to be rolled out to major centres, where there is already competition in any event, I think it is a real furphy that somehow or other Australia is placed in some kind of broadband impasse. Telstra could, for instance, start to use its longstanding investment in ADSL 2 Plus technology equipment in its exchanges which can deliver high-speed broadband to about 80 per cent of the population. It is important to note that several telecommunications experts estimate that at least 55 per cent of Australians already have access to very fast fixed broadband today, via either ADSL 2 Plus—and there are nine companies, nine competitors, who are rolling out ADSL 2 Plus—or over cable broadband. When Telstra switches on its ADSL 2 Plus network, which should be imminent, the number will of course rise exponentially.
Where the competitive rollout of high-speed broadband will make a significant difference will be in relation to the government’s Broadband Connect policy: $1.1 billion earmarked to ensure that where Telstra would not have gone in any event with this fibre to the node rollout there will in fact be competitive infrastructure programs by some competitors. An expressions of interest proposal that has been put out by me has received 70 submissions, with some very innovative and quite exciting combinations of technologies designed to deliver these kinds of outcomes for rural and regional Australia, where under no circumstances would the fibre to the node proposal that Telstra had on the table have benefited all Australians. So the most important points are that not all Australians would have benefited under the fibre proposal, there are already multi-megabit speeds available in those markets and the government is getting on with delivering competition and solutions in rural and regional Australia.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1,answer
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2006-08-08,"—What would of course help would be if Senator Conroy would stop trying to join some Greek chorus and actually understand what this is all about. The only thing that Labor have ever come up with is to try to piggyback on Telstra’s proposal and then raid the Communications Fund of $2 billion to try and get a leg-up to provide some assistance to rural and regional Australia. That has all fallen very flat now, hasn’t it? And of course we have not got anything from Labor. Their policy proposal, if you could call it that, is in absolute ruins. This government will get on to ensuring that there is equitable broadband for all Australians.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1,answer
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2006-08-08,"—My question is directed to Senator Ian Campbell, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage. Can the minister confirm that in September 2004, just prior to the last election, he issued a press release in which he stated:
The people of Gippsland who are opposed to the Bald Hills wind project should carefully consider their vote if they want a say in the future of their local area with respect to wind farms ...
Can the minister also confirm that after the election he tried to justify blocking Bald Hills on the grounds that ‘the special problem they’ve got here is that the state government have chosen to remove planning controls from local councils’? Don’t these statements show that the minister’s opposition to the Bald Hills wind farm had nothing to do with orange-bellied parrots and everything to do with marginal seat electioneering? Did the minister spend 450 days searching for an excuse to block the Bald Hills project—an excuse which eventually came in the form of a parrot?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Wind Farms</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,question
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2006-08-08,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Given that answer, Minister, can you confirm that in April this year you threatened to ‘unilaterally extend federal powers’ to allow you to veto wind farm proposals on the grounds of local opposition? Given the minister’s failure to get any state to agree to his national code, will the minister now carry out that threat? Minister, can you now explain to the Senate exactly what powers you will be unilaterally extending and what section of the Constitution you will be relying on?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Wind Farms</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,question
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2006-08-08,"—The answer, broadly speaking, is no.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—I have said in answer to another question from—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—It is just a dead duck. It is not a dead parrot; it is a dead duck.
—Order! Senator Carr and other senators on my left, the minister has had nine seconds to speak and immediately we have this tirade from my left. I ask you to come to order and allow the minister to answer the question.
—In answer to a question from one of Senator Faulkner’s comrades I have said that the Australian Department of the Environment and Heritage advised that we should get a report on cumulative impacts. That report identified four birds that would be at risk through wind farm development. They include wedge-tailed eagles. That is the species that Mr Hulls used to stop a wind farm at Ballan only a few months ago, even though the report that he relied on and the report that I relied on said that wedge-tailed eagles are in fact abundant and, although they will get killed by wind turbines, they are resilient enough and in large enough numbers not to be threatened by them.
—Not in Tasmania.
—Not in Tasmania, Senator Brown. Before you joined us, I was advising the Senate that three wedge-tailed eagles in Tasmania have been killed in the last three months—one a month, when the predictions that were done showed that only one a year would die. The Victorian government’s report said to Mr Hulls—this is the secret report he refuses to release—that you should take a conservative approach to these critically threatened species. The report also looked at the white-bellied sea eagle. It said that, yes, white-bellied sea eagles will get killed by these blades but, again, the species is abundant enough for that not to threaten that species any further. It also looked at the swift parrot and said that although swift parrots will be killed by these blades—and the prediction is that over 100 birds a year will be killed—they were resilient enough and abundant enough not to be threatened. In relation to the orange-bellied parrot, there are only 50 breeding pairs left in the world. It is a species that is described by the Victorian government’s own department, on its website, as being in as precarious a state as the Siberian tiger and the polar bear. This report said that wind farms would hasten the extinction of that species.
We know that Labor have all sorts of problems on climate change policy. You have had a backflip from Mr Beazley in relation to climate change policy. We know that renewable energy can make a contribution to solving the issue of climate change. We know that wind power can make a contribution. My view, however, is that if you want to develop wind power successfully in Australia you ensure that local communities have a say in it. You do not do as Mr Hulls has done in Victoria and as Ms MacTiernan is doing in Western Australia: ride roughshod over the views of local communities. I think it is incredibly important that local communities have a say in this, particularly if, for every two wind turbines you see turning in Gippsland now you will see five under the Latham-Beazley policy of support for wind farms.
That is a fact. It is not politics; it is a fact. Under the Latham-Beazley model you will get five wind turbines for every two under the Liberals’ policy. That is the reality. If Senator Faulkner wants to call that politics, he can call it what he wants, but that is a reality. The people of Gippsland are very concerned about their landscape. They are very concerned about their unique Australian flora and fauna. The reality is that you can save threatened species and have a climate change policy that stops the impact of greenhouse gas emissions. You can actually do both if you take a constructive approach and do not play politics with it, as Labor has done on this.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Wind Farms</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,answer
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2006-08-08,"—I have made it quite clear to the states that if you want to build a climate change policy that has wind as part of the renewables response to it, you cannot have state Labor governments continuing to ride roughshod over the views of local communities. You need to engage them.
In Western Australia, the new Minister for the Environment, Mr McGowan, said at a recent meeting of environment ministers: ‘Sometimes you have got to roll over the local community’—as he sought to do in the town of Denmark in Western Australia, and as Mr Hulls has done in Gippsland. He said to local communities, ‘You cannot have a say.’ The approach is to build a set of guidelines to ensure that communities have a say in the future of their communities. We know that Labor is opposed to that. We know that, down in Gippsland, for every two wind turbines that will be built under this government, they will build five. And they will do it without any reference to the views of local communities.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Wind Farms</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,answer
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2006-08-08,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage (Senator Ian Campbell) to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today relating to the proposed wind farm at Bald Hills, Victoria.
What we saw in question time today was the minister’s attempt to defend his complete public humiliation last Friday when confronted with a court process that called into question his totally politically charged decision to knock over a wind farm proposition. What we saw as a result of the court hearings was that the minister was forced to accept a settlement which said that he would reconsider his decision according to law, the clear implication being that the first decision was not determined according to law but was a decision made according to politics—base politics that the minister pursued.
The minister today wanted to discuss the Victorian government, the WA government and something to do with the Supreme Court building in Victoria. He also discussed John Faulkner’s period as environment minister. Distinguished though it was, that did not seem to me to be all that relevant to the minister having to publicly explain why he put in a political fix, why he misused and abused his role as environment minister and why he sought to put political considerations in front of his obligations as a minister of the crown.
The minister’s behaviour in relation to the Bald Hills application for a wind farm is a sorry tale. He spent 450 days in search of a dead parrot. Here are the numbers on this issue: the minister was told that you would get one dead parrot in 1,000 years and that in the 10,000 sightings made when surveying the area they had not found one orange-bellied parrot—they had sighted 10,000 birds but not one parrot. What we know is that although this application was denied he approved 800 other turbines around the coast. While 800 turbines were approved, the Bald Hills application was knocked over—and this is despite the fact that a lot of these turbines were in areas where there is a genuine risk to the orange-bellied parrot and where there have been sightings and are breeding grounds.
What is at the heart of this is that for 450 days the minister refused to make a decision. Why? Because he was in search of an excuse. He was required under the act to make a decision within 30 days, but he took 450 days. From October 2004 until April this year he refused to make a decision. Why? Because he was looking for a justification to knock over the application.
What do we know? We know that every piece of advice that he got said that there was no justification for knocking back the application. His department and the scientific advice all said one thing: ‘There is no basis for you to refuse this application.’ The best he could do was to dredge up a dead parrot and say, ‘There is some minute risk to a parrot, and that is my justification for knocking off this one application.’ He approved 800 other turbines on the basis of the same sort of advice. He did not even require some applications to come to him. But he intervened in this case to ensure that this application did not go ahead.
Why? What was the only thing on the record that would support his decision? I give the minister credit for this, because he is honest in the sense that he honoured a political promise to the people of McMillan. He said before the election when writing to the electors that he would not allow that application to go ahead. Without any evidence and without any consideration for his role as minister he promised that it would be stopped. And you have to give him his dues: he did stop it. He put in the political fix. It took him 450 days to find the dead parrot to use as his excuse, but he finally found that and he hung the decision on that.
What we know is: at the first whiff of court action, he was humiliated. He had to withdraw and pay the legal costs of the other side because his advice was that he did not have a case. Now he has had to commit to going back and reconsidering his decision. It is a humiliating backdown, and what it shows is that he is not fit to be the minister for the environment. No-one—not industry, not the environmental community—can have any confidence in the decision-making processes, because they know that he will put a political fix in front of proper decision making.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Wind Farms</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,5,1,speech
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2006-08-08,"—How quickly petrol prices and interest rates vanish from the Labor Party’s perspective when there is a little bit of cheap politics to engage in. There they are bleating about petrol prices and interest rates, and today’s question time focuses on the orange-bellied parrot. My goodness! The credentials of this minister render him as one of the best environment ministers that this country has ever seen.
On the issue of whales alone, right around Western Australia there are people who make livings from whale watching and dolphin swimming. They are in electorates in regional Australia, electorates that the opposition does not know of or understand. In taking the stand that he has on so many environmental frontiers, he has assured the jobs of very many regional Australians in particular. He brings an energy and an enthusiasm to this portfolio, in utter and stark contrast to the environmental ministers in each of the states of our great country.
I want to draw attention to the fact that in Western Australia we have a scandalous environmental situation. Indeed, it is very timely that Senator Evans has led this debate in taking note of answers to questions. Since 2001, when the Labor Party took over in Western Australia, 4.2 million litres of raw sewage have gone into the Swan River. Not one single charge has flowed from that. This is because the previous environmental minister had absolutely no idea. One thing I can say about Senator Ian Campbell that is very important is that he is responsive to people and communities. That is a concept that, sadly, the opposition have in recent times not come to terms with.
Let me highlight how absolutely stupid the minister in Western Australia was. The minister had an EPA licence for the Midland brickworks.
—What does this have to do with parrots?
—This illustrates how good Labor’s environmental credentials are. The minister failed to read the licence properly and allowed the Midland brickworks to emit hydrogen fluoride to a level five times greater than the licence permitted, because she applied the licence across the five kiln stacks instead of to the whole plant. Since 2004 the people of Midland have been exposed to this absolutely outrageous toxicity from the Midland brickworks because the Labor Party’s environmental minister in Western Australia could not read plain English. And the Labor Party have come in here today and said that Senator Campbell is in error!
In Western Australia, under the EPA—which virtually controls and locks up the whole of Western Australia—it takes 13 to 18 months to issue an EPA licence to a local small Western Australian shire to make road alterations. To clean up the verge of a road, you have to have an EPA licence in Western Australia, and it takes the EPA 13 to 18 months to issue that licence.
Let us have a look at the sorts of credentials the opposition bring to the table here. There is a raging debate throughout Australia with respect to the location of wind farms and turbines. One of the most important things that any federal minister can do is listen to community concerns and look at the environmental impact of those developments. Looking at what has happened in Western Australia, heaven help Australia if there were to be the same level of ineptitude, complete stupidity and gross incompetence replicated by having those on the opposite side of this chamber elected to government. It would be absolutely frightening. It would be a nightmare. Thank heavens for Senator Ian Campbell.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Wind Farms</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,5,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2006-08-08,"—I also rise to take note of Senator Ian Campbell’s contribution in question time today. If there were any remaining doubt that Senator Ian Campbell has disgracefully abused his position as Minister for the Environment and Heritage, that doubt was buried today under the pile of parrot droppings that the Senate has been subjected to. For months, Senator Campbell has spuriously claimed to be the defender of the orange-bellied parrot. Today, he effectively gave the Senate the bird. He denied the undeniable. He refused to accept that he has been caught out abusing his powers under environmental laws to protect a Liberal Party mate. The facts are now plain for the whole world to see. He has distorted the scientific evidence, he has squandered taxpayers’ money and he has undermined valuable investment in renewable energy.
In the run-up to the 2004 election, the minister, Senator Campbell, made it clear that he would do all he could to protect Russell Broadbent, the endangered Liberal Party candidate for McMillan. Senator Campbell told the voters of McMillan that he had ‘undoubted powers’ to veto the wind farm. He made no mention at that time of the orange-bellied parrot. Nevertheless, Senator Campbell was confident that he would find some legal basis for intervening. He gave voters a nod and a wink—‘Elect Mr Broadbent and I’ll stop this project.’ The problem for Senator Campbell is that the law actually requires the minister to have a reason for intervening that stands up to scrutiny. The need to win a marginal seat for the coalition government just does not cut it. One of his advisers may have told Senator Campbell that he needed an excuse that would fly. Senator Campbell appears to have taken it literally. He latched on to the orange-bellied parrot.
Following the election, Senator Campbell spent 16 months shopping around for some scientific evidence to back the decision he had already made to stop the wind farm. We now know that this evidence was very hard to come by. In December 2004 Latitude 42 Environmental Consultants told the minister ‘any impacts on bird populations appear to be negligible’. Of course, this was the wrong answer for Senator Campbell, so he commissioned another study, from a firm called Biosis. Biosis concluded that blocking the Bald Hills wind farm would have ‘extremely limited beneficial value to the conservation of the parrot’. Biosis modelling found that there could be one parrot killed by the wind turbines every 1,000 years—one parrot every 1,000 years. In March, the minister’s own department told him that the wind farm at Bald Hills posed a ‘negligible threat to the parrot’. The department states that ‘no orange-bellied parrot has been recorded there’, ‘there appears to be no suitable habitat on site’ and ‘it is not considered to be a major migration passage’.
Despite the weight of evidence, Senator Campbell blocked the wind farm. Understandably, the backers of the wind farm instituted legal proceedings against the minister to overturn the decision. Last week, the minister had his day in court—and he was caught out. His parrots came home to roost. The court ordered that the minister’s decision should be set aside and that the minister reconsider the decision according to the law. It also ordered the Commonwealth to pay the costs of the proceedings. That is right: taxpayers will be asked to underwrite Senator Campbell’s blatant political favouritism. Senator Campbell talked today about these being consent orders. The Senate should have no doubt that the minister was well advised by the Australian Government Solicitor on this matter. Senator Campbell agreed to the consent orders because his lawyers knew that his case was doomed.
This case has exposed the corrupt way that environmental law is administered by this minister. This minister’s administration of the portfolio is like something you could expect in a tin-pot Third World country—or from the Western Australia Liberal Party. If you are investing in wind farms in this country, you need not only an environmental impact statement but also a political impact study. It is about time that Senator Campbell paid the price for this. Senator Ian Campbell is not yet a dead parrot, but he is a very naughty boy! (Time expired)

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2006-08-08,"—Senator Conroy’s speech illustrated as nothing else could how desperate the ALP is to grasp and find some niche to attack the government with on its environmental record. The fact is that the Howard government has done more for the environment than any other government in this country’s history has and, in particular, has done more for the environment than that which occurred in the 13 years of the Hawke and Keating governments. Senator Faulkner, for example, was the minister for the environment and achieved almost nothing.
Now, we have a government which has a fine record and has advanced the care of the environment in Australia across the board and made it a very high priority. First of all, this government introduced the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act—
—What about the orange-bellied parrot?
—You are looking for something, I know, Senator Faulkner. The ALP is desperate to find something, and they have latched on to the orange-bellied parrot, hoping that the rest of us will not take note of the fact that their record in environmental management was so absolutely dismal and amounted to nothing much at all to place on the record.
First of all, the Howard government introduced the environment and biodiversity act, which, for the first time, gave the federal government a right to intervene in environmental issues. That has meant that it is now much easier for these big projects to be given an environmental assessment, which means that a broad range of environmental issues can be dealt with by the federal government before they get towards their conclusions. Previously, in many cases, the federal government could only be involved if the Foreign Investment Review Board provisions were invoked.
The environment and biodiversity act was the first great achievement of the Howard government in the environment, but of course there have been many more. In particular, we turn to the Natural Heritage Trust, which, Mr Deputy President, you would know about because you are a man of great intelligence and have a great feeling for what the government has done in Queensland with the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. The Natural Heritage Trust committed $3 billion to the largest and most successful environmental restoration program in Australian history. The trust involves national, regional and local governments, and empowers community organisations in some 56 regions across the country to identify and solve local environment problems.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—We have mentioned the parrot because we know that that is all you can latch on to. This government’s record on the environment is so impeccable, so strong, that all you poor people on the other side can do is latch on to the poor little orange-bellied parrot.
When it comes to the question of climate change, the Howard government has an outstanding record by world standards. We are meeting our Kyoto targets, even though we regard the Kyoto agreement as a hollow agreement, a meaningless agreement, which will do almost nothing to reduce climate change problems secondary to greenhouse. The Kyoto agreement is something that we are not signing, but we are meeting its targets, and we have a very fine record in that area. Australia, under the Howard government, was the first and only government in the world at that stage to establish a national greenhouse office.
—Oh, sit down; you’re embarrassing yourself and your party. Just shut up!
—Senator Faulkner, I know you are embarrassed. I understand your embarrassment, and if you feel so embarrassed about the record of the ALP in government over their poor environmental record then perhaps you should leave the chamber.
We have not only introduced the Natural Heritage Trust and looked after the greenhouse effect but we also have programs to manage ocean quality and protect the Great Barrier Reef. This government has a very fine and outstanding record of environmental control. We have introduced a mandatory renewable energy targets program. This government is impeccable in its record on the environment, and for you people to latch on to a small issue like the orange-bellied parrot just states how— (Time expired)

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2006-08-08,"—I have just heard the two worst speeches from Senator Eggleston and Senator Johnston, not even attempting to defend Senator Ian Campbell and his ministerial malpractice over the orange-bellied parrot. The orange-bellied parrot affair is not about environmental protection; it is about politics. The orange-bellied parrot affair is not about a threatened bird species; it is about McMillan, a threatened Liberal Party seat in Victoria. In pursuit of that political outcome that Senator Ian Campbell, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, sought, what have we seen? We have seen the environmental assessment processes of this country debauched by Senator Campbell. We have seen the minister reject his departmental advice, the professional advice, the expert advice, the scientific advice, that he received. We have seen Minister Campbell shopping around for new and different advices in the vain hope that he would eventually find one that suited his political objectives on this issue. We have seen a huge amount of public moneys wasted on unnecessary bureaucratic and legal wrangling. And of course, finally, we have seen the utter and complete humiliation of Senator Campbell.
Senator Campbell, as environment minister of this country, is charged with very heavy responsibilities. He is charged with the protection of Australia’s environment and he is charged with ensuring that the use of our natural resources occurs in accordance with strict environmental guidelines. Senator Campbell, as we have heard, is the minister who likes the soft option. He likes grandstanding at the International Whaling Commission to stop the slaughter of whales. He is right about that; every single Australian agrees with him about that. It takes no political courage to stand up on that issue. But it does take political courage and political integrity to balance competing issues in marginal electorates, do what is best for your country and behave with ministerial propriety and integrity. You don’t just do what is best for your party; you have other responsibilities. Minister Campbell has failed that test comprehensively.
It also takes political courage as an environment minister to stand up on tough issues like greenhouse and climate change—courage that Senator Campbell has never demonstrated. He has been missing in action on those most crucial global issues. There are no more important issues facing the world than those. What do we get from this minister traditionally? Temper tantrums, immature behaviour, puerile rants and raves, and political attacks. That is the modus operandi of Senator Campbell, and it is not good enough.
What we have seen from Senator Campbell today is a yellow-bellied performance about the orange-bellied parrot. In any other government in the Western world this sort of performance would end with either a resignation or a sacking. We know the chances of Senator Campbell doing the proper and honourable thing here and the chances of Mr Howard, the Prime Minister, doing the proper and honourable thing in relation to this issue are as remote as the chance of one of Senator Campbell’s parrots in 1,000 years hitting a rotor blade at Bald Hills wind farm. That is the chance of them doing the right thing. But Senator Campbell should resign. This is a resigning offence and he should go.

"Minchin, Sen Nick (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",LP,2006-08-08,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate records its deep regret at the death, on 17 July 2006, of the Honourable Dr Reginald John David (Spot) Turnbull, former senator for Tasmania, and places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.
Reginald John David Turnbull was born in Shanghai, China, in 1908. His family returned to Australia 10 years later, where he was educated first at Wesley College, Melbourne, and later studied medicine at the University of Melbourne. At the age of 28, Spot Turnbull, as he was widely known, opened a medical practice in Launceston, before enlisting in the Australia military force in 1942. He later served with the 2nd Australian Imperial Force and was a major with the 12th Australian Field Ambulance.
Spot Turnbull entered the Tasmanian state parliament in 1946, beginning a long and distinguished political career. He served as Labor’s Minister for Health for 11 years and subsequently as his state’s Treasurer. His achievements in Tasmania included overseeing the introduction of fluoride to town water to improve dental health—a very worthy achievement—the introduction of compulsory X-rays to help fight tuberculosis, improvements to women’s health services and encouraging the establishment of the Royal Flying Doctor Service in Tasmania. In 1962, former Senator Turnbull entered the Senate to serve as Australia’s first Independent senator—a significant claim to fame in this place. He continued in this role until his retirement 12 years later, in 1974, except during the eight months from August 1969 when he led the Australia Party. He was a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Health and Welfare from 1970 to 1971 and was a parliamentary adviser on the Australian delegations to the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York in 1970 and 1971. Aside from his contribution to the Tasmanian and Commonwealth parliaments, he was a Launceston City Council alderman and served as Mayor of Launceston from 1964 to 1966. Throughout his long political career, he remained a practising GP.
I think it is fair to say that Spot Turnbull will be remembered as a politician with a commitment to helping people and, as I am reliably advised by Senator Ferris, who knew former Senator Turnbull, he was one of this Senate’s great characters. It was a life of great public service at all three levels of government—a relatively rare degree of service and achievement. On behalf of the government, I offer condolences to his wife, Nell, and his children, Shann, Hamish and Marsha.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Hon.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2006-08-08,"—On behalf of the opposition, I would like to support the motion of condolence moved by Senator Minchin following the death, on 17 July this year, of the Hon. Dr Reginald Turnbull, who I understand was better known as Spot. I inquired about the reasons, and apparently it was to do with some sort of facial spot, but it is a great Australian nickname. On behalf of all Labor senators, I would like to extend our sympathies to his widow, children, family and friends. Reginald Turnbull had a long and, dare I say it, controversial career in politics at the local, state and federal levels, including serving 12 years in the Senate as a representative of the state of Tasmania. As Senator Minchin said, interestingly he was born in Shanghai in 1908 and trained in medicine, a discipline he continued to practise throughout his long career in public life. During World War II, he served as a major with the 12th Australian Field Ambulance.
In 1946, he was elected a Labor member for the seat of Bass in the Tasmanian House of Assembly. He remained in the House of Assembly for 15 years, until 1961. During his 15 years in state parliament, he served as the Minister for Health for more than 10 years and was responsible for the introduction of a variety of important health services. These included the introduction of fluoride to town water, the introduction of compulsory X-rays to fight tuberculosis and the establishment in Tasmania of the Royal Flying Doctor Service. For a time, he also served as Tasmanian Treasurer. I think it is fair to say that with his distinctive personal style he cut a highly controversial figure in the Tasmanian Labor Party and in public life more generally. After a decade in the Tasmanian cabinet and some considerable controversy, he was eventually estranged from Labor. I do not know what it is about Tasmania, but we seem to have a record of that. It is obviously a very independent group of people in Tasmania.
Nonetheless, Reginald Turnbull was regarded and is remembered as an intelligent, committed and somewhat larger-than-life individual. He was a very popular man in his home state and gave many years to public life. He was elected to the Senate as an Independent in 1961 for a term commencing in 1962 and was re-elected in 1967. From 1959 to 1967, he served as an alderman on Launceston City Council, with a period as mayor between 1964 and 1966. Thus he balanced the dual roles of Independent senator and Mayor of Launceston for two years and continued to practise medicine. I dare say he was a very busy man.
For a period of about eight months from August 1969 he was leader and sole representative in the federal parliament of the Australia Party. In the early days of the Senate standing committee system he was a member of the committee on health and welfare. As I understand it, he was also a parliamentary adviser to the Australian delegation to both the 25th and 27th sessions of the General Assembly of the UN in the early 1970s. He retired from the Senate in 1974. Despite his retirement he remained interested in politics and apparently even considered running for the seat of Bass in 1977.
Dr Turnbull was married twice. His first wife, Elizabeth Turnbull, passed away in the 1980s. He is survived by his widow, Nell, and by his three children. He was clearly a person who made an enormous contribution to public life in this country and was, obviously, a very interesting character. To his family and friends in this time of mourning I extend the sympathies of all opposition senators.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Hon.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,2006-08-08,"—I wish to be associated with this condolence motion for former Senator Spot Turnbull. Spot Turnbull was a giant of a man—as a medical doctor, as an influential mayor of Launceston, as a distinguished minister in the state Labor government—Treasurer, and Minister for Health for 10 years—and as a senator in this place for three terms. Mr Kenneth von Bibra, a friend of the late senator, described him as a ‘larger than life character’. Spot Turnbull, as he was affectionately known, had a pioneering role in so many areas. I mention the Royal Flying Doctor Service, compulsory testing for tuberculosis, water fluoridisation, pap smears and so on. The state has indeed lost a pioneer and, as I said earlier, a giant of a man. I extend to his widow, his family and his friends my sympathy as a Tasmanian senator, and I thank God for his life.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Hon. Dr Reginald John David Turnbull</title>,CONDOLENCES,6,1,speech
"PRESIDENT, The",N/A,2006-08-08,"—I would like to add a few words of tribute to the motion of condolence for the late Hon. Dr Reginald Turnbull. Spot Turnbull was one of the most significant political figures in Tasmanian politics in the second half of the 20th century. He was an MHA for Bass from 1946 until 1961, when he resigned to successfully contest a Senate election. He was a gifted physician who contributed greatly to improvements in public health. He was Australia’s second Independent senator and served in the Senate for 13 years. He had previously been a Tasmanian Minister for Health and later Treasurer in the Cosgrove and Reece Labor governments. In local government, as has been said, Dr Turnbull was a popular and effective mayor of Launceston while serving as a senator. He was once described as the ‘stormy petrel’ of Tasmanian politics, and I think that would be a label Spot would have relished. He remained interested in politics throughout his long life and attended celebrations in Melbourne to mark the Centenary of Federation in 2001. He received a Centenary of Federation Medal for his parliamentary service. Following his 90th birthday, Spot indulged in a series of living wakes because he said he would not spend money on parties he could not attend.
I thank Senator Julian McGauran for representing me and the Senate at Dr Turnbull’s funeral service in the chapel at Wesley College. My condolences go to his wife, Nell, herself the daughter of the great surgeon Sir John Ramsay, and to Spot’s three children, Dr Shann Turnbull, Dr Hamish Turnbull and Marsha, Lady Grimwade. I now invite honourable senators to stand in silence to signify their support for the motion.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2006-08-08,"—I move:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:
The failure of the Minister for the Environment and Heritage (Senator Ian Campbell) to follow due process in assessing the environmental impact of the Bald Hills wind farm in Victoria, thereby undermining the legitimacy of national environmental approval processes.
I move this motion because it is quite apparent that the Federal Court’s consent orders to set aside the minister’s veto of the $220 million Bald Hills project display the depths of the minister’s chicanery and dissembling. It was always a questionable decision, but it was quite apparent, as a result of that court decision, that the minister’s already confirmed track record of misusing his office has now been reinforced by way of judicial decision. The judicial decision was that the minister’s decision be set aside and that he reconsider the assessment of that project according to law. There was a clear and unarguable premise. It said the existing decision was inconsistent with the law. The humiliating backdown—that this minister had to consent to these orders—was based on the fact that he had corroded the evaluation and approval processes which are designed to protect our environment from absolute damage. This is a scandal that has been brewing for two years. It highlights the fact that, despite the minister’s taking 450 days to come up with a decision that he has now had to abandon, it was a decision made only after court action had been taken by Wind Power. They said that he had avoided his responsibilities to respond to their application within the 30-day procedural program.
This decision took place in the lead-up to the 2004 election. The minister saw an opportunity to use his ministerial powers to give the Liberal Party an advantage in the marginal Victorian electorate of McMillan. I say this to the minister, and he is here in the chamber today: to his credit, he has always been up-front about that. A local newspaper, the Great Southern Star from Leongatha, provided us with the detail. It quotes the Liberal candidate as saying on 12 October 2004: ‘When Ian Campbell arrived, the whole complexion of the campaign changed for me. Senator Campbell gave a commitment to do everything within his power under the EPBC Act to veto the Bald Hills project.’ Clearly the minister has made a decision based on a prejudicial assumption of the scientific analysis required by the EPBC Act, which he had undertaken. Despite his lengthy efforts to find a scientist to support his claims, he has ignored it. Equally, he publicly announced his decision before any approval process was completed and advice provided. He was not making a ministerial decision based on environmental standards; he was making a political decision based on political imperatives, where the endangered species he was seeking to protect was a targeted marginal seat in Victoria.
It is now abundantly clear what has occurred, so I will not rehearse all the arguments on this shabby and sordid process. I will concentrate on the fallout that arises from the minister’s remarkable backflip to the Federal Court. Justice Weinberg’s order of 4 August was a short one, and one sentence sums up Senator Campbell’s embarrassing retreat: ‘The court orders by consent that the decisions of the respondent, the minister, dated 3 April, be set aside.’ He then instructed that he reconsider the proposal ‘according to law’. You have to make a presumption there: if it was not made according to law, on what basis was the decision made on 3 April? The entire fabric of the minister’s arguments relating to Bald Hills wind farm has collapsed as a result of his decision to agree to those orders. He has to publicly admit that the decision on the Bald Hills wind farm was flawed from the beginning. I ask a simple question: how long will it take before the Prime Minister takes action to defend due process of law? How long can this minister stay in his job? I bet the Prime Minister is now saying, ‘I was right to hold off on his promotion.’ Why he stayed a parliamentary secretary for so many years has now been confirmed. The Prime Minister was wrong to appoint him to this job. There has been a dereliction of duty, and he ought to either resign now or be sacked.
The theatre surrounding this decision was played out in a whole series of public arenas. What happened at the recent Senate estimates is one example. It is worth while revisiting what occurred at Senate estimates, because it sheds light on the actions of this minister. The minister put in a particularly hairy-chested performance on 25 May. He interrupted public servants, he insulted members of the committee, he did one of his temper tantrum routines, he shouted, he bellowed and he sought to deflect questioning away from issues about the probity of his own decisions. It was a demeaning performance—a performance so demeaning that members of the government made it clear to me that they were appalled at his behaviour. We saw the minister bobbing up and down like a jack-in-the-box with his nose growing ever longer after his attempts to evade and dissemble concerning his actions. It was a clear case of the politics of the absurd—the theatre of the absurd.
We had continual interference, not just in the usual manner in which he sought to prevent officers of the department from answering legitimate questions but in dissembling to the committee about the way in which decisions had been made within this government. He told the committee:
We put every single document on the table and every single bit of information.
That, of course, was a very fine sentiment; the trouble is it just was not true. He did not provide all the relevant information. He failed to mention that he had been advised by his own department that the grounds to reject the Bald Hills wind farm did not exist, but he went ahead anyway. Similarly, he forgot to mention the formal recommendation that he received on 10 March this year from a first assistant secretary of the department, a Mr Gerard Early, that he approve the wind farm. Far from being open and transparent with the Senate, as he claimed, he was in fact concealing the very information that gave the lie to his decisions.
The truth of the matter is that the minister committed himself to banning this wind farm way back in 2004 during the federal election. He made a political promise, and now his humiliation is that that political promise has been exposed for the lie that it was. He could not press ahead. He could not twist the approvals process to suit his purpose. The courts of this country know it, and it has been demonstrated before them that his actions were not in accordance with the law. The extent of his desperation to block this wind farm can be measured by the length of time he took to try to find a scientific opinion to defend his actions—450 days. In the end he could not do so. He was required to act within 30 days; he failed to do so. It took him 450 days, and in the end Wind Power, the proponents, forced his hand by taking legal action forcing him to act.
He desperately sought scientific opinions to justify his action. He said here today that the Biosis report did not refer to one parrot dying every 1,000 years. We found before the Senate estimates committee that Ashley Stephens from the department of the environment in Victoria wrote to the senior zoologist who wrote the Biosis report, Mr Ian Smales, in an email on 7 April 2006. The correspondence from the senior zoologist to him on the same day said:
To find the number of birds that might be killed at any one wind farm such as Bald Hills, was not the intent of our work and thus the scenario for a particular site–although it contributes to the cumulative impact assessment–is simply a scenario for the purposes of modelling.
Ashley Stephens wrote back to Mr Smales and asked this simple question in regard to his reading of the report:
For Bald Hills, if I multiply (1 - 0.9999392 from table 4 by the number 15 from table 3, I get 0.000912. this means about one mortality every 1,000 years. Is that right?
The senior zoologist from the Biosis report—this is the scientific advice the minister is relying upon—said in an email on 13 April at 10.20 am back to a senior officer from the department of the environment in Victoria:
Yes you’ve calculated correctly.
Cheers,
Ian
These are documents that I have tabled. I seek now to refer once again to those documents and to two particular tables that appear in the Biosis report on page 27 and page 30. They make it perfectly clear what those reports are saying. The minister cannot even read the hand-picked scientific advice which he sought to use to justify his politically motivated decision to ban a $220 million wind farm on the presumption that there would be one death every 1,000 years. That is what the report says.
The survey undertaken showed that there were 10,441 birds and 81 separate species sighted in the 12-month survey period, but not one orange-bellied parrot. The potential habitat was 20 kilometres away. Furthermore, the only sighting of an orange-bellied parrot was 40 kilometres away. That is what the department drew to the minister’s attention. The minister was told by his own department that the Bald Hills decision that he was going to take would in fact undermine the approval process for development in western Tasmania, Victoria, south-west New South Wales and of course south-east South Australia.
This minister prostituted his statutory obligations to seek political advantage in the last federal election campaign in the marginal seat of McMillan. He has sought to protect not an endangered species of fauna but an endangered Liberal mate in the marginal seat of McMillan. The minister has effectively convinced no-one that his decision was based on any science other than political science. The only science this minister is interested in is the numbers in this parliament. It is unfortunate for him that no-one was persuaded—not in the government, not in the bureaucracy and not in the Federal Court.
This minister should either resign or be sacked. What you have is that his decision has been set aside by the court and he has had to agree to it. He has had to agree that he will reconsider his own decision on the basis that he acts in accordance with the law, which he patently has failed to do up until this point. His own flawed logic has seen his decision in regard to a $220 million project squashed. We have seen the wilful misuse of the environmental modelling that was commissioned by him in a desperate bid to try to find a scientific fig leaf for the politically motivated decisions that he had already announced he was going to make.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2006-08-08,"—Mr Acting Deputy President, you can always tell when Senator Carr’s arguments are either spurious or based on irrelevancies because the volume always increases massively. You could tell that by the end of that little 15-minute spray Senator Carr was going hoarse. That, if you need to measure the depth or quality of his arguments, is the ultimate test. When he is hoarse at the end of 15 minutes you know that the arguments are so hollow that he is either misleading you about it or seeking to exaggerate. The voice gets louder and louder and ultimately he ends up hoarse.
In the time available to me I will make a couple of points. I am pleased to see on the list that Senator Brandis and Senator Scullion will be supporting the government’s case in relation to the motion that Senator Carr has moved. I am sure that Senator Brandis will address some of the legal issues. Senator Carr, in his normal way, has moved a motion against a minister and then wandered out of the chamber in his arrogant style, not prepared to listen to the argument. I think Senator Kemp actually put that to us earlier. He said that Senator Carr will always attack you if you are not in the chamber. Now he moves an attack, says that I should not have this job, and then wanders out of this chamber.
—It’s so he doesn’t stay here and interject and spoil your speech.
—It is probably a good thing, Senator Ludwig, but it does show a great contempt for the Senate when someone effectively moves a motion attacking a minister, yells and screams for 15 minutes, deceives the Senate and then skulks out of the chamber because he does not want to be corrected.
Mr Acting Deputy President, can I firstly make the point that, as Senator Ludwig will know because he has actually had legal training, when you have a consent order from a court it is in fact an agreement. It was an agreement between the proponent, Wind Power Pty Ltd, and me that we would go to the court and suggest a process. It was fully agreed; there was no disagreement with the proponent. We would go to the court and say, ‘Right, this is a good way forward.’
The only attack that you could possibly make on the process is that Wind Power, the proponents, did not have access to the cumulative impact report. The only reason they did not have access to it is that they informed us that they wanted to take legal action to force me to make a decision. So instead of coming to us and saying, ‘Can we have a look at the report?’ they came to us and said, ‘Please make a decision.’ We made a decision. I think it is entirely appropriate that they have access to the report so they have had access to it since April. They have had a lot of access to it. They have said, and I have agreed, that we will look at another submission on this proposal. I think it is an incredibly sensible way to go forward.
Senator Carr also said that the orange-bellied parrot had not been sighted at this particular location and that it did not even fly through it. ‘It has never been spotted’ I think were the words he used. The best thing that Senator Carr could do for this whole process is to get it out in the open. We have put all of the documents out there for the public to see. Senator Carr talked about the cumulative impact study, and that is a study of the impact on migratory species across that whole coastline. You would know from your own state, Mr Acting Deputy President, that these wind turbines do have significant impacts on birds. You have lost three endangered wedge-tailed eagles in Tasmania in the last three months.
We know that the Victorian Labor comrades of Senator Carr have played fast and loose with the truth on this issue, and they have hidden from the people of Victoria and from the people of Australia the information that puts the lie to what Senator Carr said in the Senate today. When the proposal came to my department the Victorian government sent up this huge wad of material in relation to the proposal. What they did not send up was this document which Mr Hulls still keeps secret from the Australian people. Senator Carr should read it. In fact, I will not even bother him with that effort because I know he struggles when it comes to effort, except when it comes to bellowing air through his lungs and vocal chords and making himself hoarse.
But what did the report say to Mr Hulls? His own department, the Department of Sustainability and Environment of Victoria, says under the heading ‘orange-bellied parrot’:
The Bald Hills wind farm proposal will increase the level of threat to the orange-bellied parrot.
It was not in any of their documents. That stack is what they sent to Canberra. I would have loved to have been the courier who got the contract for that. This document was missing, though. We know why now: because Senator Carr and his comrades in Victoria wanted to cover it up and hide it from the people of Victoria. What does it go on to say?
The department agrees that the orange-bellied parrot is unlikely to utilise the site. However—
this is the bird that does not go anywhere near the site, does not go through the site—that is what Senator Carr said to the Senate—
it is highly likely that the orange-bellied parrots commuting between habitat patches in South Gippsland will fly across the site. Their commuting flights are often at heights encompassed by the rotor swept area.
That will be news to Senator Allison who, without any ill will, said in Senate estimates that these birds do not fly at those heights.

Senator Allison interjecting—

—This is a submission made by Minister Hulls’s own department saying that the birds would in fact fly through the site and would go through the rotor-swept areas. Senator Allison interjects: ‘These birds are sensible; they know how to avoid them.’ There are three dead wedge-tailed eagles lying on the ground in northern Tasmania now, and here is a species with 50 breeding pairs left on the planet. It is worth making the point that if they were 50 blue whales and you stuck a rotor in their path there would be people marching in the streets. It is all right to have a bit of fun with a parrot. It does not really matter if it is an endangered parrot or an endangered eagle. These people who pretend they care about the environment say, ‘Let’s forget it.’
The report goes on to say:
A conservative approach is therefore required—
a conservative approach—
which acknowledges that this proposed development will increase the cumulative risk to the species posed by the wind farm industry. As for other wind farms in Victoria that place this species at increased risk of extinction, the proponent should investigate compensatory habitat management activities off site.
This is a very serious issue. It is one that the Victorian government’s own people recognise. It is one that the minister in Victoria has used to stop wind farms himself. He stopped one at Port Fairy only recently because of the impact on migratory birds. He pretends that for him to stop a wind farm because of one migratory bird is okay but for me to stop one because of another bird is not okay. It is gross hypocrisy, compounded by Senator Carr’s misleading of this chamber. (Time expired)

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2006-08-08,"—I join this debate on the urgency motion about Senator Ian Campbell and the process he used in assessing the environmental impact of the Bald Hills wind farm in Victoria. Since the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act was established on 16 July 2000, 2,745 proposals have been referred to the minister—not this minister but the ministers before him. But only four applications—that is, less than 0.015 per cent—have ever been rejected.
A significant number of the 2,745 projects involved threatened species. But it is painfully clear to us on this side of the chamber at least that this minister, like those who have gone before him, has been very reluctant indeed to use the EPBC Act to prevent projects from going ahead and has opted instead to utilise the option in the legislation of approving projects with conditions. It came as an enormous surprise to the wind industry and environment groups that the minister overturned the Victorian state decision and knocked back the Bald Hills wind farm. The minister’s decision was made even more surprising when it was revealed last week that he had ignored departmental advice to allow that wind farm to proceed.
A government report entitled Wind farm collision risk for birds: cumulative risks for threatened and migratory species stated that wind farms, not specifically the Bald Hills wind farm, are not likely to have a major impact on the species in question—that is, the orange-bellied parrot, the Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle, the swift parrot and the white-bellied sea eagle. Specifically on the orange-bellied parrot, the report says:
The current and proposed levels of wind farms within its habitat do not significantly affect the chance of survival ...
                  …         …         …
... the species has a very high probability of going extinct within 50 years in the absence of any mortality due to wind turbine collisions.
                  …         …         …
... such action—
preventing wind turbines, that is—
will have extremely limited beneficial value to conservation of the parrot without addressing very much greater adverse effects that are currently operating ...
Those threats include the fragmentation and degradation of overwinter habitat by grazing, agriculture and urban development; competition with other seed-eating birds; foxes and feral cats; disease; and disorientation during migration caused by brightly lit fishing boats. Ironically, the orange-bellied parrot is also on the list of birds threatened because of climate change.
The Bald Hills wind farm would significantly reduce greenhouse emissions—some 435,000 tonnes a year. There are far greater threats to the orange-bellied parrot than turbines, including global warming. A better outcome for the orange-bellied parrot, the Democrats say, would have been to approve the project with conditions. These could have included that the wind farm be required to minimise impact on habitat and that a percentage of the revenue from the wind farm or a specified dollar amount be put into creating more winter feeding habitats—which is a big problem for the bird—and securing current habitats. The CEO of the proposal is quoted as saying:
We’d be more than happy to do whatever we could to make sure we didn’t have a negative impact on these parrots.
As we have already heard today, the minister has conveniently used the EPBC Act to fulfil his pledge during the 2004 federal election campaign to stop the project, which is now located in the Liberal seat of McMillan. It is not hard to be cynical when we have the Treasurer and Prime Minister in waiting, Peter Costello, defending Senator Ian Campbell’s decision by saying that wind farms ‘look ugly’. Federal agriculture minister Peter McGauran argued that wind power is a fraud and would devalue farming land. The minister even said that the information about wind farms on the AGO’s website should be removed.
Given that only 0.015 per cent of applications have been knocked back by the minister since 2000, given that the department advised the minister to allow the wind farm to go ahead and given that the minister could easily have approved the project, like so many others, with conditions that would have been a win for the parrot, we can only conclude that the minister has set out to undermine the legitimacy of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.

"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2006-08-08,"—We are debating today a motion which reflects on the shameful behaviour of this minister, based purely on the politics of a marginal seat, in exercising his powers as a minister of the Crown under an act of this parliament. This is the minister who, through his Liberal Party candidate for McMillan, promised a small group of wind farm opponents that a vote for the Liberals in the last election would result in the wind farm being blocked. That is the reality. That is on the public record. This was a matter which involved a political promise by the candidate and this was a minister who was involved in delivering on that promise, come what may.
The minister spent 450 days casting around for an excuse, any excuse, to set aside this project—any vague or flimsy reason that he could come up with to deliver on a promise made to a small number of constituents in the seat of McMillan. All the advice from his own department told him that he had no grounds to block the proposal. This was reported in an article in the Age quite recently. The article talks about a briefing paper which was delivered to Senator Ian Campbell, dated 20 March this year, from the Department of the Environment and Heritage, signed off by first assistant secretary Gerard Early—so it was at a very high level in the department. The paper recommended that the wind farm be approved with standard conditions to minimise risks to endangered birds. In other words, it recommended the sorts of conditions which were imposed on other wind farms approved by this government and, indeed, by this very minister.
Mr Early advised the minister that more drastic measures, such as vetoing the development, would be inconsistent with previous government decisions and ‘would have ramifications for all coastal development in western Tasmania—your state, Mr Acting Deputy President Barnett—in Victoria, in southern New South Wales and in south-eastern South Australia’. I will touch on those very serious ramifications in this contribution. This minister knew better than very senior officers in his department, and he rejected their very sensible advice. He had commissioned advice from Biosis, and from Biosis he got something that he thought approached what he wanted. He jumped on it, without much thought, it would appear, because the rest is history. Windpower took the matter to the Federal Court, as you would expect in these very shabby circumstances, and the minister’s house of cards collapsed.
The minister continued his inane commentary on the matter, in opposition to the court case, and, when his own department’s advice was revealed, what did he say? The Age quotes him as saying:
I get advice from my department on all issues on a daily basis, I don’t always accept it. The bottom line is, if you want a ‘Yes Minister’ in action I’m the wrong guy to be your minister … It was a very good decision, I stand by it and I’d make it again tomorrow.
That reminded me not of Yes, Minister but Michael Palin of Monty Python fame. Who could forget that famous and very relevant sketch where John Cleese complained about a dead parrot. What did Michael Palin say: ‘Norwegian Blue—beautiful plumage!’ That is akin to this mantra about the orange-bellied parrot, which frankly was not endangered at all.

Senator Ian Campbell interjecting—

—Senator Faulkner earlier talked about this sort of puerile behaviour—this infantile behaviour by this minister. We are seeing another example of it today; he cannot contain himself. He was heard by me in silence, but of course he is not prepared to do that when he is being shown up in public. He is prepared to engage in this kind of theatrics. Senator Ian Campbell continued with his version of the dead parrot sketch for about another week, and then he had to capitulate. And that capitulation was very public. The capitulation is to settle the case on terms which the applicant says were ‘the most we could have received from this application’, and that is: forcing the minister to say that he would actually consider the application according to law. What a concession to make! He makes the concession that, on this occasion, he will consider the application in accordance with the law. At the same time, he will commit the Commonwealth, the taxpayer, to paying the legal costs of the applicant—costs which have been incurred because of the improper actions of this minister in consistently pursuing a political objective rather than the objective which is laid down in the legislation, which is a proper environmental approach to the problem.
I asked the minister a question in question time, and he assiduously avoided answering it, because it is true that wind farms have been approved by this minister even though they pose a greater risk to the orange-bellied parrot than Bald Hills would. There is nothing worse for a minister than to be exposed on arrogant inconsistency in the pursuit of so-called ministerial duties. The minister has been exposed on the basis that there was a political objective which had to be achieved, and the minister cast around and found the flimsiest of excuses to give effect to it.
It is, of course, true—and again the minister would not own up to this fact—that the very report he relied upon noted that it had intentionally overestimated the risks posed by wind farms and therefore overstated the likelihood of collisions. Did the minister tell that to the public when he made his announcements about the orange-bellied parrot? Of course not. He wanted the public to believe that he was the minister in shining armour defending the orange-bellied parrot from a risk which, frankly—as Senator Carr has demonstrated—would arise once in a thousand years—
—That is simply not true and Senator Carr knows it.
—It is absolutely true, and Senator Carr has documented the information—

Senator Brandis interjecting—

—Senator Brandis, you will get your chance in a minute, if you can hold your tongue for a second or two. If I had some protection from the chair, it would be helpful.
 (Senator Barnett)—Order! Senator O’Brien has the call.
—What we have seen is not something that is funny. We could think that it is funny.
—You were just quoting Monty Python, you goose.
—That is right. I was quoting something because the minister has been pilloried in the press. I must say I was greatly amused by the cartoon in Saturday’s Australian. It has the minister walking out on a gangplank.
—I thought it was quite clever too.
—It is a very clever cartoon. I hope you get a copy for your office, Minister. It will be your parting gift from this portfolio, I suspect. The serious part about this is why applicants would want to bring a matter before this minister when he has demonstrated that he is not capable of properly applying the law. He will apply what he considers is to the political advantage of his party. Why would applicants who want to build this country’s infrastructure, infrastructure that this country needs, go to this minister when he has demonstrated that he will be so inconsistent and that he will not give a fair hearing to applicants, as demonstrated by the different treatment that he has given to wind farms in this portfolio? And it is not just him; it is his whole government. He has departed from a consistent approach, the consistent approach that was recommended by his own department—the advice that he has said that he had rejected. This minister shows developers that they cannot rely on him. This is the minister who now cannot have any credibility in making any decision on this matter. He cannot have any credibility on this matter when it comes back before him and he cannot have any credibility on any other project. (Time expired)

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2006-08-08,"—On Sunday, 7 December 2003, Mr Mark Latham was sitting at home in Sydney. Mr Latham had five days earlier been elected to the leadership of the Australian Labor Party. He wrote a long, reflective essay to himself about the challenges he faced as the leader of the Australian Labor Party and how he was going to get it into shape to face a federal election in the ensuing year. He wrote down a list—you can read it on page 254 of his published diaries—of the challenges facing the Australian Labor Party that he had to address. One thing he put on his list was this: ‘We have got to get some decent senators.’ Addressing the trade unions, he says:
... if they want people like me to take unionism seriously, they need to give us better Senators and stop sending their rejects to Canberra.
After that lamentable, embarrassing, ignorant pair of performances by Senator Carr and Senator O’Brien, I cannot help feeling a bit of retrospective sympathy for Mr Mark Latham. What these two gentlemen have demonstrated—and it must be remembered that these two would be ministers in a federal Labor government were the Australian people so injudicious as to elect one—is a lamentable ignorance of elementary legal principles. Neither of them are lawyers. I see my friend Senator Kirk over there, who is a very good lawyer—and, therefore, about to be booted out of the caucus by the Labor Party. She would not need to have this explained to her, but they do, so let us take it simply.
First of all, much is made by Senator Carr and Senator O’Brien of the terms of a consent order in the Federal Court last Friday. It is a consent order which resolved by agreement litigation between Bald Hills Wind Farm Pty Ltd and the Commonwealth. Much is made of the use in the consent order of the language ‘that the matter be remitted to the respondent for reconsideration according to law.’ Senator Carr and Senator O’Brien seem to be unaware of the fact that that is a totally formulaic expression. In any consent order that disposes of litigation on an agreed basis, those words will appear in a case of this kind. It is utterly formulaic and has absolutely nothing to do with the determination on the merits. There was no determination on the merits in the consent order last Friday, contrary to what Senator Carr and Senator O’Brien would have you believe. Perhaps they themselves misunderstand.
This is a very simple case. What has occurred is that a party seeking to develop a wind farm in a particular locality in South Gippsland has made an application and the minister was given certain advice by his department that the application be approved subject to some conditions. The minister chose not to adopt that advice at the time but rather to commission a further survey. I think we have got a glimpse into what a future Labor government would be like with Senator Carr and Senator O’Brien as ministers in it. Not only would no departmental advice ever be called into question, but these ministers—were they ever to become ministers—would think there was something wrong or insidious or corrupt about a minister failing to rubber-stamp departmental advice. So I think we have got a glimpse of what sort of quality of ministers they would be. Nevertheless Senator Ian Campbell, like a good minister should, applied an independent mind to the department’s recommendation. He commissioned a further study by a reputable scientific expert, Biosis.
The particular issue with which Senator Campbell was concerned was not the effect on a given species just of this wind farm but of the cumulative effect on a range of species of the development of a number of wind farms across the coast of southern Gippsland. That is why he commissioned a report, being a minister who was on top of his department, not merely an automaton always following the department’s advice. He commissioned a study into something he was not satisfied the department had sufficiently turned its mind to—that is, the cumulative effect of all of these wind farms on migratory bird species. The report by Biosis came back to the minister. Let me read again, although Senator Campbell has read it once, the relevant conclusion:
Given that the Orange-bellied Parrot is predicted to have an extremely high probability of extinction in its current situation, almost any negative impact on the species could be sufficient to tip the balance against its continued existence. In this context it may be argued that any avoidable deleterious effect—even the very minor predicted impacts of turbine collisions—should be prevented.
In the study that Biosis did, they predicted the death of perhaps one orange-bellied parrot per year by impact with the turbines. That might not sound very many until you realise that this species, which is on the endangered species list, is so scarce and so rare that there are only 50 breeding pairs left in the world.
I am sure that if we changed the species and were talking about somewhat more famous animals, like the great white pandas or the white tigers, and we were told that there were only 50 breeding pairs left in the world and somebody asked the question, ‘Is it an unacceptable level of risk to kill one of the remaining 50 breeding pairs a year?’ most people with an ounce of environmental sensitivity would say: ‘Of course we can’t have that. According to the best scientific modelling and projections, that’s one per cent of all that are left in the world being eliminated every year.’ But because it is the humble orange-bellied parrot and because it lends itself to the asinine parody in which Senator O’Brien sought to engage—this Pythonesque burlesque that he tried and could not even accomplish on a sleepy afternoon in the Australian Senate—it is not treated with respect.
This is a serious environmental issue. There are 50 breeding pairs of this species left in the world. The scientific report says that the chances are you will kill one a year. That is our best estimate. So what does the minister do? He does what he is required to do under section 133 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The act provides certain specific tests that have to be applied to endangered species in considering applications to approve anything that might impinge upon them. In particular, section 18(3) of the act provides that in relation to endangered species:
A person must not take an action that:
(a) has or will have a significant impact on a listed threatened species included in the endangered category; or
(b) is likely to have a significant impact on a listed threatened species included in the endangered category.
I do not think that you would need to be very intelligent to work out that, if you only have 50 breeding pairs of a particular species left in the world and you have a scientific report that tells you that a particular proposal is likely to kill one a year, that is likely to have a significant impact on that endangered species.
Senator Campbell, on the basis of the best science available to him, refused the proposal under section 133(7) of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, and in doing so adhered to the statutory obligation provided for by section 136(2), which says:
In considering those matters, the Minister must take into account:
                  …         …         …
(e) any other information the Minister has on the relevant impacts of the action.
That includes the Biosis report. The minister did the right thing. Senator Campbell, I hope you are not paying this barrister that you have briefed in the Federal Court proceedings too much, because it is not going to be a very hard case for him to win, to show that you applied the statutory criteria accurately and in accordance with the science.
To top it all off, what we know now that we did not know before, and what Senator Campbell did not know at the time he made this decision on 5 April this year, is that the Victorian government, which had supplied documentation to Senator Campbell on this very topic, had concealed from him one highly relevant fact: a report by its own Department of Sustainability and Environment that reached the same conclusion.

"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2006-08-08,"—I rise today to say that I believe that Senator Campbell has finally exposed the complete lack of merit in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. When the government introduced this, the majority of the conservation movement across the country said that it was completely flawed legislation because it relied almost entirely on the discretion of the minister to determine the fate of any development project that was referred to the minister. It was only the WWF, the Humane Society, the Tasmanian Conservation Trust and the Queensland Conservation Council who stood with the federal minister of the day and made wild claims that it was the biggest win for the environment in 25 years.
Several years later, what we have seen is that the EPBC Act stands condemned. The activities of the minister in relation to the orange-bellied parrot demonstrate why, because it depends entirely on the whim of the minister whether he is going to apply the act appropriately or otherwise. That has always been the case. I inform the minister that when Senator Hill was the minister for the environment he ruled out any consideration of cumulative impacts on orange-bellied parrots as a result of wind farms. If you have a look at his decision then, he said that he was not going to look at the cumulative impacts at all.
I have heard a whole lot of hypocrisy from people around this chamber talking about their desperate concern for critically endangered species. When it was determined that the detention centre was to be put on Christmas Island I did not hear the same sort of passionate outcry for the Abbott’s booby. When it was decided to exempt logging of old-growth forests in Tasmania from any consideration with regard to the proposed pulp mill, did I hear an outcry from either the Liberal Party or the Labor Party about the green and gold frog, which was vulnerable under the EPBC Act? What about the wedge-tailed eagle? It is endangered. We have heard a lot about the wedge-tailed eagle. The assessment from Forestry Tasmania says that they will be wiped out in the north-east if the logging continues there for the pulp mill.
What about the swift parrot, the spotted-tailed quoll, the eastern barred bandicoot and other vulnerable species? The swift parrot is endangered. All of those are listed in the documents put out by the pulp mill proponents as being impacted by this pulp mill—and that is without consideration of the forests. And yet I do not hear a whimper from anywhere in this chamber. That, apparently, is okay. At the discretion of the minister, some species can be wiped out. With others, he takes a passionate interest in them, and the passionate interest has got to do with marginal seats in Victoria. Everybody in the country knows that. In Western Australia, they also know that the decision in relation to one particular wind farm proposal was to out-redneck a local sitting member, Wilson Tuckey. We also had the Treasurer saying that he would not want a wind farm in his backyard.
We are facing a global catastrophe with global warming and climate change. We need the desperate roll-out of renewable energy everywhere we can get it, and we need biodiversity protection to be taken seriously and consistently. We do not need ministers grandstanding and making political decisions because they can under a completely flawed act. Under the EPBC Act there have been hundreds, if not thousands, of referrals to federal ministers since it came in, and only two or three have ever been stopped.
Here is a challenge for you, Minister: Ralph’s Bay and the critically endangered spotted handfish. I want you to take the same decision on the spotted handfish as you took on the orange-bellied parrot. People in Ralph’s Bay will be watching to see if you do, because that is one of the last habitats of the spotted handfish. Let us have exactly the same process applied. You will get any number of reports telling you that the spotted handfish is critically endangered. Let us stop the Walker marina development right now on the basis of the spotted handfish. We do not even have a recovery plan funded, Minister. That is the level of concern the Commonwealth has for the spotted handfish.
As I have indicated, the wedge-tailed eagle in the north-east of Tasmania is also endangered, as the native forests go down in order to feed a pulp mill after a decision by the Commonwealth to exempt those forests from any assessment. How can you have an environmental impact assessment of a pulp mill that is going to use millions of tonnes of native forests every year, locked in for 30 years, and say, ‘I’m not going to look at the environmental impact on the forests’? The EPBC Act has been shown to be poor legislation. It should be repealed. What we need out of this orange-bellied parrot fiasco is new legislation which takes away from the minister the discretion that the minister currently has under the act that makes a mockery of environmental protection.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2006-08-08,"—I rise to speak on this urgency motion. I must say that, having heard the debate, I think the urgency is not so much about wind farms or indeed parrots but appears to be something to do with the Victorian Labor Party trying to divert attention from something—but we will get to that in a moment. I have to congratulate my well-informed colleague Senator Brandis on the way he has dealt with the issues of due process. I think we have comprehensively debunked any conspiracy theory that the Minister for the Environment and Heritage has somehow stepped outside of the process. I think that theory has been completely debunked.
What has been a consistent theme in the argument from those opposite is that somehow the minister should be accused of this evil of having no consistency. From all the information that is before me, all I can see that the minister has refused to do is be pressured to make a fundamental decision about protecting the environment. He has sought to find that very delicate balance between development and the environment and has said, ‘I am not going to make that decision until I have considered the most recent and most comprehensive information at hand.’
You have to take this job seriously. It has been a fair amount of time since those opposite have perhaps had that opportunity, but I would remind them that they should look very carefully at the actions of this minister. He has a very proud history of delivering consistent decisions. Those decisions have to be made after very carefully balancing development with environmental protection. It is not an easy task. You have to do it very carefully. This government and this minister have demonstrated that they have been able to do that for some time.
I will cite a couple of well-known recovery plans. In the context of, say, a windmill, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act does not simply look at the footprint that the windmill makes on the ground and what plants will no longer exist there because we have stuck a great windmill there but it also looks at the wider implications. In another context, this government has said, ‘You not only need a plan to manage mullet or sharks; you also need to look at the wider impact.’ Of course, that is exactly what this minister is doing. In the case of the dugong recovery plan, this government did not namby-pamby around this area. Yes, there were a lot of people who got their noses out of joint and, yes, there were a lot of developers who said, ‘That’s inappropriate,’ or ‘That’s not right,’ but we put in specific legislation to ensure that there were dugong protected areas. That is consistent with the approach we are taking today.
The turtle recovery plan was, again, absolutely consistent with the decisions that the minister has made. The development of the turtle recovery plan was carried out only after the minister had received the best possible information on turtles, particularly with respect to their interaction with the fishing industry, and how we could enable them to recover. The industry developed turtle excluding devices—devices that are now recognised as some of the best innovations around the world and which are now in bycatch-reducing devices. The industry put in a supplementary submission and came back to the minister and said, ‘Now can we continue?’ They had in fact ameliorated any of the potential damage that may have been caused by their activities.
But if we are looking for a real comparison, we can look at the albatross recovery plan. Mr Acting Deputy President Barnett, coming from Tasmania, you would appreciate this. The albatross is an iconic species. Everybody knows that albatrosses are threatened and endangered. But, in terms of the comparison between the orange-breasted parrot and the albatross, there are thousands of albatrosses and there are no parrots. The parrots are in such perilous circumstances. With the albatrosses, we said, ‘There is simply no acceptable bycatch—none.’ We gave the tuna industry time to come back with another submission. We said, ‘If you want, you can come back with another submission on how you go about it and not how many birds you kill.’ They went away and developed tori poles and down-shooting devices and eventually said, ‘Night setting only. We are going to operate at a time when albatrosses cannot negatively interact’—and the minister said, ‘Crack on.’ That is exactly what happened, Senator Carr. Their submission took these matters into consideration.
For your information, Senator Carr, the orange-breasted parrot could possibly be called a coastal parrot. You may or may not be aware that it travels only about two kilometres from the coast. As has already been said here today, it is at most risk when it is flying and moving between habitats. So perhaps they could consider spatially where they are putting the wind farm. The minister is not standing in the way of these things. Quite rightly, he has looked at the very best scientific advice. I am quite sure that, if someone comes up with a plan that can ameliorate those challenges, he would be supportive.
There has been a lot of derision and there have been a lot of Monty Python jokes—poorly done—but we have made a very long-term commitment to this animal. This is part of a 10-year recovery plan. This is not something that has dropped out of the air. It is not an attempt to dupe people in this place, as those opposite would have us believe. In fact, the people who have been doing the duping are those on the other side. We keep hearing from Senator Carr: ‘One in a thousand years’, ‘Be afraid’, ‘This is ridiculous’ and ‘Obviously it is a political conspiracy.’ I will quote straight from a document that was addressed to the authors of the report, Biosis. The question asked was basically: ‘Is this valid? Should we take this part of the report to mean one in a thousand?’ The document states:
To find the number of birds that might be killed at any one wind farm such as Bald Hills, was not the intent of our work and thus the scenario for a particular site—although it contributes to the cumulative impact assessment—is simply a scenario for the purposes of modelling.
That debunks the one in 1,000 theory clearly and utterly. If you have heard that, take it from your mind because it is utter rubbish.
—It is one a year.
—It is one a year. What the report does state is:
Given that the Orange-bellied Parrot is predicted to have an extremely high probability of extinction in its current situation, almost any negative impact on the species could be sufficient to tip the balance against its continued existence. In this context it may be argued that any avoidable deleterious effect - even the very minor predicted impacts of turbine collisions - should be prevented.
It is unequivocal. I understand that. It says: ‘Do not have wind farms where these birds are unless you have some other mitigating device,’ which obviously has not been put forward in this first submission. (Time expired)

That the Senate take note of the documents.
I am only going to speak very briefly to this. This is an extremely unusual matter before the chamber, and I do not think it should pass without attention being drawn to it. We have a situation where two documents of additional information—one dating from 24 September 1997 in relation to the Public Service Bill 1997 and another relating to the enrolment of new electors at the 1996 federal election close of rolls, which was received on 23 June 1998—have today been tabled before the Senate. It does not take a great deal of analysis to realise that this material ordinarily would have come before the Senate the best part of a decade ago.
I want to acknowledge the efforts of the Secretary of the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee, Mr Alistair Sands, who is so competent that he managed to find these reports the best part of 10 years after they should have been brought before the Senate. I assume that Mr Sands was tidying up the office—and, of course, these well predate his time as the committee secretary—and that this material was found in some old files. I think the secretary of the committee was reviewing files due for destruction and discovered these two items of evidence that obviously should be preserved for the full record but had not been tabled before the Senate. They now, of course, form part of the official records as of today.
The first one, in relation to the Public Service Bill 1997, is a letter from the then, and still, Clerk of the Senate, Mr Harry Evans. This was received on 26 September 1997 by the Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee and enclosed a report of what is described as the corporate links subcommittee of the Department of the Senate, which relates to staff concerns arising from the Parliamentary Service Bill and associated legislation. Some senators would know I took a very active role in the debate on that legislation at the time. Interestingly enough, this report is referred to in the report of the committee, but it was never published. It is also interesting to note that the corporate links subcommittee report that we are dealing with today was for a committee that no longer exists. It was an internal staff committee that some time prior to the turn of the century ceased to exist.
That is an unusual situation, as is the second item, which relates to evidence from the Senate with regard to an inquiry by the committee into the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998. The secretary, Mr Sands—as I said, this was very diligent and good work from him—wanted to make sure that the records of the Senate were complete. It is a worthy objective, and I am pleased we have been able to achieve it, but this material needs to be tabled to do so. Effectively, that is happening today to complete the records of the Senate and to complete the records of evidence.
The only other point I want to make in relation to this very unusual, and I suggest unprecedented, tabling today is that the AEC material that is now being included formally in Senate records relates to the enrolment of new electors in the 1996 federal election and the close of rolls. It was signed by the then Acting Deputy Electoral Commissioner, Mr Dacey, who I note is still a very senior official with the Australian Electoral Commission. It was also signed by Mr Jim Doyle, the acting director of enrolment. This material was presented by the Australian Electoral Commission at a time when it was strongly of the view that the electoral rolls should not be closed on the day that an election is called. The Electoral Commission provided this parliament’s Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters with consistent advice over very many years about the closure of the rolls, the impact of any proposals to change those close-of-roll arrangements and the numbers of people who would be disenfranchised if that were to occur.
The interesting element of this letter is that it gives details about those new enrolees, a breakdown of those details and the impact early closure of the rolls would have had on them. Since that time, but only very recently of course, we have seen the Australian Electoral Commission change its view in relation to the consistent advice it has provided over very many years about the early closure of the rolls. We still have not got to the bottom of why it has changed its views, but it is now consistent with the Howard government’s legislative changes. These were dealt with in our last session, and I think they remain some of the most significant and reprehensible legislative changes that have ever been passed in the Australian parliament. But this interesting artefact is something that I thought was valuable to draw to the Senate’s attention. It points out a number of things. It points out the competence of our Senate committee secretaries. I give a pat on the back on this occasion to Mr Sands for finding this material. It graphically points out the fact that the Australian Electoral Commission has changed its previously consistent approach over decades in relation to early closure of the rolls. It also shows the number of people who would have been impacted by early closure of the rolls in 1996.

It graphically points out the fact that the Australian Electoral Commission has changed its previously consistent approach over decades in relation to early closure of the rolls. It also shows the number of people who would have been impacted by early closure of the rolls in 1996.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2006-08-08,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
The Conservation of Australia’s historical heritage places report was received on 21 July 2006. I advise the Senate that I believe this to be a very disappointing document. If fully implemented, its recommendations would accelerate the loss of heritage places in Australia, including many of our major regional and state buildings, many of which are places of particular significance. This is, unfortunately, very much a partial document delivering what looks suspiciously like predetermined outcomes. Accordingly, I think it is very short sighted. I am particularly concerned about the debate relating to public versus private interests, as is represented in this report. This is a report that gives an overwhelming priority to the perceived short-term interests of private property owners to the detriment of the long-term interests of the community at large. It underestimates the value of heritage conservation as a public good by seeking to corral that sense of public value to property and sites already in public hands. By downplaying the significance of the environmental, social and economic benefits of heritage conservation, the report fatally compromises the value of its own recommendations.
The commission also enters the debate over compensation and its alternative of incentives within a clear system of developmental controls. The Productivity Commission comes down decisively in favour of compensation, applied in conjunction with voluntary agreements. The commission proposes a series of regressive alternatives. It seeks an ad hoc and ultimately ineffective means to manage the protection of heritage places. There is no doubt that all processes can be and are improved over time, but this preference by the commission for compensation is ultimately self-defeating. In all Australian jurisdictions, compensation as a means of management has been considered and rejected. The same is true in heritage and planning processes right across the Western world. It is proposing here an antiquated, obsolete and ahistorical approach to heritage protection and one not in keeping with world best practice. It is one that goes against all the things the Productivity Commission claims are the core values it pursues.
These recommendations, if implemented, would undermine a sustainable system of heritage management in this country. The commission now uses incentives for owners of heritage places but within an orderly system of listing of heritage development control. If the commission’s recommendations became practice, it could mean that the value of cultural heritage itself would be undermined.
When debating the question of private loss against the wider public interest, the Productivity Commission finds in favour of private owners. I am concerned that in doing so the Productivity Commission, through this report, plays down the extent and level of public support for heritage conservation and heritage listing of sites and places of significance. There are many varied surveys, including those undertaken by survey groups such as Allen Consulting, which consistently report a high level of public support for and appreciation of heritage protection. The Australian public is nowhere near as negative, aggressive or reactionary on these questions as some of these so-called economic rationalists in the Productivity Commission would like to believe. The evidence just does not support the predetermined positions that they have taken on these matters.
I am concerned that this report contains the appearance of predetermined or preconceived notions of what is in the public interest and, in doing so, has taken the view that the ultimate test of government is to protect private interests. The commission not only effectively marginalises the majority of submissions it received in favouring the principles of the current system but has remained blind to its own errors in its analysis. In the course of the consultation period, a number of heritage councils drew to the commission’s attention errors of fact and of interpretation in relation to the use of voluntary agreements in the United States. Those arrangements are not as the commission represents them. Despite this being drawn to their attention, those submissions have been ignored by the authors of this report.
It is my concern that this report is fundamentally flawed. Its principal recommendations on fundamental changes to heritage management protocols should be rejected by government. The net effect of the recommendations is that the voice of heritage, which is an important community voice, would effectively be drowned out. That is the underlying presumption of this report. If implemented, the changes that are proposed in this report would direct us down a one-way street to destruction. If these changes are implemented, national assets will be lost in so many cases. It is a matter of deep concern that a publicly funded body such as the Productivity Commission could devote so much time and energy to producing such a shoddy document.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2006-08-08,"—On behalf of the Chair of the Community Affairs References Committee, Senator Moore, I present additional information received by the committee on its inquiry into petrol sniffing in Aboriginal communities and seek leave to move a motion in relation to that document.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I stand here this afternoon to provide some comments about a letter that has been received by the Community Affairs References Committee in relation to its inquiry into petrol sniffing in Aboriginal communities. The letter was to the committee by Mr Gregory Andrews, the now Assistant Secretary of the Communities Engagement Branch of the Office of Indigenous Policy Coordination. It corrects the record on two matters that were mentioned in evidence during the Senate’s inquiry into petrol sniffing and on evidence that he gave on 27 April this year.
The comments I want to go to refer to the way in which this whole sad and sorry saga has been dealt with since that day. I will begin by saying that it became evident to me in the last two months that the Senate had been misled by Mr Andrews. In fact, on 18 July I put out a press release calling on him to correct the record. I understand and accept that he did and I want to thank him publicly for doing that. In this job I find that public servants who choose to mislead the Senate are not helpful, nor do they do their minister or their government any service by being dishonest in their evidence. But I do believe there is one section of his evidence that to this day has not been corrected, and we have not had any evidence to lead us to believe that the statement he made was in any way correct. I also note that he gave that statement on the ABC’s Lateline program—and I will get to the matters of that television show and the reporter, Mr Tony Jones, in a moment.
On 27 April Mr Andrews suggested that people were being raped and bashed and were killing other people and themselves. He went on to say that young people were hanging themselves off the church steeple on Sundays and that their mothers were having to cut them down. Since 27 April, I have travelled to Mutitjulu and have had a meeting with at least 30 members of that community. They are distressed, dismayed and horrified at the comments that have been made about their community. They have not had a chance to reply to these allegations and, at this stage, those allegations are completely unsubstantiated. There is no evidence at all that people have hung themselves off the church steeple. There may well be evidence that kids in that community have tried to commit suicide. Community members are certainly shocked and dismayed and they were extremely upset when they told me that no mothers had had to cut their children down off the church steeple. So why do we have public servants making these sorts of accusations?
I think we really need to take note here, with this letter that has emanated out of a whole flurry of activity at the ABC, of the role of the media in this sad and sorry saga. We now know that Mr Andrews was interviewed on Lateline as a former youth worker. In a letter posted today on the Crikey website, I notice that Tony Jones himself has written to clear himself of accusations against Lateline, which he says amount to a conspiracy theory.
But let us just put the question of a conspiracy theory to one side. Tony Jones admits in his letter that Mr Andrews being described as a former youth worker was in fact an unfortunate misjudgement, although a minor one. I notice, though, that Lateline was still happy enough to interview a whole swag of people in relation to petrol sniffing in that community and that only one of those people—that is, against a whole swag of people who had been associated with but were not involved with, did not live with and were not other Indigenous people in that community—was a senior traditional owner from that community. That is pretty one-sided reporting, I would say. I myself was a bit shocked and horrified when I saw the string of accusations being made on the Lateline show. I understand ‘a story is a story’ for some reporters, but I have to say that in my estimation the creditability and the high professionalism enjoyed in this country by Lateline have been severely diminished.
We now know that two weeks ago—a couple of months after these allegations had been made—the Northern Territory Police department issued a statement to say that 200 to 300 people had been interviewed in relation to the allegations at Mutitjulu and that they had not found enough evidence to charge anybody with any crime. I notice, Tony Jones, that you did not actually repeat that or seek to qualify the unsubstantiated accusations on your show. The Northern Territory Police’s press release suggested that they had viewed hundreds of people and had not yet come up with any evidence. Where is the balance in the reporting here? Where is the attempt to get out to the community and to provide another side to the story?
I think poor Greg Andrews is the messenger who has been shot here. It is unfortunate that this whole saga—as well as his misrepresentation of the activities of his department during Senate estimates—has come to light through his interview on Lateline. Why hasn’t Lateline reported the lack of spending on and commitment to petrol sniffing by the federal government? Why didn’t Lateline then seek to do a story on the outcome of the petrol sniffing inquiry? Why has it not revealed to the rest of this country that only three communities are involved in the 10-point plan—Docker River, Imampa and Mutitjulu—compared with the many other communities in the Northern Territory that want some action taken in relation to petrol sniffing? Why has it not revealed that any money this government has spent out there has been from the Aboriginals Benefit Account—that is, from Indigenous people’s own money derived from the royalties of mining? Not one new cent of the federal government’s money has been spent at Mutitjulu.
Why hasn’t Lateline revealed to the rest of this country that any programs funded at Mutitjulu operate on a six-month or one-year funding basis and not on a three-, four- or five-year funding basis, which would enable some consistency and some quality outcomes rather than poor people struggling to deal with these problems and having to stop every four or five months to rewrite grant submissions? Why hasn’t Lateline revealed that these are short-term funded programs, that there is a serious lack of youth workers and youth programs in this community and that there are community people out there who want action taken? Unsubstantiated accusations either by public servants or through shows such as Lateline do nothing to assist or arrest the strife and the dysfunctionality in these communities. Why won’t Lateline take its cameras out and give us a half-hour show on the success of the Mount Theo program or the Papunya program, given that there are no kids sniffing in those communities now? That has happened not thanks to the actions of this federal government but thanks to the actions of Indigenous people. In my mind, the ABC, courtesy of Lateline and Mr Tony Jones, has seriously eroded the creditability of Indigenous people.
I do not step aside from the fact that, if there are people out there doing as Tony Jones, Lateline and Mr Andrews suggest, they should be charged, locked up, sent to think about their actions and punished for their actions. We know that the paedophile they are talking about no longer lives in that region and has gone back to South Australia, but we and the police do not have any other evidence on which to base an arrest, a questioning, a holding or a charge. What are we doing to support the police in their actions to try to get to the bottom of this? What we tend to do is see on national television wild accusations which are unsubstantiated but then not qualified by the ABC. I seriously think that the reporting behaviour of this show needs investigating. I am grossly disappointed by the lack of impartiality of the ABC in relation to this, and I do not believe that their behaviour in the last two months has done anything to try and arrest the gross dysfunctionality in some of these communities or the lack of attention to petrol sniffing in this country.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs References Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,15,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-08-08,"—I was also a member of the committee conducting the inquiry that this information relates to. I should also say that I am chair of a separate committee, the Senate environment committee, which happened to be at Uluru Katajuta National Park on the night of one of the Lateline reports into this issue—a report which included allegations or comments regarding the actions or apparent inactions of Parks Australia with regard to some allegations. I also want to speak on the issue whilst it is before the Senate. I think it is an impossibly difficult issue to deal with, frankly. There are aspects of the way this story was handled by Lateline that I think are less than ideal. You can get into allegation and counterallegation, point to different aspects of transcripts and end up going down a range of different rabbit burrows and it will not really prove anything. I think we all need to remember when we are debating these sorts of issues that the key thing we need to keep our eye on is what is best for Indigenous Australians.
Clearly, the suggestions that were made that there was a paedophile ring have been demonstrated to be grossly overstated if not completely incorrect. Certainly there was the strong inference in the reporting that the alleged paedophile was still in the community at the time the reports were made, when in fact he was no longer in the community and, from all the evidence I have seen, was pressured or chased out of that community some time earlier. That still raises the questions of why is it up to a community and, to some extent, organisations like Parks Australia to use various forms of pressure et cetera with regard to somebody who had very serious allegations made about them.
The statement released by the head of Parks Australia, Mr Cochrane, around the time of the Lateline stories shows quite clearly that Parks Australia reported the allegations to the police. That was the appropriate thing to do, of course. Given the very crucial and very basic fundamental aspect of justice that somebody is innocent until proven guilty, obviously the person in that circumstance could not just be summarily dismissed from their job until the allegation had been investigated. However, in the meantime significant changes were made to restrict the activities of that person to try to ensure there was a reduced prospect of any untoward actions. The Territory police, having investigated the allegations, did not find any grounds for charging anybody. We can all see how that would put an organisation or an employer in a difficult position. Serious allegations are referred to police, the police investigate them and no action is taken. What do you do? That is always a difficult scenario. I do not think any of us can just get up and pronounce with certitude and high and mighty judgement how to deal with those situations. You have to deal with them on a case-by-case basis at the community level. I think that is basically what the community did.
Frankly, I think the mainstream media, including the ABC, and mainstream politics, including us, simply do not operate in such a way as to deal effectively with some of the very serious challenges that Indigenous communities have to face. I think our records show that we have not exactly covered ourselves in glory in trying to deal with these issues. But I would also emphasise that we have to guard against double standards and against each of us, from our different perspectives, using scenarios that arise purely to advance our own political, ideological or philosophical barrow of the day. It is very easy to do that—in fact, sometimes it is quite hard not to do it. But I think we need to try to step back and look at the bigger picture—the long-term picture—and recognise the wider damage that can be done by just running away from an issue without looking at the broader consequences.
Let us not also forget, of course, that many people, and particularly women in Indigenous communities, are crying out for more support and more help in dealing with violence and abuse towards adults and children in their communities. It is an incredibly difficult issue, and it is one that we have to try to deal with a bit more sensitively. That is why running off with wild allegations and using them to follow up with very public and very punitive actions is not normally a terribly constructive way to go.
I also note the contrast between this and the way we tend to act with regard to allegations of child abuse, including child sexual assault, in the broader community. There was a report on the front page of my hometown newspaper, the Courier-Mail, a week or so ago about many thousands of child abuse and neglect allegations that had not been followed up by the state Labor government. In saying that, I know there are some reasons for that situation. But the fact is that, even if many allegations of child abuse had not been properly investigated because of resource constraints, the Queensland government did not have the federal government coming in and cutting off their funding and sending in an administrator, like happened in Mutitjulu. We have not had any widespread allegations that Queenslanders, as a society, are not able to function and cannot look after themselves or that we need to mainstream and deal with Queensland from Canberra. We have not had widespread smearing of the entire Queensland community such that the whole society is dysfunctional because of the quite widespread amount of child abuse, neglect and assault that occurs.
We know that it is a difficult issue, and we know it is an issue that occurs throughout the entire Australian community. Whilst there is evidence that it is more widespread in some—and I emphasise ‘some’—Indigenous communities, the fact is that child abuse and child sexual assault are quite widespread across our community. It is a very difficult issue to deal with. From my background as a social worker and from knowing people who have worked in child protection, you are in an impossible position. If you go in and remove a child, you are accused of taking children away from their families, traumatising them and ripping them away from their support networks. If you leave them alone and more abuse happens, you are accused of leaving them to suffer lifelong damage. It is an impossible choice, and that is when you are operating outside the glare of the public spotlight, the media spotlight and the political spotlight. In the spotlight it becomes 50 times more difficult.
In saying all that, I am not being helpful in providing an answer because I am not sure that you can provide an easy answer. Every situation has to be dealt with on its merits, but we need to recognise the need for sensitivity in these issues across the board and the need, as much as possible, to deal with these sorts of issues outside the glare of the public spotlight. We need to do that without using it as an excuse to sweep the issues under the carpet. We cannot resolve difficult and major issues at the community level whilst there is a whopping great spotlight on them and everybody is trying to look at every single situation to see how it fits the political battles of the moment. We have to try to find a way to move outside of that. I do not think there is any doubt that that is the way the story on Mutitjulu ended up. It galloped along and ended up overblowing the situation. There is no doubt that there are serious difficulties in that community—the community itself acknowledges that. It wants support in working through them.
At the end of the day, you can have many politicians—all of us—making all our pronouncements, statements of outrage and big headlines in the newspapers, but that will all die down and the people at the community level will still have to deal with the situation. They want long-term support in dealing with that and enabling them to deal with that. We might go in there genuinely to try to help, but sometime or other we will be leaving and they will still be there. They are the ones who need the support. In this circumstance, the community have clearly been left in a situation where they feel like they have been punished many times over and perhaps exaggerated perceptions have been created about that situation. There is a wide range of circumstances and a wide range of reasons as to why things are as they are in that community, and that is a subject for another day. Certainly this whole episode is a reminder of how easy it is to let one small thing blow up out of proportion and cause more harm than good. It is a reminder of how we need to be careful in dealing with these issues. (Time expired)

We cannot resolve difficult and major issues at the community level whilst there is a whopping great spotlight on them and everybody is trying to look at every single situation to see how it fits the political battles of the moment. We have to try to find a way to move outside of that. I do not think there is any doubt that that is the way the story on Mutitjulu ended up. It galloped along and ended up overblowing the situation. There is no doubt that there are serious difficulties in that community—the community itself acknowledges that. It wants support in working through them.
At the end of the day, you can have many politicians—all of us—making all our pronouncements, statements of outrage and big headlines in the newspapers, but that will all die down and the people at the community level will still have to deal with the situation. They want long-term support in dealing with that and enabling them to deal with that. We might go in there genuinely to try to help, but sometime or other we will be leaving and they will still be there. They are the ones who need the support. In this circumstance, the community have clearly been left in a situation where they feel like they have been punished many times over and perhaps exaggerated perceptions have been created about that situation. There is a wide range of circumstances and a wide range of reasons as to why things are as they are in that community, and that is a subject for another day. Certainly this whole episode is a reminder of how easy it is to let one small thing blow up out of proportion and cause more harm than good. It is a reminder of how we need to be careful in dealing with these issues. (Time expired)

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2006-08-08,"—I will briefly conclude my remarks. I was at the stage of saying that I am extremely disappointed that the government are not having a public review of the act. It is extremely depressing and disappointing that it is an internal review, where they will choose who they consult with, where they do not take public submissions and where, presumably, we the community will not know the outcomes of the review of this extremely important legislation. The government also did not provide time lines for this review: when it is taking place, how long it will take, when it is due for reporting and when we will actually see amendments to the act. I think they have missed a significant opportunity to do a proper, full and thorough review of this act when it so desperately needs it.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2006-08-08,"—I wish to speak on the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 2006. In 1995, David Mowaljarlai, an Aboriginal elder from West Kimberley, said:
... I don’t own the land, but the land owns me. That is the strong thing in Aborigine law and culture. It’s about the land. I’m only a servant, we all Aborigines are servants, we serve nature. That’s why it’s so important for us, because the land owns us.
That is regarded as one of the definitive statements about Aboriginal relationship to land. The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, which is being discussed today, was the first and strongest legal recognition of the profound connection that Indigenous people have to their country and the communal nature of landownership in traditional Aboriginal law and culture. It recognised that relationship by granting a form of freehold title. It represented the most significant set of rights won by Aboriginal people after two centuries of European settlement. It returned about 50 per cent of the land area of the Northern Territory to its traditional owners. It went some way towards correcting a historical injustice and extending our legal system to recognise a non-European, communal ownership structure and the historical truth of Aboriginal rights on this land before European settlement. Australians can be rightly proud of the land rights act and the bipartisan spirit in which it was enacted.
With the bill before us, the government will seek to radically reshape that land rights regime and, I think, in doing so it will debase its symbolic value. The bill diminishes the rights of traditional owners over their asset: the land. It fundamentally seeks to alter the principle of communal landownership, which is at the heart of the land rights regime. The government has taken this step without proper negotiation with traditional owners and without their consent. It is hard to imagine that any other group of Australians would have their property rights treated in this way. The government is rejecting the tests set from the first days of the land rights regime—the tests that those rights should not be diminished without negotiation or the consent of traditional owners. It is squandering the opportunity to develop a negotiated package of reforms which recognise Aboriginal cultural principles and encourage appropriate economic development on Aboriginal land. The government’s actions demonstrate a lack of respect for Indigenous people and their culture. It represents yet another paternalistic attempt to tell Aboriginal people what is good for them.
Labor is proud that the land rights act had its origins in a Labor government and that we remain absolutely committed to the spirit and substance of the act. The act had its roots in the Woodward report, commissioned by the Whitlam government in 1973. Justice Woodward identified various aims of recognising Aboriginal land rights, including:
The doing of simple justice to a people who have been deprived of their land without their consent and without compensation.
                  …         …         …
The provision of land holdings as a first essential for people who are economically depressed and who have at present no real opportunity of achieving a normal Australian standard of living.
The preservation, where possible, of the spiritual link with his own land which gives each Aboriginal his sense of identity and which lies at the heart of his spiritual beliefs.
The need for justice, the need to recognise the spiritual link to land and the need to provide an economic resource for Indigenous people are as strong today as they were 30 years ago. With bipartisan commitment to land rights, the Labor legislation that lapsed at the election of 1975 was adopted and passed in almost original form by the Fraser coalition government. In the debate, the then Liberal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Ian Viner, noted: ‘affinity with the land is fundamental to Aborigines’ sense of identity’.
From the outset, a difficult test was set for those who might try to amend the act. The test began with Woodward, who stressed the importance of it. He said:
… ensuring that none of these interests or rights are further whittled away without consent, except in those cases where the national interest positively demands it—and then only on terms of just compensation.
That is, not without consent and only on the basis of a strong national interest. This is a tough test and it is a test that the Howard government’s bill, which we are debating today, has failed. There was no proper negotiation, no consent and no argument of strong national interest.
That approach and test was reaffirmed by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs in 1999. It was a restatement, if you like, of the Woodward test. The bipartisan report, Unlocking the Future, stated:
The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 (‘the Act’) not be amended without:
traditional Aboriginal owners in the Northern Territory first understanding the nature and purpose of any amendments and as a group giving their consent; and
any Aboriginal communities or groups that may be affected having been consulted and given adequate opportunity to express their views.
Again, this is a test that the Howard government has failed in relation to this bill.
The failure to properly consult, negotiate with and afford basic respect to Aboriginal people in framing and pursuing these changes has engendered broad opposition to the bill. Not a single non-government submission to the very brief Senate inquiry that we were allowed was satisfied with either the bill’s content or the way it had been brought forward. Traditional owners, land councils, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, the Law Council of Australia and the Minerals Council of Australia all had reservations about the bill. The government is on its own in unilaterally reshaping the land rights regime.
Labor is committed to reforms which assist Aboriginal people in gaining maximum benefit from their land. Likewise, we as a party have always promoted the benefit of homeownership and have helped Australians to realise that dream for over a century. We will consider positively any proposal which assists Indigenous Australians to realise the economic potential of their land but we will do so in accord with other strongly held values.
Aboriginal land belongs to Aboriginal people and changes to land tenure on their land need to be negotiated with them and to have their consent. Reforms must be respectful of and appropriate to the principles of Aboriginal communal ownership and ensure the security of their title to Aboriginal land. To diminish their ownership rights as this bill seeks to do must be considered very carefully. Reform is a delicate and nuanced process but one which is achievable with a commitment to negotiation and consent and respect for Indigenous culture.
Aboriginal people, I have found, are very committed to appropriate economic development and they want better services and economic opportunities in their towns. In partnerships with mining interests, they are finding ways to maximise economic development on their communal land. More than 200 Indigenous land use agreements across Australia have helped achieve economic outcomes for traditional landowners and facilitate smoother leasing arrangements.
Labor supports the normalisation of services in townships and communities, and the capacity for Aboriginal homeownership and commercial enterprises in those communities. In spite of the government’s rhetoric, these things can happen under the current ownership system but Labor also accepts that improvements can be made and some new leasing arrangements could promote more efficient development and increase economic activity—for example, the transaction costs in securing a sublease on Aboriginal land can be high in terms of both money and the time it takes. We accept that this can delay development and we are committed to a constructive solution. We share common goals. There are traditional landowner groups who want to find a model that will streamline leasing and encourage economic activity yet preserve their role as decision makers and financial beneficiaries of development on their lands.
Traditional owners in north-east Arnhem Land, Wadeye and Yarrabah in Queensland are talking about long-term leases, but their models reflect their interests as ongoing landholders, not government interests. They are rightly suspicious of a government which will not supply adequate hospitals and schools but argues that taking over their property rights is the solution to their disadvantage. Ironically, elements of this bill are testament to the effective outcomes that can be generated through consultation and negotiation.
The bill includes a number of mining and exploration provisions which seek to streamline economic development opportunities on Aboriginal land. These are a response to concerns raised by mining interests and traditional owners and are in accord with the joint submission of the land councils and the Northern Territory government to the Commonwealth. They are the product of negotiation, have the consent and support of traditional owners and therefore receive Labor’s bipartisan support. Labor is moving an amendment to split this bill so we can expedite the passage of those negotiated mining and exploration provisions and seek to further negotiate tenure reforms which are respectful of Aboriginal ownership traditions and encourage appropriate development on Aboriginal land.
The Howard government’s changes proposed in this bill fall well short of Aboriginal people’s aspirations. The government seeks to characterise the debate as a conflict between land rights and economic development. It promotes a simplistic political paradigm in which Aboriginal people have to choose one or the other—protection of their land rights or the benefits of economic development. For Minister Brough, it is even more simple: he equates it to a choice between homeownership and communism. All other considerations are excluded by this simplistic and erroneous assertion. You can have private homeownership under his plan or continue to live in ‘communist communities’, as he describes them. That is the extent of the respect he shows for Aboriginal law and culture by characterising that observance and that heritage as communism.
There is ample evidence overseas of how communal land tenure and economic development can work successfully together. The government says that leasing arrangements under communal tenure are too time-consuming and represent a significant deterrent to investors and infrastructure development. Their answer is that the ownership rights of Aboriginal people therefore need to be diluted. Labor says: there are better answers. To the Howard government, land rights are a blockage that needs to be cleared away. For them this is not a policy debate but the continuation of an ideological battle—a rejection of a rights based approach—and what they now call a practical approach.
The commitment the coalition showed to land rights in the Fraser years seems a long time ago. They argue that because land rights have not delivered an end to Indigenous disadvantage they are somehow part of the problem. For Indigenous people and for Labor, economic development and land rights are not mutually exclusive. They are not ends to be chosen between. It is not a choice between economic development and communal ownership; it is a debate about how we best promote economic development on Aboriginal land.
Land rights are a basic legal ownership framework within which we can develop solutions to the particular challenges facing Indigenous communities and landowners. The government is presenting Aboriginal people with very difficult choices. In the hope of a decent economic chance and opportunities for homeownership, they are asked to trade off control of their land, which could effectively be for four generations, given the appalling mortality rates of Indigenous people.
No other Australian landowner would receive such an ultimatum from the government and no other Australian landowner would be expected to tolerate such interference in their property rights. The government’s defence of this criticism is that the scheme they are proposing is voluntary, and that should provide us all with enough reassurance. But these statements that the leasing scheme would be voluntary have been seriously undermined by the minister’s own approach in recent months.
Minister Brough and the government are using their powerful position to coerce communities into signing up to the leasing proposal. On two occasions it sought to link a total of $60 million in education and housing funds to an Aboriginal agreement to enter into a 99-year lease with the government. In a media release on 19 June 2006, Minister Brough stated:
Around fifty houses will be built and real jobs provided, if the community is safe and signs up to full school attendance, a no-drugs no-violence policy and agree to a 99 year lease.
You will get the houses if you sign up for the lease. This casts serious doubt on any assurances that the scheme is voluntary and raises concerns as to whether Aboriginal people are now being required to bargain away their land rights to secure basic services to which they are entitled as a right of citizenship.
Any amendment to the land rights regime needs to be intellectually sound and well thought out. Two recent government concessions on this bill are a clear indication that the original proposals were flawed and that the government is making it up on the run. The government has backed away from the five per cent cap proposal on rental income and the condition that Aboriginal people could not negotiate for any pecuniary interest aside from rent. I understand that as late as a couple of hours ago more amendments were circulated.
These changes are an acknowledgment that the government’s proposals in their original form were flawed and were not supported by Aboriginal people, whom we would have seen refuse to take up the scheme. The government is madly churning to try and ensure that it is able to implement the scheme given the hurdle it has in terms of Aboriginal agreement. But with the minister fixing up the holes in his policy as he goes, it is clear the plan has not been thought through and that the weaknesses stem in part from the failure to negotiate and seek Aboriginal consent.
The government simply asserts that this bill will facilitate homeownership and be a panacea for the entrenched disadvantage faced by Indigenous Australians. Of course, no evidence is produced to support that claim. It has floundered to provide answers to the important questions. How will Indigenous people, with some of the lowest incomes in the country, be able to service large mortgages? How will homeownership be achievable in the most remote regions of Australia where construction costs are high and incomes are low? What will happen to the traditional lands of those who default? Will this scheme see much Aboriginal land divested from its traditional owners, as was the case in Canada and the USA with their experiments? We are asked to take the government’s assertions and this bill on trust. This bill is desperately lacking detail and the Senate should not be and cannot be expected to pass legislation with so much important detail unseen—detail that goes to the very heart of Indigenous ownership and control of their land.
The government has been unable to indicate how the Northern Territory or Commonwealth government entities holding a 99-year headlease will be formulated or how they will work. Yet their formulation is critical to the degree of traditional owner representation and influence over future developments on their land—a key consideration for them and for Labor. The government has likewise been unable to indicate whether traditional owners will have to pay rent to these entities in order to lease back land that they already own. Labor cannot accept these changes when it is clear that so little has been thought through and when there are so many critical flaws in the policy.
The bill also includes a range of measures pertaining to land councils and their funding and independence and to the minister’s interference in the role of land councils. Labor has serious concerns about a number of those measures. However, they are consistent with the Howard government’s history of sidelining Indigenous voices and undermining Indigenous organisations. They do nothing for Aboriginal people and they look very much like the government is again seeking to tell Aboriginal people what to do rather than holding a meaningful discussion with them about the way forward. Some of the proposals in this legislation give the minister unheard-of powers and seriously undermine Indigenous control over their property.
This is a government which is strong on the rhetoric of traditional values of courtesy and respect—respect for elders and respect for property rights. It is a government which uses the rhetoric of small government to limit its interference in the rights of individuals to conduct their lives as they see fit. Why do these same values not apply when it comes to its dealings with Indigenous people? It is time the Howard government showed Aboriginal people some respect, showed elders some respect and showed some respect for Indigenous property rights. If the government cannot bring itself to show some respect for Aboriginal culture and connection to the land, then it should at least respect Aboriginal people’s right to be dealt with as citizens.
The land rights act was the first and most substantial legal instrument of its kind and, as such, is one of huge symbolic and practical importance to Indigenous people in the Northern Territory. The act is a demonstration that we can work to do justice in the shadow of injustice and that our legal system is expansive enough to accommodate different cultural and legal systems and principles. It conferred significant landholdings on traditional owners which are available for their economic opportunities. But the government’s failure to respect Aboriginal cultural principles, negotiate with the owners of the land or get their consent in pursuing the changes contained in this bill show a shocking level of disrespect for Indigenous people.
The government is arguing that land rights have not provided the economic benefit to eliminate Indigenous disadvantage and is therefore seeking to construct a Hobson’s choice for Indigenous people—choose between your rights to land and your rights to economic development. I do not believe it is beyond the wit of traditional owners and the government to devise land tenure arrangements which streamline development without fundamentally undermining Indigenous ownership and control of the land. Labor urges the government to go back and negotiate with Aboriginal people and talk with them, not at them. Then I am certain we will have a much better result than that proposed in this bill. The bill is an affront to Aboriginal Australians and to the bipartisanship that we should be seeking to gain in dealing with land rights legislation. I urge the Senate not to accept the bill in its current form.",SENATE,<title>ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS (NORTHERN TERRITORY) AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,20,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-08-08,"—The Democrats do not support the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 2006 as it stands. There are components within it that have been developed through ongoing consultation with Indigenous peoples in the Northern Territory and with other stakeholders over a prolonged period of time, particularly with regard to the area of mining. Those components are the ones that clearly have the support of traditional owners and land councils and are the ones that we will not oppose.
But there are other components of this legislation which, despite all the talk of nine years of consultation, did not appear in any form until late last year or earlier this year. Some of the other components of the legislation actually go in the other direction, to findings of various reports that were brought down as part of previous consultations. So let us once and for all, from the start, put aside any farcical deception that this legislation has been the subject of ongoing consultation at the community level for the last nine years. Some components of it have been, but there are key, vital components that have not.
We only have to look at the evidence given to the disgracefully short Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into the legislation—by one of the few Indigenous voices at traditional owner level who were able to give their views—to see quite clearly that traditional owners are not aware of some of the components of this legislation, are not supportive of other components and have not been consulted on them. If we look at the Senate committee transcript of that single day of hearings in Darwin, we see that the officers from the federal government’s Office of Indigenous Policy Coordination made it quite clear that they had not spoken to traditional owners about some of the newer key, crucial and controversial components of the legislation; they admitted that up-front. They had spoken to the land councils, not to consult them but to inform them as to what the government was proposing, and left it at that. This is from the part of our government that is now responsible for overseeing all activities in the area of Indigenous policy. If there were any one group of people in the entire armoury of the federal bureaucracy who should know the importance of meaningful consultation with traditional owners, particularly on matters that directly affect them, it would have to be the people at the top of the Office of Indigenous Policy Coordination. But they did not do that consultation—they openly admitted that—and from what I could see they did not see any reason why they should have.
I drew the attention of the Senate committee and the officers of the OIPC to the submission from the government’s own Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner which in part went to public commitments by this government in the domestic and international arenas with regard to the rights of Indigenous peoples—principles they had agreed to follow with regard to dealing with Indigenous peoples on issues and decisions that directly affected them. The core of those is the principle of free and informed consent by Indigenous peoples to legislative changes that directly affect their rights. The response from the OIPC officer—I think he was one of those who stayed in Canberra; he could not even be bothered to travel to appear before the committee in Darwin but gave evidence by phone—was, ‘Well, the concept of free and informed consent is a bit fuzzy around the edges.’ Like many legal concepts, international or domestic, it is fuzzy around the edges. But the fact that something is fuzzy around the edges should not be used as an excuse when it is quite clear what the heart of it involves. And it is quite clear that what this government did was not make any effort at all to give effect to any free and informed consent. How can there be free and informed consent when there is not even any informing in the first place? It does not matter how fuzzy the definition is; that is right outside any definition of free and informed consent.
So we have yet another example of lots of lofty-sounding rhetoric from this government, trying to fool people into thinking that they are doing things the right way, that they have some genuine commitment to these basic principles. But, when you look at the reality of what they do on the ground, there is not even a pretence of following these principles; they are treated with total disdain, complete contempt. Unfortunately, that is not just disdain and contempt for a nice-sounding principle; it is disdain and contempt for the Indigenous peoples themselves, for the traditional owners. I find that extremely offensive and very distressing.
When the previous minister announced by way of a media conference, towards the end of last year, this new idea about township leases, I spoke on that subject in the Senate. She did not give a ministerial statement in the Senate, because that is out of fashion. Important matters affecting the public are now announced via a media doorstop interview outside. Ministers very rarely bother to announce them through statements in the parliament now, thus making it more difficult to debate them. But, when I did speak on the matter a couple of times towards the end of last year, I spoke quite specifically about the need for direct engagement and consultation with the people who are affected, the people at the community level. No matter how fantastically brilliant the government thinks these changes are, if they are not going to involve the peoples whose land is affected, whose rights are directly affected; if they are not going to talk to them and treat them with respect, dignity and basic courtesy; if they are just going to impose it on them as another brilliant idea from Canberra, then the chances of it working are dramatically reduced. Of course, that is exactly what has happened. Not even the slightest effort was made.
What that says to me is not that the government did not think about it—of course they would have thought about it. What it quite clearly says is that there is no genuine commitment to try to make these changes work. If there were, there would be genuine engagement with the people who these changes affect. That is not a political or ideological point; that is just basic common sense. If you want a community to work with changes and to make those changes work effectively, then you work with them. You do not just drop it on them from a hundred miles above and then try to convince them afterwards that it is a fabulous thing that is going to be good for them, particularly not when it is something as fundamental as this, and particularly given our extremely sad and sorry history with regard to the dispossession of Aboriginal people.
It seems the latest form of conservative political correctness these days is that you are not allowed to talk about Indigenous history. You are not allowed to talk about symbolism or rights because we all have to be practical, and if you talk about history you are looking backwards, and we have got to look forward; we cannot be trapped in the past. I agree that we cannot be trapped in the past, but there is no way we can walk effectively into the future unless we honestly acknowledge how we got to where we are today. And there has been no honest acknowledgement of how we have got to where we are. That is part of why changes like these can be made with such contempt and such dismissiveness, not just towards the Senate and the parliament—we in the Senate are getting used to being treated with contempt—but, far more importantly and far more unforgivably, towards Indigenous people.
That, to me, is the core problem with this legislation. I have stated publicly a number of times that, even though I have concerns with the specifics of some aspects of the legislation, if the traditional owners, or a reasonable proportion of them, were to make it clear that they were broadly supportive of these changes going through then I would vote for them anyway because this law is, first and foremost, a law regarding the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory. If they are supportive of it then that is their business. But the evidence is quite clear, even from the very limited Senate inquiry that we had, that they are not supportive of it.
I should emphasise and put on the record that this legislation first appeared at the end of May—less than 2½ months ago. The initial indication from the government when requests were first made to refer it to a Senate committee was that that could not happen, because it had to pass by the end of June. The initial insistence from the government and from the minister was that this had to be pushed through within less than a month. With some strong urgings—urgings that it was in the government’s interest, let alone basic due process and decency—there was agreement to hold the briefest possible Senate committee inquiry. I sometimes wonder these days whether Senate committee inquiries that are impossibly short just give the government a fig leaf to make it look like they have engaged in consultation when they have not.
I note that a number of people, including important witnesses such as Oxfam Australia, did not put in submissions to the inquiry, because they did not have time, in the extremely short time frame available, to put in meaningful submissions. The committee did not have time to take evidence from some of the people we would have liked to have had evidence from. The report of the committee, which included government members, categorically stated that there was insufficient time for the committee to properly scrutinise the legislation. With legislation as fundamental as this you cannot get a more basic description of contempt than that. The Senate committee members, including the government members, openly stated that there was insufficient time to scrutinise it. How contemptuous can you get?
And it is not just traditional owners that we were not able to hear from. Other important bodies I would have liked to have had more evidence from included, particularly, the Minerals Council of Australia. When you have the mining industry in the Territory lining up with Indigenous people in the Territory in expressing concerns about some of these changes then you know something is deeply wrong. If you look at the detail of the changes, you can see why. There is a consistent pattern coming out, with many different pieces of legislation in a wide range of areas being forced through the Senate, of more power being centralised in the hands of the national government.
We have heard a number of federal government ministers in recent times speaking more and more frequently about the need to get more and more power into the hands of federal government. Whatever the area is, it seems that the government’s solution is to give more power to themselves. That is what they have done in the area of Indigenous affairs; we have already seen it in a wide range of other areas. In the administration of Indigenous issues, under the guise of so-called mainstreaming, we have had the government taking full control. Even though all the rhetoric is of opening up more opportunities for economic development for Indigenous people, creating more flexibility and generating opportunities for enterprise, what you see when you look at the detail is more control for the minister.
That is why the Minerals Council are also concerned about some of these changes. Indeed, even where you had amendments recommended by the land councils, by the Northern Territory government and by the minerals industry, the government did not make some of those changes in particular areas, because that would have meant them relinquishing control and giving more control and power to the land councils, the traditional owners and industry to work it out amongst themselves. You would have thought that a government like this, with all their ideological rhetoric, would be all for any opportunity for government to get out of the way and allow Aboriginal people and industry to figure it all out for themselves without red tape, without bureaucracy and without government interference.
If you look at all of the contentious changes in this legislation, you see that they all have one thing in common: they either give more power to the minister and the government or they take power away from Aboriginal Australians. Sometimes they do both in one measure. When you look at that you see a pattern, and that is why it is not sufficient for the minister to give vague assurances that there will be no coercion of Aboriginal people to sign up to 99-year leases on their townships—that it will all be voluntary. He can say that now, but once the legislation is passed there is no way of preventing people from being coerced in all sorts of ways into leases that they would rather not enter into.
If you look at some of the other changes in the legislation, you see changes that increase the minister’s control over the budgets of the land councils. Previously, there was a legislative minimum that land councils had to receive each year. They had a guaranteed floor that they knew they would receive each year in funding. That is now to be taken away. What other possible reason could there be for that, other than for the federal minister to have more power, more influence and more ability to provide implicit threats to the land councils? If they do not do the right thing then their budgets can be diminished. Anybody that suggests that does not and would not happen is either a fool or a liar. It happens time and time again. It is not a practice solely the province of the current federal government; it is the practice of governments state and federal, Labor and Liberal, over a long period of time. It seems to have got worse, I might say, in recent times, at both state and federal levels; it is a practice that we all know happens. If this legislation goes through, it will be a clear example of where there is a major weapon in the back pocket of the minister. The minister will be able to require the land councils to do what he wants and to inflict punishment if that does not happen.
In addition to that, the minister now gets power to be able to override a land council’s refusal to delegate powers and functions. Supposedly, there is more flexibility because the land council can delegate more easily, and that is good, and they can also decide that they do not want to and keep the decision with themselves. But under this legislation they can have that overridden from left field by the minister. We have the potential for the minister to be able, against the land council’s wishes, to more easily establish smaller land councils. These are the sorts of provisions that were opposed and have been opposed by the Minerals Council for the simple reason that it will increase uncertainty. It will mean the potential for dealing with different people and different bodies making different decisions about the same situation. This legislation has the real prospect, which perhaps in some respects could please some environmentalists, of making it more difficult to establish mining in the Northern Territory. It actually increases the potential complexity and the prospect of bureaucratic interference.
The other aspect which I think really does need emphasising is: who will be paying for any 99-year leases that occur over townships? Remember, this is the government’s brand new idea. The government have not consulted with traditional owners and it has not been part of the long reconsideration of this act to have a 99-year headlease over a township. Yet any rents payable to traditional owners who agree to lease their land will come not from the lessee, like the Northern Territory government, for example, but from the existing pool of money already set aside for Aboriginal people which has been directly derived from mining royalties on Aboriginal land. Frankly, every time I look at this I think there must be a mistake. They could not be so brazen as to say under the guise of providing economic opportunity for Aboriginal people, ‘You can rent your land to somebody else for 99 years and the money to pay for that rent will come from your own money that has already been set aside.’ Not a single new cent will be provided to assist in the so-called economic development for Aboriginal people under this act if any of these leases are agreed to. The money will come from funds already set aside for the benefit of Aboriginal people and derived directly from mining royalties from their own land. So, to pay for leases, the government is now going to dip into that set amount of money already there and meant to be used for Aboriginal people.
There are a range of other aspects that need some questioning in the committee stage. One of the downsides of not having time for proper committee inquiries is that in the committee stage of debate we have to ask the questions on the floor of the chamber. The government might think that it saves time by having short committee inquiries but it actually chews up the time of the Senate as a whole. I will explore some of those other matters later.",SENATE,<title>ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS (NORTHERN TERRITORY) AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,20,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2006-08-08,"—The Greens believe that elements of these amendments are bad legislation. We are concerned that some of the amendments contained in the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 2006 will have significant impacts on Aboriginal communities. These are the biggest changes in over 20 years to what is considered in Australia to be landmark legislation that covers a large proportion of Aboriginal controlled land in this country—up to 50 per cent of the Northern Territory. Yet it is being rushed through the Senate with undue haste, causing significant community confusion and concern. The government claims that there has been sufficient community consultation going back over a number of years on this bill. This is disingenuous. While it is true that there has been consultation on some of it, there has not been on the controversial elements. It is telling to note that on the aspects of the bill that have had proper stakeholder input there is little controversy and broad community support.
I was interested to note today when we were talking about the heritage protection bill in this place that Senator Kemp made the point that the government will be consulting. He said:
One of the reasons that this government has been able to get itself re-elected is that it does have a reputation for being a consultative government. It is a government that gets out and it listens.
It has not consulted on this issue. Let me state here very clearly that as far as these sections of the bill are concerned—those amendments arising from the joint submission made by the four land councils and the NT government in 2003 and designed to improve the workability of the legislation as it relates to mining agreements—the community supports them and we support them. As far as the other newer proposed changes are concerned—those that have not had proper community consultation and around which there is significant community concern—we do not support them. We believe that they need to go back to the community and the government needs to get it right.
There are a number of unintended consequences of this legislation which will create disincentives for economic development and homeownership in Aboriginal communities and make it more difficult and costly to resolve issues and develop agreements. Ultimately, they will prove counterproductive to the stated aims of this legislation. To this end we are proposing that the bill be split to allow further development and consultation on those elements of the bill that are contentious and those that have not been adequately discussed. Let us move into law immediately those sections of the bill on which there is broad agreement and defer the newer parts for further work and further community consultation.
We strongly support the idea that problems associated with economic opportunities in Aboriginal lands urgently need to be addressed and we strongly support moves that remove disincentives to investment and enterprise development that benefit Aboriginal communities. We support moves to streamline processes and get rid of unnecessary red tape, but not if they disadvantage Aboriginal communities. We support increased positive incentives to encourage business and employment opportunities for Aboriginal people.
If the government is genuine about economic development for Aboriginal communities then it needs to take time to address these issues effectively, talk to the experts in Indigenous development and look at what has and has not worked both here and overseas. If the government is genuinely concerned about creating real jobs and homeownership for its Aboriginal citizens then it will not push through these ill-informed changes in their current form. Instead, it will present a package of amendments, projects and programs to address economic development.
Given how wrongheaded these amendments are and the government’s apparent unwillingness to support deferring this legislation, I must question the government’s motives to rush this legislation through. The ultimate aim of this legislation may be to diminish the power of land councils, destabilise government structures, increase the power of the minister and take away control from traditional owners so that outsiders can come in and exploit their land and resources.
It is interesting to note that remote Aboriginal communities that are not on Aboriginal land face many of the same problems and constraints as those communities where land rights have been granted, yet the government is not moving to deal with these issues. The issue of facilitating economic development on Aboriginal land, particularly in relation to developing enterprise and employment opportunities for remote Aboriginal communities, is an extremely important one that requires a considered and concerted approach. We are pleased to see that the government is now demonstrating a willingness to address this issue, but the current approach will not prove effective.
The main impediment to economic development in Aboriginal communities is not the issue of land tenure and private leases. Housing access, rather than individual house ownership, is an issue. There are many more pressing issues that need addressing. Constraints to economic development include the incredible remoteness, transaction costs, transport costs, limited opportunities, small population sizes with no economies of scale, the lack of equity in terms of low income and low rates of employment and, in particular, the lack of education, training and infrastructure. These are all issues that constrain economic development.
I note with interest a report that has just been released by Reconciliation Australia which looks at Indigenous community governance. It is a research project and it also looks at socioeconomic development. It points out that common factors for successful socioeconomic development include:
... strong visionary leadership; strong culturally-based institutions of governance; sound, stable management and professional staff support; strategic networking with public or private sector partners to engage with the wider economy; having infrastructure substantially in place; having access to relevant training and mentoring opportunities; and hard-headed strategic planning and review procedures.
It goes on to say:
While improved governance can strengthen economic development, given the rapidly growing Indigenous population there is an urgent need to increase investments in infrastructure and essential services if current levels of socioeconomic development are not to stagnate or go backwards.
The majority equity that Aboriginal communities have to use to promote economic development is their land. The way that land rights and native title work in Australia makes that much more difficult because, unlike in other countries, communities are not granted full freehold lease title, which greatly limits the amount by which they can benefit from resource exploitation, such as mining.
The Northern Territory has very restrictive tenure arrangements over community living areas that basically mean that Aboriginal people cannot undertake economic development opportunities in Aboriginal town sites. If the Commonwealth and the Territory believe that tenure is the main impediment to economic development, why are they not fixing these issues? Why are they only looking at these issues on Aboriginal land? What Aboriginal people need is the ability to enter into joint ventures, to enter directly into these enterprises and to develop their equity. However, at the moment they are restrained in their ability to bring money to the table.
A number of aspects of this legislation are cause for concern—for example, the provision to create 99-year headleases, under the new section 19A. We believe this will not result in either an increase in private homeownership or more enterprise being developed in townships on Aboriginal land. At the same time, this may have a number of unintended consequences that undermine the prospects for economic development. The community is very concerned that headleasing and subleasing provisions could mean that traditional owners relinquish control and cannot prevent inappropriate commercial development on subleased land—for example, liquor outlets subleased in dry communities. Unless traditional owners are convinced that there are provisions to ensure that economic benefits to them are safeguarded, this uncertainty will act as a disincentive to grant any such leases.
It is arguable that there is no need to introduce this new headleasing scheme because private leases are already available under the existing section 19. This has already happened with the Alice-to-Darwin railway and with the gas-processing plant near Wadeye. The reason individual private leases for housing are not already happening is an issue of demand, not of the difficulty of the process. Most people in Aboriginal communities simply do not have the income to buy their own homes, even if they want to, nor do they have the money to maintain them. As I said previously, the issue is to do with access to housing.
If the issue is the complexity of developing leases under the current section 19 provisions then the government should simply look at streamlining the existing section, rather than develop a whole new 99-year headlease scheme which vests control in an outside entity. The Northern Territory government entity that controls the subleases remains totally unknown. The Northern Territory legislation has not been drafted and there is no information available on the powers and composition of this entity or how it will operate. Is it to be a not-for-profit entity? If not, where do the sublease profits go? If the rental for the headlease is fixed, can the entity make a profit from the sublease? What say do the traditional owners then have in the approval of the subleases?
Under the fixed terms of the 99-year lease, traditional owners lose control for four generations. This could mean that they lose the chance to respond to future opportunities when the situation on the ground changes and some real opportunities for economic development emerge. It is unclear whether this means that the rent remains fixed as well. Traditional owners are concerned that they may lose control over townships on their land to community residents from other cultural groups. It is the land councils who will be negotiating the conditions of the lease. When this is taken in combination with the provisions creating new land councils—where 55 per cent of members live nearby and are not necessarily the traditional owners of the land—and delegating the functions of a land council to Aboriginal corporations, who are not necessarily working in the best interests of the traditional owners, this creates a problem. It could mean that a group of residents who are not the traditional owners of the land on which a town site is located could effectively be taking control of a township lease.
The government has asserted that these headleases will be purely voluntary. However, the committee inquiry heard evidence of at least two cases where communities have been required to sign on to headleases in exchange for the delivery of what are arguably basic and essential services. On Elcho Island, I understand that Minister Brough has sent an open letter to the community, giving them two months to sign on to a headlease if they want funding for 50 so-called additional houses to meet chronic unmet need. Given the severe housing shortage on Elcho Island, the provision of adequate housing is an essential service—not, as the minister claims, a discretionary one.
Then we look at the Tiwi Islands and the secondary boarding school. The OIPC have argued that this is not an essential service, but a discretionary extra, because it will be a private boarding school. This is despite the fact that there is an urgent need for secondary schooling on the Tiwi Islands and the government has a long record of providing resources for private school infrastructure elsewhere with no strings attached.
The Department of Education, Science and Training stated clearly in Senate estimates, when cross-examined by Senator Crossin, that the $10 million was conditional on signing the headlease. Housing and education are essential government services that most Australians take for granted. Federal, state and territory governments have been failing in their obligation to deliver these services to Aboriginal communities for decades. Where the provision of essential services is woefully inadequate, it is disingenuous to claim that requiring Aboriginal communities to sign away their rights in exchange for ‘extra’ services is a voluntary decision. This amounts to coercion.
What this government is effectively doing is selling to Aboriginal communities the services we take for granted as our rights as citizens. It is doing this by requiring them to sign away control over their communities and by using ABA moneys to pay for town-planning services which are normally provided by local government.
We have similar concerns about the delegation of land council powers. These provisions are highly likely to undermine the stability and workability of the land councils and to promote dispute and litigation. There is a very big difference between enabling the land councils to delegate some of their responsibilities to regional bodies to make it quicker and easier to deal with local and regional issues and what is proposed in this bill. Proposed sections 28B and 28C are a radical departure from the normal administrative rules relating to delegation of powers. Proposed section 28B means that once a delegation is made it cannot be varied or revoked by the land council, except at the request of the delegate or on the say-so of the minister. The minister can unilaterally grant a variation or rescind it by written direction to the land council—whether they want it or not.
Proposed section 28C means that the minister can delegate powers if a land council refuses to do so. This is not delegation; this is a mechanism to strip and reallocate the core functions given to land councils under the act. Proposed section 28D means that while a delegation is in force a land council cannot exercise its functions regarding that subregion. However, at the same time the land council must provide the corporation with the powers that have been delegated to it and facilities and assistance to perform the delegated functions. There will be an increased demand on limited resources combined with confusion and inefficiency brought about by the duplication of services. The council is still ultimately responsible for its statutory obligations but may no longer be in a position to carry them out.
This is madness. It is clearly politics of divide and conquer. We expect that it will increase conflict and litigation. We believe that this will diminish the potential for economic development in remote communities. It will scare off partners or investors, not encourage them. These provisions are not about simply enabling more efficient and effective decision making about regional issues at the regional level. Giving the minister the power to override land councils subverts their existing governance and accountability arrangements for no appreciable gain. We believe that if the government is serious about fast-tracking development it should drop altogether the proposed provisions under sections 28C, 28D, 28E and 28F.
Then we come to the establishment of new land councils. Some well-thought-out and sensible recommendations on how to create new land councils were provided in the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs Unlocking the future, in 1999. It is ridiculous that the government has ignored these recommendations and effectively gone back to the approach of the discredited Reeves report—of which the committee report was universally critical—and is seeking, for ideological reasons, to effectively dismantle the two large land councils by other means.
At the same time as this plan for breaking up the land councils is going ahead, there has been an ongoing process under native title to create larger native title representative bodies because of the obvious benefits in terms of capacity, resources and economies of scale. We do not believe that a 55 per cent vote represents a substantial majority, and we believe that having such a low threshold increases the likelihood of internal conflict and instability. Because the bill specifies only 55 per cent of ‘people living nearby’, we are concerned that traditional owners could be sidelined and disempowered by Aboriginal people from other cultural groups who do not have rights and responsibilities for that area of the land.
Then we come to the use of the Aboriginals Benefit Account. We do not believe that the use of the Aboriginals Benefit Account to fund the new leasing arrangements is appropriate, and we support the concerns of the Minerals Council of Australia—it is very unusual for the Greens to support concerns of the Minerals Council of Australia—that the ABA moneys are increasingly being seen as a substitute for government funding of basic social services. We are concerned that, by effectively taking over administration of ABA funds, the government is undermining the fund’s role in encouraging and supporting economic development initiatives. It is simply outrageous that ABA money is being used to fund changes that the communities do not want and do not support. We also have concerns about the termination of non-contiguous claims to intertidal zones, riverbeds and banks, and we believe that further work is required to resolve this issue in a satisfactory manner.
I want to very quickly touch on the issue of the Senate inquiry and committee report. We were extremely disappointed at the limited time allowed for the Senate inquiry, which gave stakeholders a very short space of time to put in submissions, and the fact that there was only a one-day inquiry. The committee listed a number of substantial issues with the bill; however, its final recommendation that the legislation should go ahead and further community consultation should be allowed after the act has been put in place `is inappropriate. It is not the way to deal with substantive issues of this kind. Because these changes will have such unintended consequences, we believe that just going back to communities after the fact to deal with the changes in this legislation will be impossible.
This legislation needs to be split. The elements that do not have community support and that will have such unintended consequences, such as the impacts on communities, land councils and traditional owners, should be withdrawn and should go out for community consultation. If the government is genuine about promoting economic development in Aboriginal communities, it needs to come back with a fully consulted and considered package that genuinely addresses the fundamental constraints to economic development in Aboriginal communities. Subleasing and promoting individual homeownership and a miraculous belief that that will therefore deal with all the economic problems in Aboriginal communities is, to my mind, wrongheaded. This bill needs to be split.",SENATE,<title>ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS (NORTHERN TERRITORY) AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,20,1,speech
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2006-08-08,"—I am happy to rise in my place today to indicate my support for the legislation on the table, the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 2006. Indicating one’s view about this legislation does rather depend on whether you see the possible shortcomings in it or the potential that it holds. For my part, I believe this legislation should properly be characterised as a bill which offers an enormous opportunity for growth, empowerment and economic development for at least certain parts of the Aboriginal communities of the Northern Territory.
This legislation in particular addresses the fact that there have been 30 years or so of land claims in the Northern Territory, resulting in approximately half of the land area of the Northern Territory being Indigenous-owned but, in that period, relatively little economic exploitation for the benefit of Aboriginal people, traditional owners, of the land that has come into their legal ownership under these reforms, which were enacted in 1976 by the Fraser government. I believe anybody who observes the state of Aboriginal Australia today needs to acknowledge that part of the solution to the very many problems faced by Indigenous Australians is to give them greater access to economic power and the capacity to fund and resource solutions to the problems that they face.
I see—and, of course, the federal government sees and, to a large extent, the Northern Territory government sees—the reforms in this legislation as being part and parcel of the program to give Aboriginal Australians in the Northern Territory greater economic clout, greater capacity to exploit their most valuable resource, which, in many ways, is the land that is traditionally theirs. These are the most comprehensive reforms to Aboriginal land rights legislation since it was introduced in 1976. I believe it does allow for greater economic returns on land which have not been fully identified, understood and, certainly, exploited.
In many ways, we need to change the paradigm which operates in communities in the Northern Territory. It is a paradigm which could be said to have let down Aboriginal people. I believe that the dynamics and considerations that apply in the rest of Australia—issues such as home ownership and the capacity to secure access to resources that will be an ongoing source of economic wealth—are equally to be exploited within the context of Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory. These changes will make it easier for Aboriginal people to own their own homes and for businesses to operate in the Northern Territory on Aboriginal land in the way that they operate in other parts of Australia.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-08-08,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
This document is the 2004-05 annual report of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Services, ATSIS, which was an executive agency of the Commonwealth within what was then the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. It was established on 1 July 2003 as an interim measure and a means of implementing what the government called a separation of powers within the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. It was staffed largely through the transfer of ATSIC staff.
ATSIS was abolished, along with ATSIC, in 2005. This report covers the final period of ATSIS, the closure period, until March 2005. As the report says, the abolition of ATSIC and the administrative arrangements to disperse ATSIS programs, functions and staff to other agencies were undertaken by the current federal government as a move to what they called a whole-of-government approach. This report deals with the winding down or closure period. In that context, it is probably not massively enlightening in terms of the overall scenario of the administration of services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. But I want to take the opportunity to look at the process that has followed on from the winding up of ATSIS, particularly this move to the so-called whole-of-government approach.
I will not revisit the debate we have just had about the Office of Indigenous Policy Coordination and their role with regard to the land rights legislation. I want to talk about another example of what has occurred with the government’s move to this whole-of-government approach and the winding up of bodies like ATSIS, which was not without its flaws.
A couple of weeks ago, I travelled to a number of Aboriginal communities in the Cape York area of Queensland, including Mapoon, Napranum, Hopevale and Wudja Wudjil, as well as a couple over in the gulf—in particular, Burketown and the Yarrabah community near Cairns. Predominantly, I went to listen to people and to hear what issues they believed were important in each of those different communities. Every community is different, despite the fact that we tend to take a one-size-fits-all approach to debates about and policies for Indigenous affairs. Even in just that one region of far North Queensland there are big differences between the communities.
One thing that came out very clearly was the very damaging effect on these communities as a direct consequence of the government’s changes to the Community Development Employment Project, CDEP. What has happened to a number of those communities, most notably Mapoon and Napranum out of the ones that I visited, is that the contract for the administration of CDEP has been taken away from the councils that had been running them for a long period of time and been given to an outside service provider, a Job Network agency, which now has to run the CDEP program.
Councils like Mapoon are widely recognised as operating very effectively with a very small number of people—there are around about 300 in that community, I believe, with about half of them being under 18. That council manages to run services over a much wider area than your average local government does. Yet they had their CDEP funding taken away from them with about a week’s notice, with it given to a service provider from out of town who did not even have programs ready to run. The bizarre scenario for that community is that it actually had people operating under a no work, no pay situation for a number of years suddenly being told that they all had to go on holidays because the new service provider did not have programs ready.
The brilliant whole-of-government approach of the federal government has led to sit-down money being paid on cape communities. What a fantastic reform! That is the sort of brain surgery we have had from some of the brilliant people now running this whole-of-government approach in Canberra. It is a reminder of how we are going back and repeating the same mistakes again. What we need are people who are willing to work on the ground rather than just pursue their ideological agendas and ignore the consequences. This is one more example of where the consequences on the ground go in the opposite direction to the rhetoric. (Time expired)

Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Services</title>,DOCUMENTS,21,1,speech
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2006-08-08,"—Tonight I wish to raise a few issues with regard to sports broadcasting. The first one refers to Caroline Wilson’s article 10 days ago that raised the question of AFL broadcasting rights with regard to radio. That article explained that there are likely to be A and B packages, and that only commercial stations could afford the A package. That raises the prospect of the ABC having to take the B package, in other words, to broadcast the less crucial games at the worst times. I think that would be an appalling development.
The Australian Broadcasting Corporation has been dealing with football for over 70 years in a broadcast sense. It has its own niche market. It is crucial to broadcasting to every element in Australia, unlike commercial radio, and overseas. If it were placed in the position where it could only get a B package, no doubt it would give long-term consideration to withdrawing from football broadcasting. It does 11½ hours on a Saturday and six hours on a Sunday. It is not just about service delivery. It is about the culture of the game. This is about developing and integrating football into Australian society. I think that if it were cut out of the loop just for a few extra dollars, it would be a tragedy.
Since the article, there has been the normal revolt by ABC viewers. But I have to say that, in reaction to it, I heard last Friday on the morning breakfast show Andrew Demetriou saying that he did not think it was going to happen. He has been a very capable administrator, so I will not pursue this any further tonight, on the basis that I think he will solve it. There is a role for government in this, though. It is not just about saying, ‘We fund the ABC,’ and leaving it at that. It is almost a community service obligation for the AFL to see that football reaches everyone in Australia—people with a whole different set of tastes. I just hope that will be resolved.
While I am on the question of sports broadcasting, anyone who has travelled internationally will have realised how important cricket is in the subcontinent and that Australia is more famous in the subcontinent for cricket than for any other subject. The average Pakistani or Indian could tell you who the Australian cricket captain is; they would struggle to tell you who the Prime Minister or the Treasurer of Australia is. It is something by which we are judged by a very large proportion of the population of this globe.
It was with massive disappointment that this morning I saw the crass and racist comments made by Dean Jones. They were appalling comments. Here you have an Australian broadcaster going to the subcontinent and to South Africa and talking about a terrorist taking a catch. It just happened to be the one Islamic member of the South African cricket side—a devout and religious person who always adheres to his religious principles, to the point at which he does not have the beer logo on his uniform because he is Islamic. But what do we have? An Australian face in the subcontinent—the one Australian commentator who is there—saying, ‘A terrorist has just taken a catch.’ The South African cricketer was called that simply because he is a faithful adherent to the Islamic religion.
Maybe a bit of my prejudice is coming through here, too. I regard Dean Jones as the worst cricket commentator that I have ever heard in 50 years of following cricket. People around this building will know of my previous complaints after listening to his inept, inaccurate and racist broadcasts—his utter incompetence. You do not hear it so much now because Foxtel does not carry many of the subcontinental games. Foxtel tends to broadcast cricket out of England—as it does at the moment—New Zealand and South Africa. It is not just because of a lack of interest; it is because of broadcast quality pictures and a range of things. But what we are now facing is that there are a hundred million Muslims in India; the overwhelming population of Bangladesh is Islamic, as is that of Pakistan; and there are quite a few Muslims in Sri Lanka. They all heard that comment.
Dean Jones has apologised. He said that he did not mean for the comment to go to air, just like Mel Gibson did not mean for his public comments in Los Angeles two weeks ago to become public, but they have become public. I just hope that Australian broadcasters note the reaction out of the subcontinent and never employ Dean Jones again, because he does not deserve it. He does not deserve to be employed in cricket commentary anywhere around the globe.
I was somewhat critical of Michael Slater’s cricket broadcast three or four years ago. Here is a role model for Dean Jones. Here is a broadcaster who was pretty average three or four years ago, but, month by month, he improved. He set himself the task of becoming a top-class cricket commentator. He achieved that and is being employed by Channel 9 this year—a well-deserved reward for his effort. So Dean Jones has gone down one path, down a dead-end path, and Michael Slater has had all those opportunities opened up to him by hard work and dedication.
The third matter related to sports broadcasting that I want to express great disappointment in is the fact that the International Olympic Committee is caving in to the NBC network’s demands about the scheduling of Olympic events. This is a total disgrace. Having swimming finals at 10 o’clock in the morning, going against what has been basically a tradition over 100 years, just to satisfy about five per cent of the Olympic audience worldwide is a total disgrace. Do you know why I really hate it? Because it belittles the United States and people’s view of the United States. I like the United States. I admire their political system and where they fit in the world—where they stand in terms of foreign affairs, defence and security matters. But the one thing that I hate is seeing the United States trying to impose their cultural values on everyone else. Diversity is good.
We should not have to allow one American TV network to totally reconfigure the Olympic Games. Imagine how they would have felt—for example, when they had the Atlanta Olympics or the Los Angeles Olympics—if the rest of the world said, ‘We’re sorry, we want to have the swimming finals or the gymnastic finals at nine o’clock or 10 o’clock in the morning to suit the rest of the world.’ They would have gone absolutely haywire over such as suggestion, but that is what we are left with. We are left with a situation where the International Olympic Committee, which is supposed to be independent, is simply going to respond to the one network that pays the most money. That is not the Olympic ideal and it will belittle the Olympic movement.
The final point I want to make on sports broadcasting refers to the communications package. I want to go to one very minor element. Foxtel’s sports coverage is always divided into two these days. If it is live, they put ‘live’ on the screen. If it is a live soccer match from wherever in England, you will see ‘live’ on the screen—that is the case whether it is live cricket, golf or whatever—so that the general public know whether they are watching a replay or a live broadcast. I commend Foxtel on that. What an advancement! But none of the commercial channels, or free-to-air channels, follow suit. Quite often it is deceptive broadcasting. You do not know whether you are watching something live or on delay.
Even Foxtel footy has ‘live’ on the screen if it is coming direct, but the commercial networks do not do that. This has been at its worst in the coverage of the Olympic Games where, because of their soft packaging, if you like, you never know what is live unless you happen to be listening to ABC radio. The worst instance of all was the coverage of the equestrian event in Barcelona in 1992, where Channel 7, two hours after we had won two gold medals, broadcast the equestrian event as though it was live. Incidentally, the commentators claimed that we had won one gold medal, for the individual event; they had not realised that we had won the team event.
I know it is a minor issue, but in any rewriting of communications policy it would be nice to write that in: to request, as part of their public duty, that commercial networks show that the broadcast is either live or not. It would help everyone to know whether the networks are, if you like, ‘cheating and packaging’ rather than bringing live broadcasts to the public—a public that deserves live broadcasts.
