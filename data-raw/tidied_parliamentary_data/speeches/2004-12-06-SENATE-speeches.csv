"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-12-06,"—This motion is to exempt three bills from the cut-off to enable them to be debated before the end of this week. Those bills are the Copyright Legislation Amendment Bill 2004, the James Hardie (Investigations and Proceedings) Bill 2004 and the National Water Commission Bill 2004. I just wish to signal that the Democrats have concerns about the Copyright Legislation Amendment Billbeing potentially rushed through by the end of this week. That is obviously what this motion seeks to enable. We do not have a problem with the latter two bills.
Without going into the substance of the copyright bill, it is fairly technical. The government might think that it is minor; the Democrats and I remain to be convinced that it is minor. Its flow-on amendments to do with the copyright components of the US free trade agreement were extremely complex, extremely detailed amendments that were dealt with in the intellectual property area of the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement. In my view, they were not given anywhere near the level of attention they deserved. In the debate around the free trade agreement, there was a lot of focus on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and one or two other aspects—the Australian content of television and artistic matter in particular—but the broader matters to do with copyright and intellectual property did not get anywhere near the attention they deserved. That bill, of course, has passed but we already have another bill with more `minor and technical' amendments. The phrase `minor and technical', which the government uses a lot of the time, usually tends to prick up my ears because it often can mean small amendments but with big ramifications. 
Without saying that we are categorically opposed to the bill, because we could do that in the debate, our broader concern is simply that this is an important area. It is complex and technical, and to simply rush the bill through by the end of this week—as is enabled by this motion—is not something that we are comfortable with. We do believe it should be properly examined. These sorts of changes, once they are put into the law, are often there for a very long period of time, particularly given that, in this case, they are linked with an agreement with the United States. As the minimum, we should look at the bill in sufficient detail and with sufficient thoroughness with the assistance of people in the community who have expertise in what is a very complex area. The Democrats request that the question be split so that the question on the copyright bill could be put separately. We do not believe it is appropriate to rush it through in the space of a week or two, however minor the government might believe the amendments are.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,2,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-12-06,"—I wish to register that the Australian Greens also have concerns about the Copyright Legislation Amendment Bill 2004. The letters about these amendments were only made available on Friday, and we saw the legislation just last week as well. Our office has been having discussions primarily with the players in the industry but also with community groups that are also looking at these issues. With almost every phone call to alert a different group to this legislation, we are receiving in response a range of different queries and question marks that those industry groups have about the implications of this legislation—issues that we have not been able to get our heads around or understand. Each time a different industry group are contacted, they come back with a whole range of other concerns. I think to propose that this type of legislation be dealt with by the end of the week is to rush through the legislation, and certainly the industry groups that we have been speaking with are only just being made aware of both the legislation itself and the consequences of the legislation.
I understand that there were reports in today's newspapers that the United States did not feel that this legislation needed to be dealt with by the end of the year. I think that Christmas and the summer break would be a fantastic opportunity for those people in the industry who will be impacted by the legislation to get their heads around it and work with consumer and community groups to put forward their particular concerns about this legislation so that it can be properly debated in the new year.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-12-06,"—On Thursday of last week I was interrupted in speaking to the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2004, which deals with modifying the existing laws to enable money from levies to be directed towards a separate industry body for the promotion and research of aspects to do with the livestock export trade—predominantly the live cattle and sheep trade. I should emphasise that as well as sheep and cattle this trade is now starting to expand into goats and other animals. Opportunities are always being examined by various industries to seek to expand trade in these areas.
Without recapping what I said last week and, indeed, without recapping 20 years of speeches in this place by the Democrats, we have had a longstanding concern about the extreme levels of animal cruelty involved in the livestock export trade. The Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare—established by Senator Don Chipp back in the mid-eighties because of concern about animal welfare issues in the community, of which this was one of the most significant—detailed some of those problems nearly 20 years ago. There have been many changes made since then, and I am sure the government and the minister would tell us that the changes contained in this bill are in response to concerns in the community about animal welfare aspects of the trade. That is true as far as it goes.
These changes, in part, come out of the Keniry inquiry. This inquiry was established by the government following the MV Cormo Expressdebacle of over a year ago which involved enormous suffering of tens of thousands of sheep and the premature death of many of them. The MV Cormo Express incident reignited community debate about the livestock export trade and highlighted the enormous level of public concern about the high level of animal cruelty and suffering involved in the trade. As I mentioned last week, petitions from over 100,000 Australians were tabled in this chamber—the largest petition we have had for a number of years by a long way—expressing their concern. So it is an issue that does concern many people, and I am sure that senators from across the political spectrum would recognise that it is an issue that does concern many Australians, some of them very strongly.
Whilst there have been and there continues to be improvements made in some aspects of the trade—the conditions faced by the animals on board the ship and some of the monitoring issues—in my view, and it is obviously not a universally held view in this place, the level of suffering involved is so high, intrinsic and inevitable to the trade that it simply cannot be ameliorated to a level that is satisfactory to a large proportion of the community. Whilst any action that reduces suffering has to be welcomed, the bottom line is that it cannot be reduced to a level that is satisfactory. That being the case, these continual efforts to look like we are improving the situation, these continual changes here and there, bits and pieces of action to try and address the community concern, can really be little more than window-dressing. They do not get to the heart of the problem; they do not get to the core, which is that the level of suffering is intrinsic and cannot be adequately reduced and any attempt to reduce it by small amounts is in many cases simply an attempt to try and deal with the public relations problems that the industry has faced repeatedly over many years rather than really to get to the heart of the matter. That is what this bill does. Indeed, I would suggest that this bill further entrenches the economic viability of the industry without addressing the core problems of animal suffering and, on top of that, the large degree of job loss that happens in Australia in the meat-processing and animal slaughter industries as a result of the animals being shipped directly offshore. 
This bill enables money to be put directly into the live export industry to help with research and development and with promoting the industry. We should not be promoting an industry when we should be looking at replacing the industry. That is the core problem with the government's approach and, I would suggest, with the opposition's approach, and this has been continuing over a long period of time. It is an industry that is, in effect, being subsidised by government and by job losses here in Australia. That is not satisfactory. It is also not satisfactory for money to be directed towards the body to help it continue to promote an industry when there is not anywhere near the same level of energy, priority and commitment being put into promoting the alternative.
This is one area where there is, if you like, the benefit of a clear and viable alternative to the live animal export trade. It is not an absolute one-for-one replacement, I acknowledge that, but there is clearly an alternative industry in the export of slaughtered and processed meat that is not being promoted to anywhere near the degree that the live animal export trade continues to be promoted. This is something that baffles me. I do not know why we do not put as much energy into promoting the export opportunities for a value added industry as we do into one which is basically exporting the product—that is, the animal—in its rawest form.
As most senators know, I am a vegetarian and an animal rights activist and as such personally am not keen on expanding the slaughter of animals whether in Australia or in the Middle East. But I separate my personal views from the broader community views and the policy on this—that is, that there are clearly markets for animal products and for meat and meat products. The fact is that those markets can be serviced via slaughtering the animals and processing the products here in Australia, which would enable more of the money and more of the jobs to stay in Australia while at the same time dramatically reduce the suffering of the animals. I have heard over many years the argument, which continues to be put, that if we do not export animals then some other country will and their standards will be worse than ours so the suffering will be greater. That argument is continually put alongside the other argument that they do not have refrigeration in the Middle East so the animals have to be slaughtered there. That is simply a furphy.
The argument that for religious reasons the animals have to be slaughtered there is again a furphy. We have halal accredited slaughtering in Australia. From my discussions with people involved in that industry and in the halal accreditation process, it seems to me that significant improvements could be made. One hurdle to our further exporting halal slaughtered meat from Australia is the lack of faith in the adequacy of our accreditation process. That is something I have heard from meat workers unions as well as from people involved with the accreditation process. That is just another example of the fact that if we were genuinely serious about developing export industries for processed meat we would be ensuring our accreditation process in Australia for halal slaughtering was topnotch and beyond reproach. The information available to me is that it clearly is not. One reason it is not is that the priority continues to be expanding the live animal trade to the exclusion and detriment of other export opportunities.
I would be more accepting of this government's genuineness and its arguments in this area if there were an equivalent degree of enthusiasm, energy and commitment to expanding, promoting and removing the barriers to alternative trade. I see very little of that. What I see are continual efforts to expand the live animal trade. I recall evidence from a budget estimates committee hearing earlier this year that national and state trade delegations to the Middle East regularly explore opportunities to develop the live animal export trade or deal with the problems that continually arise—and this bill came out of the problems that arise—but that those delegations very rarely seek to develop opportunities for the processed meat trade. 
The evidence about the level of cruelty involved in not just the transportation of animals to the ships and the shipping of the animals but the offloading and slaughtering in the various countries in the Middle East is overwhelming. Frankly, it is at the stage where you cannot use the excuse `well, if we don't do it someone else will and they'll do it even worse'. That excuse is simply not true. Animals over there are treated in the same way whether they are exported from Australia or anywhere else, and we are complicit in the enormous cruelty involved by virtue of continuing to be a part of that trade. I believe that if we as a nation set standards in this area the long-term impact would have far more value than it would if we simply raced to the lowest common denominator, which is basically what we have been doing to date.
The bill in its narrower scope goes some way to implementing the Keniry report recommendations. Inasmuch as that is a step forward, I suppose that should be welcomed, but I have to say that anything that enables further promotion of this trade is still moving in the wrong direction. It is continuing to attempt to entrench a trade that will never be able to overcome the major problem of being seen by a significant proportion of the Australian public as intrinsically cruel and as taking away Australian jobs. The industry has had 20 years to try and overcome that problem. I would suggest that, if anything, the industry is even more on the nose now than it was 20 years ago and that it will continue to be. All of the efforts to address that are simply continuing to deny the undeniable. A real forward-thinking approach would be to accept that and seek to develop a viable alternative that addresses the potential impacts on people who earn a living from this trade. That would be a better approach than the industry continuing to put all of its energies into fighting the sorts of PR battles it is perpetually engaged in.
The Keniry report is notable for the fact that the government did not accept all of its recommendations. So even this inquiry, set up by the government with the government's terms of reference, did not have all of its recommendations picked up because the government is doing everything it can to keep this trade alive. I do not support this trade; many Australians do not support it. I acknowledge that there are people whose livelihoods depend on this trade, and I am not seeking to ignore them. But I would also say that there are people whose livelihoods have been lost to this trade and who are being ignored and denied by this government. In acknowledging that, the Democrats' amendment does not seek to amend the core of the legislation but, whilst not opposing the bill, does seek to draw attention to the concerns that I have just raised. The core problem is that it is a trade that is intrinsically cruel and takes Australians' jobs. Until we attempt to prioritise the development of alternatives to this industry then those problems will continue, the community concerns will continue and I will continue to raise those concerns in the Senate through questions. I move:
At the end of the motion, add “but the Senate, recognising there is a strong and ongoing opposition to continuing the live trade of animals from Australia due to both animal welfare concerns and concerns that domestic jobs are exported along with the animals, urges that priority be given to phasing out the live trade of animals as soon as possible.” ",SENATE,"<title>AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2004</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2004-12-06,"—I thank Senators O'Brien and Bartlett for their contributions to the debate and for their support for the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2004. I acknowledge that the Labor Party has much the same sort of approach as the government to the export of live animals. I accept that the Australian Democrats have a slightly different view but support the bill anyway. After the MV Cormo Express incident the government did respond to the Keniry report with a comprehensive set of measures designed to restore confidence in the live animal export industry. Many of those measures are now in place, including the important changes to the regulatory regime for control of the livestock trade through the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service.
The amendments in this bill to the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act will put in place the industry structures and funding arrangements needed so that the live animal export industry will be responsible for research and development and the management of enhanced quality assurance systems. The bill will put in place a livestock export marketing body and a livestock export research body to receive the funding raised through Customs charges on live animal exports. That body will be LiveCorp. Meat and Livestock Australia Ltd remains the industry research body and the industry marketing body for the whole of the red meat industry. It alone will receive dollar-for-dollar eligible matching government research funding.
LiveCorp will be subject to strict accountability measures and the government has agreed with the recommendations of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee that the body's annual report, the funding agreement between LiveCorp and the government and the statement of compliance with conditions of the funding agreement will all be tabled in parliament. I thank the Senate committee for its recommendations. LiveCorp will work to ensure its members achieve best practice with animal health and welfare. The bill will allow for consistent funding of LiveCorp—the livestock export industry body and the livestock export marketing body—that will serve the specific needs of the livestock export industry and help address the criticisms that have raised concerns about the proper conduct of the industry.
In relation to Senator Bartlett's second reading amendment, with respect to Senator Bartlett I acknowledge his concern for animals. It is a concern that I think is shared by most Australians. Senator Bartlett's second reading amendment is, with respect, well meaning but ill conceived and a fraction simplistic. The live export trade is worth $1 billion annually to Australia and provides some 9,000 jobs, mainly in rural and regional Australia. It is a very important part of the Australian economy and one that is very important to rural and regional Australia.
Senator Bartlett in fact gave all the reasons why we should oppose his amendment but then chose to try and negate those reasons. It is quite obvious that if Australia is not supplying live animals to willing overseas destinations then someone else will fill the gap. Whilst it is an important industry for Australia, we also think that by being in the business we do have an influence and will have an increasingly greater influence on the export destinations to have in place more humane arrangements for the slaughter of the animals in those overseas areas. 
The live export trade also helps us in our general trading arrangements with many of the countries we deal with and it helps build Australia's trading capacity, and that again means money and jobs for Australia and Australians. Many of the overseas countries to which the live cattle are exported do not have the infrastructure, the freezing facilities or the transport to take frozen red meat. It is simply really a case of live animals or nothing at all.
There have been, as Senator Bartlett rightly acknowledged, considerable improvements to the way animals are treated in the live export trade. This bill is about that. A lot of the initiatives put in place by the government have been particularly useful. Senator Bartlett mentioned that he approved of those. They certainly have made improvements in this area. It is interesting to note that, since these new arrangements have been put in place, cattle mortalities have reduced from 0.34 per cent of stock-shift since 1999 to 0.1 per cent in 2004. Similarly, sheep mortalities have declined from 1.34 per cent in 1999 to 0.79 per cent in 2004. So the industry has certainly lifted its game with a lot of encouragement from the government and, as Senator Bartlett says, it reflects community concern about some of these areas. I think the business now is well controlled and well organised in a way that is not inhumane and that enhances the way the operations occur in the eyes of the Australian public. The government is very keen to see the live trade continue, for the reasons I have mentioned, and this bill will help with that. I support the bill, I thank senators for their support and I urge that the Democrats' second reading amendment be rejected.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2004-12-06,"—I rise to speak in the second reading debate on the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004. For the last few years I have had the dubious pleasure of standing here to speak to similar bills—similar not just in a formal sense but insofar as this bill is part of the annual routine of amendments to VET funding. What is depressingly similar is that every year I have had to address the fact that this government's policy position on the vocational education system has remained lamentably underdone. The truth of the matter is that in recent years—in fact since Dr Kemp left the job—there has been a stalling of the national vocational education agenda.
We have seen a whole series of crucial measures in the vocational education framework remain in limbo and many problems and issues remain unresolved. Of course, these are matters that I have raised again and again through a number of Senate inquiries, and I once again draw the Senate's attention to the failure of this government to complete a program of genuine national consistency in training regimes and qualifications across the country. There remain huge flaws in the administrative arrangements. We simply do not have a system in place where a qualification earned in one state is recognised in every other state. I know the rhetoric says differently but in practice that is not the case. 
There is in fact a climate of growing skill shortages whereby the issue of the national recognition of qualifications will become even more acute. It must be fixed. There is no evidence whatsoever in the government's forward program that it intends to fix this issue. The situation remains where a hairdresser in one state is not recognised in every other state across the country. We have a major problem with nationally consistent quality assurance regimes. The training curriculum, including the review of the training packages, has stalled. The revamp and the review of the ITAB structure is essentially proceeding at a snail's pace.
When you look at the major elements of the vocational education reform agenda in this country you see there is no serious work being undertaken. On top of that, the Prime Minister has unilaterally announced the destruction of the Australian National Training Authority, even though our vocational education and training system, despite every criticism I might have of it, is regarded internationally as being one of the leading systems in the world. I have always argued that it could be so much better. We have missed so many opportunities. We have failed to undertake our full responsibilities in the Commonwealth's role in this regard. If it had not been for some difficulties within New South Wales at the time when ANTA was actually established, we may well have had an entirely different system of administration back in the early nineties.
But now the Commonwealth has unilaterally sought to abolish the Australian National Training Authority. ANTA's national role, which has been crucial to the development of whatever progress has been made, is now to be pushed aside. Just after the federal election an announcement was made by the Commonwealth—an announcement which of course was never mentioned in the election campaign itself. No discussion was possible on this matter during the election campaign. There was no consultation with TAFE providers, with staff or with clients. There was no consultation with the states or territories, which of course were always seen to be partners in the national training agenda. They have been completely ignored. The decision was essentially raised unilaterally by this Prime Minister. 
I take it that the Minister for Education, Science and Training was somewhat taken by surprise, because he too was not adequately consulted; he was told. This was a prime ministerial stunt. It was driven by the Prime Minister's office without the involvement of the Department of Education, Science and Training, let alone the minister for education. We do not have any really clear understanding of what the government intends to do in the period post-ANTA. It makes the approach to ATSIC look like it has been thoroughly thought through. The government is essentially at sixes and sevens. But there was a new regime announced by the government during the election campaign of the establishment of 24 technical colleges—and more about that in a moment. It is, frankly, disingenuous for this government to say that it is concerned about the future of school leavers, concerned about skill shortages and concerned about the imbalance in the arrangements between vocational education and university education. It is completely disingenuous when the government has unilaterally announced the abolition of ANTA.
This takes us back 15 years to a world in which the training system was essentially run like the old Victorian railways. That is where we are going, back to the Victorian railway style of administration where separate state instrumentalities dealing with parochial, inward-looking arrangements will be free to do their own thing, and there will be no nationally consistent set of policy frameworks. Nothing could highlight this administrative incompetence and this political vandalism more than the government's decision to announce unilaterally that it will establish 24 technical colleges to train what it says are 7,000 students over four years. 
The 7,000 students over four years are merely a drop in the ocean of what is actually required, and it does not address the fundamental question of skill storages faced by this country. It does not face up to the grave concerns being expressed by both employer and union groups about the failure to deal with the skill shortage question. It does not address the fundamental blockages on productivity that arise as a result of the government's failure in this area—a failure, I might say, that is pointed out by the Labor Party year upon year—when it moved to its cheap and nasty training scheme away from traditional trades and put in place a series of mickey mouse training programs in the form of this so-called New Apprenticeships scheme.
Essentially, we have a government that seems determined to duplicate bureaucratic structures and the training facilities themselves. Because we do not have any quality assurance regime in place or any understanding of what the government intends to do with regard to the protection of the quality, probity or integrity of the administrative arrangements, we can only presume that the experiences we have seen in the past are likely to be repeated. The Department of Education, Science and Training has an appalling record when it comes to contract management. It has an extraordinarily inept approach to contract management, yet we are told that this new entity will be created with no guidelines and no arrangements put in place to determine what the quality assurance regime will be, and we are supposed to have some confidence in it. I ask the question: what will these new colleges look like? What sort of staff will they employ? Some of the statements I saw during the election campaign implied that they would be non-union, which I would have thought would be a breach of the Industrial Relations Act as it is currently proposed. There is no suggestion about the quality of the qualifications of staff to be employed or the need to ensure the curriculum meets modern training needs.
We have nothing more than a rather crude attempt to give private vocational education and training arrangements a leg up through the use of public subsidies, yet again, where the government seeks to use public moneys to bolster a privatised system. We are entitled to ask: what sorts of fees are likely to be charged, and how will students be able to afford them, what areas of skill shortages will be addressed and what areas of the current unmet demand will be addressed by these new programs? I think there is a real danger that these so-called technical colleges are about dumbing down training in this country and that institutions can be set up as cheap as chips, quick as you can with pared back training to working-class students who are pumped through from year 12. There is a real danger that they will not meet the needs of a modern economy; they will meet the political needs of a government that is seeking to run some populist lines about the failure of public education in this system and the failure, as the government perceives it, of the current TAFE programs. We are entitled to argue about what the relationship will be between these bodies and existing TAFE colleges. 
This year the budget the government brought down actually cut TAFE funding and we have got a proposition in this bill where that is carried forward. This bill is supposed to be about supplementary funding as agreed to as part of a longer term arrangement. But there is no ANTA agreement, so the funding in this bill cuts the funding that has been allocated. This is a bill which is symptomatic of the total failure of the Commonwealth and the Howard government to come to honest and reasonable terms with the states. The principles underlying the ANTA agreement, which should have been embodied in this bill, were about consensus and mutual cooperation. They were about shared responsibilities. They were about mutual obligation between the Commonwealth and the states. All those principles are gone under this government. What you see is a unilateral approach. It is a great irony of modern liberalism, isn't it, that it was said to be the bastion of a system of government which was centred on a federation whereby the states had an extremely important role? In reality, we have a government that sets in place a highly centralised model of unilateralism where the government seeks to impose its will upon the states using somewhat dubious administrative practices.
I can tell the officers who are here today: we will have a field day with this at Senate estimates. Be prepared, because I can see year upon year of incompetence exposed as a result of this sort of policy making. I do not blame the officers for that. The great disadvantage they have is that they are being asked to implement a political decision without proper processes being set in train, without the necessary public policy rationale being explained and without a clear understanding of what can and cannot be done. We have a political device established by the Prime Minister—in defiance, in my judgment, of even the minister's view about propriety—which will inevitably, given the past practice, lead to administrative disaster.
The principles at stake here are very important, and they ought to be defended by this parliament. I am very sorry to say that, given the circumstances in this Senate for the coming three years, those principles may well be abrogated as the Commonwealth seeks to impose a politically derived interest which of course is poll driven. It is not based on evidence. It is not based on hard fact. It is based on perceptions that the government has that it believes to be to its short-term advantage by attacking public education and the states in this area with no clear policy imperatives being established as an alternative. These fundamental questions about skill shortages, probity in contractual arrangements and the necessity of ensuring quality assurance will not be able to be protected on the basis of what we have seen to date.
The unmet demand in 2003 in this country for vocational education places is said to be about 57,000 people. In particular, these are older people who are desperately seeking training to improve their job prospects and are not able to secure an opportunity through the existing arrangements. And what is the government's answer? These bodgie, half-baked proposals to set up private colleges for 7,000. So you can see that this is all about short-term appeal for electoral advantage without any proper examination of what the needs of the country are.
We have acute shortages emerging. Just on the weekend I was advised of a company in Ballarat that is seeking to employ boilermakers. They say that they cannot and that they are seeking several dozen boilermakers. The company says, `We can't find them in the country at the moment.' I say that is nonsense, but nonetheless they say that we need to import an entire factory full of boilermakers from China because we cannot provide sufficient trained personnel in this country. Firstly, I do not think they have tried too hard and, secondly, it points to the fact that for years upon years the government has encouraged short-term, cheap and nasty training arrangements and has neither provided the necessary investment itself nor encouraged others to do it. We now have a situation where the government is saying that it seems to be all right to import boilermakers from China to work in Ballarat if it is for undertaking the necessary work. It is appalling for a country of our sophistication and prosperity not to be able to provide sufficient trained personnel in a trade such as boilermaking. 
In its July survey of investor confidence, ACCI stated that the lack of sufficient skilled workers is the No. 1 priority on its list of the top 10 constraints on investment in this country. It is well known that the number of trade apprenticeships has in fact increased but it has not kept pace with the necessary demand. The rate at which we have been training apprentices is some 15 per cent below what it ought to be. We have had enormous energy placed in training people how to make cappuccinos and how to flip hamburgers, but sufficient attention has not been paid to getting people to undertake high-level skills training in this country.
We all know the facts: it is expensive. It is easier for employers to get a government wage subsidy to take on an AQF3 in burger flipping or cappuccino making than it is for employers to provide the necessary support and investment in the higher level of skills training. So we have training rates that have fallen far too low as a percentage of the work force. A detailed study undertaken by the NCVER has shown that training rates for the metal trades fell from 12 per cent in the period 1987-92 to 9.8 per cent for the period 1993-2001—a drop of almost 20 per cent. There has been a similar decline in the electrical trades, at 23 per cent, and in the building trades, at 15 per cent. Rather than having a simplistic view and looking at the numbers of people in training, you have to look at the actual demand. The demand for skilled trades is not being met in terms of the investment that either the government or the private sector is putting into the traditional trades.
Of the 417,000 new apprentices in training, only 32 per cent are in the traditional trades areas. The vast majority of the so-called new apprentices are undertaking short-term training projects in retail and hospitality. While those areas are important, there cannot be undue emphasis on them. You cannot have an unbalanced approach to your training profiles, which is what we have at the moment. We need tradespeople with the depth and breadth of the four-year training programs that are available, and we need to make sure that this is seen to be the backbone of our productivity growth in the country.
Different rates of training apply in the various states and territories. For instance, in Tasmania the proportion of the new apprenticeships in the traditional trades is only 22 per cent, and in the Northern Territory it is only 11 per cent. We have a failure of policy at a national level, accentuated by a failure of policy at a regional level. We have a series of employer incentives being paid by the Commonwealth under the program, which has been geared towards providing additional support to, and undue emphasis on, the short-term trade areas.
The ACTU recently released a study of the cost to the economy of the trade shortages. The study proposes that, over the decade to 2014, the cost to the economy will grow from about $1 billion today to $9 billion. The 250,000 apprentices missing from the work force will in 10 years time cripple our manufacturing and construction industry. The cost to my state of Victoria will be some $2.4 billion. In New South Wales the estimated cost will be some $3 billion. That translates into many thousands of jobs and a huge loss of opportunity for our economy and our society. However, we have a situation where the government puts $2.3 million into advertising and spends an inordinate amount on promotion and employer incentives—some $500 million per annum now—but does not meet the necessary obligations of the real needs of the economy. In this bill we have an unfortunate situation that has gone on for far too long, and it will become more acute as this government moves ahead in this parliament.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-12-06,"—The Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004 is now the second bill to roll over VET funding because the federal government has failed to negotiate a new ANTA agreement with the states and territories for the second year in a row. ANTA agreements, as we all know, have been running since 1993, but since at least 1996 they have been the subject of significant funding cuts. The coalition cut TAFE funding in 1996 and 1997 and then froze it from 1998 to 2000. In the five years to 2002 student numbers increased by over 16 per cent, and there has been an annual growth in the delivery of courses of around six per cent per annum for the past 10 years. The funding per training hour fell in real terms by 19 per cent between 1997 and 2002.
By 2002, students were paying $194.6 million in fees and charges, and if New South Wales is indicative of other states their governments are requiring students to make up for the funding freeze. The Democrats do not want to see the TAFE system go down the same road as higher education in terms of massive fees being charged. The government was antagonistic to the TAFE sector from day one. Prior to the election Minister Nelson said that he would resume negotiations for a new ANTA agreement later in the year and that he would be willing to amend the legislation to incorporate any changes from the new agreement. However, the government has slowly but surely moved away from funding the states to funding its own programs, such as the direct purchase of 7,500 training places through private providers worth $20.5 million.
During the election we saw announcements of $1.06 billion of funding over four years for various training initiatives, on top of the ANTA funding. Very little of this funding is likely to go to the states or to supporting those institutions that currently provide almost 90 per cent of vocational education and training in Australia. It is fascinating that the ANTA negotiations stalled partly because of the unwillingness of the federal government to provide satisfactory funding, when they apparently have $1 billion up their sleeves. Within two weeks of the election the Prime Minister announced that ANTA would be abolished from July next year. I ask: how can a government that profess to be a supporter and promoter of vocational education and training abolish a body central to the delivery of vocational education and training?
ANTA agreements detailed the framework for a national VET system with agreed objectives, priorities, assured funding arrangements and consistent national strategies. State specific plans were also negotiated with ANTA within the agreed national frameworks. Only three months earlier, Minister Nelson announced the appointment of five new members to ANTA's board. The Australian Education Union's TAFE secretary, Pat Forward said:
It's perplexing that people who have been at the forefront of vocational education for 15 years—state education departments, TAFEs, unions, small business—weren't involved in these decisions. 
ACTU President, Sharan Burrow, condemned the move, saying that the government was cutting its commitment to the skills and training agenda at the very time when skill shortages are becoming the biggest issue facing the Australian work force and economy. If the government is truly committed—which it says it is—to addressing the problem of skills shortages in our growing economy, why did it abolish ANTA without consultation? The Democrats would argue that this is not the sort of leadership that will deliver improved state-federal relations, nor will it improve training results in the states. It is appalling that the government are playing politics with the state governments and destabilising the structures that provided nationwide collaboration and coordination of the VET sector. The short-sightedness of the Howard government's education and training policies, I would argue, are close to unparalleled.
TAFE Directors Australia estimate the unmet demand for TAFE places at 42,800 in 2003, and they expect demand to grow significantly. This high level of unmet need is a direct result of the federal government's four-year-old funding freeze and failure to negotiate a new ANTA agreement. Apart from somewhat limited growth funds in 2001-03, there has been no additional funding, despite an annual growth rate in places of around six per cent per annum for 10 years. Our vocational education and training sector is driven by government to deliver short-term, competency based training packages and a shift to private providers.
In New South Wales alone, 15,400 TAFE teachers are on casual contracts and only 4,800 have ongoing employment. In fact, around 65 per cent of delivery hours in New South Wales TAFEs are from staff on casual contracts, and we do not think that helps deliver world-class training to students. The government needs to consider the type of staff that will be attracted to TAFEs on a casual contract and whether it is in the students' best interests. Without greater funding of the TAFE sector these problems will never be solved.
The result of underfunding TAFEs is that more students are missing out on a place, we have higher class sizes, increased casual teaching and wasted money on dodgy non-TAFE training providers. Given this history, it is extraordinary to think that Australia has a skills shortage. The Treasurer was quoted in the Financial Review as saying `if you want to ensure that there are no bottlenecks in an economy it is important that you continue to supply skilled labour', yet around 170,000 people will retire from the manufacturing sector in the next five years and as few as 40,000 people are being trained to replace them.
The Australian Industry Group released data showing that there are currently up to 21,000 unfilled apprentice positions in the manufacturing sector alone in Australia. For the first time ever, an Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry survey found the biggest concern for their members was the increasing skills shortage. The government's own Intergenerational Report stated, and the message from industry is, that the crisis in skilled employment will worsen and this will impact on future industry investment, taxation revenue and funding for future services.
The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations' skilled vacancy report for November showed an annual increase of 6.9 per cent in all trades. I ask the minister: is your government ever going to look objectively at the mountain of evidence of skills shortages and respond accordingly? The skills crisis is the result of eight years of coalition government policy failures. There is nothing else that the government can sheet home the blame to. The crisis is indeed in their court and entirely their responsibility.  
Australia's proportion of youth at risk is high compared to other OECD countries, with unemployment levels 2.7 times higher for 15- to 24-year-olds than for adults aged 25 to 54. Ten per cent of school leavers are not making a successful transition to work and, over the past decade, 15 per cent of teenagers have not been in full-time learning or work. The government's election announcement of an $800 tool voucher was laughable in the face of these enormous problems. The Prime Minister thinks that young people are now going to sign up to apprenticeships to get $800 worth of tools, while they still struggle every week to make ends meet.
The Democrats have been appalled by the low apprenticeship wage rates which currently apply, especially for first and second year apprentices. We know that they act as a disincentive for young people to take up these positions. First year apprentices receive just $235, and second year apprentices receive $308 in wages—lower than both the living away from home allowance at $318.50 and the newstart allowance at $394.60. A wage of $235 a week would barely cover rent, food and transport and would leave nothing to pay for other bills, clothes, social expenses and the like. That amount might be all right if you are a 16-year-old still living at home with mum and dad and they are paying for all of your costs, but apprentices now need to have good maths and English and they need to stay at school for the time necessary to acquire those skills. They cannot now leave school at year 9 or even year 8 as might once have been the case. There is an urgent need to engage young people in training to obtain work skills that will allow them to enter the work force. The cost of doing otherwise, in terms of welfare payments, lower tax revenue, higher health costs and higher crime rates will be much greater well into the future.
The opportunities and challenges of a global knowledge economy mean that our future depends no longer on minerals, sheep or wheat but on the creativity, ingenuity, initiative, ideas and skills in particular of all Australians. At the very least we should be aiming for two years of post-school training for all our citizens—adults as well as school leavers. Strong TAFE institutions with highly developed local community, business and student linkages are best placed for rapid and responsive technology and knowledge transfer. One of the main problems with this government's policies is that they weaken TAFE institutions. The result of reduced funding is always a narrowing of the courses delivered, and moves to establish federally funded technical colleges will further undermine an already injured TAFE system.
The Chair of TAFE Directors Australia, Gillian Shadwick, believes there has been far too much emphasis on short-term traineeships which have come at the expense of higher level skills training. In response to the coalition's pre-election training policy announcements, Ms Shadwick stated:
... the policies announced fall well short of what is required to address Australia's future skills needs.
The Democrats argue that there are many policy areas that need to be addressed in the VET sector. As a minimum, all Australians should have, as I said, two years post-school training. TAFEs are the backbone of the VET sector and cannot be replaced by an assortment of industry training schemes. We should reinvest in our TAFE system by renegotiating the ANTA agreement with an additional five to 10 per cent in annual growth funding in real terms; a requirement that at least 70 per cent of the content is delivered by permanent professional, accredited teachers by 2007; professional development for TAFE teachers so they have up-to-date industry experience and teaching competencies and qualifications; improved data gathering on skill needs; better sharing of infrastructure, especially in the regions, by public institutions and businesses; improved training and retraining strategies for older workers, people with disabilities and those who are welfare dependent; and a commitment from state and territory governments to nationally consistent and significantly reduced fees and charges for TAFE courses. 
We should put on hold `user choice' in the delivery of VET courses until there has been a proper review and evaluation of this private provider model. The current drop-out rate of new apprentices in VET needs to be addressed. Quality and successful completion need to be rewarded and student support must be improved. Different learning rates and student needs should also be recognised if we are to make significant progress in this sector. Fees and charges, we think, should not be allowed in VET programs in schools as they are a barrier to student participation. The Democrats support government links with industry to assist the transition between school and employment and further education but argue that this should be done in a balanced way rather than giving industry complete ownership of the process.
With the abolition of ANTA from July next year, around the time the government will gain control of the Senate, an independent review of Australia's current and future vocational education and training needs is needed to guide what appears at present to be a rather ad hoc and short-sighted approach to VET.
The Democrats will not oppose this bill because we do not want to stop the money flowing, as disappointing as the level of funding is in the bill. For any government to be reducing funding for VET in the middle of a national skills crisis is ridiculous and appalling and is obviously not going to solve the skills shortage. The government has led us down the path to a skills crisis through funding cuts and funding freezes to TAFEs and discouragingly low apprenticeship wages. Now its refusal to index inadequate growth funds has again delayed adequate funding flowing to the sector.
Failure to gain agreement from the states and territories for a new ANTA agreement for two years reduces stability in the sector and is placing further financial pressure on TAFE, businesses and other VET providers. The Democrats urge the government to introduce appropriate policies that will move Australia out of the skills crisis and provide the necessary training for our young people.",SENATE,<title>VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2004-12-06,"—Education, science and training minister Brendan Nelson's program to establish 24 Australian technical colleges across the country—including four in my home state of Queensland—is one of the most progressive and forward-thinking proposals to come before the Australian parliament. It underlines the total commitment of the Howard-Costello government to skilling Australia in precisely the way we need to skill our nation. It gives practical vocational education the same weight in terms of policy commitment as university training. It recognises that pursuit of a university degree is not for everyone and that high trade or technical skills are just as valuable and should ultimately be just as rewarding.
My career in politics and outside politics has had a focus on training and vocational education as a crucial element in national life. So it is especially pleasing that the government's effort in this area has been allocated to my friend and Queensland Liberal colleague the member for Moreton. I want to place on record my view that Gary Hardgrave will be a fine success in the portfolio of vocational education and training. He is a very energetic man who focuses strongly and proactively on the job at hand—as he did in the third Howard ministry as Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, another great interest of mine. 
I come to this debate with great optimism—indeed with total confidence—that, despite what we have heard during this debate, the proposed network of Australian technical colleges will do the job. They will give high-achieving young Australians a great start in their chosen trade. By refocusing the national effort, by bringing the real requirements of business and industry and individual employers fully into the mix, the national network will offer vocational education and training opportunities to young Australians that will set them up for life.
In my own state of Queensland we have a great opportunity to boost future work force skills through the establishment of four federally funded Australian technical colleges at Townsville, Gladstone, Brisbane and the Gold Coast. As a former Queensland minister for training, I know that the new colleges will create fresh opportunities for our young people to acquire excellent trade skills of which they can be rightly proud. It is essential that we provide high-quality tuition in both academic and vocational education for students in years 11 and 12 who want to pursue a trade. We must do all we can to help provide skilled entry level workers in key trades with shortages in those disciplines. That is what the Australian technical colleges will do and that is why they are a really good idea that deserves—and, in my view, has won—widespread support throughout the VET community.
The colleges will be linked to, and endorsed by, industry and run autonomously by principals, who will engage teaching staff on a performance pay basis. That is an important development in its own right and one that brings into the equation the principle of reward for excellence. It is my view that excellence is very much needed within the VET system, a system that, despite what we heard from Senator Allison, is run almost exclusively by the states and is very heftily funded by the Commonwealth at record levels.
The government wants to move Australia away from the mistaken belief that success for young Australians can only be equated with a university degree. It wants to eradicate any residual feeling that new apprenticeships and vocational education are second best to university. Our commitment as a government is to build an even stronger economic future and provide opportunities for all Australians. That is what the new technical colleges will help achieve. As part of their training, students at the new Australian technical colleges will be able to undertake academic, information technology and business courses. This will mean they will graduate with the necessary trade, entrepreneurial and business skills for self-employment and will have the choice to go on to further education and training.
This is a positive and progressive development that stands in stark contrast to the political game playing of the states over the Australian National Training Authority and funding. ANTA has now been scrapped because the states would simply not play the game. They played the politics and ignored the legitimate rights and aspirations of young people, particularly the young people who wanted to progress through the VET system. The Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004 provides for immediate funding mechanisms to replace the old agreement made redundant by the states and for negotiation of a permanent agreement. The states must realise that when spending federal dollars they have a responsibility to spend them wisely and in accordance with national aims and objectives. The Australian technical colleges are a key element of the national vision for training and vocational education and are institutions that I believe will serve our young people very well.  ",SENATE,<title>VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Buckland, Sen Geoffrey",ALP,2004-12-06,"—Since the beginning the Howard government has failed to come to grips with the importance of vocational education and training. It is an issue that it has not been able to successfully deal with throughout the course of government. If we look at Australian industry today, we can only conclude that the Howard Liberal government has failed the basic skills test. For years now, despite numerous calls from industry and calls from the secondary, vocational and tertiary education sectors, the government has allowed Australia's work force skills and potential work force skills to fall to a new critically low level. This failure has had a marked impact on the ability of small, medium and large industry to plan for the future and to develop and expand.
I am reliably told by those in the vocational training sector that skills as a productivity driver have declined by 75 per cent in 10 years. It is now clear for everyone to see that we have critical skills shortages in key trades and industries such as engineering, electrical, mechanical, bricklaying, plumbing, metal fitting and fabrication, child care, aged care and nursing. We also have a critical shortage of skilled workers in the meat industry. The Productivity Commission has found that Australia needs more skilled workers and greater skills growth if we are to address the country's skill shortages, to improve the standards of living and to remain internationally competitive. But, because the Howard government has failed to fund enough places in TAFE each year, tens of thousands of Australians wanting training have been turned away.
The greatest growth in new apprenticeship schemes has occurred in areas where there are no skills shortages. One study has found that between 20 and 30 per cent of new apprentices receive inadequate training and about half the people who do not finish their new apprenticeship say it is because they feel they are being used as cheap labour instead of being trained for the trade they wish to pursue. It makes me think that the government has more focus on addressing industry needs by introducing unfair dismissal laws rather than on providing real training and education for the existing and the prospective work forces.
Prior to coming to this place I spent many years on the board of a TAFE institute. I saw many changes there, but the most startling changes came in those first few months after the Howard government came to office. It was almost like night following day, the changes were so stark. There were changes in attitude and direction and there was a lack of information. The emphasis moved from one of successful training completion to one of asking what institutes could achieve for status and numbers. But the funding was not there to provide what the sector believed they were seeking. Even today there is confusion within the TAFE sector as to their future role. That is not because they have failed. It is because, firstly, they are not getting the funding and, secondly, they are not getting direction from the federal government.
Senator Santoro's contribution earlier was particularly helpful because it told me more about the new institutes of technology than I have been able to find out from other sources. I think there will be an opportunity to speak about those institutes at some future time. In my contribution to the address-in-reply I said I was somewhat warmed by the thought of these new institutes, but if they are at the cost of an effective TAFE system then I wonder what this is all about. Is this just a bit of smoke and mirrors by the government to fudge their failure with training?  
This is an important area for our consideration. I cannot see where the government is going with it. As I said, Senator Santoro's contribution was somewhat helpful. Obviously, he has a lot more information on the subject than has been made generally available. I will read his speech at today's conclusion to try and gain a little more from it. A worrying factor in his contribution was that rewards might be based on the success of students, that there might be bonus schemes for instructors. I do not really know what that means, but I am sure he would be happy to help me work my way through it. 
It is interesting to note that the Australian Industry Group found recently that currently there are 18,000-21,000 unfilled vacancies in industry for tradespeople. These vacancies were brought about by people not being sufficiently trained. There are not enough people with skills of a sufficient quality to perform tasks for those seeking work to be done. The situation is now very stark in heavy industry where the emphasis has been on the core business of an organisation and doing away with tradespeople and maintenance people—just bringing in flying squads or contract workers. Industry are now finding that they do not have enough people with the right skills coming through the gates for shutdowns, for major repairs and for ongoing maintenance. The skills are clearly not there.
Prior to coming to this place I was also involved in a group training scheme. I had a lot of time for this scheme, where young people took on apprenticeships with more than one employer, and thought it might be the way forward. But as time went on we found that—and it was not through lack of effort by the group training schemes but through the nature of the industry—people were not getting sufficient skills for specific industries. If a large industry is not getting people trained properly in, say, fitting, turning, plumbing or carpentry to suit all the sectors, it will have jacks-of-all-trades and masters of none. People do not acquire sufficient skills to do the work that they are called in to do. Industry is now suffering from that. That revolution was brought about by industry itself. The problem we have is that there are not enough people to do the work.
What is more important, according to AiG, is that the number of traditional apprenticeships has remained largely unchanged since 1996 when the Howard government came to office. According to the department of employment, vacancies for skilled tradespersons have increased by a staggering 54 per cent over the last three years. There is not the number of people there to do the work. The figures rise quite sharply in key industries such as the metal trades, automotive, electrical and construction industries. In fact, they are rising every day and work is being deferred because there are not sufficiently skilled people to do the work. People can use backdoor tradespeople who tell them they have all the skills in the world when, in fact, they have none at all. Recently I was caught up in a situation like that, so I know that it is going on. Someone came to do a job for me and, when I asked about his business and activities, I determined that this fellow was not all that he had cracked himself up to be. The work is still waiting to be done.
The National Centre for Vocational Education Research say that, since 1999, there has been a massive 22 per cent drop in apprenticeships in the traditional trades. That is incredible. It is a worrying situation. I come from the traditional trades area and I have seen at first-hand the need for those skills. Only one in three apprenticeships were in the traditional trades field for the June 2004 quarter compared with 42 per cent five years earlier.  
It is local businesses that are suffering, because there is now a shortage of about 20,000 skilled workers, as I said before, in sectors such as carpentry, construction, manufacturing and mining. At one time you could say, `I won't go and do a job because it's too far from a capital city.' That excuse no longer applies because of changed transportation needs and the manner in which you can travel to and from a job. The shortage is occurring because we do not have trained people to do the work. AiG says that over the next five years 175,000 people are expected to leave the traditional trades, while only 70,000 will enter those trades. So there will be a shortfall of over 100,000 skilled workers because of natural attrition and because of workers seeking alternative career paths and thus moving from one industry to another.
It is a legacy of this government that we have reached our current predicament so quickly. Everything that has been put in place over many years has been destroyed. It worries me that a government can be so blind to the real needs of this country. It pretends to stand up for industry and says it will get tough on industrial relations law; in fact, the real issues that have to be dealt with involve those people who are at the work sites and those young people who are trying to get training. Money is required to provide training for those people.
The Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004 amends the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act by limiting funding to the vocational education and training sector. It will reduce the level of funding for vocational education provided to ANTA—and we have heard about the destruction of ANTA—for distribution to the states and territories in 2004. Funding will fall from $1.36 billion to $1.31 billion. This is a reflection of the Howard government's failure to understand the needs of our country and of people trying to enter the work force in order to fill the shortages that are obviously there. 
The bill seeks to appropriate up to $1.154 billion in funds for vocational education and training to be distributed by the states and territories in 2005. The bill represents another reminder that the Howard government cannot be trusted when it comes to the education and training of Australians. The Howard government slashed $240 million from the VET sector in its first two budgets. The government should spell out what the new technical colleges will do. We need to know—Senator Santoro in his speech helped a little in this regard—whether these colleges will duplicate what is already provided by the TAFE sector. We need to know whether people will be fast-tracked into trades having received little training but having received a big certificate to say that they have done some training. Will the training be of the same quality and lead to the same level of ability that currently applies? Will the new institutes replace the current TAFE sector or will they simply represent another avenue of competition and of putting training in the hands of the private sector? We do not know the answers to those questions. They have not been spelled out for us.
At the same time that all these things are going on, business is crying out for more skilled staff, and there is a major shortage of TAFE places. It seems to me that the government needs to re-examine exactly where it is coming from and going to in relation to the training of tradespeople. The blame for all the disasters we are experiencing now—insufficient tradespeople, not being able to get people to do work and high levels of job vacancies in the trades area—rests with the government and its inability to accommodate the needs of industry. My friend the member for Hindmarsh, Steve Georganas, in his first speech in the other place a couple of weeks ago, outlined the real problems we have in South Australia with the construction of a new airport terminal. There is a great shortage of plasterers, fitters, plumbers and carpenters. Excessive wages are being paid in order to try and attract people to do this work.  
People in the TAFE sector give a very clear indication that they are not sure where their future lies. They have put in the effort to build a quality, first-rate training organisation that is the talk of the rest of the world. However, through the creation of these new institutes, it seems that the government is seeking to undermine them and take from them the very skills that they have built up in the area of training in this country.

Can the minister confirm that Primary Energy Ltd has sought funding for its Gunnedah grains-to-ethanol project under the environment department's Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program?

Could I confirm that the minister is going to take on notice the original question, which was on the decision not to fund this project under the Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program, which is a program within his portfolio. Can he confirm that 15 projects have in fact been funded under that program—the Greenhouse Gas Abatement program? Can he provide detailed reasons as to why an application for funding from Primary Energy Ltd was not successful?

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-12-06,"—I do not have details of that. I am happy to seek any relevant information in relation to the greenhouse program. I will have to check on the detail of the program. But, once again, what you see here is Labor attacking a proponent of a proposal, attacking a program that is designed to assist a regional community that is suffering from the effects of water reform and attacking a proposal that has significant benefits for that regional community by creating 50 permanent jobs, 350 additional indirect jobs and significant advantages for that community through a small grant through the Regional Services portfolio. What you saw here last week, Mr President, was, firstly, Labor attacking the proposal. Secondly, when they found out the proposal had passed the guidelines of not only that program but a previous program, they then started to attack the project itself. When they found out the guidelines had been adhered to and the project had been approved based on those guidelines—
—I rise on a point of order, Mr President. The minister was asked specifically about a decision on funding—or lack of funding—for this project in his own portfolio. He is clearly nowhere near that in his answer. The point of order is on relevance. I would ask you to bring him to the question. What he is going on about is entirely irrelevant to the question that was asked. We asked him about the decision in his own portfolio area under the Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program, and he seems to be unable to answer the question. 
—On the point of order, if Senator Wong were to be honest and read the question again, she would see that the question specifically referred to a project that had been approved under one program and she was asking why it had not been approved under another. I am now talking about the project, talking about the approvals process that it has been through—
Honourable senators interjecting—
—I am specifically answering the question that Senator Wong was asking.
—On the point of order, Mr President: I am happy to read the question again, because it does appear from the minister's contribution that he may not have heard the question correctly.
—It is my understanding that you asked the minister a question and he said he would get information on that question. I suspect that perhaps that should have been when the minister sat down because, really, the rest of the answer was not relevant strictly because the minister had already said he would get the information. I thought he may have been adding more information to the answer. On the point of relevance, Minister, you have two minutes left.

Senator Wong claims that it was not funded under the Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program. As I have said, I am happy to see whether or not it was even an applicant, and what the reasons are. It is a fair question. But she presumes that my department have not backed this project. The reality is that, regardless of whether it has been approved under the Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program, any other program in my department or any other program within any other department—which I was addressing in my first answer—this project is a good project. It helps the local community. It helps a region that is suffering because of reform to water. It helps a region that is suffering from high levels of unemployment, and this is an employment generation program as well. It is a positive project that, once again, the Labor Party are trying to tear down because they do not like regional Australia being assisted by a federal government that is focused on helping regional Australia.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Environment: Program Funding</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,answer
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-12-06,"—During question time today, I was asked questions by both Senator Wong and Senator Carr in relation to applications by the company Primary Energy Australia for grants under the Commonwealth grants programs. In relation to the Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program, my department, the Department of the Environment and Heritage, confirms that the company has not registered an interest in or submitted any applications for GGAP funding through any of the program's three competitive funding rounds. Further, in relation to the Namoi Valley Structural Adjustment Package that Senator Carr asked about, the structural adjustment committee recommended that the proposal put forward by Primary Energy Australia be supported.
Further in support of my remarks, I have been given a copy of a letter from the Chairman of Primary Energy Australia, Mr Ian Kiernan AO—a very successful international round-the-world sailor as well as Chairman of Clean Up Australia—which he sent to the Australian Financial Review on 3 December. In that Mr Kiernan wishes to express his concerns in writing, with reference to articles by Lenore Taylor published in the Financial Review concerning his company and the Regional Partnerships grants process. In the letter, Mr Keirnan makes the point that the Namoi Valley project offers capital expenditure of $100 million, operational expenditure of $81 million, expansion of the local economic base by $170 million, catalyst and base-load customers for $120 million for the Central Ranges natural gas pipeline and generation of an additional $30 million per year in household income. Also, construction of the plant will generate a one-time boost of $218 million in final demand as each dollar spent circulates through the local economy and there will be $47 million in export income and $88 million dollar in domestic revenue. He supports my projects in relation to the creation of 40 permanent positions—I think I have stated 50, so we disagree by 10 jobs there. He talks about 500 construction positions and agrees with me that it will create 350 permanent regional positions. The letter continues: 
Granting was sought by the Proponents in good faith and the appropriate application process was rigorous and lengthy. Preliminary work as referred to in your article—
the article by the Financial Review—
had been undertaken on this project some years earlier. The grant was awarded to enable the project to proceed to financial close in the Namoi Region. 
The project is at its most sensitive and Commercial in Confidence stage as it progresses toward Financial Close. And to add; the project is currently being assessed under the Biofuels Capital Grants Scheme. It would indeed be a great shame if this progress and prospects for grant success were jeopardized through inaccurate, negligent and mischievous reporting.
Yours Sincerely
Ian Kiernan AO

—Minister, you can ask for leave to incorporate things, but you cannot debate the issue. You would know that. Are you seeking leave to incorporate that letter?
—Yes.
—Is leave granted?
—On behalf of the Labor opposition, I will support incorporation when I have been shown the courtesy of having been shown the letter, as is the normal process.
—I read the letter.
—You read parts of it selectively, Senator Campbell. If you had offered us a copy of the letter, we would have agreed to incorporate it. We will grant leave to incorporate the letter, provided we see it first.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-12-06,"—I spoke on this briefly this morning so I will not go into it at length again. I simply want to draw attention to the fact that this Selection of Bills Committee report and what we are debating now, which is to adopt it, recommends sending off the Copyright Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 to a Senate committee for inquiry. I think that is good. I complained this morning that it was being rushed through. There are some technical matters that need proper examination. The concern I have is that it has a possible hearing date listed of 6 December, which is today, and a reporting date of 7 December. So for all of the people that are listed as possibly giving submissions or evidence—Internet service providers, copyright owners and users, the Attorney-General's Department et cetera—it is a pretty tight time frame, to put it politely.
It may be that the committee could defer and the Senate Legal and Constitutional References and Legislation Committee could decide separately to give itself an extra day or two. The bottom line is that even if there is another day or two—I support it going to a committee, as any sort of examination separately from the chamber is obviously better than nothing—it is fairly farcical to refer a bill which, from memory, only saw the light of day in the whole world last week. For people to have absorbed an incredibly complex area—copyright law—particularly in the international arena and in areas like the Internet, and to provide information for us as a Senate to make an informed decision on that legislation via a committee, even one as talented as the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, is fairly implausible. In some ways, having such a massively rushed referral of a matter brings the committee system into disrepute. After proper examination, maybe we will look at the details and look at the submissions from the experts and decide: `Okay, it is all right. It is not that big a drama; it is just minor and technical amendments, as the minister says'. 
I would be more confident and comfortable if we had the opportunity to do those examinations and hear from the experts after proper consideration rather than this overnight inquiry. Whilst this is a decision of the committee and I am probably not likely to succeed in amending the motion, I thought it appropriate to speak to it and to highlight precisely what is being proposed, which is basically that we refer a matter overnight. Doing that is really stretching the credibility of our Senate committee processes past breaking point.

The key value of Senate committees in my view and in my experience is that you get to hear from people in the community who are affected, such as some of those who are listed in the committee's report as possibly giving submissions or evidence. I do not think those people, even if they have been lined up to give verbal evidence at a hearing tonight—as may well be the case—can really have had the opportunity to consider sufficiently all of the ramifications.

"DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The",N/A,2004-12-06,"—On behalf of the President, I present the report of the official Australian parliamentary delegation visit to the European Institutions and France, which took place in April and May 2004.",SENATE,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,<title>Parliamentary Delegation to the European Institutions and France</title>,Delegation Reports,15,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-12-06,"—by leave—The official Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the European Institutions and France was one of which I was privileged to be a member. The delegation visited the European Union countries of Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and France. I want to commence my brief remarks by thanking the secretariat, who did an outstanding job of administering, coordinating and supervising the effectiveness of that visit. I want to particularly acknowledge the good humour and good graces of the President. I grew very close to my companions on that delegation, as you do on these visits, and learnt a lot about them. It generated a great deal of fraternal respect and affection. The visit was enormously beneficial to me.
I want to make my remarks in two distinct frames. The first is to reflect on the extremely beneficial impact on a senator who has in Australia's consideration of legislation issues to be cognisant of the importance of our relations with those giant economies and the societies that constitute Europe. I am not going to remark in any detail on the institutions we visited because they are covered in the report, but the variety and the place that is given in Europe to a diverse expression of institutions that address matters of democracy or justice or that represent the state is a reminder to us all that in diversity is often strength—in diversity is the ability of large and diverse societies to reflect and respond to extremely complex situations. Another aspect that impacts on a senator is the parliamentarians who meet and the environments in which they live and work, which induces understandings that we do not otherwise achieve. 
What has the most impact of all is the recognition that Australia's place and reputation in Europe is a very large one. It is large by virtue of our peoples; it is large by virtue of our history and the things we have achieved as a nation; and it is large because of the tremendous regard that Europeans have for the sacrifices and efforts of Australians in the two world wars and in trying to assist in reconstructing the peace thereafter. Within my eight years I have not been on that many delegations, but I can say without doubt that this one had the most impact on me. It was the most useful for me and it really helped put in my mind where I and we sit with respect to the great role and great responsibilities that any parliamentarian does carry in the broader scheme of things.
The second frame I really wanted to draw attention to was something that struck me as being immensely important. It is that the Europeans, through their harsh and very difficult history, through the tremendous conflicts and bloodshed that marks their modern history—and by `modern' I do not just mean the last couple of hundred years; I guess I mean since the time of the barbarians—have gained an understanding that, unless parliamentarians talk to each other, unless you continue to negotiate, to discuss issues and to sit down on things that otherwise would seem to be intractable, you are faced with the ugly, awful alternative that conflict will be used as a means to resolve difficulties.
Consequently, to an efficiency minded and somewhat rationalist people, the range and variety of institutions that are dedicated just to parliamentarians meeting each other is quite astonishing to an Australian's eyes. The European parliamentarians cross-fertilise in ways that we do not even consider in Australia. We do not even meet as parliamentarians. I know that individual political parties might have interaction, but we do not even meet with our own state and territory parliaments in the intense, reflective and very interactive way that the European parliamentarians do. In this country we tend to leave the interaction as one between executives or between bureaucrats. In Europe the interaction is between the parliaments of Europe and the parliamentarians. That understanding of the distinction between the relationships that are vital to preserving unity and to preserving peace in Europe I think most of all rests on the proposition that the parliamentarians make an effort and put themselves out to attend many common forums where parliamentarians from other countries are present to discuss issues. That is why the countries of Europe can end up with a fairly uniform view on major issues such as human rights and environmental rights. In our little country we squabble and quarrel in ways that mean issues can never be resolved, because it is a contest between executives. In that huge continent, with those hundreds of millions of people, they are able to make huge advances because the parliamentarians talk to each other and sit down to work through those issues. 
The other thing I want to briefly remark on was that I was struck by the regard that is had for the life and the work of parliamentarians. The attitude of the community, the media and the general public to parliamentarians is one of respect for the very considerable role they have. I was a little surprised—but on reflection, not—to discover that when the parliamentarians of some of those countries are coming out to Australia one of the major briefings they get is to expect an aggressive media that has no respect whatsoever for the role and duties of a parliamentarian. That is a reflection on our society. We have as capable and as qualified parliamentarians and media as they have, but the relationship and the sense of the importance of the democratic and representative function is quite different. In thinking briefly about what I would say in my remarks, my eye was drawn to a press release today from the Roy Morgan organisation, which has just conducted a poll. It says that newspaper journalists are regarded as having `high or very high standards of ethics and honesty' by 12 per cent of the public in this country, and federal members of parliament by 20 per cent. I am disturbed that we are only at 20 per cent, but I note that the European parliamentarians think much worse of our media than they do of us.

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-12-06,"—It makes me quite sad to speak to the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004. It is a bit of legislation I would probably describe as pathetic, because it represents the failure of the government to achieve an agreement with the states to provide adequate—not generous, but adequate—funds for the provision of vocational education and training in this country. It represents a failure of the government to address the critical skills shortage that has been building for the past decade or more, and it represents a failure of the government to capitalise on the fabulous opportunities that our TAFE system offers. It does this by further undermining the funding that TAFE desperately needs to educate working class Australians, people from a non-English-speaking background and mature age students wanting a second chance at education, to name just a few of the groups that utilise our fantastic TAFE system. This bill delivers a small portion of the much needed funds to keep courses running and teachers employed at TAFE colleges around this country, and this is the only reason that the Greens will support the bill—but we do so grudgingly because the funds provided in this bill are entirely inadequate. The Greens have always been loud and vocal advocates of increased funding for TAFE, and we will outline our support for TAFE again today.
The context in which this bill comes before the Senate is important to understand. There is a political context, an ideological context and a socioeconomic context. Politically, this bill comes in the aftermath of an election in which vocational education and training got more attention than it has in the previous three years of neglect by the government, but unfortunately the publicity was not good. The frenzy of poorly conceived public policy and pork-barrelling that has come to characterise recent elections included the government's new initiative to introduce secondary technical colleges. This proposal came after the establishment of the Institute for Trade Skill Excellence and was followed by the abolition of the means by which state and federal cooperation is brokered with regard to vocational education and training—that is, the Australian National Training Authority, ANTA. 
The technical college proposal has been roundly criticised, and rightly so. Firstly, we might very well ask, `What is it?' There has been so little information coming from the government as to how this proposal would work. All we know is that there is to be about $290 million spent over four years establishing technical colleges for teaching year 11 and year 12 students trade skills along with current curricula, and that they are to be run autonomously by the principals of the institutions and to be free of state government or union involvement. It sounds to me like John Howard is seeking to create his very own system of private TAFEs. That is the sort of approach to a problem that you would expect from a greedy kid in the schoolyard who cannot get their own way—they create their own system—rather than the sort of approach that we would expect from a Prime Minister who is entrusted with making decisions for the country's future educational needs.
As to where these new institutions will be—whether they will be on new sites or replace existing institutions—all this is unknown. Nor is it clear whether the funding will replace any proposed funding for vocational education and training in secondary schools. Another question is: where will these colleges fall constitutionally? All educational institutions currently fall under state jurisdiction. There is no capacity for the Commonwealth to establish educational institutions under the Constitution except perhaps using the corporations power. So how will it be done? We do not know.
The Australian Education Union has estimated that these colleges will cost taxpayers almost 10 times as much per student as it would cost to deliver the same service through existing publicly funded TAFE colleges. Pat Forward from the Australian Education Union pointed out, shortly after details of the technical colleges were released, that:
According to the Government's own figures, the 24 colleges would provide training for 7,200 students at a total cost of $147m in their first full year of operation. This works out at a cost per student of $20,444.
By contrast, figures from the National Centre for Vocational Education Research financial data establish a total average cost per student in TAFE of $2,235—and this cost includes capital. 
Perhaps most importantly there are questions of quality and of need. Will these colleges provide the quality of education currently on offer in the TAFE system and will they provide the much needed boost to vocational education and training to address the burgeoning skills crisis? The issue of quality is under a cloud when we do not know what body will ensure that the qualifications issued by these private colleges are of any level of quality. We do not know this because quality control for vocational education and training is a matter for the states, and it appears that the Commonwealth is going out of its way to sidestep the need to enter into collaborative arrangements with the states regarding vocational education and training funding and provision. 
The Greens also note the intention to exclude unions from industrial and professional representation in these colleges and from the new advisory body—the Institute for Trade Skill Excellence. This is a worrying sign that points to a lack of standards and a poor focus on teaching excellence. The Institute for Trade Skill Excellence is the second pillar of the political context in which this bill is set. Quietly announced earlier this year, its purpose was not fully understood until the abolition of ANTA was foreshadowed a month or so ago. 
It now appears that the Institute for Trade Skill Excellence may be intended to replace much of the work of ANTA and in doing so replace input provided by unions, state governments and employers to the Commonwealth with a sole employer providing advice to the government in regard to the operations of these private institutions. That is because the Institute for Trade Skill Excellence has as its major shareholders the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Australian Industry Group, the Business Council of Australia and the National Farmers Federation. There is no representation from unions, there is no representation on behalf of teaching staff, there is no representation from state governments and there is no representation from either parents or students of these institutions. This new institute will see industry being asked to provide endorsement of qualifications that are provided through public and private training providers. It will identify preferred providers, it will establish an industry reference group and conduct marketing type tasks to promote trade skills and distribute certificates for graduating apprentices.
This has all the hallmarks of a government, having failed to get agreement on its negotiations with the states through the ANTA process, taking the opportunity to quit the system altogether—being the greedy boy not getting his way in the playground. In reality, the government is attempting to establish its own foothold in the vocational education and training sector to encourage future growth to occur under a federal umbrella endorsing privately provided training sanctioned by industry. This, surely, is why ANTA has been abolished. The government has failed to get agreement with the states regarding the Commonwealth's share of vocational education and training funding, because the Howard government has always cut or underfunded its share. In the recent negotiations it again refused to stump up adequate growth funds. It also wanted to use its financial muscle to impose antiunion requirements and user-choice provisions. As a result, the agreement was never made, so the government is happily pursuing its own model—eagerly endorsed by the employers—of privately provided and privately endorsed training packages.
To anyone familiar with the Howard government's record in education policy, this looks eerily familiar. Just as in the schools sector and in higher education, the Howard government has come in, has slashed public funding and strangled public institutions. It has created a crisis in the delivery of services and has then turned to students to deliver more funding to the sector by addressing demand through increased private provision—provision which has been encouraged by government subsidies to private providers and more access to the so-called education marketplace. In the meantime unions are attacked, the working conditions of teaching staff are threatened, and students, parents and families are asked to pay more for education of an inferior quality.
This is the ideological context in which this bill is set. The Howard government clearly believes that the best people to provide and manage vocational education and training in Australia are representatives of industry. If not, why would it create a replacement for ANTA that is made up of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Business Council, the Australian Industry Group and the National Farmers Federation? But the sad fact is that this approach simply does not and will not work. Firstly, the role of ACCI must be seen as compromised because they have as vocal members of their organisation private vocational education and training providers who have a profit based interest in the direction of government policy which has nothing whatsoever to do with addressing skills shortages or long-term skills planning, let alone any higher ideals about the benefits of well-rounded public education provision in the country. 
Secondly, industry involvement in the Howard government's vocational education and training policies to date has not addressed the skills shortage that we see today. Most of the growth in the New Apprenticeships scheme over the last few years has happened in areas where there are no skills shortages. It has been reported that over 20 per cent of new apprentices do not get proper training. I understand that half of all new apprentices leave their apprenticeships early because they feel exploited as cheap labour rather than having any opportunity to gain genuine training and apprentice experiences.
The Australian Industry Group has said that the number of traditional apprenticeships has been fairly stagnant since the Howard government came to office. That is eight years of neglect in addressing the burgeoning skills shortage that we are seeing at the moment. We find ourselves in 2004 with a shortage of around 20,000 skilled workers in areas including carpentry, construction, manufacturing and mining. There is, for example, a major crisis in the number of bricklayers in Australia.
This skills shortage is an appalling state of affairs. But what makes it so appalling is that the means to address the problem are so obvious: fund our marvellous and publicly funded TAFE system. TAFE is an amazing resource which is the envy of many comparable countries. They are numerous, they contain well-trained staff and they offer comprehensive learning environments and courses which are affordable and accessible. But TAFEs are currently struggling because the federal government has consistently refused to back the system with the generous funding that it needs and deserves; generous funding which, when you compare it to the secondary and tertiary education sectors, results in TAFE being the poor cousin. The amount of money needed to be put into the TAFE system is not large in comparison to the amount of money needed in our public secondary and higher education sectors.
The Greens have been campaigning for years at both state and federal levels in support of the interests of TAFE students and teachers. We do this because we recognise the vital role TAFE plays in delivering training and education to millions of Australians, often Australians with very limited resources, and it provides these opportunities in an accessible, affordable and equitable way. If the government shared the Greens' support of these millions of TAFE beneficiaries then it could have done what we and others have been calling for for years and made the necessary investment to allow TAFE to grow to meet the demands that exist in our community for the services provided by TAFE.
The Greens went to the last election with some costed commitments in the area of TAFE. We are committed to reversing the destruction of TAFE by such things as automatic, indexed for inflation increases in federal funding of TAFE by at least $32 million for each one per cent of growth in demand. This would make sure that every qualified Australian who wanted to improve their skills would have access to an appropriate TAFE course. It would cost little more than $1 billion over 2004 to 2006. We also support a `save TAFE' restoration package of $600 million spread over three years to redress damage to staffing levels, casualisation and the rundown of equipment; $200 million per annum to remove all student fees for educational services; and ending the funding of private providers that directly compete with our publicly funded TAFE system. This package would cost at least $2.8 billion in new money for TAFE over three years. As I said, it is a small amount of money by comparison with the investment that is needed in the secondary and tertiary education sectors.  
But this government actually does not want to save our TAFEs. It is happy to let them dwindle. This is obvious from the Howard government's appalling track record of hostility to TAFE, which includes a 15 per cent cut in real terms in federal funding of TAFE and a refusal to fund growth in student numbers, resulting in an unmet demand of 50,000 students. That is 50,000 Australians who are qualified and wanting to attend TAFE but cannot because of a shortage of places. 
From 1995 to 2002, a 77 per cent growth in the funding of private providers that compete with TAFE has occurred under this government. Private providers now teach about 15 per cent of vocational education and training hours in this country, up from an almost negligible number in 1995, thanks to the legacy of this government. Tragically, the problems that have been caused for TAFE have been exacerbated by the penny pinching of state governments. In my own state of New South Wales, TAFE teachers are currently involved in industrial action to win a fair pay deal for senior TAFE teachers, a claim that would simply bring them into line with their secondary school colleagues. The Greens support this action and condemn the state government for failing TAFE in its hour of need.
This action in New South Wales comes in the wake of dramatic rises in TAFE fees in New South Wales as well as other states. People who were paying $260 for a one-year course are now paying $300 per module—that is, between $3,000 and $4,500 for a full TAFE course. The effect of this is predictable: fewer people are enrolling at TAFE, and they are spending less time there. For some sections of the community the opportunity to access the second chance at education that TAFE provides is completely taken away.
This can only be bad news for our skills base and bad news for equity in education. This bill is a tragically wasted opportunity to turn this history of neglect around. It is a wasted opportunity to finally do something meaningful to address the chronic skills shortage unfolding in Australia today. The Greens condemn the government for this manifest failure to protect the interests of job seekers and industry. We call on the minister to recognise the value of the great TAFE system that we have, and to come back to this chamber with some alternative legislation that backs TAFE colleges and TAFE staff and enables them to meet the burgeoning need for training and education that the public TAFE system can and should be empowered to deliver.",SENATE,<title>VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2004-12-06,"—I rise to make my contribution in the second reading debate on the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992 to reduce the appropriated funding to be provided to the states and territories, following the failure of this government to reach agreement with them earlier this year in the signing of the Australian National Training Authority agreement. This government has repeatedly failed over the years to provide adequate growth funding through ANTA. It fails to recognise the unmet demand, and therefore no growth funds are being provided or have been provided for many years.  
This government continued its mean penny-pinching ways in reducing real funding for a field of education and training that has been growing fast. Of course, it tried to push the responsibility for our national skills shortage onto the states and territories. Now it has gone further and announced the abolition of ANTA—something that was not mentioned at all during the election campaign but which was announced minutes after this government again claimed victory. It was decided during the election campaign launch, where the Prime Minister announced a record amount of billions of dollars to be spent to get the government re-elected, that they would spend $289 million on building 24 new private technology colleges. Geoff Maslen, in an article he did for the Campus Review in May this year, said: 
The Federal budget failed to provide money for additional places to meet the needs of the estimated 50,000 Australians who were unable to enrol in TAFE courses this year ...  
The government claimed that the package being offered for the 2004-06 ANTA agreement would deliver 71,000 new places over the three years. The states and territories believed this to be a gross overestimate, their figure being only 18,000. They naturally defended their case and sought more growth funding, based on past trends and expectations of high levels of enrolment growth. Unfortunately—and this is so often the case with the government—the government decided that after so many years in power they knew best and failed to consult with the states and territories. The government believe they do not need to listen or consult. They made appropriations for the 2004 year in anticipation of their offer being accepted, but we now know that the states and territories held out. They stuck to their guns, with the result that there has been no new agreement and this bill before us offering a reduced fallback funding. 
The deal was initially rejected by the states and territories in December 2003. The Minister for Education, Science and Training then rolled over the existing agreement for a further 12 months but withdrew the indexation of growth funding and maintained all other funding at the 2003 level. The minister then went on further to demonstrate his annoyance by taking millions of dollars away and putting it out to private providers—10,000 new places in priority areas such as for older workers and people with a disability. However, when successful tenders were announced in May 2004, the number of new places had dropped to only 7,500 places, at a cost of $20.5 million.
This government is desperate and grasping at straws and has gone further by committing $289 million for private technology colleges. The government sees this as a genuine response to the national skills shortage which its policies over eight years have created. I will return to this point later in my speech. Reaching agreement on growth remains a key problem for this government. Estimates on growth vary. In January, in a Campus Review article entitled `States reject ANTA offer', it was estimated that unmet VET demand would be 57,000 places. Figures I have obtained from the ABS suggest that there was a shortage of around 43,000 places in 2003. These figures give an indication of the situation in the recent past, but we have a skills shortage and a need for many more places right now and into the future.  
The new private technology colleges will not even start for two years, and they are hardly the answer for here and now. As was stated by the shadow minister in the debate on last year's VET funding amendment bill, this government has not provided one extra cent of funding in six out of the nine years it has been negotiating ANTA agreements—and now it has suddenly turned around and discovered that it has a skills shortage on its hands and a crisis in industries in this country. The Australian Education Union says that over the past seven years cumulative budget cuts have reduced spending in TAFE by $240 million. Is it any wonder then that TAFE is critically short of funds and that so many young people are missing out on places? The truth is that this country has youth unemployment running at around 20 per cent, not the 7.5 or so per cent the government tries to have us believe. We have a national skills shortage, but we have had that for some years under this government. 
The Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee conducted an inquiry into this very matter only a year or so ago. There are anywhere between 40,000 and 50,000 young people unable to get TAFE places, yet we have an education minister who will not reasonably negotiate but who picks up his bat and ball and goes home when the states and territories try to argue for a better deal for young people in this country and try to address the skills shortages.
The Dusseldorp Skills Forum report How Young People are Faring 2004 reveals that a disturbing number of young people are being left behind, facing insecure employment and reduced earnings over the long term. More than 25 per cent of the 2002 school leavers experienced a troubled transition six months after leaving school. We in Labor are again saying that we do not like the situation, but we will not refuse this funding bill as there has to be some funding guaranteed. However, we condemn the government for failing again this year, as they have over the last eight years, to adequately fund an important area of the education sector to reflect real increases, to meet skills shortages, to guarantee young Australians a secure future and to assist older workers to upgrade or retrain.
As was pointed out by my colleague Dr Emerson in the House of Representatives, this government has been unable to accept that there is a skills shortage. It has seen the main problem as being one of industrial relations, where the solution is just to remove all workers rights and to allow wages and conditions to be eroded. It believes this will create jobs. The tragedy for the nation is that the jobs are already there. It is not that there are not enough trained and skilled people to fill them and it is not as if we have not been talking about a skills shortage in this country for years. I remember standing in this place arguing that this government needed to have a long-term strategy to address skills shortages the day it was announced that the Darwin to Alice Springs railway was to be built and still nothing had been done in the Territory to address that.
I want to digress for a minute. When I speak to small business in the Territory, the No. 1 issue it always raises with me is the skills shortages matter, not the industrial relations matter. Sometimes the issue is tax and the complicated BAS system they are working to, but nine times out of 10, repeatedly for the last 6½ years, small business in the Territory has put a case to me that there is a chronic skills shortage in the Northern Territory. The second biggest thing it says to me is that young people are not attracted to picking up a skill or a trade and that what the government needs to do is to spend some money on an advertising campaign to make training and having a trade skill attractive to young people, encouraging them to pick up a skill or a trade.  
Dr Emerson went on to point out that even the ACCI—which surely must be closer to the government than the trade unions are in this country—was telling the government that skills shortages are the main problem confronting business. So you are hearing it nationally and I am hearing it locally. Similar advice comes from the Australian Industry Group and the Business Council of Australia, both one would believe notable and well-informed organisations in the field of Australian industry and business and both at the coalface of trying to fill jobs with skilled and ready workers but unable to do so in anywhere near sufficient numbers.
The government have kept to the same old recording to the states and territories for years, saying to them, `You have GST revenue that is growing; you have to take on more responsibility for education or for health,' which is hardly a demonstration of national leadership and hardly what one would hope for from the highest-taxing government ever in the history of this country.
Let me go back to Dr Emerson's speech where he refers to this government's action in attempting to further strip awards and remove skills based career paths as an allowable matter. He said that this government does not even believe that employers should have any obligation to support staff training. There is a little bit of confusion there at the moment: maybe Minister Hardgrave does and Minister Nelson does not. So why should we think it might attach real importance to training nationally? Perhaps working towards a policy of private technical colleges offering $100,000 trade qualifications, as it has moved to do in the higher education sector.
So at a time of acknowledged and well-documented skills shortages, the Howard government not only has severely limited funding for VET—limiting growth of places, ducking and weaving on its national responsibilities and pushing its training agenda onto the states and territories—but also has removed any responsibility for employers to support training. How can it possibly believe this is the way to continue Australian growth, prosperity and international competitiveness? Every year over 10 per cent of Australians over 15 years of age study in the VET system. In 2002 there were 1.3 million people in the public TAFE system, which provides entry level VET for young people and also further opportunities for older workers and a second chance education for the economically disadvantaged. It is therefore a wide-reaching sector, important not only to us as a nation but to individuals too within that nation. It is perhaps especially important in my own electorate of the Northern Territory where large numbers of people access TAFE, especially disadvantaged Indigenous students for whom university is less of an option but for whom VET represents a real chance of training for employment.
The minister may well boast that under this government the number of people on traineeships and apprenticeships has doubled. Maybe that is true at the entry level, but how many of those entrants are completing their trade qualifications? That is a different figure. The truth is that many of the traineeships are short-term fixes, and most of this growth has been in certificate level training in retail and fast food, not in the traditional trades areas in which we are now facing severe shortages—trades such as building, panel beating and metal fabrication. This government has not had a strategy to examine skills shortages and respond accordingly. It still does not have a strategy. It wants to plug the gaps with 24 technical colleges. It has allowed the quick fix where statistics look nice—double the number of trainees and apprentices—but the final outcome does not fit the national demand for skills. It fits government political expediency but not national strategy. The results are now clear, and business is facing a massive skills shortage. 
This latest idea of 24 private technical colleges is not an appropriate national strategy either. These colleges will barely make a dent in the skills shortage. They do not start until 2006 and will not be fully operational until 2008, and by then tens of thousands more young Australians will have missed out on places. Furthermore, these colleges are to provide high-quality tuition for students in years 11 and 12, according to the minister's press release of 12 November, so many potential TAFE students will be excluded. The colleges may well provide tuition to more than 7,000 students but, to return to the figures from the ABS quoted earlier of around 43,000 places short in TAFE, these new colleges are nothing short of a gimmick and are not a serious attempt to reduce the shortage of places or skilled tradespeople.
Let us take the practicalities that exist in Darwin, which is supposed to be a place where one college will be located. If they are looking at getting at least 300 students into that technical college from the pool of year 11 and 12 students in the Darwin and Palmerston area, it has to be recognised that there are only about 1,000 or 1,200 year 11 and 12 students in that area at this stage. One has to wonder where they are going to find those 300 students. Obviously they will come out of the existing high schools that are already set up and that have well-established VET in Schools courses.
Before these colleges get anywhere near to being operational, Australian businesses will have spent many more fruitless and costly hours trying to recruit skilled workers who just are not there. Australian business cannot wait years for action from the Howard government. If the government were to put that $289 million into existing TAFE facilities and programs, we could see action right now and the shortage could be reduced far quicker than waiting until new colleges are built and operating. These new colleges are simply a wasteful duplication of facilities, which the nation's young people cannot afford. They will simply add another layer to the education system—another layer to the bureaucracy—and take funds away from the well-established state schools and TAFE institutions.
I am well aware that this bill is not about the establishment of the 24 colleges; it is about funds going to the vocational education and training sector of our education system. It is about the fact that this government is not providing enough growth funds in the vocational education and training sector. What it does mean is that the $289 million that has been set aside for the technical colleges is, as I said, a wasteful duplication of resources and facilities. In Darwin we have the Charles Darwin University, which has a massive amount of equipment and resources sitting waiting to be used by potential VET students. We have VET in Schools courses operating at Casuarina Senior College, Darwin High School and, particularly, Taminmin and Palmerston high schools. I believe we need a strategy that actually encourages these schools to work cooperatively with Charles Darwin University and to share the resources that we have got rather than simply setting up another building—another lot of bricks and mortar—which I do not think people believe is the answer to this problem. Building another building will not close the gap in skills shortages. What we need is better use of the current resources and a long-term strategy to attract people into the trades area and to ensure that these places come on board now, not in 2006 and 2008. 
I know that Senator Allison mentioned comments by Pat Forward, the AEU federal TAFE secretary, who said on behalf of her members of the current proposal to set up the technical colleges:
This is a ham-fisted attempt to bypass the public TAFE system. It arises from the government's inability to establish positive and productive relationships with the Labor State governments, particularly in the area of vocational education and training.
This government has failed to realise that there needs to be growth funding in this industry. This government has failed to work cooperatively with state and territory governments to address the skill shortages and to properly give due recognition to the needs of and the resources required by the public TAFE system. The Labor Party believe that this bill is a great disappointment for our nation but, as I said, we will not be opposing it. Some money flowing into the VET system is better than no money and there must be some funding for 2005. I particularly condemn the government for its failure to adequately fund the vocational education and training sector repeatedly over many years to guarantee our young people a secure future, to meet skills shortages and to assist older workers to upgrade or retrain.
I noticed that Senator Carr this morning made comments about the technical colleges, the abysmal waste of money that this will lead to, the lack of recognition from this government that this money needs to be put into creating places right now and a promise that we will pursue this in estimates at every chance we possibly get. We will be raising this as an issue every year for the next three years. The government just discovered during the election campaign that it had a skills shortage on its hands. I do not know why it has taken the government this long to realise that. Certainly the committee that Senator George Campbell and I have been working on had raised this as an issue in an inquiry over 12 months ago. Businesses have been raising this as an issue with me for the last 6½ years. This government's answer is not to put $289 million into places here and now but simply to establish more capital works, more buildings, to create a privatised TAFE sector, to bypass the states and territories and to make sure that it is only available for year 11 and 12 students when there is currently a very good system in place—the VET in Schools system—which is working but which is severely underfunded. This is not the answer to the skills shortage in this country.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2004-12-06,"—The Senate is debating the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004. I want to deal with the implications of the bill for Tasmanians. The legislation before us appropriates funds for state and territory TAFE systems. Despite Tasmania having had a strong economy in recent years, unemployment in my home state is still above the Australian average and there is a significant problem with long-term unemployment. Tasmanians also suffer the lowest average weekly earnings of all states and territories. One way to improve these factors—employment, income levels and levels of economic development—is to increase the average level of education of Tasmanians by making university and TAFE places more accessible.
Late last year I was involved, along with Senator Shayne Murphy, in negotiating with the federal government extra university places for Tasmanians because we were not getting our fair share. I pointed out that Tasmania received less than its fair share of student places per head of population. As a result, the University of Tasmania will be awarded over 1,600 new student places by 2008. These negotiations resulted in more than $200 million in benefits for Tasmania. Despite a tendency by some people to see vocational education and training as the poor cousin of university education, we should not discount its importance. TAFE education provides different skills to those provided by universities, but it is just as valuable as university education and in some respects is more so. Vocational education and training provides very valuable skills and training to students, who become the backbone of our economy. 
There are almost 14,000 vocational education and training students in Tasmania. We know from statistics that vocational education and training is a very important step to employment. I will quote some of the statistics. Seventy-two per cent of Tasmanian TAFE graduates are employed after their training. Seventeen per cent of TAFE graduates who were not employed before their training were employed afterwards. So we know that this training is very important for employment. In fact, Tasmanian TAFE training gives the biggest boost in employment of its students of all states and territories except for Queensland.
The TAFE sector in Tasmania is undergoing significant growth. The latest figures we have show that the total number of hours of delivery of TAFE education increased between 2002 and 2003 by over 11 per cent. That is the biggest growth of any state or territory and double the growth of the next highest growth state—Queensland. The Australian average growth was just three per cent. There is a lot of other good news in the Tasmanian TAFE sector: per hour costs of delivering training have fallen by more than 20 per cent since 1999; participation is growing faster than the national average, which means that Tasmanian participation levels are catching up to the overall national average; the Tasmanian state government increased its dollar allocation to TAFE by 15 per cent between 1999-2000 and 2003-04; and 84 per cent of employers were very or moderately satisfied with TAFE graduates' skills.
But, despite this good news, there has been an impasse in negotiations between state and territory governments and the Commonwealth over future funding of the state TAFE system. In fact, the last two Australian National Training Authority agreements on funding have not been signed off. Commonwealth funding offers in negotiations on the latest ANTA agreement have not recognised the forecast growth levels or unmet demand in Tasmania. And Commonwealth funding is important—it makes up about a third of public funds spent on the national vocational education and training system. The Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Commonwealth Bank produced a survey of business expectations for the March quarter this year which identified the availability of suitably qualified employees as one of the top three constraints on Tasmanian businesses. We need more skilled graduates to help the expansion of the Tasmanian economy. But, despite the importance of training to the state, the Commonwealth has insisted on linking industrial relations provisions—the construction code—to the funding, creating a barrier to resolving the negotiations.
The Commonwealth government has recently announced a number of Australian technical colleges, one of which will be based in northern Tasmania. I understand the initiative will provide training in a number of trades to 300 students in their last two years of school, but this will not address the funding problems in the state TAFE system and will only focus on the particular courses it will offer in one part of Tasmania. Whatever the arguments for and against the Australian technical colleges, they are only a small add-on to a much larger system of state and territory run TAFE colleges. We cannot afford to ignore the funding needs of the overwhelming number of students. 
One of the effects of this impasse in negotiations has been a seven per cent increase in TAFE fees from 2005 for Tasmanian students. I do not pretend to know all the ins and outs of the negotiations between state and territory governments and the Commonwealth over funding for vocational education and training, but I do know that linking unrelated industrial relations requirements to funding will obviously make it impossible for state and territory Labor governments to come to agreement with the Commonwealth. And I do know that, by not granting adequate funding to state vocational education and training systems, the main people who suffer are the students. They do not deserve to bear that burden.",SENATE,<title>VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2004-12-06,"—On the surface, the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004 is a routine piece of legislation. This bill amends the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act to reduce the appropriated limit of total funds for vocational education and training to the Australian National Training Authority, for distribution to the states and territories for 2004, from $1.136 billion to $1.131 billion, to reflect the outcome of the ANTA negotiations. It will also appropriate funds for vocational education and training, to be provided for distribution to the states and territories for the year 2005, up to a limit of $1.154 billion. But in reality this bill is much more than a mechanism used to provide federal funds to the states and territories for vocational education and training; it is an annual reminder of this government's terminal failure to properly fund vocational education and training in Australia. More importantly, it is a constant reminder of the failure of this government to understand the importance of the role played by TAFE in our vocational training system in this country.
We have noted the decision by the government to establish 24 technical colleges which will be run by the private sector. One has to assume that this is the beginning of the transfer by this government of the training agenda out of the hands of the public sector or the state systems and into the hands of the private sector. I wonder to what extent the private sector will fulfil the role that TAFE plays in the community in terms of both our training infrastructure and dealing with some of the other peripheral issues that surround that. I had the privilege of visiting the South-West TAFE in Sydney, about a month or so before the election, to see at first hand the training being provided to our boilermakers, welders, sheet metal workers and plumbers and those in a range of other trades that were being serviced by that TAFE. I also had the privilege of watching the teachers in that TAFE system spend time and energy on dealing with young disadvantaged workers—young people who had not completed year 10. They were giving up their time to train them in the basic skills that would enable those kids to get a place in the TAFE system and, more importantly, get a place in the apprenticeship system so that they would be given hope into the future. I also watched teachers at Miller TAFE spending time with young kids who had severe learning difficulties, teaching them no more than how to read a train timetable so that those kids could get to work on time. I wonder to what extent the private training providers—the new technical colleges—will put time and energy into trying to assist those sorts of kids to get through our system, to work their way through our system, and get a place in the trade areas where there are skills shortages.
Over their nine years in power, the Howard government have run vocational training into the ground, in the process denying a generation of young Australians a chance to embark upon worthwhile careers and nurturing a skills crisis that threatens to stunt economic growth both now and in the years to come. While Labor will not stand in the way of this bill being passed, we will not let the government's disappointing attitude towards vocational education go unchallenged. Every year that this bill has been introduced into the chamber has been a demonstration, again and again, of the short-sighted nature of the government's approach over the past nine years as to the way it has funded the VET system. It is a constant reminder as to why we are suffering a major crisis in terms of the skilled work force of this country at this point in time. The funding to VET has been reduced cumulatively, I think, by over $200 million. We have seen something like 50,000 young Australians, including 15,000 school leavers, miss out on TAFE every year. With a youth unemployment rate that is stuck at around 19.7 per cent, we can hardly afford this situation to continue.  
But it is not just a question of whether or not young people are able to get into good paying job opportunities for the future. This approach by this government over the past nine years has had and will have a severe impact on our economy. There is currently on the drawing board in this country $25 billion to $30 billion of major project work from the North-West of Western Australia right across to Gladstone in North Queensland. There is no question that those projects will suffer from skills shortages. They will not, because the salaries that will be available to the skilled workers on those projects will be at a level sufficient to attract labour from all around the country. But the impact on our economy when those projects start to suck labour out of our general engineering sector in the metropolitan areas will be that much of our general engineering and metal-working sector, which underpins our economy on a day-to-day basis, will be struggling to survive as a result of those labour shortages. Many of those businesses will collapse as a consequence of that, resulting in the fact that when people come off those projects they will join the unemployment queues. More importantly, the damage done to the economy in the interim will take a very substantial period of time to repair. Thanks to this government's short-sightedness we are facing that sort of a skills crisis in this country now and, in the short to medium term, very significant difficulty in even coming close to overcoming it.
There is evidence in abundance as to what is happening in that area. We know, for example, that over the next five years something like 170,000 tradespeople will leave the traditional trades. We also know that only around 40,000 people will enter them. According to the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations skilled vacancy index, vacancies for skilled tradespersons have increased by a staggering 54 per cent over the last three years. In the manufacturing sector alone, there are currently between 18,000 and 21,000 unfilled vacancies for tradespeople. Skills shortages are now regularly listed as one of the top constraints, if not the top constraint, on investment by Australian businesses—and that is not just large Australian businesses; that is small and medium Australian enterprises, the same enterprises we hear this government talk about daily and dearly.
We heard the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations in this chamber during question time go on about the fact that if only we could get rid of the unfair dismissal laws, if only we would pass the legislation, we would create 77,000 new jobs in the small business sector. What the small business sector is crying out for is not 77,000 new jobs; it is crying out for skilled workers who are available to go and work in their industries to meet the shortages that they have currently and are not able to meet out of the current labour force, the skilled workers they do not have the capacity or the resources to train in order to meet their skills needs. AiG, for example, say that over half the businesses they regularly survey face skills shortages. In regional areas the situation is even worse. In New South Wales alone, for example, 60 per cent of regional businesses face skills shortages. 
Quite frankly, the government's response to this situation has been farcical. First, we had the National Skills Shortages Strategy. Unfortunately, the most impressive thing about this so-called strategy was its title. I think the only thing it ever offered was a web site. It certainly offered no new funding to meet skills shortages. It had a web site and a grab bag of pilot programs and policy reviews. In fact, the initiative was so poorly received the government were sent scrambling back to the drawing board. And what have they come up with to supplement this flawed policy? We have seen the announcement during the election campaign of the technical colleges. I am not suggesting that these technical colleges will not add to our overall capacity to meet Australia's crippling skills crisis. Of course they will make a contribution in one form, but will they solve the problem? Of course they will not. There is no way in the world that 24 technical colleges, taking in people, I think, from years 11 and 12, will solve the crisis that we currently face across all of our industries in the quest for skilled labour at this present point in time, and they certainly will not serve them into the future.
The causes of the skills crisis that we face are complex, and there are no easy answers to fixing them. Last year, for example, I chaired a Senate committee which was dedicated to investigating the skills crisis. Our report tackled the complexity of the issue and gave over 50 separate recommendations covering areas as diverse as the collation of labour data and identifying current and future skill needs, improving VET in schools, developing pathways between VET and higher education, the role of industry and many other areas. But, despite the fact that the government has had this report for nearly a year, it continues to try to offer what it sees as simplistic answers like the one of technical colleges announced during the election campaign. While they may make great headlines in the context of a federal election campaign, they will not, as I said, solve the skills crisis that we are confronted with. The crisis needs to be dealt with today—not in 2006 and certainly not in 2008, when hopefully these colleges will be operating at their optimum level.
In fact, the government is spending something like $289 million on an initiative that is simply going to duplicate what we currently have in place when the money could be used much more effectively to build on the current system in order to deliver quicker results to our industry. For example, there are a number of skill centres around this country that could substantially maximise the contribution they are making to our skills shortage situation with a lot fewer resources than the government has planned to throw into these technical colleges. Some of those examples are Austool, in Ingleburn, and a construction industry training centre which is in the current minister's own electorate—and I suspect he has not visited it yet, let alone knows that it even exists. That centre has the capacity to deal with about 3,000 building industry apprentices every year. It is funded by a levy on the industry and works hand and fist with the local TAFE college to provide the training resources to train those apprentices, as well as training for subcontractors and independent contractors in the construction industry on how to run their businesses. That is an example that could have been followed in order to put something in place that could have delivered quickly the sorts of skills training outcomes required to meet the crisis that currently exists within our skilled labour force. 
There are other examples, such as the Hunter Valley training facility, the Australian aviation centre in Brisbane and the Bosch/RMIT program in Victoria. With regard to TAFE, two technical colleges will be established in Bairnsdale and Warrnambool in Victoria, both of which have long-established TAFE institutes and group training companies. The millions that the government plans to spend on this handful of technical colleges would be better spent on providing new TAFE places for the close to 50,000 young Australians who are currently missing out.
What is more, this is an initiative with an exceedingly narrow scope. It attempts to address the skills crisis in isolation without consideration of a host of other important issues. For example, while this initiative is aimed at developing technical skills in new workers, it completely ignores the fact that employers also want their employees to have good interpersonal skills and high levels of literacy and numeracy. It also ignores the fact that thousands of workers in industry today with limited training could be cross-skilled or could shift their skills base to meet shortages in particular areas that they are not in at the moment. They will not be able to be catered for by these new technical colleges. Again, one comes back to the question I initially asked: why is the government so dead set on bypassing the TAFE system in order to meet this issue of skills shortages? The only conclusion that you can come to is that this is the start of the process by this government to shift vocational training infrastructure out of the public sector into the private sector and to hand over total responsibility for providing training for our skilled labour force, at whatever level that may be, to industry and the private sector.
The recent abolition of ANTA provides a stark example of the government's `my way or the highway' attitude towards the states and VET. The government summarily abolished ANTA without consulting state governments. In fact, even the federal department of education was not consulted. ANTA staff only learnt of their fate on the day of the announcement. Whilst ANTA was by no means perfect, it played an important role and gave equal voices to government, educational institutions, industries and unions. One of the important roles that ANTA played was keeping a national focus on the training agenda—keeping a national focus on the standards that were being provided for various skills within our society and ensuring the portability and interchangeability of those skills and their capacity to move flexibly across a labour market. What body will now play that role in ensuring that there is a standard set of skills that exist within our society that is flexible and capable of meeting shifts in the labour market as the labour market's demands change with movements in our economy? There is no body currently in place that has the capacity to do that. The reality is that this is a bill that was delayed. It is a bill that is necessary in one context for ensuring ongoing funding to the TAFE system, but it is a bill, in my view, that is starting to shift the provision of vocational education and training from the public sector slowly into the hands of the private sector and the direct responsibility of industry.",SENATE,<title>VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2004-12-06,"—in reply—The Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004 will provide a total of $1.15 billion as the Australian government's contribution to the states and territories for vocational education and training for the 2005 calendar year. Vocational education and training underpins Australia's ability to compete in an increasingly global market and it is vital to ensure our continued economic growth. 
It is interesting to note, given the contribution of other speakers here today, that the Australian government's contribution to the states and territories has grown from $777.9 million under Labor to $1.13 billion under the coalition government in 2004—an increase of 45 per cent. In real terms, the Australian government has increased funding for training by 23 per cent since 1995. By contrast, in 2004-05, most of the states and territories cut their training budgets—New South Wales by 2.4 per cent in real terms, Western Australia by 2.1 per cent and the Northern Territory by 5.2 per cent. Last year, the states and territories rejected the Australian government's offer for the proposed 2004-06 ANTA agreement of $3.6 billion—a 12.5 per cent increase on the 2001-03 agreement. If accepted, this offer would have created up to 71,000 new training places. These would have been in addition to the extra 15,750 places for aged care training announced in the 2004-05 federal budget.
We have also announced new measures in our election commitments to a total value of $1.06 billion over four years. This is one of the most significant boosts to vocational education and training ever taken by any government. During the debate in the House on the VET funding bill, the opposition raised the need to address unmet demand to study at TAFE. The latest ABS figures released last Thursday, 2 December, show that there has been yet another decrease in unmet demand. This means that more and more students applying for a place in a TAFE or other vocational education course are being successful. In 1995, an estimated 89,300 individuals applied for but were unable to gain a place to study in a VET course. Of these, 69,400 were seeking access to a TAFE place. In 1999, the level was 71,100 for all VET and 53,900 for TAFE. In 2003 the level had fallen to 55,400, of which 45,900 were seeking places in TAFE. In 2004, from figures released by the ABS on 2 December, the level has fallen further to 45,500, with 34,100 seeking to study at TAFE. All this is against the background of an increase of 35 per cent in the number of VET students since 1995.
The strong VET system supported by national initiatives has seen a continued and steady decline in the level of unmet demand for VET over recent years. The reform of Australia's VET system and the increased funding provided by the Australian government are providing increased opportunity for all. In the vocational education and training sector we are now in a transition stage in terms of national arrangements and, as we heard on 22 October, the Prime Minister announced the abolition of the Australian National Training Authority, ANTA, and the transfer of its functions to the Department of Education, Science and Training from July 2005.
ANTA was established in 1992 to coordinate the levels of government in setting up a truly national vocational education and training system and 12 years on this national system with industry leadership is in place. It is a significant achievement of ANTA, and indeed of all of the stakeholders, that the national training system that we are now delivering is industry endorsed with nationally recognised qualifications that are the envy of many other countries. The transfer of ANTA functions to the department acknowledges the maturity of the system and the achievements of the national training system to date. It does not mean that there will be a reduction in effort—quite the opposite. The Prime Minister has announced that a new ministerial council will be established to ensure the continued harmonisation of a national system of standards of assessment and of accreditation. This will allow a clearer focus on critical issues facing Australia such as skill shortages, and I stress it is the government's intention that the national system will continue and that industry's central role will be maintained. 
In recognition of industry's role in the vocational education and training sector the Howard government will establish the Australian Institute for Trade Skill Excellence. This institute will provide industry endorsement and qualifications provided by both private and public training providers and will identify high-quality and industry relevant training. The strength of Australia's economy has seen a strong increase in the demand for skilled workers. For too long, success for young Australians has been equated with finishing year 12 and getting a university degree. We are committed to challenging the view that new apprenticeships and vocational education are second-best to university and to providing high-quality alternatives to the 70 per cent of young people who do not go directly from school to university. 
The latest figures show that in 2003 there were more than 1.7 million students in vocational education and training. This represents more than 12 per cent of Australia's working age population and, as I said before, an increase of 35 per cent from 1995. New apprenticeships have grown to around 400,000 in training—nearly three times the number in training in 1995. Today, new apprenticeships are available in more than 500 occupations, including emerging industries such as aero skills electrotechnology, information technology and telecommunications. This bill appropriates funding for the full 12 months, enabling states and territories to plan their ongoing vocational education and training delivery. I commend the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004 to senators.
Question agreed to.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2004-12-06,"—I rise to speak in the second reading debate on the Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004 and the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill 2004. These are both matters close to my own heart and close to the top of the opposition's policy priorities, namely, the education of Australian children in Australian schools. This was a crucial policy issue during the recent election campaign and, despite the various attempts by some in the media and others to suggest that this was a policy based on the politics of envy, nothing could be further from the truth. This was a policy which went to the heart of fundamental questions of social justice in this country.
At this stage of the year the opposition clearly have no intention of holding up these major funding bills. Not only do we not want to threaten a substantial share of the funding that goes to public education but also, of course, there is the funding that goes to less wealthy non-government schools in both the Catholic and other sectors. So we are not prepared to hold up this legislation.
In the first place, I think it is important to reiterate that, as far as Labor is concerned, the first priority of government must be high-quality, universally accessible funding for public education. Equally, wherever a child goes to school, whether to a public or a private school, we take the view that all children are entitled to resources at levels that meet a national standard. Therefore, schools should be funded on the basis of need and, accordingly, I move the following second reading amendment that expresses that view:
At the end of the motion, add “but the Senate:
	(a)	condemns the Government for its unfair funding policies for schools; and
	(b)	believes that there is a need to restore integrity and sustainability to Commonwealth funding of schools through the adoption of comprehensive principles that include:
	(i)	supporting high quality public schooling as a national priority,
	(ii)	recognising the entitlement of all children and young people to national standards of educational results and resources,
	(iii)	giving priority in funding for all Commonwealth programs for schools to meeting the educational and financial needs of schools,
	(iv)	recognition of the right of parents to choose the type of schooling for their children and to public funding for that schooling based on need, and
	(v)	Commonwealth funding for schools should be provided as part of a national partnership with state and territory governments so that all governments work together to deliver high quality schooling for all”. 
I am sure that those senators interested in this question will recall that, back in December 2000, when the last major funding package was brought before the Senate, I made the point that nothing matters more than the education of our children. Of course, I still hold that view. 
When Labor passed the 2000 package, we outlined that we regarded it as poorly thought out legislation which was a recipe for increased inequality in the outcomes of Australian schooling. I think that position has been borne out by the passage of time. We passed the bill in December 2000 because we simply had no choice in the matter. It is quite apparent that the concerns expressed at the time of the passage of the legislation have now come to pass. We will pass this legislation for very much the same reasons as we did the previous package. We believe this is a very badly thought through piece of legislation. We argue that Australian schools deserve far better. However, they deserve to know with certainty what their funding will be for the next year and that is essentially why we will be voting for this legislation today.
In the previous parliament, I chaired a Senate inquiry into the principles that underlie this particular bill. While the inquiry was inevitably truncated because of the time constraint, it nonetheless received some 80 submissions and heard evidence in four cities over five days. The most remarkable thing to come out of that inquiry was overwhelming evidence, across the board, that the present government's funding policy was not working; that it was fundamentally flawed. That, of course, came from those in the public education system. They pointed out that government schools have been sliding well and truly behind in terms of their share of Commonwealth funding. It was also pointed out—they were able to convey the message to Australian parents—that students in government schools were being treated as second best. The students in these schools were being treated by this government as if they were attending schools of last resort.
It was not just those in public education who were expressing concerns about the direction of government policy. The committee also heard evidence from educationalists and parents whose children were in private schools. They argued that strong, comprehensive public schools were in the best interests of the nation as a whole. As educationalists, they understood that a national education system must be founded on a sound, trusted, high-quality public education system that provides opportunities for all.
At the same time, it was not only the advocates of public education who pointed out the problems and the anomalies within the current funding arrangements for private schools. Non-government schools themselves gave evidence that they were very unhappy about the way the funding system was administered and worked for private schools. Different groups raised different issues. For example, those from Christian and Lutheran schools were worried about the future of substantial proportions of schools within their systems which, they said, could not survive if the full effect of the current funding formula—the SES formula—were applied to them. The formula was simply inadequate, they said, to support low-fee schools, especially those in regional areas and those still finding their feet as relatively new schools.
The Catholic systems told the committee that, although they were now to be funded on the basis of the actual SES scores of their schools, they did not intend to distribute the aggregated recurrent grants provided by the Commonwealth on the basis of the SES index. Instead, they all reported that they would continue to allocate funds on the basis of the actual resource needs of the schools within the system, which was something not reflected in the SES formula. Small private schools in the Australian Capital Territory told us that the SES funding system was a disaster in Canberra. SES scores failed completely to reflect the socioeconomic make-up of the school communities because of the unusually heterogeneous nature of Canberra suburbs, where the wealthy live next door to the disadvantaged. Some schools, funded under the `fair' SES system—as it was described—were struggling to stay open because the SES system completely missed the target in terms of assessing their true needs. 
This, and much more evidence, convinced me that the current school funding arrangements and the priorities set by this government are in a shambles. They do not reflect either the needs of a school and the community or the wider views and aspirations of the public at large. This is a government that is deeply at odds with the Australian community about schools funding.
The second major theme that came out of the Senate inquiry was that people across the political spectrum in the schools funding debate were sick and tired of the division and disharmony around these matters. They wanted to see a new consensus. As educators, there was a widespread view that there should be a new set of arrangements entered into whereby people involved in the schools debate were free to actually get on with the job of education. That is what they really cared about. They recognised that to establish a new consensus we have to work together, as a nation, to achieve agreement about how schooling will be funded from the public purse. We have to forge an agreement with the states and territories for that to eventuate.
The Howard government, on the other hand, right up until today, has presided over division and discord. In this area of policy—as in so many others I can think of, such as those concerning asylum seekers or industrial relations—this is a government that has sought to play upon wedge politics. It has taken the view that one can essentially ignore the social cost, because it thrives on a them and us mentality and has sought to essentially exploit those divisions within the community.
Labor takes the view that it is the national government's responsibility to make sure that the nation works together. The national government has to take an active responsibility for building coherent policies and the political consensus that should accompany them. National government should be in the business of building social harmony. We have too many factors working within education at the moment to pull this nation apart. Xenophobia and religious bigotry are just two examples of those sorts of pressures. We see the alienation of the socially dislocated and the disadvantaged. We see the victims of the Howard government's policies in terms of industrial relations and social policy as another area of major social concern. We say that it is time for the government to reverse its callous, irresponsible strategy of neglect and to face up to the real issues in Australian school funding.
The question of capital funding requires considerable attention. Political stunts are being pulled in terms of this legislation by bypassing the states and handing out token amounts of capital funding. Many small projects—such as sun protection devices or airconditioners—are being used to bring this issue to the fore. What is remarkable is this new government policy of directing funding straight to school-parent organisations on a submission model, with applications going straight from schools to the Commonwealth. Once again, we see this highly conservative government turning its back on traditional liberal principles about the role of the states in this area. We see a highly conservative, reactionary government essentially turning its back on the traditional provision of the responsibilities of the state. The government is proposing that government funding go to both government and non-government schools on the basis not of recognised block funding authorities but of direct government grant. 
What we have got here is a government program essentially seeking to bypass Labor states. That is really the core of it. What we have got is a government that is trying to curry favour with kids in government schools by providing tokenistic payments for small-scale projects and facilities. It is a gimmick, and parents of government school students will not be fooled by it. They will not deduce from this that the Commonwealth actually cares for programs any more than it did in the past, but they will know that it is another opportunity for local members of parliament to get into the rort mill, to be able to provide special largesse to favoured communities where it suits the government.
Labor's priorities for schools funding are clear in our policy. For Labor, the priority in funding for schooling must go to government schools, to public education. That does not mean that we would abandon private schools. Our view is that support for the non-government sector is critical but that it should not be seen as some sort of abject entitlement. Labor policy calls for a national schools resource standard, linking federal and state funding to this standard. All Australian children—even the sons and daughters who go to Geelong Grammar—ought to be able to expect that schools work to a standard. Labor have a commitment with the states and territories to cooperate to bring coherence and fairness to the funding of both public and private schools. Everybody should be funded on the basis of need.
The Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004 is being debated cognately with the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill 2004. Essentially, the second bill is about the government's $700 reading voucher scheme. Labor do not oppose the introduction of this measure, because we support any measure that might help kids who are having trouble learning to read to reach the standards that are required by a complex and challenging world. However, we would like to draw the Senate's attention to some of the issues that these measures do raise. My colleague Jenny Macklin has said that the literacy measure introduced in this bill, the Tutorial Credit Initiative, is yet another example of catch-up politics on the part of the minister, Dr Nelson. The issue of early reading and literacy is one that was put firmly on the agenda by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Mark Latham, much earlier in the year. Labor are well aware of the need to start early when it comes to reading. Literacy and numeracy in the early years will be a high priority for a Labor government. We will develop a program designed to positively encourage an interest in reading in all children in the preschool years.
—And your state governments couldn't care less about it.
—Senator Kemp, since your brother was removed from this portfolio it has gone downhill. We understand what the dilemma is in the Kemp family: the heart has gone out of the government in these matters. It is purely, blindly ideological, without any coherent understanding of what is going on. So I can understand why you are so concerned about this, Senator Kemp. 
I want to draw attention to some of the potential difficulties the government is facing with the implementation of this tutorial scheme. First, many commentators have drawn attention to the logistical problems—for instance, the availability of tutors in all regions, especially rural and remote areas. Of course there will be no provision on the basis of need. Second, there is the capacity and opportunity—again, especially in remote and regional areas—for parents to seek assistance for their children. I am concerned that this bill will not be able to provide for that. Third, there are details of the brokering arrangements for the hiring of tutors and the assigning of tutors to students. These, again, are very sketchy. I look forward to the Senate estimates, where we will be able to have that explained to us, along with the way in which the money has actually been allocated. I pity the poor officers that have to explain that. Labor will want to know exactly how the government proposes to make the initiative truly effective for kids and their families in every region, from every corner of the country. We want to make sure that every element of our society actually has access to these provisions.
On the surface it is pretty easy to sustain the charge that this looks like a cynical publicity grab, a device to try to attract votes, particularly in marginal seats—yet another quick fix from Dr Nelson. It appears to have all the hallmarks of an ill-considered, ill-conceived policy initiative designed by the pollsters, aimed at winning votes in marginal electorates. With those sorts of reservations, we obviously will support the measure, but we do acknowledge that there are profound administrative difficulties. I look forward to the officers at estimates explaining to us how these problems are being sorted out. The problem is that the officers constantly have to take out the garbage for this government. Things just get dumped in the bin and someone has to carry it out. I am afraid this is yet another example where that will occur.
What we are looking for here is for the Commonwealth to explain how it intends to actually administer these programs. All the sound evidence supports the view that reading programs need to be integrated within an entire pedagogic program. I look forward to seeing how the Commonwealth officers will be able to explain the processes that have led to the development of this policy. From my experience as a teacher I know that past programs have been developed, such as Reading Recovery and various others, which have shown considerable success.
—You're the cause of the problem; I was wondering who was the cause of the problem.
—We never had these sorts of difficulties at Glenroy Tech. We never saw the Kemp brothers at Glenroy Tech, I can assure you. There are other areas, particularly in the run-up to the federal election, where I think the government used individual voters in a bid to seek to develop a much broader social policy. What happened here is that the government failed to develop a coherent educational policy but rather had a grab bag of measures aimed at securing votes in marginal electorates. The Howard government has abandoned policy coherence—and since Dr Kemp's departure from the portfolio you could have expected that. There has been no real understanding of what is required to actually lift educational attainment in this country, to encourage higher levels of participation and to ensure that there is a genuine approach to social justice in these matters. The second reading amendment that I have moved today addresses some of those concerns and I trust that the Senate will find favour with it. ",SENATE,<title>SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE (LEARNING TOGETHER—ACHIEVEMENT THROUGH CHOICE AND OPPORTUNITY) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-12-06,"—I also rise to speak on the Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004 and the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill 2004. The government has chosen to ignore completely all of the criticisms that were made of its SES funding model. This bill simply enshrines those inequities and ignores the problems that have been raised. It does significantly increase grants to the Catholic school system, and no doubt much of this money will go to schools that have fewer resources than wealthy schools, but that is because the Catholic sector will distribute those funds according to its own criteria of need.
This bill also places numerous and not very sensible or useful conditions on the funding of both government and non-government schools. The Democrats initiated the pre-election inquiry by the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee into Commonwealth funding for schools. That inquiry said that the federal government's funding arrangements were not needs based because they failed to take into account the actual income of parents and the many other resources available to the wealthiest non-government schools, providing the largest increases in funding to non-government schools that were already operating well above the resources that were available to government schools.
Louise Watson's report, presented to the inquiry, showed that 27 per cent of private students—in a survey of 1,000 private schools—attend schools where the income from tuition fees alone exceeded the average resources per student in government schools. Ten years ago the federal government allocated around 62 per cent of its school education budget to non-government schools. Now that figure is 71 per cent. Between 1996 and 2001-02, Commonwealth expenditure on non-government schools grew almost twice as fast, at 48 per cent, as expenditure on government schools, at 28 per cent. The result is that independent non-government schools have far higher resources than government or systemic Catholic schools.
The federal government now provides more funding to non-government schools than it does to our public universities. The SES model is also so problematic that over 50 per cent of non-government schools are funded outside its formula. Just imagine a tax system in which half of the population were exceptions to the rule. If the SES system were applied to all schools, apparently it would be unfair, but we are expected to believe that it is a fairer system than the one it replaced. Of course, it is unfair whichever way you look at it—it is not needs based, unless you think that schools that can afford to spend twice or even three times as much as other schools on every student should be publicly subsidised.
The Prime Minister made a big fuss over the Catholic systemic schools coming under the SES system from 2005, but in 2005 almost 60 per cent of Catholic schools will not be funded according to the SES model. When it introduced the new SES funding formula for non-government schools, which the Democrats voted against, the federal government said it was based on need. Four years of operation of the SES funding model has generated a large body of evidence describing the problems inherent within that model and pointing to the fact that need as measured in the model related to only one measure—the notional, geographically averaged capacity of parents to pay fees.
So what does it matter that the government has made such generous contributions to the running of schools that already have high incomes and often high levels of achievement—if you count university entry as a measure, as I think most parents would? Australia's levels of learning are quite good when compared with other countries, and some might say that the system must be working. But the problem, as we all know, is that the gap between high and low achievers is big and growing under this approach. Dr Barry McGaw told the schools funding inquiry that the Australian schools system as a whole is one of the most inequitable in the developed world in terms of the distance between the schooling outcomes for students from the highest socioeconomic background on the one hand and those from the lowest on the other. We are now in the unfortunate situation where kids who are bright and who have supportive, well-educated and well-resourced parents are doing much better than the bright kids who happen to be born in poor or isolated families. 
What is wrong with the government's approach is that it does not encourage a level playing field for children. Sure, a lot of parents not on high incomes make very big sacrifices to send their children to private schools, but the question I think we should be asking here is: why do they feel they must do this and doesn't it suggest that they think the government school system is not well enough resourced? This approach also ignores the most crucial question: what are the educational needs of the child? How does the child with a learning disability or a language problem or those who are Indigenous fit into this needs based model? The most difficult to teach children will not be found in wealthy schools. Yet it is the difficult to teach who need our attention most.
Research from the St Vincent de Paul Society says that, if you are a child in one of the 21 per cent of Australian households that has an income of under $400 a week, your chances of getting out of deprivation are closely linked with your access to good education. And, as we know, how well we do in school is a significant determinant of how well we do socially and economically in adulthood. Eighty-five per cent of our prison population did not finish year 10. Despite all this evidence, the coalition goes on claiming that it has a needs based funding system, when it is anything but. It is false, it is misleading and it ought to be chucked in the bin.
In our view, we should start again—working with schools, school principals, parent and teacher bodies and state and territory governments—and devise a system that is based on educational need and that has a specific aim of giving all students the same educational opportunities. This bill is more than an ideological argument between supporters of private and public schools. The choices this parliament makes with regard to this bill will determine whether we start improving the future for our most disadvantaged children by reforming an inequitable system of funding or we continue increasing their disadvantage and make it even harder for them to contribute economically and socially to the future of our country.
The Democrats have received—no doubt all of us in this place have—over 300 letters from government schools outlining the inequities between federal funding for government schools and non-government schools. We take these communications seriously and we believe a system that funded both government and non-government schools by a formula giving the greatest weight to educational need would address their concerns. Even if we define `need' as the need of parents to pay fees, the system should factor in whole-of-school income and assets, which the SES model does not. Non-government schools and school based systems have the flexibility to set their own fee levels regardless of how much funding they receive. Of course, government schools also charge fees but these are voluntary and make up less than five per cent of total government school funding.  
Donations are also a major source of funds, particularly for non-government schools. The more `old school tie' a school is, the more benefactors it has and the greater the generosity of those benefactors. These tax deductible donations can increase substantially the funds available to schools and are, by all accounts, spent on facilities and services rather than reducing fees. This revenue forgone by tax deductibility is yet another subsidy that largely goes to the wealthiest in society.
The Democrats would like to see funding models take into account cost-saving mechanisms as well as income. Schools save money by excluding the hard to teach—nudging out those who are not going to bump up their university entry scores. Eighty per cent of the school population will not make it to university, but some independent schools are not much interested in these students. It costs schools more to overcome the disadvantages of poverty, entrenched unemployment, dysfunctional families, violence, drug and alcohol abuse, mental illness, disability and non-English-speaking background—to name just a few—which are the reality of many children. A government that was seriously interested in the rights of children, or even clever enough to know that the next generation of workers will have to be well educated to support the ageing population, which we so often hear the Treasurer talk about, would reform its funding system with this in mind.
The government sells its policy of funding non-government schools under the guise of choice. It ultimately suits government to get parents to send their children to non-government schools and to fork out at least some of the cost, which is why the two major parties have been only too happy to see the size of the non-government sector grow for the last three decades or so. The question is: will this bill encourage that growth? I think it probably will. Should all schools in this country instead be resourced to, say, the average for independent schools? I think that would be reasonable. At least before the last budget it might have been doable. Seventy per cent of Australians called for increased education and health spending as a priority over tax cuts. The coalition, supported by the ALP, said that they would rather spend $14.7 billion over four years on tax cuts to high income earners. At the time, the Democrats called for an extra mere $2 billion in public funding for primary and secondary education, with $1 billion of that going to government schools and the other $1billion directed to educational need. This position was vindicated by the recent draft report from the MCEETYA schools resourcing task force, which said that government schools need an extra $2 billion a year to meet literacy and numeracy goals. 
Capital works and maintenance funding should also be based on need. Currently, grants for capital works discriminate against the schools that cannot raise their own funds and take little account of the needs of the student population. One of the more ludicrous parts of the bill is the section that gives effect to the coalition's election promise to provide small capital grants directly to government school parent bodies, bypassing the states and presumably any sensible or equitable prioritising of funding. Again, that is a funding policy that takes no account of need. It will no doubt benefit those schools that have active, committed parent organisations that can write good grant applications for that shade over the sandpit or other small item that schools may be able to put forward. It is very interesting that a government so fond of getting rid of public servants, particularly when it first came to office, is now so willing to set up another bureaucracy to administer these grants. It might also be argued that the few dollars this dispenses to schools is hardly worth the effort; but, in any case, the Democrats would prefer to see the funding for government schools directed to the state education departments and sent with a very clear message that it is to be spent, firstly, on finding out where the capital works are most needed.  
We desperately need an audit of capital works in this country. It makes much more sense for this money to be used at least in the first instance on an audit of school facilities. We ought to know how many kids are still in portable classrooms, many of which are old enough to be heritage listed, in my experience, and how many do not have the most basic indoor multipurpose spaces, for instance. An indoor space where children can learn gymnastics, put on plays and hold assemblies should be basic even for primary schools, but it is not. Portable classrooms that do not move anywhere for 25 years are uncomfortable and inappropriate learning environments, and they send a very clear message to students that their education does not matter. This government has a preoccupation with national benchmarking and testing for literacy and numeracy but there is no benchmark or national basic standard for basic school amenities. A national audit of all school buildings and facilities is urgently needed and should be followed by a development plan to fund schools to meet basic infrastructure standards. Overall the Commonwealth expenditure on capital works has dropped since 1993 by around 30 per cent. This bill will go some small way to redressing that situation but, as I said, it is not particularly helpful.
The cognate bill in this debate, the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill 2004, gives vouchers of $700 to parents of grade 3 students who fail the reading tests, so that they can access private tutors. This funding, and the $200 million for early childhood intervention announced in the 2004 budget, would achieve better results if used in preschools to keep class sizes down to no more than 15, or to remove preschool fees altogether. The government continues to insist on testing and reporting in schools when a key way to improve success in schools would be for all children to have the universal right to go to preschool for at least one year before entering school. Instead, 40,000 children miss out on preschool every year; there are no national standards for preschools; and there is a patchwork of state government, local government and community-run centres with no coordination between governments. There is federal government disinterest, little access for three-year-olds, a great reliance on parents for organisation, and prohibitively high fees. 
According to the Australian Primary Principals Association, children are also missing out on primary school because our primary schools lack the resources to meet national goals of schooling. The Democrats, the Australian Primary Principals Association and the AEU argue that the $20 million being spent on tutorial credit initiatives should be used to support existing programs in schools. Schools already have the structures and the expertise; all they need are the resources to work one-on-one or in small groups with struggling children. These vouchers are not only a massive vote of no confidence in our schools—a vote of no confidence which is neither justified nor useful—but also a very inefficient use of government money. As I said, those funds should be directed to schools where quality assurance and appropriate infrastructure are already in place.  
There are many questions about the programs, such as the availability of suitable tutors, the capacity of some parents to seek help for their children, and how this tutorial assistance would tie in with what students are learning at school. There is also concern about the fact that there is no indication that the pilot will be applied beyond term 2 of 2005, nor any details about its proposed evaluation. The inquiry the government launched this week into the teaching of reading will not address the real issues that affect literacy rates—that is, targeted resources that can be used for students who have literacy and numeracy problems in our schools. Minister Nelson needs to understand that difficulty in reading is often a learning disability that continues throughout school and on to later life. To imagine that learning problems can be fixed with a few after-school tutorials in grade 3 is truly fanciful. 
So despite its rhetoric on the importance of values, the coalition has in this bill offered only $4½ million, or $1.50 per student, to implement the National Safe Schools Framework. The coalition has encouraged user pays and private education thinly disguised as choice, while failing to address big gaps in student achievement, falling retention rates, large class sizes, alarming teacher shortages and poor facilities, particularly in many government schools. If this legislation is a demonstration of the federal government's support for public education rather than some attempt to stop its further marginalisation then I think the government needs to do much better. The Democrats will be moving amendments to this legislation—we can see that the legislation is going to pass and it is a great pity that it has been pushed to this late stage in the year for us to deal with it—and we hope the Senate will support them.",SENATE,<title>SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE (LEARNING TOGETHER—ACHIEVEMENT THROUGH CHOICE AND OPPORTUNITY) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2004-12-06,"—I also rise to speak in the second reading debate on the Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004 and the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill 2004. These bills will implement the government's clear commitments to schools funding presented to the last parliament, together with the commitments made during the recent election. With these bills the Australian government is providing supplementary funding for state schools of $10.8 billion over four years. This represents an increase of $2.9 billion over the current funding levels, which is good news.
The government is also improving the funding arrangements for non-government schools, over four years bringing funding for Catholic schools to $12.8 billion and funding for independent schools to $7.8 billion. Every Catholic and independent school will now receive funding based on the same funding formula—the socioeconomic status funding model. A funding guarantee mechanism will ensure that no school will lose funding when the SES scores are updated. 
The Australian government continue to support state, Catholic and independent schools. We do so in part because state Labor governments have failed to adequately resource their school sectors, to inform parents, to provide parents with the information needed to monitor the progress of their children's education and to enable a comparison of schools. The coalition believe that parents should be able to choose which schools their children attend and to do that they need appropriate information in order to make that choice. Parents have a right to expect that their taxes will support their children's education regardless of whether they choose a state school or an independent school. In addition to recurrent funding, the Australian government, in these bills, is also providing $2.5 billion for school capital works over the next four years. This includes $1 billion announced during the election campaign and $700 million of this additional funding will go direct to state school communities. It will not go to state bureaucracies or to teacher unions. It will go straight to school projects like libraries, computer facilities, and playing fields. 
—It's largesse. Be honest, you are rolling out the pork.
—On this side we think it is great. We know school communities welcome this initiative, and it is clear why they welcome it—they desperately need this funding. It is a pity that state governments do not put the same priority on their schools that the Commonwealth puts on them. Labor oppose this measure because they believe that school bureaucracies and state governments know far better than local school communities how to spend that money. Governments always know best; the bureaucracy always knows best! We want to put the money in the hands of the school communities because they know what the issues are in their schools.
The government has consistently pursued an agenda of improving choice and fostering excellence in education. Parents have the right not only to choice but also to knowledge about the progress of their children. The government, with these bills, will also require as a condition of funding to the states and territories that student report cards are in plain English. This information will be available to parents.
—Are you going to read them?
—Members opposite would have difficulty reading even the plain English reports. This information will be available to parents. Comparisons of performances between schools will be available to parents. We will make sure that parents will have information that is meaningful and that will help them make a choice about what is best for their children. Other aspects of the funding include providing greater autonomy to school principals. We think that local school communities and local principals have the best idea of how to run their schools for the benefit of students. We are also going to see the implementation of the National Safe Schools Framework.
These bills also provide funding for the Tutorial Credit Initiative in states which report to parents about their children's performance against the national benchmarks. Over the course of this year, more states started reporting to parents against the national benchmarks. The Australian government is now in the happy situation of needing this bill in order to expand the number of states to be included in the trial. Under this trial, up to $700 will go to parents for individual tutorial assistance for children who have not met the year 3 national reading benchmark.
The need for this was evidenced today by Dr Ken Rowe, chairman of the national inquiry into literacy teaching. Dr Rowe has stated that hospital psychology units are straining to cope with children seeking medical attention for problems caused by their failure to learn at school. He is quoted in today's Age saying:
Hospitals are complaining that their clinics are being filled with kids who are being referred for things like Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) ... But once the pediatricians sort out the children's literacy problems, the behaviour problems disappear. What is essentially an education issue has become a health issue.
This is the real effect of state Labor neglect. The fact that more states are reporting against the national benchmarks demonstrates how the Australian government's actions are assisting the states to lift their game. It is a shame it is necessary, given that the education of our children is meant to be a core state government responsibility. We as a national government are not going to stand by and watch the states neglect the education of our children. Where we see a need, we will act. 
Education was one of the key issues on which the ALP chose to fight their battles—education was front and centre for senators opposite—and it is a key issue on which they lost. Incredibly, last week Labor decided to keep their divisive schools policy. The caucus chose to keep the hit list. I am sorely tempted to read out the full list of 32 schools in Victoria which are on the hit list because I think it is important for my constituents in Victoria to know that Labor are keeping that hit list. The parents of children in these 32 schools should know that Labor do not value the sacrifices parents make to send their kids to the school of their choice. Labor think these families are wealthy. Often there are two parents working hard to put their kids through the school of their choice, and we want to support that choice. But caucus have chosen to keep building a policy on class warfare. They have chosen envy over opportunity yet again.
There is a test in these bills for Labor. The test is to see if the opposition have learnt the lessons of the last election. The Australian Labor Party claim to have got the message. Before the election Labor opposed the earlier version of many measures contained in these bills. During the campaign itself education was where the philosophical difference between Labor and the coalition was the most stark. It sounds from what Senator Carr has said as though Labor might support these bills. But they do so with no sense of conviction; they do so with a heavy heart because they embrace the politics of envy rather than the politics of choice. Let those opposite demonstrate through a real change of policy that they can read the plain English report card that they have received from Australia's parents. Join with the government, support parents, support choice, support excellence, eschew the politics of class and envy, and give parents what they want.",SENATE,<title>SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE (LEARNING TOGETHER—ACHIEVEMENT THROUGH CHOICE AND OPPORTUNITY) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2004-12-06,"—The purpose of the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 is to amend the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 2000, and it confirms school funding as occurring from the start of the calendar year, 1 January 2005. So it is imperative that we deal with this bill in this four days of sittings. It is unfortunate that the government has left the introduction of this bill to such a late stage in the school year. Schools are already nearly finished for this year and well past the time when they have to start planning for next year.
—There was an election!
—Yes, but, Senator Kemp, you also handed down this money in the May budget and we have not seen this legislation prior to this. As yet schools do not know what funding programs or amounts they might have, nor do they know the terms and conditions attached to these funds by a government that, while trying to push responsibility onto the states, is showing ever increasing intervention in schools. We have seen over the course of this year additional funding for values education, for physical education activities to be done to reduce childhood obesity—a concept which Labor not only support but also announced first—and for schools having to have `active flagpoles', whatever that actually means. I look forward to the answers to all the questions I have put on notice on the number of `active flagpoles' there are in this country and how many schools will need flagpoles, or flags for that matter, in order to put that policy into place. 
It has, however, been a bit like many advertisements on TV: read the small print if you can and find what conditions apply to access these additional funds. Schools are going to have to provide much more detailed reports to parents. States are going to have to provide much more detailed reporting to the Commonwealth. Kids are having to undertake regular testing. Additional funds are available for extra reading tuition for kids who fail certain tests, rather than being there to provide access and assistance to those children before they get the chance to fail a reading test. With all these bits and pieces of funding and all these requirements to be met to get them, school principals must be wondering what is coming next. They must be asking themselves, `How can we plan and run a school when we have a government putting out programs and funds on the run? Where will we find the time to plan and do all this extra administration and reporting but, at the same time, remain focused on our core objective, which is to educate these children?'
However, Labor are not opposed to schools having adequate funding to provide our children with as good an education as possible. We strongly believe education should be well funded as an investment in our future. The problem we always have is the way in which this government allocates those funds. This government allocates funds in an iniquitous way. As was pointed out in the other place, the top 50 high-fee independent schools have received funding increases of 150 per cent since 2000. The Catholic systemic schools got an increase of just 25 per cent while government schools got only 20 per cent. It does not take Einstein to work out that this is not equitable. Let us just have a look at those figures again: the top 50 high-fee independent schools in this country have received funding increases of 150 per cent under this government. Even the poor Catholic systemic schools—and I had the privilege of teaching in one for three years in Melbourne—got an increase of only 25 per cent under this government. Government schools got an increase of only 20 per cent. So there is no equitable funding for the resourcing of schools under this government. In the Australian on 3 May this year Jenny Macklin said:
Too many schools are getting by on less than they should because of the Howard Government's funding system. This system treats schools very differently, depending on whether they are government or non-government, and fails to address need.
And, of course, that is the real issue: need. She went on in the same article to give the now oft-quoted example of The King's School in Sydney. That school already has top-line resources like vast playing fields, a rifle range and a pool but still got an increase in funding of 165 per cent between 2001 and 2004. By contrast, the Trinity Catholic College in Auburn, not far from King's, got just 25 per cent—although it was the latter that had by far the greater need for funds. So where is the fairness and the equity in this policy of the government? I do not think I need to say any more to clearly illustrate the way in which the Howard government deals with school funding. By all means we should make certain that schools get the funding needed to provide our children with a great education, but we should do it fairly and based on genuine need.
I will digress for a minute and talk about the trip that Jenny Macklin, Warren Snowdon and I took to places such as Elcho Island a number of months ago. The school there is doing a terrific job in addressing attendance rates and providing secondary education courses in the early stages. With the help of fantastic programs such as AFL Kickstart, the number of kids who are attending school has increased—in fact doubled—in that time. We took a trip on a small light aircraft out to some of the outstations. They are really struggling to provide education for anywhere between 15 and 40 children in probably no less than a donga or a makeshift classroom. They usually have second-hand materials and inadequate paper, pencils and crayons—let alone readers or maths resources, and far be it from them to think about any IT equipment such as computers or overhead projectors. Let us look at the statistics. When it comes to funding public education in this country, the amount of money that has been provided to places like The King's School—a 165 per cent increase in funding over three years—is nothing short of a national disgrace.  
I am saddened by the fact that the Minister for Education, Science and Training is now into his second term. I cannot think of any outstation that this minister has personally attended to look at the sorrowful state of Aboriginal education, particularly in outstations. He trumpets the benefits of this policy which is inequitable and unfair. That is embarrassing given the state of Aboriginal education in this country at this time. The States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 2000 brought in policies that provided the greatest funding increases to some of the wealthiest independent schools in Australia while funding for government schools was maintained essentially in line with indexation for the cost of schooling only. This policy is continued in the funding proposals put forward by the Howard government for the future. The existing unfair distribution formula remains over the next quadrennium. Independent schools will receive an increase of 47 per cent in general recurrent funding, Catholic schools 39 per cent and government schools only 27 per cent. Indigenous education workers and teachers in the Northern Territory, who overwhelmingly supported the Labor Party and its policies, will struggle for the next four years with an increase of only 20 per cent in their funding while some of the wealthiest and most independent schools in this country get a boost of 47 per cent.
I do not think anyone would deny that we should have choice in education just as in other aspects of life. We should have choice between government and non-government schools, but the Howard government loads the funding in favour of the wealthy schools to such an extent that it becomes totally biased towards the haves rather than the have-nots. That is absolutely typical of the philosophy of this government. Labor believe that policies should be based on genuine need—policies under which schools will know well in advance what their funding levels will be for 2006 and beyond. We remain committed to needs based funding. Our caucus committee just last week re-endorsed the principle of needs based funding and a general schools resource index. I am quite proud of that policy. I have travelled around the Territory and have taught in an Aboriginal school where we struggled to get new resources year in and year out. To even contemplate having some of the resources that some of these schools have was beyond us. We just wanted some decent topsoil on the footy grounds out in these communities—not just for the school but for the whole community. This education policy of the government is an absolute disgrace.
As was stated by the shadow minister in her speech in the second reading debate, we believe in an increase in funding to government schools, to redistribute the funds away from high-fee independent schools to more needy Catholic or low-fee independent schools and to better resource public education in this country. Having said all that, and having condemned the government for its unfair distribution of funds and for holding back for so long on this funding bill, Labor will not be opposing this bill—and we cannot, because all schools around this country rely on this money flowing through from 1 January. We will allow the bill to pass for one reason only: to give schools, parents and children some degree of certainty for the next year, however unfair and biased that certainty might be. 
Labor's education philosophy is very different and would include establishing a national schools resource standard against which to measure school needs. This would enable all schools to have the resources to deliver a high standard of education. At the risk of being repetitive I want to put on record in this chamber the following facts, which were stated by the shadow education minister in the other place. This states grants bill 2004 provides for $7.6 billion to the 12 per cent of students in non-systemic independent schools and only $7.2 billion to the 69 per cent in government schools. For the first time ever, a government of this country is giving more funds to private schools than to government schools.
That is a national disgrace. This government is totally ignoring the needs of the majority of school students in this country—and the choice, mind you, of the majority of parents in this country, who choose to send their children to a public school. It has devised a formula that conveniently ignores the fact that the independent schools can operate from a very high level of fee income which gives them a high resource level without government help. But, again, it is what we have come to expect from the Howard government: look after the rich and kick the poor and keep them even further down.
But there is more, and it gets worse. Of the $31.3 billion in total funding for schools over the four-year period, only $405 million is new money—the detail is in the fine print with this lot—and, of that, only five per cent is for government schools. What a disgrace. On top of indexation, government schools over the next quadrennium will only get five per cent of the new money. Even to get this they have to subject themselves to new funding and accountability conditions—active flagpoles, for heaven's sake; more testing of kids; more reporting to parents; and more time spent on administration. The government does not want more time spent trying to reduce class sizes, or catering to the needs of kids who are dyslexic or autistic or who  cannot read. It does not want more resources put into the system so that those children who are speakers of English as a second language get the support they need to achieve, or extra resources for school counsellors or school careers officers. It wants more reporting and more testing of children—which is fundamentally flawed. If you have an education such as I have you can drill a thousand holes in that philosophy—and active flagpoles, for heaven's sake!
Earlier this year I had the pleasure, as I said, of accompanying Jenny Macklin on a trip to a few bush schools in the Northern Territory. We found schools with ancient classrooms that were badly in need of repair—or, preferably, replacement—and with minimal equipment. They usually had no playing field at all, certainly no gymnasium or rifle range, and little sports equipment beyond a few basketballs or footballs—a far cry from the elite schools this government defends that even have rifle ranges. Yet the minister in his wisdom thinks such elite schools need even more funding. We can only wonder what world he is living in. Perhaps he really does think the King's School is the norm. I wait for the day he steps off a light aircraft in the Northern Territory and actually takes the time to visit an out-station and meet the teachers there. It is totally unacceptable that Indigenous students in the Northern Territory can be put into old, poorly maintained classrooms while at the same time this government is pouring millions into schools which already have new classrooms, well-equipped labs, extensive sports facilities and so on. It is no wonder that this minister wants to hide the real issues and facts, a job which he does very well with his myriad press releases to cloud the issues and muddy the waters. Take away the smooth words and the smoke and mirrors act and what we have is a national disgrace in education funding which is destroying the `fair go' Australian philosophy. 
This debate today also includes the Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004. The facts and figures already quoted show what this government really means by choice: plenty for the elite with money but very little, indeed none, for most of my constituents in remote parts of the Northern Territory. To that extent one could certainly claim that this bill is wrongly named. Pat Byrne, the President of the Australian Education Union, summed it up recently in an article in the Australian Educator:
... it's the same choice that we have seen the Howard Government provide on the establishment of more schools regardless of existing provisions, and additional funding to schools that need it least. Coalition policy threatens to make public education the residual system for those who cannot afford private education. It is a two tiered policy based upon income and exclusion, not choice at all ...
The learning together bill implements several budget decisions: the integration of Catholic schools into the SES funding model, a funding guarantee to independent non-government schools that might otherwise be disadvantaged, additional funding for the capital grants program for some isolated Catholic schools in the Northern Territory and the establishment of the new Literacy, Numeracy and Special Learning Needs program aimed at the more disadvantaged students. This bill also sets out the new reporting requirements against performance measures, gives principals and councils more authority over staffing and makes schools commit to physical education programs—as if they are not already doing it. All of this has Labor support. It is just a pity that the minister and this government cannot see that the actual resources available to schools are more important than the state of their flagpoles or their flags. All the minister can do when confronted with schools saying they lack resources is to blame the states and then give more to already resource-rich independent schools.
This country cannot afford to wait another three years to have education funding changed to a national, cooperative, real needs based system. From Labor's point of view, the introduction of a fair needs based funding formula is essential and urgent before the damage being done to our school system becomes irreparable. But for now, however, we condemn the government for delaying the introduction of these important school funding bills until such a late time of the year. The government also stand condemned for the ongoing—and indeed worsening—funding formula that they use. We support the passage of the bills with amendment. The second reading amendment that has been proposed by the Labor Party seeks to add that the Senate:
	(a)	condemns the Government for its unfair funding policies for schools;
	(b)	believes that there is a need to restore integrity and sustainability to Commonwealth funding of schools through the adoption of comprehensive principles that include:
	(i)	supporting high quality public schooling as a national priority;— 
in other words, supporting and guaranteeing that support for government education—
	(ii)	recognising the entitlement of all children and young people to national standards of educational results and resources;
	(iii)	giving priority in funding for all Commonwealth programs for schools to meeting the educational and financial needs of schools;
	(iv)	recognition of the right of parents to choose the type of schooling for their children and to public funding for that schooling based on need; and
	(v)	Commonwealth funding for schools should be provided as part of a national partnership with State and Territory governments so that all governments work together to deliver high quality schooling for all”.",SENATE,<title>SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE (LEARNING TOGETHER—ACHIEVEMENT THROUGH CHOICE AND OPPORTUNITY) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-12-06,"—The Greens will be opposing the Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004 because it is part of this government's agenda to privatise our education system. It is part of turning Australia into a divided, elitist and, as a result, underperforming country. For the sake of our future generations, the Greens will play no part in taking our country down this path. We will also be opposing the harebrained scheme outlined in the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 to introduce the Tutorial Credit Initiative, which will pour $11 million per annum into privatising year 3 literacy whilst allowing public schools to go without much needed resources to tackle literacy problems within the comprehensive educational environment of the classroom. I have spoken in the chamber many times about the importance of public education, and I am proud to be in a political party that is a vocal advocate for public education. I speak out again today to defend public education because there is a no more gratuitous transfer of wealth from the public sphere to the private sphere of education—and no greater threat to the egalitarian nature of this country as a result—than that contained in the two bills we are debating today.
The Greens' concern with the future of public education is about the principle of equity. Equal access to the highest quality education, equal access to the outcomes that education gives, equal status in the community with our neighbours, the right to grow and learn with all kinds of people as equals—this is the gift that public education gives us. This is why public education plays such a crucial role in knitting together our fair go society. But this fair go society is under threat as long as private schools which continue to exclude students on the basis of wealth, academic ability, behaviour, religion, sexuality, disability or race expand their share of school enrolments. Sadly, this is the context in which this debate is occurring.
Earlier this year the Sydney Morning Herald commissioned research on school enrolments. The study identified a drift in enrolments to the private school sector of over 22.3 per cent since 1993, whilst public school enrolments increased only 1.2 per cent. This is a staggering rate which is radically changing the culture of our communities, yet state and federal governments are silent on the dangers of this shift. In the face of what appears to be a growing class divide in Australia, both major parties are silent on this issue of enrolments. In the government's case, they support the drift away from public schooling under the guise of promoting parental choice. The Greens recognise that this decline, if allowed to continue, will result in the public system being seen as a residual safety net school system. We recognise the negative effect this will have on the cohesiveness of our communities. The Greens recognise that the decline in enrolments in our public schools is a national problem that must urgently be addressed by all levels of government. 
The Howard government are quite happy to see this drift in enrolments away from public schools to private schools because it is the outcome that their schools policy is designed to achieve. The policies of the government, which are clear in the bills today, have nothing to do with the principles of equality and everything to do with user-pays elitism. In fact, it is only when you understand that reducing the number of students in the public school system and boosting private school enrolments is the aim of the government through their schools policy that you can make sense of their policy, which otherwise appears as a real dog's breakfast of conflicting logic and blatant inequities. For the first time ever, Commonwealth funding of private schools now exceeds the total Commonwealth expenditure on public universities—a staggering fact that the Howard government have brought into play. Between 1993 and 2002, funding for the Catholic sector rose 3.1 times faster than for the government sector, whilst funding for all other private schools rose 2.7 times faster than for the public schools sector. Since the government took office, recurrent per student funding to private schools has risen by 42 per cent. The share of total federal government funds spent on schooling that goes to private schools has risen from 55 per cent in 1993 to over 70 per cent today.
The private school sector has done amazingly well out of the federal government's policies in the last few years. This is a result of deliberate federal government policy. The Howard government's primary contribution to the school sector has been its generous bankrolling of private schools and its support for the deregulated expansion of the private school sector. Private schools have received a far greater increase in funding from government—that is, both state and federal governments—than public schools have over the same period. Even though the federal government contributes only around 30 per cent of the schools budget in Australia, the Howard agenda to push private schooling has reached a scale where the figures for all government—that is, state and federal—funding over the same period shows private schools outstripping public schools in their funding increase. A study carried out by Swinburne University of Technology's Institute for Social Research found that between 1993 and 2002 government expenditure on private schools increased by 91 per cent, compared to 28 per cent for public schools. This was not simply a function of enrolments, because per student funding for private schools rose by more than double that of government schools.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-12-06,"—by leave—This afternoon just after question time, in providing additional information relating to a question without notice asked today, I made a statement to the effect that the Department of the Environment and Heritage had confirmed that the company Primary Energy Australia had not registered an interest in or submitted any applications for GGAP funding through any of the program's three competitive funding rounds. The department has since advised me that the company Primary Energy Pty Ltd did not submit any applications for funding for any GGAP round. They did not register an interest in the early rounds, rounds 1 and 2, but did register for round 3. At no stage did they make an application.

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-12-06,"—I rise to continue my speech in the second reading debate on the Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004 and the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill 2004. The facts are incontrovertible: this government has poured buckets of money into the private school system. How has this happened? It has happened because the Howard government introduced a funding arrangement four years ago which it Orwellianly named the socioeconomic status, or SES, model. The government claims that it gives money to those schools which educate the poorest in our community on the basis of socioeconomic need, yet the rich schools end up with massively more money than they were getting before and they are not the schools that are educating the poorest people in our community. It is an absolutely bizarre outcome for a model that the government claims is about equity when we see more government funding going into the wealthiest private schools.
The SES funding model was a rort from the outset which has only got worse over time. In fact, it is a double rort. Firstly, the use of census districts to measure socioeconomic status is about as reliable as using your shoe size to pick a footy team. Just because the average income of your neighbours is low does not mean that yours will be. In reality, those who can afford to send their children to schools which charge annual fees of over $10,000 are the higher income earners in their area, not the average or lower income earners. This means, for example, that boarders from rural New South Wales at the King's School are more likely to be the sons of large land owners, but under the government's system they attract a subsidy based on the income of their father's tenants. Secondly, the government has rorted its own system to ensure that, if schools are still worse off—compared to the existing government subsidies—after this warped logic of the SES funding model has been applied, their funding is maintained and indexed at their overfunded levels.
The system gets worse still in this legislation. This legislation introduces the Catholic systemic school into the SES funding model. The minister will tell us that Catholic systemic schools are now part of the SES system, but this is totally misleading. In reality, all government money goes not to individual Catholic schools but, instead, centrally to the Catholic boards of education. They get the money based on a notional—or, in other words, made up—SES score of 96 and then they distribute the money as they see fit. Additionally, 60 per cent of Catholic systemic schools are notionally funding maintained—that is, the SES funding model says that they are overfunded and yet the government intends for them to be able to continue the funding they are receiving at what it perceives to be an overfunded level. 
Catholic system schools will get an additional boost of over $360 million as a result of this legislation. But there is no guarantee that this money will find its way to the most needy of Catholic schools, because the money is paid in a lump sum to the Catholic boards of education, who then distribute it according to their own model of need—not based on even the government's bodgie SES system, which is designed to have some concept of need as a part of it. Private schools get to pick and choose students—and have lower operating costs as a result, because they can choose not to educate the most disadvantaged or those students needing the most assistance—yet they continue to get generous rises in public subsidy even when their estimated per student expenditure is already on average 15 per cent higher than that of government schools and in many cases much more than 15 per cent higher.
The situation is clearly perverse, but this legislation takes us on a trajectory that makes this inequity a whole lot worse. The Swinburne University of Technology study that I mentioned earlier projected that, within seven years at the current rates, governments will be providing more funding to private schools than to public schools. I will say that once more: in seven years time, at the current funding rates, governments will be providing more funding to private schools than to public schools. Considering the lengths that the government has gone to to ensure big funding increases to private schools, we should not be too surprised to see rising student enrolments in private schools. But funding is only half the picture. The other key problem is the government's portrayal of public schools as inferior and, in the Prime Minister's words, `values neutral'. Public schools and public school teachers teach important values such as equity, respect and celebration of diversity. These are important values and it is unfortunate that the government and the Prime Minister do not recognise these values as important.
I remind the Senate of the quite illuminating views of the minister for workplace relations's chief of staff, Mr Kevin Donnelly, who in a recent book and accompanying articles describes public schools as homes for `feminist, multicultural and neo-Marxist' theories. He reminds us:
... many parents would consider the sexual practices of gays, lesbians and transgender individuals decidedly unnatural and that such groups have a greater risk in terms of transmitting STDs and AIDS.
Are these the sorts of values that the Prime Minister would like to see public school teachers promoting? Clearly these are the views of the chief of staff of one of his frontbench cabinet ministers. Not only is this comment homophobic but the intention is clearly to imply that teaching a celebration of diversity is wrong and that somehow public schools are in the business of forwarding partisan political agendas.
This is part of a propaganda war against the public school system and it has the two-pronged objective of encouraging enrolments in private schools and introducing intolerant, conservative values into public schools. The flagpole requirement in this bill is an example of this government's values approach—specifically a myopic vision of patriotism. The Greens are appalled at this state of affairs. Our policies, as suggested in our amendment to the second reading of this bill, which I will foreshadow at the end of my contribution, are targeted at turning this around to firmly establish that the government's primary responsibility should be to the public school system and that it should act to ensure that public schools can offer the best education available, which is what governments are elected to do.
The Greens advocate significant increases in funding for public schools from all levels of government and we also expect all levels of government to be enthusiastic cheerleaders for our public schools. This bill should be rejected in its entirety to allow alternative legislation that achieves these goals to be brought before the Senate. The Greens say that a new and alternative bill should abolish all public funding to the wealthiest private schools and redirect this money to struggling public schools and that a full inquiry should be undertaken to examine whether the funding going to the rest of the private school system is the best way to spend our education tax dollars. In the meantime, the Greens say that the current generous levels of funding to the rest of the private school system ought to be frozen for four years while any inquiry is under way. The savings made here should be redirected into the public school system, including for a new priorities schools program, similar to the old disadvantaged school program, that would target the most needy of the public schools. Consider what a difference that would make to the educational outcomes in Australia. Over $6 million over the next four years would go to struggling public schools and students with special challenges rather than to the very wealthiest schools within the private school system. 
The Greens believe the government should be telling parents about what great work is being done in public schools. I have been privileged to visit many public schools. One that I visited in southern Sydney, Menai High School, is doing fantastic work with Aboriginal students and with students who have particular interests in agriculture, art and aquaculture. A whole range of specialist needs and interests of the students at Menai High School are being catered for by a top-quality public education system with committed high school teachers at that school. These are the kinds of stories that parents should be hearing from the minister for education, not the criticisms coming from the minister and the Prime Minister and the comments coming from government staffers like Kevin Donnelly.
I know that the opposition shares some of the concerns that the Greens have in relation to this bill, and I heard comments about them before. But I also heard the Labor Party say that they will be supporting this bill. When I speak with teachers and parents, they tell me about their experiences under state Labor governments, and it has not left them full of confidence that a Labor government will become the champion of public education.
The future of schooling in Australia is at a crossroads. It is worth remembering the trajectory we are headed down. The Swinburne University study said that, if we continue at these current funding levels, in seven years time both state and federal governments will be putting more money into the private school sector than into the public school sector. That is not what governments are elected to do. Governments are not elected to put more public money into private schools rather than invest in a quality public education system that all students can access regardless of their ability to pay, regardless of any disability that they may have, regardless of their gender and regardless of their religion. Children should be able to access a quality public education system. It is the government's responsibility to fund that system. Yet we see this government going in totally the opposite direction by putting increasingly more funds into the private school sector. In seven years times, if it keeps going at this level, it will be putting even more money into the private school sector than into the public school sector.
At a time when, as a nation, we should be celebrating and supporting the role our public school system plays in teaching all Australians side by side about different cultures and living the values of celebrating diversity, we are not. This bill is about giving an additional government endorsement to what a parent, quoted in the Sydney Morning Herald, called the educational equivalent of a gated community—a gated community which says: some people cannot come in here. 
This bill should not be titled `Learning Together'; it should be titled `Learning Apart' because that is a far more accurate description of the elitist approach which is inherent in this funding bill, which the Greens reject. We want the objective of providing the highest quality public education to Australian students to be returned to the top of the government's priorities. Education should not be reduced to one more consumer status symbol that the aspirational voter is encouraged to purchase. Education is a birthright of everyone. Quality public education is a birthright of everyone. The Greens will continue to struggle towards this goal of universal access to quality public education. The logic of the argument is too compelling, the justice of the outcome is too obvious and the benefit for all of our futures is too great for parliament or anyone else to do otherwise.
I will just take the opportunity now to foreshadow the Australian Greens amendment, which I will move later at the conclusion of the second reading debate. The amendment condemns the government for its attack on the reputation, quality and impeccable values of public education, for its failure to adequately fund public schools to achieve their full potential and its failure to act to address the drift in school enrolments away from public schools. It calls on the government to: establish in legislation that the first priority to guide federal schools policy is the welfare of the public school system; scrap the manifestly unfair SES funding system for non-government schools; abolish the nexus between funding for non-government schools and both the AGSRC and the number of children educated in private schools; redirect the funding currently going to the wealthiest private schools into the public school system; redirect the increases in funding to all other private schools back into the public school system; introduce a new schools policy to protect the viability of local public schools; act to make non-government schools as accountable as government schools for the government funds they receive; ensure that all Australians have access to free, high-quality public preschool education; recognise that the public school system educates nearly 90 per cent of Indigenous students and that as a result better support for public schools and public schoolteachers is vital.

"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2004-12-06,"—Listening to Senator Nettle in this place tonight, it is very easy to see and understand why the Greens failed to realise the expectations that they promoted in the community prior to the last election and failed to realise votes that they thought somewhere along the line were going to give them the balance of power in this place. As someone who is a product of the private Catholic school system—two very small Catholic schools in Brisbane—I can very well understand why the parents of children at a school such as one of the ones I attended, and the relatives and the brothers and sisters of voting age that have relatives attending such schools, rejected the Greens' philosophy on education as comprehensively as they did. In fact they rejected the Greens' policies on so many other issues that the Greens promoted. From my experience in the electorate of Queensland that I represent I fail to understand how the Greens can come up with the views that have just been expressed here this evening—and to a lesser extent also by members of the Labor Party in this place. I sometimes wonder whether we represent the same electorate—though I stopped wondering on election night because the results clearly demonstrated who was really in touch with the Australian electorate. 
In the context of the debate on the Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achieve-ment Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004 and the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 before the chamber, I want to focus my remarks on the measure to fund improving literacy outcomes in state schools. Lifting the literacy skills of young Australians is a very important thing to do. Without basic literacy and numeracy, educational outcomes, employment prospects and life choices are severely limited. So it makes very good sense to assist parents to meet the cost of extra tuition for children who are not performing in terms of the test applied in year 3, the year 3 benchmark. The government is doing this through the trial Tutorial Credit Initiative, under which eligible parents will have access to a $700 tutorial credit for use on outside school hours additional tuition.
In line with the government's philosophy of facilitating parent choice—so recently endorsed at the ballot box along with many other freedoms that the prescriptive legislation preferred by others would outlaw—this scheme gives parents choice and advice. Parents will select tutors and this process will be administered by brokers who will be responsible for the engagement of tutors at public expense who are appropriately qualified, screened and vetted.
It is probably worth repeating at this point that there remains some resistance to the concept of reporting schools' academic performance publicly and that this is a short-sighted—and, in relation to teacher unions, self-serving—response to demonstrated need. On that front it is also worth recording the words back in May of the Queensland education minister, Anna Bligh, a luminary of the Left, about this tutorial scheme. Ms Bligh, who formerly failed to render satisfactory service as the Queensland children's minister, is apparently determined to match this performance in education. In a media statement about this scheme issued on May 19 she said:
This is a cheap political stunt by the Federal Education Minister Brendan Nelson ... It is important for the mums and dads of the more than 3000 children who are struggling with reading in Queensland to know that their child is a political football to the Howard Government.
That was last May. In October, just five months later and after the people of Australia had delivered their very different verdict on who was playing political football, Ms Bligh and Premier Peter Beattie had this to say in a media statement on public disclosure of performance:
It's important that parents and the wider community have confidence in the quality of education being delivered in Queensland schools ... we expect that making school data available will help drive performance.
Granted that the issues on the one hand of supporting parents in getting remedial tutorial assistance for their children with literacy difficulties and on the other providing information on school performance are separate, the principle is drawn from the same base. The state education systems are not places where, increasingly at Commonwealth expense, political footballs should be kicked around. Ms Bligh and the Queensland Labor government, please note: it is a fact that research shows—and Ms Bligh and Premier Beattie attempt to make a virtue out of their discovery of this long-known fact in their media statement of October 21—that schools in states in America which are required to publish literacy and numeracy results at certain levels achieve higher rates of improvement than schools in states which do not require such information to be made public. The issue in Queensland is that in relation to reporting literacy outcomes the state system now conforms to Commonwealth requirements, as is proper and which is most certainly to be welcomed. 
The States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill gives effect to funding and facilitating choice of remedial action on literacy. Literacy and numeracy testing and benchmarking at years 3, 5 and 7 are a critical part of the schooling system and a key indicator of academic performance. The fact that more states than the original four taking part in the trial have come on board is great news. It is a significant step towards effective national standards and outcomes and obviously must be supported by anyone interested in the future of our children and our country. As the second reading introduction speech incorporated into the Hansard last week noted:
The 24,000 children across Australia who have not attained the minimum reading skills deserve the opportunity to receive additional tutorial assistance offered by the Tutorial Credit Initiative, and their parents are entitled to comprehensive information about their child's progress.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2004-12-06,"—I wish to say a few words on the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2004. This bill establishes a framework for the funding of measures in the education portfolio targeted at Indigenous students and provides funding for the next four years. The bill also establishes two small new programs first announced during the recent election campaign. I start my remarks by drawing the attention of the chamber to the recent performance of the Department of Education, Science and Training with regard to Indigenous education. I recall reading just recently documents from within the government that went to the review undertaken by the government on the effects of mainstreaming of Indigenous programs within government. I was struck by the reference to the fact that the department of education was the only department within the government that had failed even to respond to the review and to undertake a review of its own programs. This was before the recent changes the government announced. I want to take up this matter more directly with the department in due course and I am sure we will be able to hear from them why that occurred. 
The legislation we have before us tonight, however, continues a pattern we have seen in recent times where the government says a great deal about its commitment to Indigenous education but when we look empirically at the impact, at what is actually occurring, then I am afraid the story is less than satisfactory. The legislation has to be seen in the broader context of the government's recent changes. Firstly, it has abolished ATSIC and it is not sought to replace it with a representative body but with a government appointed committee. Secondly, it has sought to mainstream Indigenous programs across all other government departments. Thirdly, it has adopted a more authoritarian and paternalistic approach to the provision of government services to Indigenous people, as revealed in the recently leaked cabinet documents referred to by the National Indigenous Times. In my judgment, the government's approach has taken us back a generation in Indigenous public policy. I happily concede that not everything is bad in the government's treatment of Indigenous affairs. In fact, some very positive advances have been made during the period of the Howard government. Nonetheless, progress is far too slow.
Last week we saw the opportunities that have opened up as a result of Michael Long's so-called `Long Walk'. What he has undertaken is a truly remarkable feat. It began as a spontaneous gesture by him and a small group of supporters and it led to the situation where the Prime Minister has reopened a dialogue with a number of Indigenous leaders—a dialogue which had been closed for five years. I think Michael Long's action provided a real ray of light for Indigenous people in this country. He did this, of course, out of despair and anger, but he has re-ignited the national debate about reconciliation and the dire need for action for social justice for Indigenous people in this country. The involvement of Aboriginal leaders such as Pat and Mick Dodson has been a very positive development. The fact that the Prime Minister has now said that he will continue the dialogue with Michael Long and Pat and Mick Dodson is equally positive. I hope much good comes from those discussions. We will have to wait and see whether or not that hope is realised.
The problem is that I have not seen any evidence that the government has actually resiled from any aspect of its own position. I am concerned that the government has not actually changed its mind about the need for a truly representative body to speak for Indigenous people and that it still believes such action is unnecessary. I am concerned that the government has yet to change its position on the so-called `shared responsibility agreements'—the conditions that, in my judgment, may well force Indigenous people to give up their natural and proper social rights because of the demand by the government for behavioural changes. I am equally concerned that the government has at no point acknowledged its responsibilities with regard to reconciliation and has failed to understand why reconciliation remains a very important matter for this country. 
The government talks about its so-called practical reconciliation measures, ignoring the real meaning of the process for Indigenous Australians themselves. When we look at the speech by the Governor-General to this parliament we can see that even the so-called watered-down version, the `practical reconciliation' that the government used to speak of, seems to have fallen off the agenda as well. Apparently the government just cannot see that a formal, explicit process of reconciliation between Indigenous and other Australians is an absolute precondition for moving forward on a broad range of issues, just as an apology to the stolen generation is an important part of the process of healing. Some people have said that you do not really need to worry about the question of apologies and acknowledgement of prior custodial ownership of the land because the real questions go to the fundamentals about the provision of services. I say that is a misconceived view. You would not say to Australians celebrating Anzac Day or to Australians down at Ballarat last weekend celebrating Eureka, `You can have one or the other: either you can have a water supply, an electricity supply, a decent school or a hospital or you can have some acknowledgement of some ceremony.' You would not put that view, and nor should you.
But with regard to Indigenous people there is a view somewhere in this country that says these two issues should be seen as separate and that there is a dichotomy between acknowledgement of past injustices and necessary improvements in social justice today. Equally, there is a view put that you can have a distinction between social rights and social responsibilities. No-one else accepts that distinction. That sort of dichotomy does not occur in any other aspect of Australian society when we talk about people's rights to a decent school, hospital, water supply, electricity supply or house. None of those rights are challenged; they are taken for granted as fundamental rights for any citizen in this country. But it seems that, when this government raises these questions, the processes have to be seen as separate. I say that is a false dichotomy, and of course it is an insulting attempt to institutionalise paternalism and authoritarianism to take the position that appears to be being taken in so many aspects of the government's policies today. So, when the government talks about setting conditions under which it will support service provision to Indigenous people, I think we are entitled to ask: would those conditions apply to anyone else in this country or do they only apply to Indigenous people?
We say the government is proposing a new agenda. As far as I can see, the education agenda has not been immune from this approach. I think we are entitled to ask: if education is one of the keys to the future for Indigenous people, what action is the government taking to actually unlock the doors of inequality in this country? From what I have seen so far, the profound historical disadvantage faced by Indigenous peoples is not being addressed by these measures. Of course that is not to say that we oppose the measures for a substantial injection of new money into Indigenous education. This bill provides $29 million over four years and funds 250 scholarships and mentoring for Indigenous students from remote areas as well as 600 additional places in training and apprenticeships. Of course you do not oppose those things. What I say is that you put those things in context. You put them into the context of what is actually occurring in this country, and then you can see how limited these measures are.
Programs such as the Indigenous Youth Leadership Program and the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program are all about picking winners. The government now sees its role as selecting high achievers and sending them to TAFE or universities in the city. The scholarships provided under the leadership program will also send school age students to what the government terms `the best Australian schools'. I can only presume, having listened to the rhetoric of the government in other areas, that what it means by that is the elite private system. I say this policy may well be very divisive. It may well produce a situation where many students will not be provided with assistance. I am concerned to make sure that, if we are to select students who are the best and the brightest from remote Aboriginal communities, we do understand the role that their communities have in their education and understand that we cannot separate that role from the ongoing cultural education that is involved with a young person in Aboriginal society. 
I refer to the proposal to spend $25,000 a year on each student's fees at one of these schools. That could probably be much better spent on providing places at government secondary schools for three or four students, so I do think there needs to be balance here. There needs to be an understanding that the provision of basic educational services to Indigenous peoples should not be confined to just the best and the brightest who can be shipped off interstate, leaving behind desolation because of the government's failure to provide services for the many. The parliament has been asked by the government, in considering this bill, to put in place a program of which we have no detail. We can only guess at what is being proposed here. We have seen no guidelines. No provisions are actually made for how this proposal would work. 
If we look at the changes to the Indigenous Education Direct Assistance program, we see that the government does not explicitly refer to the major changes to IEDA that in fact have been put in place over recent years. In fact, with this bill the government is ushering in major reforms to three schemes under the program itself. It will bring together two new programs into a new whole of school intervention strategy. This move abolishes the Aboriginal Student Support and Parent Awareness scheme, or ASSPA, a scheme that provided funding for liaison and consultation between Indigenous families and the schools for their children to attend. I would have thought that would be exactly the sort of program that the government now talks about in terms of its shared responsibility arrangements. You would have thought that was exactly the sort of thing to encourage communication between the agencies of a state and the local communities. The move replaces this scheme with one based on a submission model, funded only on the basis of proposals prepared according to a set of guidelines. Indigenous leaders have criticised this very heavily on the basis that a number of groups lack the very practical resources and know-how to prepare the submission based processes that have been envisaged by this measure.
This point is well illustrated by the IEDA review itself. That government process provided no real rationale for the new program. In fact, only 10 submissions were actually received in the review process. So it is little wonder that there is very little understanding of how these programs might actually work. You would have thought that measures as important as these might have attracted more submissions if there had been a greater understanding of what the government was proposing to do. So what we have here is a functioning system of consultation and parent involvement in schooling, although with different levels of success in different regions—a scheme now being sent into oblivion—while at the same time the government says that it has renewed emphasis on consultations. 
Given the hour, Mr President, to assist the work of the chamber I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the remainder of my remarks, which are of similar moderate tone and obviously provide assistance and forthright advice to the government on how it might lift its game.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
The Government is also making major modifications to what was known until now as the ATAS scheme—Aboriginal Tutorial Assistance Scheme. This scheme is getting a name change, but a lot more as well by way of change.
The scheme provides additional tutorial assistance to Indigenous students who need it right across all sectors of education—school, TAFE and university.
Until now, at school level, the scheme provided broadly-based assistance to kids at every year level.
Now, the Government wants to “target” the help that Indigenous children receive. The program is capped, and so the funds will be largely eaten by the Government's own priorities. It appears to be limiting assistance in the first instance to children who have fallen behind at the Year 3, 5 and 7 literacy and numeracy benchmark tests.
It has also shifted emphasis away from individual tuition and into the classroom setting, which stretches the dollars further. The IEDA review emphasised that, while classroom tutorial help was useful, it needed to be supplemented by individual assistance.
So help available to Indigenous kids under this program will be narrower in focus and Indigenous students might miss out on individual assistance that they need. It is also unclear whether children at year levels other than 3, 5 and 7 will receive help.
Furthermore, in schools in the cities that have fewer than 20 Indigenous students, those kids will miss out altogether on tutorial assistance.
These changes fly in the face of the Government's insistence on so-called “mutual obligation”. Here, we see the Government blatantly failing to keep its side of the bargain with Indigenous school students: it is abandoning large numbers of them, by withdrawing the tutorial assistance in literacy and numeracy that they so clearly need.
As with the other changes brought in by this bill, there is a complete absence of detail about guidelines or implementation. Once again, the Senate is being asked to vote in the dark.
Where to now?
So where is the Government headed, in general terms, in Indigenous policy?
Does it have a direction? Is the direction the right one?
The answer is that it does indeed have a direction, but it's one that, despite the Prime Minister shaking hands with Indigenous leaders last week—despite that—the policy direction is one that should cause a high level of concern in the minds of all decent Australians.
This Government has taken us backwards in terms of Indigenous policy. More seriously, it has taken Indigenous people backwards—back in time. It has actually reversed direction.
In the early nineties, under the previous Labor Government, there was real forward movement. Australians were marching towards formal and real reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous citizens. It was a time of hope for Indigenous people.
But the Howard Government, when it explicitly refused to say sorry and rejected reconciliation, stopped that forward movement in its tracks.
This is not to say that there hasn't been anything to celebrate for Indigenous Australians in the last eight years. There has—but the achievements of individuals, groups and communities have occurred despite, and not because of, the Howard Government.
Now the new welfare agenda—the “shared responsibility” policy being foisted on Indigenous people without their full involvement and free agreement—will turn the clock back still further. 
There's nothing wrong with the concept of mutual obligation—provided that it is truly mutual and freely entered into. And it should apply to everybody—not just to the most starkly disadvantaged section of Australian society, Indigenous people.
What's wrong is forcing Indigenous people to sign up to do things they realistically can't do, because of their degree of disadvantage.
Australia collectively needs urgently to address this disadvantage.
Labor wants to see genuine reciprocity in welfare policy and service provision.
As a first step, a precondition, we need formal and real reconciliation. Labor is committed to this process. We call upon the Prime Minister and his Government to join us, and to join with Indigenous Australians and to take that crucial first step in the long road to a better life for Indigenous people in this country.

"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NATS,2004-12-06,"—I rise tonight to speak about a proposal by the University of New England in Armidale to establish a rural medical school at the UNE. Last week I met with a delegation from the Naresuan University, Thailand's premier regional university, which has established a regionally based rural medical school with the assistance of the Thai government. This university is now graduating over 200 medical graduates a year for Thailand's population of 65 million. Thailand, like Australia, has also been suffering from a shortage of doctors in its regions, and Prime Minister Shinawatra's government understand that if more doctors from rural and regional areas are trained and recruited in regional communities they are more likely to stay there to practise. This delegation has forged a working relationship with the University of New England in which the University of New England will help to train health professionals from Thailand along the lines of the long experience that the UNE has with distance education. It is probably regarded as Australia's premier distance education tertiary facility.
The University of New England is lobbying for the establishment of a rural medical school, shared across several regional New South Wales universities—the UNE, Charles Sturt University and Southern Cross University. I have met several times with Professor Victor Minichiello, the Dean of the Faculty of Education, Health and Professional Studies at the University of New England, who is passionate about this cause—that is, to develop a rural medical school to train doctors in regional Australia. It is well understood that rural and regional Australia currently faces a shortage of medical professionals—not only GPs but specialists and almost all allied health professionals. Unless this is addressed, the shortage will increase, making it harder for country people to be treated in their own communities and therefore certainly impacting on their quality of life. The coalition government, over the past eight years, has made some headway in addressing this problem—very substantial headway, I might add, with embedded changes to the whole way that medical training takes place—but there is still a fair way to go and other methods must be looked at.
The Rural Health Strategy that was announced, I think, in the 2000 budget, provided an initial $562 million to improve access to health services for people living in rural and regional Australia. This was the largest rural health program ever announced by a government. The strategy included increasing the funding for the number of postgraduate training places in rural Australia for general practices. Also a whole range of scholarships and other financial incentives are now in place. Funding has also been provided to place practice nurses in country doctors' clinics, registrars are also paid incentives to train in rural areas and doctors who are prepared to continue to practise in regional areas and set up outreach services are also rewarded. The government has also brought rural medicine into the 21st century with assistance for health services to establish online links with other medical professionals and educational facilities. This broadens the ability for the medicos to reach remote communities and also allows easier access to educational resources. The selection process for medical students has also been addressed. In fact, academic prowess is now no longer the only criterion used by all medical schools across the nation; there are other methods used to find out whether the proposed student is going to be a valued addition to the medical profession. And I mean that in the broadest sense: it is not done only on academic prowess now. 
One of the government's initiatives which I think has really made some headway in the recruitment and retention of doctors in rural Australia has been the establishment of the university departments of rural health in a number of major base hospitals across Australia. One such university department of rural health is based at Tamworth Base Hospital, in conjunction with the University of Newcastle. This allows medical students from the university to undertake some of their practical training in a rural setting and also assists those rural health services where the UDRH is based. The clinical schools will ensure that senior year medical students receive comprehensive training in the practice and procedures they will need for rural practice. It is understood that if a student from rural or regional Australia is trained and schooled in the country, they are nine times—and I repeat that: nine times—more likely to continue to live and work in regional areas. If someone comes from regional Australia and is professionally trained there then whatever that profession might be, including the medical profession, they have nine times more chance of returning to the regional areas whence they came.
While the Australian government is working to decrease the shortage of doctors in the regions, a rural medical school would certainly complement the rural health policy of the coalition. The University of New England already has an existing nursing school and extensive health and science programs. In the university's nursing program, around 94 per cent of students come from rural and regional areas, and it has been found that those students are then retained as regional health service providers.
The University of New England is one of Australia's best regionally based universities, and it makes sense to establish a high quality medicine program that can essentially train doctors for rural and regional Australia. It cannot be enough that more medical school places are funded by the Australian government to get more doctors to practise in the hope that they may move to regional areas. I think we have to put the medical schools out there for them to go to and then have that added advantage of their staying in regional areas. We must now look to training and educating our doctors in country areas and to practise in country areas in communities they are familiar with and under circumstances they are also familiar with. I am fully supportive of the proposal for a collaborative medical school program between the University of New England, Charles Sturt University and Southern Cross University, and I will certainly do what I can to assist.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Australia: Health Services</title>,Adjournment,26,1,speech
