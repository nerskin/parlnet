Mr BYRNE
 (Holt) (10:08):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, I present the Annual report of committee activities 2011-2012.


Reviewing administration and expenditure on an annual basis is one of the primary functions of the committee. Section 29 of the Intelligence Services Act stipulates that the committee has an obligation to review the administration and expenditure, including the annual financial statements, of the Australian intelligence community (AIC).


On 18 June 2012 the committee tabled its Review of administration and expenditure No. 9, 2009-2010. 


This review examined a wide range of aspects of the administration and expenditure of the six intelligence and security agencies, including the financial statements for each agency, their human resource management, training, recruitment and accommodation. In addition the review looked at issues of interoperability between members of the AIC.


Submissions were sought from each of the six intelligence and security agencies, from the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) and from the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security (IGIS).


The committee also received five submissions from members of the public or public organisations which included:


Asylum Seeker Resource Centre


Brigidine Asylum Seekers Project


RISE.


Refugee Council of Australia


These submissions all dealt with ASIO security assessments of refugees.


On 25 March 2011 the committee held a private hearing at which ASIO, ASIS, DSD, DIGO, ONA and DIO appeared before the committee. On 16 June 2011 the committee held a public hearing—its first since July 2006—and heard from representatives of the Refugee Council of Australia, RISE (Refugees, Survivors and Ex-Detainees), the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre and ASIO in relation to visa security assessments.


The committee took very seriously the concerns put before it by various refugee and asylum seeker advocacy groups but it also recognised that the job of ASIO is a very difficult one. Therefore, the committee welcomed the efforts, introduced by ASIO on 1 March 2011, to streamline the process of security assessments in an attempt to clear the backlog and to process future assessments in less time. The committee was satisfied that the current regime for visa security assessments is the correct one and noted that the IGIS has stated that ASIO is doing its job in a 'proper and legal manner'.


Overall, the committee was satisfied that the administration and expenditure of the six intelligence and security agencies is sound, although I would draw members' attention to section 1.32 of the report about the committee's 'concerns raised in relation to the efficiency dividend's impact on agencies' during the review. One thing about this committee is that we have a very close working relationship with the intelligence agencies, and I am here to tell this chamber that, if this committee feels the efficiency dividend starts affecting the operability of the intelligence agencies in discharging their duties, then it will bring it to the parliament's attention. So we will be having further reports, reviews of administration and expenditure Nos 9 and 10. But I just wanted to flag that particularly crucial point.


There were two reports on the listing of organisations as terrorist organisations that were tabled in the period under review. The two reports dealt with 11 organisations, comprising 10 relistings and one initial listing.


The reports were:


review of the listing of Al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and the re-listing of 6 terrorist organisations; and,


review of the re-listing of Ansar al-Islam (AAI), Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LeJ) as terrorist organisations.


The committee did not recommend disallowance of any of the regulations in relation to the 11 organisations.


I would also like to thank the very hardworking secretariat—Jerome Brown, Robert Little, Jessica Butler and Sonya Gaspar—and my deputy chair, the member for Berowra, sitting over there. It is wonderful having the former Attorney-General for his counsel, wisdom and advice on these matters. It is a bipartisan committee. It works very hard to be a bipartisan committee to work in the national interest.


The other thing I would like to say is in terms of various assertions about the committee that I have heard. The committee discharges its duty very carefully. It does so, as I said, in a bipartisan manner, balancing national security interests and privacy interests at the same time. It will continue to do so in any subject matter that it is charged with looking at.


So I thank the secretariat; I thank all of the committee members. I look forward to hearing the deputy chair's contribution on this particular report.


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a Parliamentary paper.

Mr RUDDOCK
 (Berowra) (10:13):  I thank the chair for his very generous comments. I am not sure whether he had been party to my thinking, because I did in fact plan to broaden my comments a little in the context of some of the points he was making in relation to a report that might seem somewhat anodyne. I add to his comments my thanks to our professional staff and I ask members, in reading this report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security entitled Annual report of committee activities 2011-2012 to have regard to a recent statement by the Prime Minister on Australia's national security beyond the 9/11 decade. In reading the speech, what was of concern to me were the suggestions that in the decade since 9/11 the situation and risks that we face are somewhat different. There was an emphasis in that speech about the era in which the behaviour of states, not non-state actors, will be in the main part of our national security thinking. It goes on to say that the national security decade was a time of a rapid ramp-up of resources. Now, inevitably, we are in a period of consolidation. I am interested that we also have the member for Melbourne Ports, because he is familiar with some of the arguments that I am now going to raise.


I do not think we are in a position to look at these issues in relation to national security on which we are reporting, unaware of some of the events that are occurring internationally. The matters on which I will comment are not matters that I am privy to. They are matters that you will read about in the newspapers. I was just looking at some of them as I thought about what I might say today about Australians abroad and some tragic events more recently in Bulgaria. I read about what is happening in Syria and the reports of Australians abroad engaged in activities in that region. In some cases their work is said to be humanitarian, but in others the reporting suggests that they are active participants. These are people who can come back to Australia after they have been trained in organisations that ought to be of considerable concern to us.


And so I am glad that the chair mentioned paragraph 132, because it raises concerns that the committee had about the impact of the efficiency dividend on agencies. I do not think that it is appropriate, in the context of the comments that have been made about national security, that these observations by the committee that has responsibility for looking at these issues should be ignored. This ought not to be a period of consolidation that sees a contraction in the expenditure available to national security agencies, if that is the government's intention. I think that observation is quite pertinent.


In relation to the other matter that the chair spoke of—in relation to the concerns that were raised about security assessments of refugees—I do not think that people should be unaware of the way in which the refugee convention says decisions should be made. We do not have to accept people as refugees if they are of security risk. Yet findings have been made by the government that people were refugees before the security assessments took place. We would not be asking this question in this report if the government had been rigorous about ensuring that no decisions were made on refugee status before the security assessments had been made, and it was a major error. The committee report does not bring it out, but I think it is pertinent that people should know we are only being asked to look at this decision because of flawed decision making initially.

Mr SCHULTZ
 (Hume) (10:29):  I rise to present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the United Kingdom and Poland from 5 to 15 November 2012. I also want to make some comments related to the make-up of the delegation, which was led by the President of the Senate, the Hon. John Hogg, in a very dignified and professional manner. The delegation also consisted of the Hon. John Murphy MP, the member for Reid; Mr Michael Danby MP, the member for Melbourne Ports; Ms Sharon Grierson MP, the member for Newcastle; Senator David Bushby, a senator for Tasmania; and me, as deputy chair. We were ably assisted by Mr Tim Bryant, the delegation's secretary. The delegation worked exceptionally well together with the intent of strengthening the parliament-to-parliament relations between the Australian parliament and the United Kingdom and Poland.


I thank the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for its oral and written information, which was complemented by the Parliamentary Library, both of which ensured that we were well briefed. Our appreciation must go also to DFAT officers at each destination. Many individuals and organisations met with the delegation members and gave most generously of their time and knowledge. I wish to particularly acknowledge the extensive briefing from the Australian Deputy High Commissioner, Mr Adam McCarthy, and the Rt Hon. Sir Alan Haselhurst MP, Chairperson of the Executive Committee of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and Chair of the CPA UK Executive Committee, who welcomed and briefed the delegation on the current agenda with which the CPA is dealing.


All members found the London visit most informative, with the generous contribution by the five committees or committee chairs offering an opportunity for each member of the delegation to learn more about the functioning of committees and the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. Thanks must be given to the Rt Hon. Michael Moore MP, Secretary of State for Scotland, who gave his time to ensure that the delegation had full understanding and details regarding the possible independence of Scotland. A referendum on Scottish independence is planned for 2014.


In the Republic of Poland, the delegation was privileged to have advice, support and words of wisdom from Ms Jean Dunn, the Australian Ambassador to Poland, and the embassy officials. They were extremely professional in every aspect of the delegation's visit.


The first part of the visit to Poland focused on Krakow, giving the delegation a cultural and educational view of this city with 23 universities. President Hogg officially opened a cultural exhibition documenting the lives of Polish Siberian deportees to Australia. In Warsaw, President Hogg was presented with the Medal of Gratitude of the European Solidarity Centre by His Excellency Mr Borusewicz, the Speaker of the Senate, on behalf of the Polish parliament.


We as Australians never forgot 11 November, Remembrance Day, whilst we were overseas. It was foremost in our minds. We visited the Commonwealth war graves at Rakowicki Cemetery. We were reminded that at the end of the Second World War the British Army gathered together Commonwealth graves from all over Poland into three cemeteries, Rakowicki being the largest. Those buried there died while prisoners of war during the German occupation. Twenty-two Australians are buried at Rakowicki Cemetery. The delegation was welcomed by Major Aleksander Gladki. President Hogg and I laid a wreath at the Cross of Sacrifice, and the delegation laid a rose at the gravesides of the individual Australians. I have to say to you, Madam Speaker, that that was a very compelling experience.


The delegation now recognises that there is a great opportunity for the two parliaments to work more closely to support and strengthen each other, as both countries have much in common. I noted with some satisfaction the spontaneous positive reaction of the Polish people to the Australian flags on the ambassador's car and the positive comments about the quality of Australian wines.


Once again, I compliment President John Hogg on his leadership and all members of the delegation for their cooperation with each other and their commitment to work. I again thank the many officials who assisted in a professional way to ensure that the delegation achieved the aims of the visit, and I present the report.

Ms GRIERSON
 (Newcastle) (10:34):  It is my pleasure, as a member of the delegation to the UK and Poland, to follow the member for Hume. I would like to second all the comments that the member for Hume made in thanking and acknowledging all the formal contributions to the success of our delegation trip. It is important to always remember that the Prime Minister of this country, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Defence cannot visit all these countries. The Minister for Trade cannot visit all these countries. So delegations have an important role in reinforcing those partnerships and relationships and saying: 'Yes, this is a relationship that is important to Australia and that we value. We value it enough to send our members of parliament to these countries to visit.'


Certainly in the UK the visits to committees were very interesting, because they have more power than our committees. They actually set their own work program. They do not have to have it approved by both chambers of parliament, as here. We found that they stressed the staunchly bipartisan nature of their committee work. I think, when I reflect on the last five years, that perhaps that is something that has slipped away somewhat. We are more powerful as backbenchers, like me, if we are parts of committees that really focus on change, reform and highlighting issues that are central to this nation rather than political expediency.


It was particularly interesting to meet the Foreign Affairs Committee, a very powerful select committee—which featured, of course, in the new James Bond movie, Skyfall. It was interesting to once again meet Baroness Liddell. Many members here enjoyed her hospitality when she was the ambassador to Australia. But the big issue facing Britain, of course, was whether they should stay in the European Union. There was great debate around that issue. Interestingly for me, their views on economic risk were very strongly put to us, as were the history of the UK and its independence. It seemed very difficult for many of the members to embrace the European Union. However, I took time to speak to a lot of the young people who worked in the houses of parliament. One's partner was Spanish. Another's partner was German. These people are living in a united Europe and enjoying it. The European Union, of course, won a Nobel peace prize for some of the changes it has brought about. It was an interesting debate, as was the independence quest for Scotland—a very interesting debate to be part of. We also concentrated on our combined positions in security and on terrorism—the work we have done together—and certainly the support that the UK gave us for our temporary seat on the UN Security Council, which we were successful in achieving, and our work in Afghanistan together. These are very valuable.


On an evening we were free, I had the great pleasure to visit the Ledbury restaurant, which is run by a young man from Newcastle called Brett Graham. It has two Michelin stars. Brett is a TAFE graduate from my city and started his restaurant in 2005. In 2010-11 Ledbury became the UK's No. 1 restaurant and Brett was named Chef of the Year. It is wonderful to visit young Novocastrians who are making their mark in the world.


It was lovely to meet with the Speaker of the House of Lords. She took the time to say to me how much she as a woman enjoyed the Prime Minister's speech last year on misogyny. These are things women parliamentarians say to each other, and the Scottish women, of course, took me aside to share that as well. They are some of the personal encounters.


The highlight for me of the Scotland trip was the visit to Glasgow. I particularly thank Ian Davidson, the MP for Glasgow South West, who hosted us for a whole day. He took us to look at shipbuilding work and to BAE Systems and we had a roundtable with economic people from Glasgow about urban renewal and change and about the Commonwealth Games bid—Glasgow hosts the Commonwealth Games in 2018. I thank Ian Davidson. There are great parallels between his city and my city.


Visiting Poland was an absolute privilege. Of course, there are many Polish people living here in Australia, but, as the member for Hume said, it is quite an experience to stand at a Commonwealth war grave and know that that country has been invaded and occupied many times and has experienced great turmoil. I thank Ambassador Dunn, in particular. Her attention to detail was incredible. It made our trip and our understanding of Poland so much deeper and more worthwhile.

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2013-02-11,"



Ms HALL
 (Shortland) (10:39):  On behalf of the Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, I present the committee's report on adhesive arachnoiditis.


The foundation of the report was a half-day roundtable held in September last year. I would like to thank the committee secretariat for their work in organising the roundtable and preparing the report for tabling and my fellow committee members for their contribution to the report, particularly the deputy chair, Steve Irons, the member for Swan, who was instrumental in the committee inquiring into adhesive arachnoiditis, and the previous chair, Steve Georganas, the member for Hindmarsh. I would also like to thank all those sufferers of adhesive arachnoiditis who shared their stories with the committee, which in many cases caused them considerable distress.


Adhesive arachnoiditis is a painful condition. It is associated with inflammation and scarring of the arachnoid membrane, one of the delicate membranes surrounding the spine. Symptoms include chronic pain, lack of bowel and bladder control, impaired sexual function and compromised reflexes. The presentation and severity of symptoms vary between individuals and over time. Restricted mobility and even paralysis are consequences for those most severely affected. In short, this is a horrific condition, a disabling condition and a condition that does not go away. There are a number of factors which, either alone or in combination, can trigger adhesive arachnoiditis. These include complications of bacterial and viral infections, degenerative back conditions and trauma due to injury and surgical procedures. A significant issue raised relates to the risks associated with exposure to a diagnostic agent used in Australia until the late 1980s.


The committee's roundtable provided a means to raise the profile of this little known condition, to highlight some of the major challenges facing sufferers and to identify options for providing practical assistance. There is no doubt that the physical, social and emotional impacts of adhesive arachnoiditis are real and catastrophic. At the roundtable, the committee heard how those living with this debilitating condition were much more likely to suffer from depression or seek relief from the constant pain through substance abuse. The committee also heard how the unrelenting pain had some sufferers contemplating suicide.


The stress of living with this painful condition is made worse for those who attribute their adhesive arachnoiditis to medical procedures that were in fact intended to relieve their suffering. The committee is aware that some sufferers have litigated, seeking compensation from medical professionals and from the manufacturers of the implicated diagnostic agents. The committee itself does not have the authority to investigate individual claims or to order compensation. In the context of corporate social responsibility, the committee has urged the relevant manufacturer to consider establishing a charitable foundation and engage with sufferers to determine how they can be assisted.


Diagnosis can be a lengthy and frustrating ordeal for sufferers. Adhesive arachnoiditis is a little known condition, even among health professionals. The committee heard how one sufferer was only diagnosed after recognising the symptoms herself after reading a newspaper article. Another sufferer was told for many years that she had fibromyalgia. For many sufferers diagnosis is more than just a label. It validates their experience and can provide a framework to help them better cope with the condition. The committee recommends awareness raising through education and training for general practitioners and health professionals working in pain clinics.


Unfortunately, there is currently no cure for adhesive arachnoiditis. Treatments are limited and largely revolve around managing pain. But the prohibitive cost of medication was raised at the roundtable. One participant told the committee how he needed to find more than $120 each week to cover the cost of pregabalin, a medication specifically for neuropathic pain. So I am delighted to confirm that from next month pregabalin will be subsidised and available through the Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme. That is great news for chronic pain sufferers.



The committee also recommended that Medicare Locals and other health providers engage with adhesive arachnoiditis sufferers to optimise pain management. To establish an improved evidence base, the committee recommends support— (Time expired)


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.

Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (10:44):  As Deputy Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, I rise to respond to the chair's statement on the report Living with the pain of adhesive arachnoiditis: report on the roundtable into adhesive arachnoiditis. I start with the following statement:


Our guiding principles are to focus on patient needs, respect people, communicate honestly and act with integrity. We are bound by a promise to keep our customers at the heart of everything we do. We do this work in partnership with Government, industry, the community and our peak industry association,


Any suffers of adhesive arachnoiditis will recognise this motherhood statement taken from the GlaxoSmithKline website. GSK is the company that released the Myodil and Pantopaque products into the medical world, which are a cause of the condition known as adhesive arachnoiditis, described in the report as a painful condition. We heard the chair say in her statement that this is a horrific condition.


The report states that the committee very much appreciates the contributions of all participants to its inquiry. The roundtable made clear to the committee how debilitating adhesive arachnoiditis can be to sufferers. The committee very much sympathises with and hopes that the recommendations of the report will help to improve the quality of life for sufferers and their families and carers. I particularly mention Mr Max Scott from my electorate of Swan, who first brought to this terrible condition to my attention. I also thank Mr Joern Hagemann and his daughter and carer, Mrs Erika Zorzit, who both came to visit me about Mr Hagemann's condition. Their visit gave me the extra impetus to cajole, urge and convince the Standing Committee on Health and Ageing to commit to a roundtable and I thank my fellow committee members for their support in agreeing to the roundtable.


In particular I thank Steve Georganas, the previous chair, and Jill Hall, the current chair, both of whom played their part in getting this roundtable up. I thank the secretariat for their work on this difficult report as I felt there was a level of trepidation in dealing with this subject due to the long litigious history of the subject and the ongoing litigation. Thanks must also be given to the previous member for Throsby Jennie George for tackling this issue back in the early 2000s with the support of Jill Hall.


I also mention Mr Jonathan Martin from my office who spent a considerable amount of time dealing with sufferers and providing me with valuable research. His efforts should not go unnoticed by the people who read this report. During my time involved with the forgotten Australians apology more than three years ago, the comment that the Leader of the Opposition at that time, Malcolm Turnbull, made in his speech when he said, 'We believe you,' was, for many people, a significant moment. I think the same significance could be taken by arachnoiditis sufferers from the comments made by Professor Michael Sage, a radiologist, when he stated:


I believe that the most common cause of chronic arachnoiditis is Myodil, and most people have been suffering for 40 years. … These people have suffered, mainly because we were using a dye, Myodil, with no alternative. … there was a gradual recognition—with poor literature, I might say—that there was a problem. A needle was introduced to allow us to suck it out; the problem was that it was often impossible to suck it all out anyway. The bottom line was that, if there was some alternative, we should not have been putting it in. I was very concerned about this. 


The report's recommendation 1 goes back to the first part of my statement that was taken from the GSK website. This recommendation's first paragraph states:


In the context of corporate social responsibility the Committee encourages GlaxoSmithKline to consider establishing a charitable foundation to assist sufferers of adhesive arachnoiditis.


This is a decision that only GSK can make. However, if we are to believe all the motherhood and community caring messages stated on their websites around the world, we can only hope that they honour these statements. If they do not act, their response to this recommendation will give us a true indication of GSK's real community concern. In the report there is a comment that states there is an acceptable failure rate of 10 per cent for people who contract arachnoiditis from a myelography. I ask: would that be an acceptable failure rate for a motor vehicle manufacturer? The clear answer is no. My experience with manufacturing is that a one per cent failure rate is acceptable before they have a recall. I encourage people to read this report and again thank all the people who were able to finally have this debilitating condition brought to public awareness through this report. I commend this report to the House.

Ms HALL
 (Shortland) (10:39):  On behalf of the Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, I present the committee's report on adhesive arachnoiditis.


The foundation of the report was a half-day roundtable held in September last year. I would like to thank the committee secretariat for their work in organising the roundtable and preparing the report for tabling and my fellow committee members for their contribution to the report, particularly the deputy chair, Steve Irons, the member for Swan, who was instrumental in the committee inquiring into adhesive arachnoiditis, and the previous chair, Steve Georganas, the member for Hindmarsh. I would also like to thank all those sufferers of adhesive arachnoiditis who shared their stories with the committee, which in many cases caused them considerable distress.


Adhesive arachnoiditis is a painful condition. It is associated with inflammation and scarring of the arachnoid membrane, one of the delicate membranes surrounding the spine. Symptoms include chronic pain, lack of bowel and bladder control, impaired sexual function and compromised reflexes. The presentation and severity of symptoms vary between individuals and over time. Restricted mobility and even paralysis are consequences for those most severely affected. In short, this is a horrific condition, a disabling condition and a condition that does not go away. There are a number of factors which, either alone or in combination, can trigger adhesive arachnoiditis. These include complications of bacterial and viral infections, degenerative back conditions and trauma due to injury and surgical procedures. A significant issue raised relates to the risks associated with exposure to a diagnostic agent used in Australia until the late 1980s.


The committee's roundtable provided a means to raise the profile of this little known condition, to highlight some of the major challenges facing sufferers and to identify options for providing practical assistance. There is no doubt that the physical, social and emotional impacts of adhesive arachnoiditis are real and catastrophic. At the roundtable, the committee heard how those living with this debilitating condition were much more likely to suffer from depression or seek relief from the constant pain through substance abuse. The committee also heard how the unrelenting pain had some sufferers contemplating suicide.


The stress of living with this painful condition is made worse for those who attribute their adhesive arachnoiditis to medical procedures that were in fact intended to relieve their suffering. The committee is aware that some sufferers have litigated, seeking compensation from medical professionals and from the manufacturers of the implicated diagnostic agents. The committee itself does not have the authority to investigate individual claims or to order compensation. In the context of corporate social responsibility, the committee has urged the relevant manufacturer to consider establishing a charitable foundation and engage with sufferers to determine how they can be assisted.


Diagnosis can be a lengthy and frustrating ordeal for sufferers. Adhesive arachnoiditis is a little known condition, even among health professionals. The committee heard how one sufferer was only diagnosed after recognising the symptoms herself after reading a newspaper article. Another sufferer was told for many years that she had fibromyalgia. For many sufferers diagnosis is more than just a label. It validates their experience and can provide a framework to help them better cope with the condition. The committee recommends awareness raising through education and training for general practitioners and health professionals working in pain clinics.


Unfortunately, there is currently no cure for adhesive arachnoiditis. Treatments are limited and largely revolve around managing pain. But the prohibitive cost of medication was raised at the roundtable. One participant told the committee how he needed to find more than $120 each week to cover the cost of pregabalin, a medication specifically for neuropathic pain. So I am delighted to confirm that from next month pregabalin will be subsidised and available through the Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme. That is great news for chronic pain sufferers.



The committee also recommended that Medicare Locals and other health providers engage with adhesive arachnoiditis sufferers to optimise pain management. To establish an improved evidence base, the committee recommends support— (Time expired)

Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (10:44):  As Deputy Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, I rise to respond to the chair's statement on the report Living with the pain of adhesive arachnoiditis: report on the roundtable into adhesive arachnoiditis. I start with the following statement:


Our guiding principles are to focus on patient needs, respect people, communicate honestly and act with integrity. We are bound by a promise to keep our customers at the heart of everything we do. We do this work in partnership with Government, industry, the community and our peak industry association,


Any suffers of adhesive arachnoiditis will recognise this motherhood statement taken from the GlaxoSmithKline website. GSK is the company that released the Myodil and Pantopaque products into the medical world, which are a cause of the condition known as adhesive arachnoiditis, described in the report as a painful condition. We heard the chair say in her statement that this is a horrific condition.


The report states that the committee very much appreciates the contributions of all participants to its inquiry. The roundtable made clear to the committee how debilitating adhesive arachnoiditis can be to sufferers. The committee very much sympathises with and hopes that the recommendations of the report will help to improve the quality of life for sufferers and their families and carers. I particularly mention Mr Max Scott from my electorate of Swan, who first brought to this terrible condition to my attention. I also thank Mr Joern Hagemann and his daughter and carer, Mrs Erika Zorzit, who both came to visit me about Mr Hagemann's condition. Their visit gave me the extra impetus to cajole, urge and convince the Standing Committee on Health and Ageing to commit to a roundtable and I thank my fellow committee members for their support in agreeing to the roundtable.


In particular I thank Steve Georganas, the previous chair, and Jill Hall, the current chair, both of whom played their part in getting this roundtable up. I thank the secretariat for their work on this difficult report as I felt there was a level of trepidation in dealing with this subject due to the long litigious history of the subject and the ongoing litigation. Thanks must also be given to the previous member for Throsby Jennie George for tackling this issue back in the early 2000s with the support of Jill Hall.


I also mention Mr Jonathan Martin from my office who spent a considerable amount of time dealing with sufferers and providing me with valuable research. His efforts should not go unnoticed by the people who read this report. During my time involved with the forgotten Australians apology more than three years ago, the comment that the Leader of the Opposition at that time, Malcolm Turnbull, made in his speech when he said, 'We believe you,' was, for many people, a significant moment. I think the same significance could be taken by arachnoiditis sufferers from the comments made by Professor Michael Sage, a radiologist, when he stated:


I believe that the most common cause of chronic arachnoiditis is Myodil, and most people have been suffering for 40 years. … These people have suffered, mainly because we were using a dye, Myodil, with no alternative. … there was a gradual recognition—with poor literature, I might say—that there was a problem. A needle was introduced to allow us to suck it out; the problem was that it was often impossible to suck it all out anyway. The bottom line was that, if there was some alternative, we should not have been putting it in. I was very concerned about this. 


The report's recommendation 1 goes back to the first part of my statement that was taken from the GSK website. This recommendation's first paragraph states:


In the context of corporate social responsibility the Committee encourages GlaxoSmithKline to consider establishing a charitable foundation to assist sufferers of adhesive arachnoiditis.


This is a decision that only GSK can make. However, if we are to believe all the motherhood and community caring messages stated on their websites around the world, we can only hope that they honour these statements. If they do not act, their response to this recommendation will give us a true indication of GSK's real community concern. In the report there is a comment that states there is an acceptable failure rate of 10 per cent for people who contract arachnoiditis from a myelography. I ask: would that be an acceptable failure rate for a motor vehicle manufacturer? The clear answer is no. My experience with manufacturing is that a one per cent failure rate is acceptable before they have a recall. I encourage people to read this report and again thank all the people who were able to finally have this debilitating condition brought to public awareness through this report. I commend this report to the House.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (10:50):  The Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment (Towards Transparency) Bill 2013 is important legislation because it is vital for our country that we have clean unions. It is absolutely important for the workers and, indeed, for the businesses of Australia that the unions, which are so significant in many workplaces, are properly and honestly run. This legislation strengthens the requirements upon union officials to act honestly and in good faith, and it is so obvious right now that this is absolutely necessary. We have seen many scandals in a number of unions. We have many investigations going on right now into possible improper conduct. It is absolutely vital that we strengthen the requirement on union officials to act honestly and in good faith. The other thing this bill does is increase penalties on union officials who do not act honestly and in good faith. It is absolutely obvious that right now penalties are manifestly inadequate. They have, to give credit where it is due, recently been increased by the government in response to issues particularly in respect of Health Services Union, but the government's increases only raised the penalties on individuals to $6,600 and on organisations to $33,000. Under the government's increases, they are still simply civil penalties.


So my private member's bill proposes to increase penalties to $340,000 to provide for criminal as well as civil sanctions, including imprisonment of up to five years. Lest anyone think that this is in some way anomalous or in some way singling out unions, I want to make it crystal clear that what this bill seeks to do is to put exactly the same regime, as far as we can, in place for unions and those running unions as applies to companies and those running companies. If a union official or a company official does the wrong thing, they should face the same penalty for the same wrongdoing. This is what my proposed private member's bill seeks to do.


What the coalition seeks to do above all else is ensure that the rule of law operates in our workplaces. This is our fundamental commitment: to the rule of law everywhere but particularly in the workplaces of Australia. There are three major elements in the coalition's declared policies to ensure that the rule of law operates in our workplaces. The first, which this bill gives expression to, is to ensure that we have reasonable requirements and appropriate penalties on union officials. The second is to establish a registered organisation commission. This will separate the conciliation and arbitration functions of the Fair Work Commission from its law enforcement functions. The bill seeks to ensure that the law enforcement functions are pursued diligently, professionally and expeditiously. The third, and very important, element in the coalition's policy commitment to establishing the rule of law in our workplaces is the full re-establishment of the Australian Building and Construction Commission, with full power, full authority and full funding.


We have seen a very sorry state of affairs in a number of unions, but in particular the Health Services Union. I know that there would be many people on both sides of this House who lament the state to which this union has been reduced. We have seen the national president of this union face criminal charges alleging, amongst other things, that millions of dollars of low-paid union members' money have been wrongly directed into businesses associated with the family of the gentleman in question. We have seen the former national secretary of that union, now a member of this place, subject to civil and, more recently, criminal charges arising from claims that hundreds of thousands of dollars have been misdirected into electoral activities and tens of thousand dollars have been misdirected into matters that can only be described as personal indulgences. According to the report of Mr Ian Temby QC, some 20 millions of dollars of low-paid union members' money may have been improperly used in this union alone. We have also seen very credible claims of private slush funds in the 1990s in the Australian Workers Union. I commend the member for Barton for the way he has raised this subject.


Fair Work Australia currently has eight major investigations underway into possible improper conduct in unions. At least four large unions are involved: the Communication Workers Union, the Community and Public Sector Union, the Nursing Federation and United Voice. These are large unions currently the subject of Fair Work investigations.


There is a serious problem of governance in our unions. There is a serious problem of malfeasance inside the union movement and it is incumbent upon this parliament to do what it can to give this country the clean, well-run, honestly-run unions that the workers of Australia deserve.


It will, if I may say so, be quite a test for this government in considering this bill. We know that more than 50 per cent of the parliamentary members of the Labor caucus are former union officials. The challenge for members opposite will be: do they back the interests of members, of workers; or do they back the interests of officials? This is a very serious challenge for members opposite: to resist the pull of the mates network and stand up for the interests of the ordinary workers of our country. We know how powerful members of the mates network are. Michael Williamson, the former boss of the Health Services Union, was not only the National President of the Australian Labor Party at the time when the Prime Minister assumed her high office and he was not only one of the faceless men referred to by the current head of the Australian Workers Union in his notorious Lateline interview on the night of the change of Labor leadership; Michael Williamson has obviously been a godfather figure to many members opposite. We had the Assistant Treasurer, the member for Lindsay, even cite this gentleman in his maiden speech as someone who has made such an extraordinary contribution to his career.


I say to members opposite: it is high time that we put the ordinary working people of Australia first. It is high time that we put the interests of workers ahead of the interests of union officials, and that is what the coalition intends to do.


I know members opposite like to characterise the political debate as pitting the friends of the workers on one side of the parliament against the friends of the bosses on the other side of the parliament. Well, unless the government is prepared to show it is serious by entertaining the bill that I am putting before the parliament, what will be exposed is that the real friends of the workers of this country are on this side of the parliament. The people who want to see a fair go for the workers of this country and to see honest unionism are the people on this side of the parliament. I commend the bill to the House.

The SPEAKER
 (12:02):  I present the explanatory memorandum and move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I will now do the unusual act of reading a second reading speech, as this is a Parliamentary Service bill. The bill amends the Parliamentary Service Act 1999 to reflect provisions of the Public Service Amendment Bill 2012 which has now passed both Houses. In March 2010, the Advisory Group on Reform of Australian Government Administration published its report, Ahead of the game: blueprint for the reform of Australian government administration, and made recommendations to further strengthen the framework for the Australian Public Service.


This bill reflects many of those changes as far as they are relevant to the Parliamentary Service, and also includes a small number of unrelated amendments.


I turn now to some of the main provisions of the bill.




Values and employment principles



The bill revises the existing set of 15 Parliamentary Service Values in section 10 of the act with a set of five values and introduces a set of Parliamentary Service Employment Principles.


Secretaries of parliamentary departments will be required to uphold and promote the new employment principles, as well as the Parliamentary Service Values.


Section 11 of the act will be amended to enable (rather than require) the Parliamentary Service Commissioner to advise the Presiding Officers in relation to any of the values.


The bill also enables the commissioner to give advice to the Presiding Officers about employment matters.


Proposed section 11C sets out the Presiding Officers' powers to make determinations about employment matters.


The bill also includes a statement about the role of the Parliamentary Service in serving the parliament.




Code of conduct



The bill amends section 13 of the act to provide for the Parliamentary Service Code of Conduct to apply to all relevant conduct where there is a connection with the employee's employment.


In addition to the existing requirements employees will be required to uphold the proposed Parliamentary Service Employment Principles and the integrity and good reputation of their departments.


The bill allows code of conduct action to be taken in relation to employees who have provided false or misleading information in connection with their engagement. It provides that a determination of a breach of the code of conduct may be made after an employee has separated from the Parliamentary Service.


Secretaries will be required to establish written procedures to determine whether there has been a breach of the code, which must have due regard for procedural fairness.


Section 20 will be amended to clarify that secretaries are not subject to direction by the Presiding Officers in relation to investigations into code of conduct breaches or whistleblower reports.




Whistleblower reports



The bill provides for new procedures concerning whistleblower reports made by Parliamentary Service employees. It also enables the Parliamentary Service Commissioner to inquire into whistleblowers' complaints after notifying the Presiding Officers of a proposed investigation.




Review of 
a
ctions



The bill adds an option for reviews of action to be conducted by the Merit Protection Commissioner personally. Currently the commissioner must nominate a person or establish a three-member committee to conduct such a review.




Secretaries



The descriptions of the roles and responsibilities of secretaries will be expanded, including provision for a stewardship role for the Parliamentary Service.




Senior executive service (SES)



The provisions relating to the senior executive service are amended to capture better their responsibilities to the wider Parliamentary Service.




Confidentiality of 
i
nformation



Provisions for the use, and confidentiality, of information in the province of the Parliamentary Commissioner and Merit Protection Commissioner are to be expanded and included in the act, rather than in the determinations. A new provision introduces protections for employees who provide information to the Parliamentary Service Commissioner or the Merit Protection Commissioner.




Immunity from suit



Provisions for immunity from civil proceedings for both the commissioner and the MPC will be moved from the determinations to the act.




Miscellaneous amendments



The bill also proposes a number of miscellaneous amendments to update, clarify and strengthen existing provisions and to remove ambiguity.




Amendments not directly related to Public Service Act changes



Other changes are proposed which are not directly related to the Public Service Act changes. These include enabling the Parliamentary Service Commissioner and Merit Protection Commissioner to delegate their powers and functions, and revising provisions dealing with acting arrangements for statutory office-holder positions to align them with the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.




Summary



In summary, the bill before the House will ensure that the Parliamentary Service Act maintains its alignment with the Public Service Act where relevant, while incorporating appropriate modifications reflecting the different role, scale and structure of the Parliamentary Service compared to the Australian Public Service.


The bill will help ensure that the Parliamentary Service continues to provide impartial and professional support of the highest calibre to assist members and senators to fulfil their constitutional and parliamentary responsibilities.


More details are included in the explanatory memorandum which has been presented.


I commend the bill to the House.

 (Grayndler—Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (15:12):  On indulgence, I wish to inform the House of the passing last Thursday evening of Mr Nick Dimopoulos who was the Chief Executive Officer and Commissioner of the National Transport Commission. Mr Dimopoulos made a major contribution to the work of the commission since his appointment in 2006, and I greatly valued his advice. The commission plays a leading role in driving national transport regulatory reforms, and Nick's leadership and guidance will be missed by ministers and officials from across the Commonwealth, states and territories. 


In the past three years, Nick and the commission have worked very hard to implement the historic national regulatory reforms, which will provide Australia for the first time with a seamless national transport regulatory system. Nick Dimopoulos was committed to improving Australian transport safety and productivity. Nick's professional career spanned industries such as mining, logistics, finance, infrastructure and transport. Prior to joining the NTC he held senior positions in both the public and private sectors. He headed up the Committee for Economic Development of Australia and worked in the Victorian Treasury and on World Bank infrastructure projects in China. His dedication and professionalism will be sadly missed. Speaker, I passed my condolences on this morning to Nick's widow, Steph, and their children. My thoughts are with them and Nick's colleagues at this time.

Mr TRUSS
 (Wide Bay—Leader of The Nationals) (15:14):  On indulgence, I join in acknowledging and recognising the service of Nick Dimopoulos, particularly in his role as Chief Executive Officer and Commissioner of the National Transport Commission. He had a distinguished career in government and public policy but worked also in the private sector. His work in driving national transport regulatory reform was challenging and required great dedication and patience. The task has been in progress for a very long time and bit by bit some progress has been achieved. Certainly, Mr Dimopoulos's work in that regard needs to be recognised and acknowledged on this occasion. His contribution to public and private policy is acknowledged with gratitude and I join the minister in extending the condolences of the opposition to his widow and family.

Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley) (15:17):  Thank you, Speaker, and well done on explaining the title of this legislation! It is quite a whopper and I hope those listening will persevere. I rise to speak on the government's Income Tax Rates Amendment (Unlawful Payments from Regulated Superannuation Funds) Bill 2012 and Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Reducing Illegal Early Release and Other Measures) Bill 2012. It just rolls off the tongue, doesn't it! I am sure we could have come up with a catchy acronym there! The bills before the House seek to reduce the incidence of illegal early withdrawal of superannuation.


Before speaking to the bills, I would like to foreshadow to the House that on behalf of the coalition I will be seeking to move an amendment to this bill, which gives the Australian Taxation Office discretion to allow taxpayers to correct inadvertent errors leading to excess superannuation contributions breaching either concessional or non-concessional superannuation contribution caps. This amendment would give the ATO the option to remedy excessive and disproportionate tax penalties where it believed honest mistakes had been made. I will move to circulate this amendment during the consideration in detail stage of this bill.


But first, I will speak about the bills as they are. Both schedules 1 and 2 within the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Reducing Illegal Early Release and Other Measures) Bill 2012 originated from recommendations of the Cooper review, which was handed down on the 30 June 2010, over 2½ years ago. Schedule 1 of this bill seeks to introduce civil and criminal penalties for promoters of schemes that result in or encourage illegal early release of superannuation.


Schedule 2 of the bill seeks to make superannuation roll-overs into self-managed superannuation funds subject to the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006. I note that this act already applies to APRA regulated superannuation funds, and that this is an extension to the self-managed super fund sector. The coalition views both of these initiatives as sensible policy measures. The early release of superannuation is only allowed under strictly limited circumstances. These circumstances include cases of severe financial hardship, total and permanent disability, temporary incapacity, terminal illness or permanent departure from Australia.


Schedule 3 of this bill seeks to amend the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, by introducing a range of administrative consequences for contraventions relating to self-managed superannuation funds. This has come about because there has been a view that the existing penalty regime available to the Commissioner of Taxation is limited in terms of its application to trustees of self-managed super funds. This schedule seeks to give the Commissioner rectification and education directions. The cost to government of providing these directions that are being made available to the Commissioner of Taxation comes in at $17.1 million over 5 years. This will be recouped by the government through increases it has made to the Self-Managed Superannuation Fund Supervisory Levy announced in MYEFO last year. The coalition has been critical of this increase in the levy, which saw it rise from $191 to $259. It will hit 480,000 self-managed superannuation funds, whilst raising $320 million over the forward estimates. The coalition will not oppose the measures contained within this schedule, but we are critical of the hike in the levy through which the Government has chosen to fund these measures.


The second bill, the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Unlawful Payments from Regulated Superannuation Funds) Bill 2012, seeks to impose a penalty rate of tax of 45 per cent for money unlawfully released early from a superannuation fund. This measure is also consistent with recommendations of the Cooper review. Rules in relation to the early access of superannuation are deliberately strict in order to prevent people from accessing retirement savings early.


Superannuation has always been a preferentially taxed savings vehicle in order to encourage Australians to invest in their own future retirement. This in turn relieves the pressure on government to provide for those who do not have the financial means to support themselves in retirement. To preserve this savings vehicle for its intended use, it is reasonable that penalties exist in order to prevent misuse, particularly given the concessional tax status of superannuation. The coalition wants to encourage as many Australians as possible to plan and save for their retirement and to take full advantage of the benefits that the superannuation system offers. This Labor government has not made life easy for many Australians planning their retirement and the spectre of further changes still hangs over their heads. The government's track record on superannuation has been one of taxation and fiddle, causing great uncertainty for those preparing for their retirement or relying heavily on their superannuation system for their income. 


Superannuation is becoming increasingly important as part of household wealth. There has now been about $1.5 trillion in superannuation funds under management—that is about the same as Australia's annual gross domestic product. That figure exceeds deposits with financial institutions, which are around $720 billion; it is much larger than direct shareholdings, at around $514 billion; there are also unfunded superannuation entitlements, at $353 billion. So superannuation assets and entitlements totalled $1.8 trillion within total wealth of households and unincorporated enterprises of $7.5 trillion. The superannuation industry, in large part, owes its success to government policy. The industry is boosted by the compulsory nature of superannuation contributions, currently at nine per cent—but legislated to increase to 12 per cent—and by concessional tax treatment afforded to savings in a superannuation fund.


There is only one measure from the MRRT package that a coalition government will keep, despite the enormous shortfall in forecast MRRT revenue, and that is the increase in compulsory superannuation from nine to 12 per cent. It was in this House that I also emphasised that employer funded superannuation contributions are in fact just that—funded by employers—and the government would do well not to overstate and exaggerate the reach of the MRRT measure in relation to the increased contribution rate. The coalition understands the importance of this measure to the Australian workers planning for their retirement and, in light of all the fiddles and changes to the Australian superannuation system over the past few years, we will not add additional confusion to this arising from reversing this particular measure. The coalition government will fund this measure from savings within the budget and not from a tax that hardly raises any revenue. 


Superannuation involves a trade-off with the government. Households are induced to lock up their savings until retirement and to forgo consumption today in return for concessional tax treatment. The benefit for the government is the greater financial self-sufficiency of people once they retire and the lower recourse to the government-funded pension system. The legislation before the House is to ensure that this system is upheld by preventing early and unlawful withdrawal of superannuation balances. The coalition supports this legislation before the House and believes that it is in the spirit of the compact between the government and the people. Having said that, I do not want to give the impression that the coalition is supportive of this government's constant fiddling, tinkering and threatening of additional taxation within the superannuation system—particularly of late as the government seems to eye this superannuation nest egg as a way of addressing its enormous budget shortfalls.


Many unexpected changes have been made to Australia's superannuation system by a government driven by the need for revenue to fund wasteful spending. What I find particularly disturbing is that this government seems to have a view that the superannuation industry is a cash cow, ready to be tapped when it sees fit to help fund its out-of-control budget and unrestrained expenditure. There has been a large reduction in the concessional superannuation caps, from $50,000 and $100,000 down to only $25,000, as well as freezing the relevant indexation on that cap. This is particularly of concern to the small business community and for those who may have a limited working life ahead of them, over which time they need to accumulate a retirement savings nest egg. I am frequently reminded by small business people, still reeling from the Labor government induced 'recession we had to have' in the nineties, that so much of their accumulated wealth—the very nest egg that they sought to rely upon for their retirement—was eroded over that time either by a reduction in the value of their business or by their business being forced to fold. Those people may have a limited window of their working life within which to accumulate a retirement nest egg that they can depend upon for the standard of living they hope to work for—and they feel they have worked for—right throughout their working life. So these reduction caps may, on the surface, seem to have some thought behind them if you look at them through the eyes of regular contributions throughout the adult working life of a superannuation saver, but that is not the journey of many Australian people—and it is particularly not the journey of those courageous men and women of small business, who may take the opportunity from a rare profitable year to provide handsomely for their retirement, in that year where they have that chance, realising that it is but a fraction of the nest egg they will require for a dignified retirement. 


There has also been a new supertax imposed on people earning more than $300,000 a year. Again, one needs to look at that over the working life of a person and not at a single snapshot as if that represents their entire working life. The government has only partly addressed the excessive penalties imposed by the ATO when people make inadvertent errors and breach their superannuation contributions cap. I will come back to that issue shortly and speak to some examples that I am very much aware of.


To make matters worse, there are fears that the government will again dip into superannuation in the forthcoming budget to help balance the books. There were rumours circulating widely throughout the media—and, some are suggesting, being planted by representatives of the government—over the past couple of weeks that the government plans to impose tax on the currently tax-free income flows from those aged 60 and above. It was as if they were testing the waters for this further tinkering and tax gouging on superannuation. Articles from the Australian newspaper suggested that these rumours have originated from the minister's own office, despite his repeated denials. After having tested the waters, the government had to rule out this threat given the protest that was building against such moves. Any further fiddling and changes would do nothing to build confidence in the superannuation system. Consumers and the industry need stability in policies and the certainty that the nest egg they are building will be there to fund a comfortable retirement. In recent days, the government has sought to attack the coalition over our intention to rescind another superannuation measure, the low-income superannuation tax offset, funded out of revenue from the MRRT—or should I say the anticipated, but not forthcoming, revenue from the MRRT.


I want to set the record straight on this. The tax offset was announced as part of the government's Minerals Resource Rent Tax package—the MRRT. The coalition has been on the record for a long time with our commitment to scrap the MRRT because it is a bad tax for Australia. Not only has it created sovereign risk implications in terms of our nation's attractiveness to foreign investors, but it is well short of its forecast. On Friday, we learnt that the government had collected $126 million, against a revenue forecast of $2 billion. The government's low-income superannuation tax offset measure, linked to the mining tax, is unfunded expenditure because of the MRRT's incapacity to bring in the revenue that the Treasurer not only forecast, but banked and spent well in advance of it actually materialising.


The coalition have been entirely transparent and upfront about our position on this tax offset. This stands in stark contrast to Labor, who promised there would be no changes to the superannuation arrangements before the 2007 election, and then reduced the government's superannuation co-contributions for low-income earners from $1,500 under the Howard government to just $500. This move stripped $3.3 billion out of low-income earners, a lot of whom would be working women. That is a salient point for this country's Prime Minister, I would have thought. Let us not forget that it is this Labor government that has hit Australians' savings with more than $8 billion in increased taxes on superannuation over the five years since coming to government. That is correct—$8 billion of increased taxes on superannuation imposed by these Labor governments over the five years since the election of Labor. The coalition will not be copping any lectures from Labor about superannuation.


I also waved around in a contribution last week what seemed to be a visual explanation of what 'not one jot, not one tittle' actually means. Those in this House and those listening to this broadcast might remind themselves of that assurance provided by Labor prior to the 2007 election. Kevin Rudd said superannuation would not be changed, 'not by one jot, not by one tiddle'. What we have found is there has been more than 50 substantial policy and legislative changes to superannuation since that assurance. So you can imagine why there is still anxiety in the superannuation sector, including those who are saving within superannuation and those who are dependent on superannuation for their revenue, about this reassurance that the payment out of super funds will not be taxed for people over the age of 60, a proposition that has been floated and then retracted in just the last fortnight.


The coalition will be supporting the measures contained within this bill. The changes are supported by industry and are expected, albeit a little late, following the handing down of the Hooper review over two-and-a-half years ago, but here they are and they will have the coalition's support. But as I stated at the outset, I will be looking to move an amendment. This will give the Australian Taxation Office discretion to allow taxpayers to correct inadvertent errors leading to excessive superannuation contributions breaching either concessional or non-concessional superannuation contribution caps. The reasons for these measures have been brought to my attention quite vividly, and I will outline them generally. The Australian tax office argues that it does not have the discretion to allow taxpayers to correct inadvertent errors that lead to a fine or punishment where there is an inadvertent breach of either the concessional or non-concessional superannuation contribution caps. Breaches of such caps attract extraordinarily large penalties, regardless of the circumstances. It is those circumstances that the coalition wishes to address. Some Australians have been forced to pay an effective tax rate of up to 93 per cent at times because of actions taken by others, completely out of their own control.


Today, the coalition is looking to address this problem. I will be moving amendments that seek to give the Australian tax commissioner discretion in a range of circumstances where individuals have made clearly inadvertent errors. In the consideration in detail stage, I will outline that our amendments seek to provide for that discretion, in cases where an individual has multiple employers and the cap is breached without any possibility of rectification; when the employer contribution is a few days earlier or later than expected; when unexpected bonus payments or redundancy payments impact on contributions; where salary sacrifice arrangements have not had caps altered or changed in time; where a late voluntary contribution is not processed until the following financial year; or where a taxpayer has received incorrect advice from a recognised tax adviser or other professional advisers. That will be the nature of the amendments I will be moving in my name at the detailed stage. I will explain in more detail, but simply with that overview I have provided, I hope that the House gets a sense that there are a number of quite inadvertent and unintentional circumstances which can give rise to an extraordinarily disproportionate fine or penalty as a result of the rigidity of the current law and the lack of discretion for the Australian tax commissioner to take account of the particular circumstances.


In closing, the coalition supports these two bills, but we will be moving an amendment to provide the discretion that the ATO needs to deal with inadvertent breaches.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (15:35):  In 1991, the then Prime Minister Paul Keating said of the superannuation guarantee:


It will make Australia a more equal place, a more egalitarian place and hence a more cohesive and happier place.


We do not often talk about happiness and superannuation in the same breath, but I think we should, because a strong superannuation system is a system that ensures dignity in retirement. It ensures that Australian retirees can enjoy that extra grey nomad trip and the comfort of being able to spend time with loved ones without worrying about paying the bills. It ensures that generations that have given much to Australia enjoy the retirement to which they are entitled.


Labor has always had a strong commitment to dignity in retirement. In 2009, we increased the pension—the biggest increase in the pension since its inception. That increase was worth $1,600 a year for singles on the full aged pension. Peter Whiteford from the University of New South Wales estimates that that knocked down the rate of poverty in Australia by about a fifth, from about 14 per cent down to about 11 per cent—one of the biggest decreases in poverty that we have seen. That came as a result of Labor's decision to raise the pension. That is the broad context for superannuation from this side of the house.


Alas, this has not been bipartisan. If we look to the Leader of the Opposition, he said once, 'Compulsory superannuation is one of the biggest con jobs ever foisted by government on the Australian people.' In 1995 he said, 'Compulsory superannuation is possibly the greatest confidence trick of the last decade.' It is in that spirit that we were not surprised when the Leader of the Opposition said on 23 March last year:


Well, we strongly oppose the superannuation increase. We have always as a coalition been against compulsory superannuation increases…


and that he said he would therefore oppose them. You can knock him for being wrong but not for being inconsistent. At least he was following true at that point to the things he had said about compulsory superannuation. But now it appears that the opposition have backflipped on superannuation. They say they will now be supporting the increase from nine to 12 per cent. They came into this place and voted against it. It is a phased increase until 2019, but those opposite will now apparently support the increase in superannuation—dragged kicking and screaming to the line—and are now unwilling to back down on this reform.


But you know where those opposite stand when they have the chance to speak out on superannuation. On the superannuation guarantee, Wilson Tuckey said that it was 'both stupid and dishonest'. Senator Alston said 'imposing compulsory superannuation on individuals does not increase total savings'—a statement clearly at odds with two recent Reserve Bank discussion papers. Senator Watson from the Liberal Party said 'unemployment is going to rise' from superannuation. Those opposite, in their heart of hearts, would really prefer that there was not a universal superannuation system. Just as they fought Medicare at its creation, so too they fought universal superannuation at its creation. Just as they have fought a series of progressive health measures, so too they have fought the increase in superannuation from nine to 12 per cent.


Today, although they may be saying that they are going to support the increase in universal superannuation, they are also going to raise the tax on the superannuation contributions of 3.6 million low-income Australians. That is about one in three workers, and they are the lowest paid workers in Australia. Nearly a third of workers are going to have their superannuation taxes increased by up to $500 a year under the opposition. Of course this is the same opposition who cried foul when the government imposed an additional 15 per cent tax on the superannuation contributions of those earning $300,000 or more in the last budget. That affected 128,000 people and some of the highest earning Australians. This, a measure which benefits 3.6 million of the lowest paid Australians, is a measure that the opposition will claw back.


The superannuation system on which dignity in retirement is founded is a Labor creation. It was Labor that put superannuation in place and has increased it from 9 to 12 per cent. It is Labor that introduced a low income superannuation contribution effective from 1 July last year. It is Labor has put in place a measure to implement a one-off refund of small excess concessional cap contributions breaches from 1 July 2011. Labor has put in place a higher concessional contributions cap for over-50s with low balances, and we have abolished the 70-year-old age limit on the superannuation guarantee. At the same time we are making the system more efficient and making the process of everyday transactions easier through new data and e-commerce standards, the use of tax file numbers as the primary locator of member accounts and facilitating account consolidation and electronic portability.


The Find My Super campaign that I ran locally with ACT MLA Chris Bourke helped link Canberrans to their superannuation. We can also do a lot through the Australian Taxation Office to make sure that your lost superannuation account finds you. Labor is working on those reforms. We have announced new rules to make superannuation simpler and more cost-effective through the MySuper reforms, which are grounded in the Cooper review. This recognises that choice architecture needs to operate in an environment where many people simply take the default fund and the default option within that fund. Defaults need to have high returns for individuals. The MySuper reforms see that put in place. They ensure that the defaults Australians receive are good defaults. I think this was a notion not well understood in the early 1990s. The emphasis then was very much on choice, but I think a lot of the research since then, particularly some of the studies coming out of behavioural economics, have told us that most people are not active managers of their retirement savings. They want rules that ensure good defaults, and that it what the MySuper reforms put in place. 


We are making sure that the directors of super funds are appropriately accountable for meeting their duties towards members. All of this is of a piece with ensuring that Australia can be a financial services hub and ensuring that Australia is a place where we encourage good money management in a way where we ensure that financial advisers are not conflicted and that they have good disclosure for their clients.


The consumer credit reforms we have put in place sit alongside the MySuper reforms in making sure that customers get a good deal, making sure we have a system that puts customers first.


To go to the specific provisions of the bill: the bill introduces civil and criminal sanctions for someone who promotes a scheme that has resulted or is likely to result in the illegal early release of superannuation benefits. At the moment, there are not those provisions available for promoters unless they are trustees of a fund. This ensures that those who would seek to benefit from the illegal early release of superannuation benefits can be punished.


The bill amends the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 to require that superannuation benefits that are rolled over into self-managed superannuation funds are captured as a designated service. That ensures that we take into account the risks of money laundering and financing of terrorism that can be associated with asset rollover and that we have the appropriate customer identification and reporting requirements to ensure that superannuation is not used for inappropriate ends.


The bill amends the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 to introduce administrative consequences for contraventions relating to self-managed superannuation funds. That gives the Commissioner of Taxation effective, flexible, proportionate power to address noncompliance with superannuation laws.


These reforms are essential if we are to ensure that the superannuation system remains a strong system which ensures good investment in Australia—we have seen the pool of assets grow to around the size of Australia's GDP. These reforms ensure that Australians have dignity in retirement.


I call on those opposite to change their commitment to scrapping the low-income superannuation contribution. They have argued that they are not going to support any measures that are linked to the mining tax, but we know that is not the case because, as soon as the breath was out of their mouths, they then said: 'Not the increase from nine to 12 per cent.' The increase from nine to 12 per cent is not small bickies. I understand that each percentage point is around $1 billion of forgone tax revenue for the government. So there is $3 billion sitting right there. 


My call to those opposite is: if they are going to support a good measure—increasing superannuation contributions from nine to 12 per cent—why not continue and support an equally good measure in bringing down the tax rate paid by the lowest income Australians on their superannuation contributions? It is a reform that follows the Henry review. The Henry review recommended the tax paid on superannuation contributions should be an individual's marginal tax rate minus 15 per cent. We have not gotten to precisely that, but we have recognised the wisdom of the Henry review's recommendation that superannuation taxation should not be a flat tax, that it should be lower for lower income Australians. So we have brought down the tax rate to zero for 3.6 million Australians.


I call on those opposite to support that measure. It is a good measure. It improves dignity in retirement and it improves dignity for lower income Australians, who are disproportionately female workers. As we know, women earn lower wages in the Australian labour market, for a range of reasons—from industry, to discrimination, to career breaks. Women in the Australian workforce earn less and, as a result, have lower superannuation balances. These 3.6 million Australians, disproportionately women, are benefiting from the low-income superannuation contribution. If the coalition were to come to government and scrap it, they would be raising taxes on a group of low-income earners, disproportionately women.


This is as good a measure, in my view, as the increased superannuation contribution. It is an important equity measure and it is an important measure to ensure that Australians in their retirement have the independence to be able to travel, to spend time with loved ones, to enjoy a good retirement. I hope that sense prevails, that the Liberal Party, which has traditionally been deeply suspicious of universal superannuation—since the very inception of universal superannuation—can now see its way to support recommendations coming out of the Henry review that low-income Australians pay less tax. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (15:50):  I am very pleased to rise to speak on the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Unlawful Payments from Regulated Superannuation Funds) Bill 2012 and the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Reducing Illegal Early Release and Other Measures) Bill 2012. The purpose of these bills is to increase penalties for those involved in the unlawful early release of superannuation moneys. These bills, in a sense, go to the bargain which exists between the Commonwealth and its citizens in relation to superannuation. The bargain is that the Commonwealth says to citizens, 'We will provide you with tax concessions to assist you to save and build up a balance that will provide for you in retirement,' and, in exchange, your part of the bargain as a citizen is that you will use the money only for the designated purpose of providing for your retirement. Hence, efforts to, for example, release the funds early are breaching that bargain, and that is, it would appear, the rationale for the measures in the bill today. 


However, there is one aspect of the bargain which the Commonwealth is not doing a very good job of keeping. Indeed, the Commonwealth has, quite frankly, breached its side of the bargain when it comes to the situation of citizens who, in good faith, make contributions into their superannuation fund and find themselves inadvertently paying extremely high rates of tax—as high as 93 per cent—when they inadvertently breach what are highly technical and complex rules.


The result is that money, which has been paid in by the citizen in reliance on the bargain with the Commonwealth with the intention of saving money to provide for that citizen's retirement, is in fact seized by the government and put into general tax revenue. Regrettably, and quite extraordinarily, the Rudd-Gillard Labor government has been content to let this situation fester for years while collecting tens of millions of dollars in tax revenue in excess contributions tax each year—much of that revenue collected essentially by tricking citizens. That is why the coalition has moved an amendment to this bill which is designed to fix this problem—which is designed to prevent citizens being tricked into paying punitive rates of taxation on monies which they thought were going to contribute towards their retirement income.


I would like to speak to the amendment and I want to make three points in the brief time available to me this afternoon. Firstly, I want to point out that the current rules are unfair and capricious in the way they operate. Secondly, I want to highlight the fact that the Rudd-Gillard Labor government has allowed this situation to fester for a number of years and has grabbed at revenue which has been received from citizens under a misunderstanding. An inadvertent error by citizens has led to them paying excessive rates of tax. Thirdly, the coalition, in the amendment we are moving to the bill this afternoon, are proposing an effective and workable solution to this problem.


Let me turn, firstly, to the proposition that the current rules are unfair and capricious in the way that they apply to citizens. When you state that a particular payment could attract a rate of tax of up to 93 per cent, most Australians would be very, very surprised. They would be particularly surprised to learn that you can be subject to a tax of up to 93 per cent, not because you have made a deliberate attempt to obtain benefits to which you are not entitled but because, through inadvertent error—and in some cases through factors which are wholly beyond your control, as I will go on to explain—payments have been made, in some cases, just days before 30 June or days after 30 June, with the result that the total amount being paid in a particular financial year exceeds an arbitrary limit and then very, very high rates of tax can apply. Let me explain how this can occur. The starting point is that the limit on concessional contributions into superannuation is $25,000 a year. I note that this contribution limit has dropped very, very sharply in the five-and-a-bit years of the Rudd-Gillard government. For many citizens it was $100,000; it is now $25,000. Of course, that sharp and continuing reduction in contribution limits has been a factor in leading many citizens to be confused and surprised and to find themselves inadvertently in a position where they have breached the contribution limits. The Rudd-Gillard government's poor administration of the contribution limits has been a factor in many citizens finding themselves caught up in this mess.


The second thing that happens is that, if you make contributions which are intended to be in contact concessional contributions but exceed the $25,000 limit, then further contributions are treated as incurring the excess concessional contributions tax of 31.5 per cent. They then fall into your non-concessional contributions limit which is $150,000 in one year or $450,000 over three years. The risk is that, if you are already at your non-concessional contributions limit, then any dollar over the $25,000 which fails to be treated as a concessional contribution picks up additional tax because you have also exceeded the non-concessional limit. I think you will agree it is crystal clear. Even as I explain it, it is very easy to see how Australians can inadvertently find themselves breaching these highly complex and technical rules. This is the situation that a disturbingly large number of people find themselves facing.


The key point is: you can breach these rules through no fault of your own, because, if a payment that you thought was going to be made by your employer by 30 June of a particular financial year ends up being made on 1 or 2 July, thus falling into the next financial year, you can trip-wire these limits in that next financial year. There is a whole range of circumstances in which, for reasons wholly outside of your control, you can end up as an employee breaching these contribution limits. One situation is where an individual has multiple employers and the cap is breached without any possibility of rectification. Another possibility is where an employer contribution is a few days earlier or later than expected. There can also be the situation of unexpected bonus payments or redundancy payments. So you might have developed a strategy to contribute up to the $25,000 limit and no more, but then, unexpectedly, you are made redundant, a redundancy payment comes in during the financial year and then you are suddenly rocketing through that contribution limit and that money, which ought to be your money, is being seized as a very large percentage in tax. Of course, another possibility is if a late voluntary contribution you intend to have made in this financial year is not processed by the superannuation fund or by your financial institutional until the following financial year. As I have explained, the consequence of any one of these highly technical errors and errors which are made for reasons which, in many cases, are outside of the control of the citizen—outside of the control of the taxpayer—can lead to you being hit with tax of up to 93 per cent. That is, on any view, completely unreasonable and unacceptable.


You would have thought that merely explaining this problem would immediately create, in any government, an urgency to fix it. You would have thought that no government would want to be in the position where it was, in essence, collecting taxes from its citizens by trickery. But, remarkably, the Rudd-Gillard Labor government has made no serious attempt to fix this problem. Let us just look at the scale of this problem. In the 2008-09 financial year, 35,000 Australians breached the contribution rules. By 2010-11 it was 50,954, and by 2011-12 it was 66,435 Australians paying excess contributions tax—in many cases due to inadvertent error. And that dramatic increase from 35,000 to 66,000 in three years is undoubtedly related to the fact that the Rudd-Gillard Labor government has systematically reduced contribution limits, all the while incidentally, telling Australians they were going to be doing the opposite—all the while telling Australians that the reduction to $25,000 was only temporary and that for those above 50 their contribution limits would not be maintained at a low level.


The Labor government, it is true, in 2010 passed some legislation which was designed to give the commissioner a certain degree of discretion to deal with this matter. But the degree of discretion is extremely limited. It is only available in respect of excess contributions of up to $10,000. What the commissioner says is that citizens or taxpayers in that situation may be eligible for a once-only offer to have their contributions withdrawn from their fund, added to their assessable income and taxed at the marginal rate.


Why such a piecemeal solution has been proffered by the present government is difficult to understand unless we recognise the troubling possibility that this government is so desperate for revenue that it is willing to collect tax revenue by trickery. And in 2011-12 the Rudd-Gillard government raised $174 million in excess contributions tax. It is clear that in significant measure some of this money has effectively been tricked out of ordinary Australians seeking to comply with the fiendishly complex rules governing contributions and contribution limits, and have found themselves—for reasons in many cases beyond their control—paying tax on their contributions, of up to 93 per cent. 


Now, the Rudd-Gillard government has been content to let this situation fester. The coalition is putting forward an amendment which is designed to fix this problem; it is designed to end this tawdry behaviour, on the part of the present government, of essentially taxing Australians through trickery.


The proposed provisions in our amendment would add new subsections to the existing section 292-465 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. They would authorise the commissioner to make a determination to reverse contributions where a taxpayer has made an inadvertent error and would allow the commissioner to consider, in determining whether to exercise his discretion, several factors that typically have caused taxpayers to make these kinds of inadvertent errors. For example, having more than one employer is the first factor set out in the proposed subsection 292-465(6A) and then whether contributions were made by the taxpayer's employer at a time that was earlier than the time the taxpayer expected; whether they were made at a time that was later; whether the taxpayer received an unexpected bonus payment that had an impact on the amount of his or her contributions, and a range of other factors, which, experience tells us, have led thousands of Australians to find themselves paying excess tax for reasons which are beyond their control—reasons which they could not take into account. I repeat, in 2011-12, 66,435 taxpayers paid an excess contributions tax. So this is a large and growing problem—a problem that the Rudd-Gillard government has been quite happy to let fester. 


Will this measure have a budgetary impact? Potentially it will. I have indicated that the revenue collected in the last full financial year was $174 million. But if the reduction in revenue occurs because Australians are no longer being tricked by their government into paying an excess contributions tax of up to 93 per cent because of their failure to comply with technical and complex rules, and in many cases exacerbated by factors beyond their control such as the timing of payments from their employer—if the reduction in revenue occurs because that kind of trickery is no longer able to be perpetrated by the Commonwealth on its citizens—then that is a reduction in revenue that this parliament ought to welcome. 


And it would be a shocking thing indeed if the Rudd-Gillard government were to say to the people of Australia, 'We are quite happy to keep raising revenue, to keep taxing through trickery.' That would be a shocking thing indeed. And unless that is what the Rudd-Gillard government wants to say to the people of Australia, then I cannot see any reason why the government would not support this amendment which the coalition has moved, which is designed to ensure that Australians no longer find themselves in that position, through inadvertently breaching highly technical and complex rules and being taxed at up to 93 per cent on money that they thought they were setting aside to provide for their retirement. I commend this amendment to the House.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2013-02-11,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (16:05):  We are debating a bill to amend our legislation in respect of superannuation. The Labor Party's superannuation policy has an important public policy purpose, and that is to build a pool of individual and national retirement savings so that individuals can retire with some dignity and some income security, and also to provide some relief for future generations in respect of pension payments and meeting the challenges of an aging demographic.


In respect of this the government provides a tax concession on contributions and earnings for moneys going into the fund and the earnings of the fund. You would have to say that on any fair analysis the policy is working. We have over $1.4 trillion in retirement savings invested superannuation accounts around the country. This is close to the fourth-largest pool of superannuation funding anywhere in the world.


It should be the case that early access to superannuation is only available in extremely limited circumstances. By 'early access' I mean prior to retirement. In the cases of severe hardship or other very limited circumstances the trustees of funds may allow early access to this funds and they do not receive high levels of taxation penalties as a result. 


Unfortunately, a number of individuals promote illegal early-release schemes. The superannuation system review recommended that the government take action to reduce the illegal early release of super, and the two bills before the House today are aimed at addressing just that. Schedule 1 of the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Reducing Illegal Early Release and Other Measures) Bill 2012 provides for civil and criminal penalties for those who promote the legal early release of super. The Income Tax Rates Amendment (Unlawful Payments from Regulated Superannuation Funds) Bill 2012, the ITR bill, amends the law to ensure that superannuation benefits pulled out as part of some illegal early release are taxed at 45 per cent.


Schedule 1 to the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Reducing Illegal Early Release and Other Measures) Bill 2012 amends the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act to introduce civil and criminal sanctions for a person who promotes a scheme that has resulted, or is likely to result, in the illegal early release of superannuation benefits. The government's super system review found that stronger sanctions must exist to deter the promoters of illegal early-release schemes from undermining the government's retirement policy and, in addition, harming members in the process. The review found evidence of promoters who were pushing these schemes charging very high commissions for convincing sometimes unwitting investors to roll their money over from a compliance scheme into one of these early-release schemes and taking as high as 50 per cent in commission—unconscionable behaviour that should be condemned by all members in this place.


Currently, there are no specific penalties for the promoters of illegal early-release schemes who are not themselves trustees of a regulated superannuation fund. Often the promoter will not be a trustee of a purported superannuation fund used in a scheme but instead recruits other parties for the role. This measure delivers on the government's announcement that it would introduce penalties to deter the promotion of these sorts of schemes. It will allow the commissioner to seek civil and criminal penalties for those who promote these early-release schemes. The review also found that those individuals who gain illegal early access to their superannuation benefits should not enjoy the same tax treatment as that which is designed to promote that public policy purpose. The review recommended that amounts released by illegal means should be subject to the superannuation fund non-complying tax rate of 45 per cent.


The Income Tax Rates Amendment (Unlawful Payments from Regulated Superannuation Funds) Bill 2012, being considered in cognate with the first bill, imposes the superannuation non-complying fund rate of 45 per cent on those amounts that are released early by illegal means. These measures will ensure strong sanctions are in place to deter the illegal early release of superannuation.


Schedule 2 to the bill amends the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 to require that superannuation benefits that are rolled over into self-managed superannuation funds are captured as a designated service. The super system review noted that, since trustees and members of SMSFs are generally the same, there is greater scope for assets once received in the self-managed superannuation fund to be diverted for an illicit purpose. By capturing rollovers into self-managed superannuation funds as a designated service under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006, the transferring superannuation fund will have to comply with a range of obligations, including customer identification requirements and reporting obligations. This measure will ensure that consideration is given to the money-laundering and terrorism-financing risk associated with the rollover of assets to a self-managed superannuation fund.


Schedule 3 to the bill amends the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 to introduce administrative consequences for contraventions relating to self-managed superannuation funds. The super system review found that the Commissioner of Taxation, as regulator of self-managed funds, needs to have effective, flexible and proportionate powers to address noncompliance with the superannuation laws. Currently, the commissioner has a very limited number of tools available to address instances of noncompliance. The review acknowledged the benefits that the current penalty regime provides to deal with and deter noncompliance; however, it highlighted some areas of the current regime which limit the commissioner's ability to achieve optimal regulation.


Applying the current penalties can be costly and time consuming, and the potential consequences can be disproportionately high. The absence of graduated penalties results in a number of self-managed superannuation fund trustees avoiding sanction for contravening conduct by simply rectifying the conduct when it is detected. This may be appropriate in some circumstances, but it is not appropriate if the trustees can continue to contravene the law and therefore their actions simply have no consequences. The review recommended that the commissioner be given additional tools, both educational and punitive, in conjunction with existing powers. These tools will support the ongoing integrity of the superannuation system. This measure delivers another stronger super reform for self-managed superannuation funds.


On this side of the House, we have a strong commitment to Australia's superannuation system. It was, after all, the Australian Labor Party that built the system and added to it. We built it over the vehement opposition of the coalition, who have never been supporters of occupational superannuation. They see it as some form of socialist plot. Every time we have had the opportunity to bring into this place measures which advance the capacity of workers to add to their retirement savings, those measures have been met with vehement opposition by those on the other side of the House.


But this government is increasing its commitment to workers' superannuation, particularly by increasing the superannuation guarantee. Those from the coalition parties really did deserve an award in hypocrisy when, in previous weeks, they raised questions and tried to speculate about what might be in the forthcoming budget when it came to workers' superannuation when they themselves, only months earlier, had opposed measures to lift the superannuation guarantee from nine per cent to 12 per cent. This measure alone will boost the retirement savings of 8.4 million Australians by about $85 billion over 10 years and add about $500 billion to our pool of retirement savings by 2035. That means around $118,000 to the retirement superannuation balance for an average worker who is 30 years old today.


Labor's super reforms also provide an annual contribution of up to $500 into the superannuation accounts of workers earning less than $37,000. This is a measure that came into effect on 1 July last year. It will enable workers aged between 70 and 74 to receive contributions for the very first time since the introduction of compulsory superannuation. This is a measure that will come into effect from 1 July this year. It also creates a new low-cost superannuation product called MySuper. Again, this is a measure that will come into effect from 1 July 2013.


In stark contrast, the coalition have confirmed that they would re-impose a 15 per cent tax on Australia's lowest paid workers—that is, those earning below $37,000 per annum. This group of people includes 2.1 million working women. The opposition leader announced at the National Press Club recently that, if elected, the coalition would abolish the low-income superannuation contribution. That is, those workers earning over $37,000 a year who are currently having $500 per year diverted into their accounts by the federal Labor government, adding to their retirement income, will have that reversed—stopped, knocked on the head—if the Leader of the Opposition ever becomes Prime Minister of this country.


The coalition policy constitutes a superannuation tax increase of up to $500 on every Australian worker earning below $37,000. If you just think about it for a moment, their policy is to abolish our policy of increasing the tax-free threshold—nearly tripling the tax-free threshold—up to $18½ thousand, so that nobody earning less than $18½ thousand pays income tax. On top of that, they are going to whack these workers' superannuation by another $500 per annum in additional taxation. It is quite clear to see where their priorities lie, and it is reflected in the focus of their contribution on this legislation.


The purpose of the low-income superannuation contribution is to effectively refund the tax that is paid by low-income earners on their concessional superannuation contributions, including the superannuation guarantee of up to $500 per annum. Because of their lower income tax rate, lower income earners otherwise do not get the same concessional benefits as workers on higher incomes do. They do not have access to a whole heap of the benefits that higher income earners may have when it comes to minimising their tax arrangements through superannuation contributions.


Treasury analysis says that there are around about 3.6 million workers earning less than $37,000 per annum—so it is not a small group of people—including, in my own state, around 1.1 million workers who would be affected by this retrograde change. That is roughly three out of every 10 workers in Australia. So, far from decreasing taxes and increasing retirement savings of Australians, the coalition—led by the member for Warringah—would go into the election opposing the low-income superannuation contribution while also opposing our policy of raising the superannuation guarantee from nine to 12 per cent. It also immediately destroys the coalition's so-called commitment earlier in the week to make no changes to the superannuation system. The re-imposition of a $1 billion per year tax on 3.6 million workers is an unexpected, unfortunate and dramatic change by any assessment.


If Australians want to ensure that they have decent policy protecting their retirement incomes, they should support members in their electorates who support the sort of legislation such as that before the House today, and the party that brought occupational superannuation to the Australian people. I commend the legislation to the House.

"Van Manen, Bert, MP",LP,2013-02-11,"



Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde) (16:20):  It is always wonderful to hear the contribution from the member for Throsby but, as is usual for this government, there was nothing new or constructive to add to the debate.


I rise to speak today on the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Unlawful Payments from Regulated Superannuation Funds) Bill 2012 and the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Reducing Illegal Early Release and Other Measures) Bill 2012. From my experience in the financial planning and superannuation industry before entering this place, these bills are based on the sound recommendations that have come out of the Cooper review. Although that review was brought down some 2½ years ago, it is heartening to see that some steps continue to be made to introduce some of those recommendations that have been very rightly made to preserve and enhance the integrity of our superannuation system.


The bills in essence are designed to reduce the incidence of illegal early withdrawals from superannuation and to impose some realistic penalties on those people who seek to illegally withdraw funds early. It is also worthwhile to note that there are some provisions within the legislation for the early release of super, but it is strictly controlled and under limited circumstances, such as severe financial hardship, total and permanent disablement, temporary incapacity, terminal illness or permanent departure from Australia. These rules have been made deliberately strict because there is an agreement inherent in the structure of superannuation that it is there for the long term for people's retirement, and the consequence is that you get a concessional tax rate for having your money not available until you retire at age 55, 60 or 65.


The Income Tax Rates Amendment (Unlawful Payments from Regulated Superannuation Funds) Bill imposes a penalty tax rate of 45 per cent for money unlawfully released early from a superannuation fund. Forty-five per cent is the current superannuation non-complying tax rate, so it fits in with current regulatory structures. This was recommended by the Cooper review for simplicity and to reflect the top marginal tax rate.


The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Reducing Illegal Early Release and Other Measures) Bill introduces civil and criminal penalties for promoters of schemes that result in or encourage illegal release of superannuation. It also makes superannuation rollovers into self-managed funds subject to the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act.


This range of measures was again recommended in the Cooper review. The anti-money laundering act also applies to APRA-regulated funds and this extends the application to funds being rolled over from an APRA fund to a self-managed super fund. It requires the people involved to be identified to ensure or lower the risk of money laundering and terrorism financing. This ability to use the safe harbour procedures will mean that transferring funds will not have to collect and verify the full range of customer information.


Superannuation is taxed at a preferential rate to encourage people to save for their retirement. This goal is undermined if people illegally access superannuation savings early, and it is also undermined if money released illegally goes in whole or in part as fees to promoters of these illegal schemes, or is channelled into other illegal activities. The measures contained in these bills are broadly supported across the superannuation industry and would not be opposed by the coalition.


There are other issues that also need addressing within the superannuation environment. A large and increasing number of Australians are confronted with excessive and disproportionate tax penalties as a result of genuinely inadvertent errors leading to voluntary superannuation contributions in excess of either their concessional or non-concessional contribution caps. Some Australians have, in effect, been forced to pay an effective tax rate of up to 93 per cent at times, and these actions have been taken completely out of their control by others. This is why we on the coalition side seek to introduce an amendment to give the tax office some discretion to allow those penalties not to be enforced in the event of an inadvertent breach of the regulations. It can be as simple as a contribution being paid at or near the end of June being processed by the superannuation fund early in the new financial year, when it related to that previous financial year. In the following financial year they make their $25,000 contribution, but because the carryover of the previous contribution—or because it was processed in the new financial year—those two amounts are added together and consequently, inadvertently, those people have breached those contributions caps. The coalition proposes to move an amendment to give the ATO discretion to allow taxpayers to correct those inadvertent errors. As the member for Bradfield rightly pointed out, there are some 66,000 Australians who have been caught in that position over the past financial year and they have paid some $174 million in excess super contributions tax, none of which goes to assisting them in accumulating superannuation benefits for their retirement.


The reason for putting this amendment in is that the ATO argues that they do not currently have this discretion, and these inadvertent errors, for example, can occur where an individual has multiple employers and the cap is breached without any possibility of rectification. An employer contribution may be paid a few days earlier or later than expected, and unexpected bonus payments or redundancy payments can also impact on the contributions. Where salary sacrifice arrangements are in place they similarly can have an impact if caps are altered and not changed in time. Before my time in this place I saw that occur firsthand on a number of occasions. We had to quickly review and ensure that clients who were on salary sacrifice arrangements made those adjustments to the salary sacrifice arrangements to avoid getting caught with changes to these contribution limits. The tax penalties involved are clearly excessive, delivering a tax rate of up to 93 per cent.


This measure should have no impact on the budget as the government should not have been planning its budget revenue estimates based on the assumption that people saving to achieve a self-funded retirement will make inadvertent errors and be taxed at up to 93 per cent on their retirement savings. Taxpayers in this situation who are doing the right thing by saving more voluntarily to achieve a self-funded retirement and take the pressure off the public purse, as a result are currently being unfairly and disproportionately penalised.


In the coalition amendments, guidance is given to the commissioner about the circumstances in which the discretion should be exercised. This is a discretion that should be exercised when the excess contributions are the result of inadvertent errors. Can this government stand up and state in good conscience that their forward estimates are based on the assumption that they will take money from people who have made inadvertent mistakes? Given that the government speakers on these bills have been loudly proclaiming the superannuation framework, the fact that they were responsible for introducing superannuation and the fact that they want people to accumulate funds for retirement—a notion that we on this side absolutely support—it is perfectly reasonable for us to ask the government to give the ATO this discretion.


We know that the government needs all the tax revenue that it can get its hands on. That is not because the people of Australia have done the wrong thing over the past five years; it is because we have a government whose profligate spending has created a situation in which it needs to find money in every single nook, cranny and crevice that it can.


When we take a longer term view and consider that we have an ageing population and an ever-increasing call on government resources in a wide variety of areas, and are faced with a government whose only inclination is to continue to tax the very people with the capacity to provide wholly or at least significantly for themselves, the cruel irony is that the very people we should assist and provide a hand up to lose out. This is because we have a government that creates hurdles and disincentives to saving via super for those who want to plan for a self-sufficient retirement. The government applies ridiculously low concessional limits to superannuation while at the same time increases taxes on those who have already done the right thing by seeking to become self-funded in their retirement.


Self-funded retirement is the ideal outcome for any retirement income strategy. The more people who are either fully or partially self-funded, the more funds that are available to assist those who do not have the capacity to fund their own retirement. That is the risk with the short-term nature of some of the decisions made by this government to prop up its budget revenue because of its profligate spending. It appears that this government simply does not understand this. Over the past five years, some $8 billion has been withdrawn from the superannuation system through higher taxes under this government.


I genuinely hope that we are able to see a superannuation system that maintains its integrity and strength for the long term and that the government is not seeking to profiteer further from future self-funded retirees through the proposals set out in these bills that apply to people who inadvertently exceed their contribution limits and finish up potentially paying up to 93 per cent in taxes.

Mr GRIFFIN
 (Bruce) (16:33):  It is a pleasure to follow on from a speaker such as my friend the member for Forde. We often spend some time together on a Thursday morning endeavouring to try and get fit, remembering what we were—well, at least what he was—once like many years ago when it came to the question of sport. I am consistent. I am as bad as I was then: still pretty bad.


This legislation makes a series of amendments to our superannuation law. Schedule 1 of the legislation implements the government's reforms relating to penalties for illegal early release schemes as part of the Stronger Super reforms. The bills will introduce civil and criminal penalties for persons who promote schemes for the illegal early release of superannuation benefits.


Schedule 2 of the legislation allows rollovers to self-managed superannuation funds from regulated superannuation funds that are not SMSFs to be captured as a designated service under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006. This amendment will ensure that consideration is given to the money laundering and terrorism financing risks associated with the rollover of assets to an SMSF and that appropriate customer identification and reporting obligations exist when assets exit the prudentially regulated superannuation sector.


Schedule 3 of the legislation provides for administrative consequences for trustees of self-managed superannuation funds by given the Commissioner of Taxation the power to issue education and rectification directions and impose administrative penalties for contraventions of the Superannuation Industry Supervision Act 1993 and the superannuation industry supervision regulations. These amendments will provide the Commissioner of Taxation with effective, flexible and cost-effective mechanisms to deal with non-compliance with the law.


The ITR bill introduces the superannuation fund non-complying rate of 45 per cent to amounts released by illegal means. The Commissioner of Taxation retains the discretion to determine that it is unreasonable to subject amounts released by illegal means to the 45 per cent rate, having regard to the nature of the fund and the circumstances of release.


Superannuation is an incredibly important part of the financial system for the future of generations of Australians, now and in the future. It is a system that the Labor government has been proud to support over the last 20-plus years and is proud to support at this time. It is an important part of the future security of generations as they get older. I commend the bills to the House.

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (16:36):  Firstly, I would like to thank those members who have contributed to this debate, including the eloquent words of the member for Bruce. Schedule 1 to the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Reducing Illegal Early Release and Other Measures) Bill 2012 introduces civil and criminal sanctions for a person who promotes a scheme that has resulted, or is likely to result, in the illegal early release of superannuation benefits. The Income Tax Rates Amendments (Unlawful Payments from Regulated Superannuation Funds) Bill 2012 imposes the superannuation non-complying fund rate of 45 per cent on those amounts that are released early by illegal means. These measures will further deter promoters of illegal early release scheme from undermining the government's retirement policy and harming members in the process. 


Schedule 2 to the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Reducing Illegal Early Release and Other Measures) Bill 2012 amends the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act to require that superannuation benefits that are rolled over into self-managed superannuation funds are captured as a designated service. This requirement will assist in reducing the risk that superannuation benefits that are rolled over for self-managed superannuation funds are used for illicit purposes. 


Schedule 3 amends the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 to introduce administrative consequences for contraventions relating to self-managed superannuation funds. This measure will give the Commissioner of Taxation, as regulator of self-managed superannuation funds, effective flexible and proportionate powers to address non-compliance with the superannuation laws. These tools will support the ongoing integrity of the superannuation system, and I commend these bills to the House.

   Insert:


   (6A) In making a determination for the purpose of paragraph 292‑465(3)(b), the Commissioner may consider the following circumstances when considering whether the taxpayer made an inadvertent error:


   (a) whether the taxpayer has more than one employer;


   (b) whether contributions were made by the taxpayer's employer, at a time that was earlier than the time that the taxpayer expected;


(c) whether contributions were made by the taxpayer's employer, at a time that was later than the time that the taxpayer expected;


   (d) whether the taxpayer received an unexpected bonus payment that had an impact upon the amount of his or her contributions;


(e) whether the taxpayer received a redundancy payment that had an impact upon the amount of his or her contributions;


   (f) whether the amount of the *concessional contributions caps changed at a time after the taxpayer had entered into a salary sacrifice arrangement;


(g) whether the taxpayer's contributions for a *financial year were processed by the *complying superannuation plan at a time after the end of the financial year;


   (h) whether the taxpayer received incorrect advice from a *recognised tax adviser or other professional adviser on whose advice it was reasonable for the taxpayer to rely;


(i) any other circumstance that the Commissioner considers appropriate.


As I outlined in my second reading speech contribution, whilst the coalition is supportive of the measures contained within this bill, we have sought to highlight a particular area of concern that relates to excessive penalties that may arise from inadvertent breaches of some of the rules we have debated in these bills. The Australian Tax Office argues that it does not have the discretion to allow taxpayers to correct inadvertent errors which lead to the breaching of either concessional or non-concessional superannuation contribution caps. Breaches of such caps attract large penalties, and we outlined the significant effective rate of penalty in my second reading speech which highlighted the potentially disproportionate nature of these penalties. Some Australians are being forced to pay an effective tax rate of up to 93 per cent at times, because of actions taken by others completely out of their control. Today the coalition is looking to address this problem and I urge all members in the House, particularly the crossbench members of the House, to embrace this very constructive and positive initiative.


I am moving these amendments as they seek to give the Commissioner of Taxation discretion in a range of circumstances where individuals have clearly made inadvertent errors. I am hopeful my colleague, the member from Tasmania, is listening intently to this very persuasive contribution about why he should support the government's amendments. The member for Denison would be very interested to know that these inadvertent errors include where an individual has multiple employers and the cap is breached without any possibility of rectification; where an employer contribution is a few days earlier or later than expected; where unexpected bonus payments or redundancy payments impact on their contributions; or where salary sacrifice arrangements have not had caps altered or changed in time. Also, examples include where a late voluntary contribution is not processed until the following financial year, or where a taxpayer has received incorrect advice from recognised tax advisers or other professional advisers where it was reasonable for the taxpayer to rely on such advice.


I have spoken in this House previously about the unusual nature where the contribution caps operate for a financial year. Yet, in the case of a small business or an employee wishing to make voluntary contributions, they might need to wait to see what their end-of-year financial position is and therefore their capability to contribute for the financial year in question, only to find that the actual payment happens in the subsequent financial years. Therefore, accrual accounting applies to the calculation of their ability to contribute, but cash accounting applies to the date on which that payment is made. I have had examples of this very case in my electorate where—much to the chagrin of the tax commissioner and the government minister responsible for this area—there has been some hand wringing about an inability to vary the penalties that were applied where an individual, through no mischief or intent to do the wrong thing, simply got caught up in this difference between accrual and cash accounting and has been hit with substantial penalties and a real disincentive for them to do the very thing we are trying to encourage, which is to make provision for their own retirement.


The government should not be profiting from Australians who have made inadvertent errors. It serves no good purpose and has no policy justification in terms of enforcement or in term of some kind of punishment that would cause people to behave differently when the behaviour was quite inadvertent in its own right. I am sure the member for Denison has found these arguments absolutely compelling and I urge him on behalf of his voters to join with the coalition on these measures. Taxpayers in this situation who are doing the right thing by saving more to achieve a self-funded retirement and take the pressure of the public purse are currently being unfairly and disproportionately penalised. All we are asking is that the tax commissioner have the discretion to take into account the various factors outlined in the amendment. 


I wonder whether the minister in all good conscience could stand up and say it is appropriate to take money from people that have made an inadvertent mistake in seeking to do what we encourage them to do, and that is to provide for their own retirement. I move the amendments circulated in Mr Hockey's name and urge the House to embrace these very constructive and positive amendments to these bills before the House.

Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (16:44):  Having only just become aware that amendments are being put before the House, it is difficult, when there has not been any process of discussion beforehand, to make pretty quick judgements. I would ask for some consideration of the House—either across the table or through any other ways—to allow some time for discussion about these amendments. If not, it will be pretty difficult to support amendments on spec. I leave that up to those at the table to make some decisions.


Likewise, I would also welcome any advice from the Chair in regard to whether there are any problem whatsoever in regard to the status of the amendments being put before the House on questions of money bills and their being introduced from non-government MPs. I do not think there are any problems, but because this has only just come before me as part of the consideration, that advice would be worthy.


So, if agreement can be reached and a little bit of time can be bought that would be appreciated. If not, it is pretty difficult to support something that has only just landed on the table before me, which would be disappointing if this does have some good content in it.

Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley) (15:17):  Thank you, Speaker, and well done on explaining the title of this legislation! It is quite a whopper and I hope those listening will persevere. I rise to speak on the government's Income Tax Rates Amendment (Unlawful Payments from Regulated Superannuation Funds) Bill 2012 and Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Reducing Illegal Early Release and Other Measures) Bill 2012. It just rolls off the tongue, doesn't it! I am sure we could have come up with a catchy acronym there! The bills before the House seek to reduce the incidence of illegal early withdrawal of superannuation.


Before speaking to the bills, I would like to foreshadow to the House that on behalf of the coalition I will be seeking to move an amendment to this bill, which gives the Australian Taxation Office discretion to allow taxpayers to correct inadvertent errors leading to excess superannuation contributions breaching either concessional or non-concessional superannuation contribution caps. This amendment would give the ATO the option to remedy excessive and disproportionate tax penalties where it believed honest mistakes had been made. I will move to circulate this amendment during the consideration in detail stage of this bill.


But first, I will speak about the bills as they are. Both schedules 1 and 2 within the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Reducing Illegal Early Release and Other Measures) Bill 2012 originated from recommendations of the Cooper review, which was handed down on the 30 June 2010, over 2½ years ago. Schedule 1 of this bill seeks to introduce civil and criminal penalties for promoters of schemes that result in or encourage illegal early release of superannuation.


Schedule 2 of the bill seeks to make superannuation roll-overs into self-managed superannuation funds subject to the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006. I note that this act already applies to APRA regulated superannuation funds, and that this is an extension to the self-managed super fund sector. The coalition views both of these initiatives as sensible policy measures. The early release of superannuation is only allowed under strictly limited circumstances. These circumstances include cases of severe financial hardship, total and permanent disability, temporary incapacity, terminal illness or permanent departure from Australia.


Schedule 3 of this bill seeks to amend the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, by introducing a range of administrative consequences for contraventions relating to self-managed superannuation funds. This has come about because there has been a view that the existing penalty regime available to the Commissioner of Taxation is limited in terms of its application to trustees of self-managed super funds. This schedule seeks to give the Commissioner rectification and education directions. The cost to government of providing these directions that are being made available to the Commissioner of Taxation comes in at $17.1 million over 5 years. This will be recouped by the government through increases it has made to the Self-Managed Superannuation Fund Supervisory Levy announced in MYEFO last year. The coalition has been critical of this increase in the levy, which saw it rise from $191 to $259. It will hit 480,000 self-managed superannuation funds, whilst raising $320 million over the forward estimates. The coalition will not oppose the measures contained within this schedule, but we are critical of the hike in the levy through which the Government has chosen to fund these measures.


The second bill, the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Unlawful Payments from Regulated Superannuation Funds) Bill 2012, seeks to impose a penalty rate of tax of 45 per cent for money unlawfully released early from a superannuation fund. This measure is also consistent with recommendations of the Cooper review. Rules in relation to the early access of superannuation are deliberately strict in order to prevent people from accessing retirement savings early.


Superannuation has always been a preferentially taxed savings vehicle in order to encourage Australians to invest in their own future retirement. This in turn relieves the pressure on government to provide for those who do not have the financial means to support themselves in retirement. To preserve this savings vehicle for its intended use, it is reasonable that penalties exist in order to prevent misuse, particularly given the concessional tax status of superannuation. The coalition wants to encourage as many Australians as possible to plan and save for their retirement and to take full advantage of the benefits that the superannuation system offers. This Labor government has not made life easy for many Australians planning their retirement and the spectre of further changes still hangs over their heads. The government's track record on superannuation has been one of taxation and fiddle, causing great uncertainty for those preparing for their retirement or relying heavily on their superannuation system for their income. 


Superannuation is becoming increasingly important as part of household wealth. There has now been about $1.5 trillion in superannuation funds under management—that is about the same as Australia's annual gross domestic product. That figure exceeds deposits with financial institutions, which are around $720 billion; it is much larger than direct shareholdings, at around $514 billion; there are also unfunded superannuation entitlements, at $353 billion. So superannuation assets and entitlements totalled $1.8 trillion within total wealth of households and unincorporated enterprises of $7.5 trillion. The superannuation industry, in large part, owes its success to government policy. The industry is boosted by the compulsory nature of superannuation contributions, currently at nine per cent—but legislated to increase to 12 per cent—and by concessional tax treatment afforded to savings in a superannuation fund.


There is only one measure from the MRRT package that a coalition government will keep, despite the enormous shortfall in forecast MRRT revenue, and that is the increase in compulsory superannuation from nine to 12 per cent. It was in this House that I also emphasised that employer funded superannuation contributions are in fact just that—funded by employers—and the government would do well not to overstate and exaggerate the reach of the MRRT measure in relation to the increased contribution rate. The coalition understands the importance of this measure to the Australian workers planning for their retirement and, in light of all the fiddles and changes to the Australian superannuation system over the past few years, we will not add additional confusion to this arising from reversing this particular measure. The coalition government will fund this measure from savings within the budget and not from a tax that hardly raises any revenue. 


Superannuation involves a trade-off with the government. Households are induced to lock up their savings until retirement and to forgo consumption today in return for concessional tax treatment. The benefit for the government is the greater financial self-sufficiency of people once they retire and the lower recourse to the government-funded pension system. The legislation before the House is to ensure that this system is upheld by preventing early and unlawful withdrawal of superannuation balances. The coalition supports this legislation before the House and believes that it is in the spirit of the compact between the government and the people. Having said that, I do not want to give the impression that the coalition is supportive of this government's constant fiddling, tinkering and threatening of additional taxation within the superannuation system—particularly of late as the government seems to eye this superannuation nest egg as a way of addressing its enormous budget shortfalls.


Many unexpected changes have been made to Australia's superannuation system by a government driven by the need for revenue to fund wasteful spending. What I find particularly disturbing is that this government seems to have a view that the superannuation industry is a cash cow, ready to be tapped when it sees fit to help fund its out-of-control budget and unrestrained expenditure. There has been a large reduction in the concessional superannuation caps, from $50,000 and $100,000 down to only $25,000, as well as freezing the relevant indexation on that cap. This is particularly of concern to the small business community and for those who may have a limited working life ahead of them, over which time they need to accumulate a retirement savings nest egg. I am frequently reminded by small business people, still reeling from the Labor government induced 'recession we had to have' in the nineties, that so much of their accumulated wealth—the very nest egg that they sought to rely upon for their retirement—was eroded over that time either by a reduction in the value of their business or by their business being forced to fold. Those people may have a limited window of their working life within which to accumulate a retirement nest egg that they can depend upon for the standard of living they hope to work for—and they feel they have worked for—right throughout their working life. So these reduction caps may, on the surface, seem to have some thought behind them if you look at them through the eyes of regular contributions throughout the adult working life of a superannuation saver, but that is not the journey of many Australian people—and it is particularly not the journey of those courageous men and women of small business, who may take the opportunity from a rare profitable year to provide handsomely for their retirement, in that year where they have that chance, realising that it is but a fraction of the nest egg they will require for a dignified retirement. 


There has also been a new supertax imposed on people earning more than $300,000 a year. Again, one needs to look at that over the working life of a person and not at a single snapshot as if that represents their entire working life. The government has only partly addressed the excessive penalties imposed by the ATO when people make inadvertent errors and breach their superannuation contributions cap. I will come back to that issue shortly and speak to some examples that I am very much aware of.


To make matters worse, there are fears that the government will again dip into superannuation in the forthcoming budget to help balance the books. There were rumours circulating widely throughout the media—and, some are suggesting, being planted by representatives of the government—over the past couple of weeks that the government plans to impose tax on the currently tax-free income flows from those aged 60 and above. It was as if they were testing the waters for this further tinkering and tax gouging on superannuation. Articles from the Australian newspaper suggested that these rumours have originated from the minister's own office, despite his repeated denials. After having tested the waters, the government had to rule out this threat given the protest that was building against such moves. Any further fiddling and changes would do nothing to build confidence in the superannuation system. Consumers and the industry need stability in policies and the certainty that the nest egg they are building will be there to fund a comfortable retirement. In recent days, the government has sought to attack the coalition over our intention to rescind another superannuation measure, the low-income superannuation tax offset, funded out of revenue from the MRRT—or should I say the anticipated, but not forthcoming, revenue from the MRRT.


I want to set the record straight on this. The tax offset was announced as part of the government's Minerals Resource Rent Tax package—the MRRT. The coalition has been on the record for a long time with our commitment to scrap the MRRT because it is a bad tax for Australia. Not only has it created sovereign risk implications in terms of our nation's attractiveness to foreign investors, but it is well short of its forecast. On Friday, we learnt that the government had collected $126 million, against a revenue forecast of $2 billion. The government's low-income superannuation tax offset measure, linked to the mining tax, is unfunded expenditure because of the MRRT's incapacity to bring in the revenue that the Treasurer not only forecast, but banked and spent well in advance of it actually materialising.


The coalition have been entirely transparent and upfront about our position on this tax offset. This stands in stark contrast to Labor, who promised there would be no changes to the superannuation arrangements before the 2007 election, and then reduced the government's superannuation co-contributions for low-income earners from $1,500 under the Howard government to just $500. This move stripped $3.3 billion out of low-income earners, a lot of whom would be working women. That is a salient point for this country's Prime Minister, I would have thought. Let us not forget that it is this Labor government that has hit Australians' savings with more than $8 billion in increased taxes on superannuation over the five years since coming to government. That is correct—$8 billion of increased taxes on superannuation imposed by these Labor governments over the five years since the election of Labor. The coalition will not be copping any lectures from Labor about superannuation.


I also waved around in a contribution last week what seemed to be a visual explanation of what 'not one jot, not one tittle' actually means. Those in this House and those listening to this broadcast might remind themselves of that assurance provided by Labor prior to the 2007 election. Kevin Rudd said superannuation would not be changed, 'not by one jot, not by one tiddle'. What we have found is there has been more than 50 substantial policy and legislative changes to superannuation since that assurance. So you can imagine why there is still anxiety in the superannuation sector, including those who are saving within superannuation and those who are dependent on superannuation for their revenue, about this reassurance that the payment out of super funds will not be taxed for people over the age of 60, a proposition that has been floated and then retracted in just the last fortnight.


The coalition will be supporting the measures contained within this bill. The changes are supported by industry and are expected, albeit a little late, following the handing down of the Hooper review over two-and-a-half years ago, but here they are and they will have the coalition's support. But as I stated at the outset, I will be looking to move an amendment. This will give the Australian Taxation Office discretion to allow taxpayers to correct inadvertent errors leading to excessive superannuation contributions breaching either concessional or non-concessional superannuation contribution caps. The reasons for these measures have been brought to my attention quite vividly, and I will outline them generally. The Australian tax office argues that it does not have the discretion to allow taxpayers to correct inadvertent errors that lead to a fine or punishment where there is an inadvertent breach of either the concessional or non-concessional superannuation contribution caps. Breaches of such caps attract extraordinarily large penalties, regardless of the circumstances. It is those circumstances that the coalition wishes to address. Some Australians have been forced to pay an effective tax rate of up to 93 per cent at times because of actions taken by others, completely out of their own control.


Today, the coalition is looking to address this problem. I will be moving amendments that seek to give the Australian tax commissioner discretion in a range of circumstances where individuals have made clearly inadvertent errors. In the consideration in detail stage, I will outline that our amendments seek to provide for that discretion, in cases where an individual has multiple employers and the cap is breached without any possibility of rectification; when the employer contribution is a few days earlier or later than expected; when unexpected bonus payments or redundancy payments impact on contributions; where salary sacrifice arrangements have not had caps altered or changed in time; where a late voluntary contribution is not processed until the following financial year; or where a taxpayer has received incorrect advice from a recognised tax adviser or other professional advisers. That will be the nature of the amendments I will be moving in my name at the detailed stage. I will explain in more detail, but simply with that overview I have provided, I hope that the House gets a sense that there are a number of quite inadvertent and unintentional circumstances which can give rise to an extraordinarily disproportionate fine or penalty as a result of the rigidity of the current law and the lack of discretion for the Australian tax commissioner to take account of the particular circumstances.


In closing, the coalition supports these two bills, but we will be moving an amendment to provide the discretion that the ATO needs to deal with inadvertent breaches.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2013-02-11,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (15:35):  In 1991, the then Prime Minister Paul Keating said of the superannuation guarantee:


It will make Australia a more equal place, a more egalitarian place and hence a more cohesive and happier place.


We do not often talk about happiness and superannuation in the same breath, but I think we should, because a strong superannuation system is a system that ensures dignity in retirement. It ensures that Australian retirees can enjoy that extra grey nomad trip and the comfort of being able to spend time with loved ones without worrying about paying the bills. It ensures that generations that have given much to Australia enjoy the retirement to which they are entitled.


Labor has always had a strong commitment to dignity in retirement. In 2009, we increased the pension—the biggest increase in the pension since its inception. That increase was worth $1,600 a year for singles on the full aged pension. Peter Whiteford from the University of New South Wales estimates that that knocked down the rate of poverty in Australia by about a fifth, from about 14 per cent down to about 11 per cent—one of the biggest decreases in poverty that we have seen. That came as a result of Labor's decision to raise the pension. That is the broad context for superannuation from this side of the house.


Alas, this has not been bipartisan. If we look to the Leader of the Opposition, he said once, 'Compulsory superannuation is one of the biggest con jobs ever foisted by government on the Australian people.' In 1995 he said, 'Compulsory superannuation is possibly the greatest confidence trick of the last decade.' It is in that spirit that we were not surprised when the Leader of the Opposition said on 23 March last year:


Well, we strongly oppose the superannuation increase. We have always as a coalition been against compulsory superannuation increases…


and that he said he would therefore oppose them. You can knock him for being wrong but not for being inconsistent. At least he was following true at that point to the things he had said about compulsory superannuation. But now it appears that the opposition have backflipped on superannuation. They say they will now be supporting the increase from nine to 12 per cent. They came into this place and voted against it. It is a phased increase until 2019, but those opposite will now apparently support the increase in superannuation—dragged kicking and screaming to the line—and are now unwilling to back down on this reform.


But you know where those opposite stand when they have the chance to speak out on superannuation. On the superannuation guarantee, Wilson Tuckey said that it was 'both stupid and dishonest'. Senator Alston said 'imposing compulsory superannuation on individuals does not increase total savings'—a statement clearly at odds with two recent Reserve Bank discussion papers. Senator Watson from the Liberal Party said 'unemployment is going to rise' from superannuation. Those opposite, in their heart of hearts, would really prefer that there was not a universal superannuation system. Just as they fought Medicare at its creation, so too they fought universal superannuation at its creation. Just as they have fought a series of progressive health measures, so too they have fought the increase in superannuation from nine to 12 per cent.


Today, although they may be saying that they are going to support the increase in universal superannuation, they are also going to raise the tax on the superannuation contributions of 3.6 million low-income Australians. That is about one in three workers, and they are the lowest paid workers in Australia. Nearly a third of workers are going to have their superannuation taxes increased by up to $500 a year under the opposition. Of course this is the same opposition who cried foul when the government imposed an additional 15 per cent tax on the superannuation contributions of those earning $300,000 or more in the last budget. That affected 128,000 people and some of the highest earning Australians. This, a measure which benefits 3.6 million of the lowest paid Australians, is a measure that the opposition will claw back.


The superannuation system on which dignity in retirement is founded is a Labor creation. It was Labor that put superannuation in place and has increased it from 9 to 12 per cent. It is Labor that introduced a low income superannuation contribution effective from 1 July last year. It is Labor has put in place a measure to implement a one-off refund of small excess concessional cap contributions breaches from 1 July 2011. Labor has put in place a higher concessional contributions cap for over-50s with low balances, and we have abolished the 70-year-old age limit on the superannuation guarantee. At the same time we are making the system more efficient and making the process of everyday transactions easier through new data and e-commerce standards, the use of tax file numbers as the primary locator of member accounts and facilitating account consolidation and electronic portability.


The Find My Super campaign that I ran locally with ACT MLA Chris Bourke helped link Canberrans to their superannuation. We can also do a lot through the Australian Taxation Office to make sure that your lost superannuation account finds you. Labor is working on those reforms. We have announced new rules to make superannuation simpler and more cost-effective through the MySuper reforms, which are grounded in the Cooper review. This recognises that choice architecture needs to operate in an environment where many people simply take the default fund and the default option within that fund. Defaults need to have high returns for individuals. The MySuper reforms see that put in place. They ensure that the defaults Australians receive are good defaults. I think this was a notion not well understood in the early 1990s. The emphasis then was very much on choice, but I think a lot of the research since then, particularly some of the studies coming out of behavioural economics, have told us that most people are not active managers of their retirement savings. They want rules that ensure good defaults, and that it what the MySuper reforms put in place. 


We are making sure that the directors of super funds are appropriately accountable for meeting their duties towards members. All of this is of a piece with ensuring that Australia can be a financial services hub and ensuring that Australia is a place where we encourage good money management in a way where we ensure that financial advisers are not conflicted and that they have good disclosure for their clients.


The consumer credit reforms we have put in place sit alongside the MySuper reforms in making sure that customers get a good deal, making sure we have a system that puts customers first.


To go to the specific provisions of the bill: the bill introduces civil and criminal sanctions for someone who promotes a scheme that has resulted or is likely to result in the illegal early release of superannuation benefits. At the moment, there are not those provisions available for promoters unless they are trustees of a fund. This ensures that those who would seek to benefit from the illegal early release of superannuation benefits can be punished.


The bill amends the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 to require that superannuation benefits that are rolled over into self-managed superannuation funds are captured as a designated service. That ensures that we take into account the risks of money laundering and financing of terrorism that can be associated with asset rollover and that we have the appropriate customer identification and reporting requirements to ensure that superannuation is not used for inappropriate ends.


The bill amends the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 to introduce administrative consequences for contraventions relating to self-managed superannuation funds. That gives the Commissioner of Taxation effective, flexible, proportionate power to address noncompliance with superannuation laws.


These reforms are essential if we are to ensure that the superannuation system remains a strong system which ensures good investment in Australia—we have seen the pool of assets grow to around the size of Australia's GDP. These reforms ensure that Australians have dignity in retirement.


I call on those opposite to change their commitment to scrapping the low-income superannuation contribution. They have argued that they are not going to support any measures that are linked to the mining tax, but we know that is not the case because, as soon as the breath was out of their mouths, they then said: 'Not the increase from nine to 12 per cent.' The increase from nine to 12 per cent is not small bickies. I understand that each percentage point is around $1 billion of forgone tax revenue for the government. So there is $3 billion sitting right there. 


My call to those opposite is: if they are going to support a good measure—increasing superannuation contributions from nine to 12 per cent—why not continue and support an equally good measure in bringing down the tax rate paid by the lowest income Australians on their superannuation contributions? It is a reform that follows the Henry review. The Henry review recommended the tax paid on superannuation contributions should be an individual's marginal tax rate minus 15 per cent. We have not gotten to precisely that, but we have recognised the wisdom of the Henry review's recommendation that superannuation taxation should not be a flat tax, that it should be lower for lower income Australians. So we have brought down the tax rate to zero for 3.6 million Australians.


I call on those opposite to support that measure. It is a good measure. It improves dignity in retirement and it improves dignity for lower income Australians, who are disproportionately female workers. As we know, women earn lower wages in the Australian labour market, for a range of reasons—from industry, to discrimination, to career breaks. Women in the Australian workforce earn less and, as a result, have lower superannuation balances. These 3.6 million Australians, disproportionately women, are benefiting from the low-income superannuation contribution. If the coalition were to come to government and scrap it, they would be raising taxes on a group of low-income earners, disproportionately women.


This is as good a measure, in my view, as the increased superannuation contribution. It is an important equity measure and it is an important measure to ensure that Australians in their retirement have the independence to be able to travel, to spend time with loved ones, to enjoy a good retirement. I hope that sense prevails, that the Liberal Party, which has traditionally been deeply suspicious of universal superannuation—since the very inception of universal superannuation—can now see its way to support recommendations coming out of the Henry review that low-income Australians pay less tax. I commend the bill to the House.

"Fletcher, Paul, MP",LP,2013-02-11,"



Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (15:50):  I am very pleased to rise to speak on the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Unlawful Payments from Regulated Superannuation Funds) Bill 2012 and the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Reducing Illegal Early Release and Other Measures) Bill 2012. The purpose of these bills is to increase penalties for those involved in the unlawful early release of superannuation moneys. These bills, in a sense, go to the bargain which exists between the Commonwealth and its citizens in relation to superannuation. The bargain is that the Commonwealth says to citizens, 'We will provide you with tax concessions to assist you to save and build up a balance that will provide for you in retirement,' and, in exchange, your part of the bargain as a citizen is that you will use the money only for the designated purpose of providing for your retirement. Hence, efforts to, for example, release the funds early are breaching that bargain, and that is, it would appear, the rationale for the measures in the bill today. 


However, there is one aspect of the bargain which the Commonwealth is not doing a very good job of keeping. Indeed, the Commonwealth has, quite frankly, breached its side of the bargain when it comes to the situation of citizens who, in good faith, make contributions into their superannuation fund and find themselves inadvertently paying extremely high rates of tax—as high as 93 per cent—when they inadvertently breach what are highly technical and complex rules.


The result is that money, which has been paid in by the citizen in reliance on the bargain with the Commonwealth with the intention of saving money to provide for that citizen's retirement, is in fact seized by the government and put into general tax revenue. Regrettably, and quite extraordinarily, the Rudd-Gillard Labor government has been content to let this situation fester for years while collecting tens of millions of dollars in tax revenue in excess contributions tax each year—much of that revenue collected essentially by tricking citizens. That is why the coalition has moved an amendment to this bill which is designed to fix this problem—which is designed to prevent citizens being tricked into paying punitive rates of taxation on monies which they thought were going to contribute towards their retirement income.


I would like to speak to the amendment and I want to make three points in the brief time available to me this afternoon. Firstly, I want to point out that the current rules are unfair and capricious in the way they operate. Secondly, I want to highlight the fact that the Rudd-Gillard Labor government has allowed this situation to fester for a number of years and has grabbed at revenue which has been received from citizens under a misunderstanding. An inadvertent error by citizens has led to them paying excessive rates of tax. Thirdly, the coalition, in the amendment we are moving to the bill this afternoon, are proposing an effective and workable solution to this problem.


Let me turn, firstly, to the proposition that the current rules are unfair and capricious in the way that they apply to citizens. When you state that a particular payment could attract a rate of tax of up to 93 per cent, most Australians would be very, very surprised. They would be particularly surprised to learn that you can be subject to a tax of up to 93 per cent, not because you have made a deliberate attempt to obtain benefits to which you are not entitled but because, through inadvertent error—and in some cases through factors which are wholly beyond your control, as I will go on to explain—payments have been made, in some cases, just days before 30 June or days after 30 June, with the result that the total amount being paid in a particular financial year exceeds an arbitrary limit and then very, very high rates of tax can apply. Let me explain how this can occur. The starting point is that the limit on concessional contributions into superannuation is $25,000 a year. I note that this contribution limit has dropped very, very sharply in the five-and-a-bit years of the Rudd-Gillard government. For many citizens it was $100,000; it is now $25,000. Of course, that sharp and continuing reduction in contribution limits has been a factor in leading many citizens to be confused and surprised and to find themselves inadvertently in a position where they have breached the contribution limits. The Rudd-Gillard government's poor administration of the contribution limits has been a factor in many citizens finding themselves caught up in this mess.


The second thing that happens is that, if you make contributions which are intended to be in contact concessional contributions but exceed the $25,000 limit, then further contributions are treated as incurring the excess concessional contributions tax of 31.5 per cent. They then fall into your non-concessional contributions limit which is $150,000 in one year or $450,000 over three years. The risk is that, if you are already at your non-concessional contributions limit, then any dollar over the $25,000 which fails to be treated as a concessional contribution picks up additional tax because you have also exceeded the non-concessional limit. I think you will agree it is crystal clear. Even as I explain it, it is very easy to see how Australians can inadvertently find themselves breaching these highly complex and technical rules. This is the situation that a disturbingly large number of people find themselves facing.


The key point is: you can breach these rules through no fault of your own, because, if a payment that you thought was going to be made by your employer by 30 June of a particular financial year ends up being made on 1 or 2 July, thus falling into the next financial year, you can trip-wire these limits in that next financial year. There is a whole range of circumstances in which, for reasons wholly outside of your control, you can end up as an employee breaching these contribution limits. One situation is where an individual has multiple employers and the cap is breached without any possibility of rectification. Another possibility is where an employer contribution is a few days earlier or later than expected. There can also be the situation of unexpected bonus payments or redundancy payments. So you might have developed a strategy to contribute up to the $25,000 limit and no more, but then, unexpectedly, you are made redundant, a redundancy payment comes in during the financial year and then you are suddenly rocketing through that contribution limit and that money, which ought to be your money, is being seized as a very large percentage in tax. Of course, another possibility is if a late voluntary contribution you intend to have made in this financial year is not processed by the superannuation fund or by your financial institutional until the following financial year. As I have explained, the consequence of any one of these highly technical errors and errors which are made for reasons which, in many cases, are outside of the control of the citizen—outside of the control of the taxpayer—can lead to you being hit with tax of up to 93 per cent. That is, on any view, completely unreasonable and unacceptable.


You would have thought that merely explaining this problem would immediately create, in any government, an urgency to fix it. You would have thought that no government would want to be in the position where it was, in essence, collecting taxes from its citizens by trickery. But, remarkably, the Rudd-Gillard Labor government has made no serious attempt to fix this problem. Let us just look at the scale of this problem. In the 2008-09 financial year, 35,000 Australians breached the contribution rules. By 2010-11 it was 50,954, and by 2011-12 it was 66,435 Australians paying excess contributions tax—in many cases due to inadvertent error. And that dramatic increase from 35,000 to 66,000 in three years is undoubtedly related to the fact that the Rudd-Gillard Labor government has systematically reduced contribution limits, all the while incidentally, telling Australians they were going to be doing the opposite—all the while telling Australians that the reduction to $25,000 was only temporary and that for those above 50 their contribution limits would not be maintained at a low level.


The Labor government, it is true, in 2010 passed some legislation which was designed to give the commissioner a certain degree of discretion to deal with this matter. But the degree of discretion is extremely limited. It is only available in respect of excess contributions of up to $10,000. What the commissioner says is that citizens or taxpayers in that situation may be eligible for a once-only offer to have their contributions withdrawn from their fund, added to their assessable income and taxed at the marginal rate.


Why such a piecemeal solution has been proffered by the present government is difficult to understand unless we recognise the troubling possibility that this government is so desperate for revenue that it is willing to collect tax revenue by trickery. And in 2011-12 the Rudd-Gillard government raised $174 million in excess contributions tax. It is clear that in significant measure some of this money has effectively been tricked out of ordinary Australians seeking to comply with the fiendishly complex rules governing contributions and contribution limits, and have found themselves—for reasons in many cases beyond their control—paying tax on their contributions, of up to 93 per cent. 


Now, the Rudd-Gillard government has been content to let this situation fester. The coalition is putting forward an amendment which is designed to fix this problem; it is designed to end this tawdry behaviour, on the part of the present government, of essentially taxing Australians through trickery.


The proposed provisions in our amendment would add new subsections to the existing section 292-465 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. They would authorise the commissioner to make a determination to reverse contributions where a taxpayer has made an inadvertent error and would allow the commissioner to consider, in determining whether to exercise his discretion, several factors that typically have caused taxpayers to make these kinds of inadvertent errors. For example, having more than one employer is the first factor set out in the proposed subsection 292-465(6A) and then whether contributions were made by the taxpayer's employer at a time that was earlier than the time the taxpayer expected; whether they were made at a time that was later; whether the taxpayer received an unexpected bonus payment that had an impact on the amount of his or her contributions, and a range of other factors, which, experience tells us, have led thousands of Australians to find themselves paying excess tax for reasons which are beyond their control—reasons which they could not take into account. I repeat, in 2011-12, 66,435 taxpayers paid an excess contributions tax. So this is a large and growing problem—a problem that the Rudd-Gillard government has been quite happy to let fester. 


Will this measure have a budgetary impact? Potentially it will. I have indicated that the revenue collected in the last full financial year was $174 million. But if the reduction in revenue occurs because Australians are no longer being tricked by their government into paying an excess contributions tax of up to 93 per cent because of their failure to comply with technical and complex rules, and in many cases exacerbated by factors beyond their control such as the timing of payments from their employer—if the reduction in revenue occurs because that kind of trickery is no longer able to be perpetrated by the Commonwealth on its citizens—then that is a reduction in revenue that this parliament ought to welcome. 


And it would be a shocking thing indeed if the Rudd-Gillard government were to say to the people of Australia, 'We are quite happy to keep raising revenue, to keep taxing through trickery.' That would be a shocking thing indeed. And unless that is what the Rudd-Gillard government wants to say to the people of Australia, then I cannot see any reason why the government would not support this amendment which the coalition has moved, which is designed to ensure that Australians no longer find themselves in that position, through inadvertently breaching highly technical and complex rules and being taxed at up to 93 per cent on money that they thought they were setting aside to provide for their retirement. I commend this amendment to the House.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2013-02-11,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (16:05):  We are debating a bill to amend our legislation in respect of superannuation. The Labor Party's superannuation policy has an important public policy purpose, and that is to build a pool of individual and national retirement savings so that individuals can retire with some dignity and some income security, and also to provide some relief for future generations in respect of pension payments and meeting the challenges of an aging demographic.


In respect of this the government provides a tax concession on contributions and earnings for moneys going into the fund and the earnings of the fund. You would have to say that on any fair analysis the policy is working. We have over $1.4 trillion in retirement savings invested superannuation accounts around the country. This is close to the fourth-largest pool of superannuation funding anywhere in the world.


It should be the case that early access to superannuation is only available in extremely limited circumstances. By 'early access' I mean prior to retirement. In the cases of severe hardship or other very limited circumstances the trustees of funds may allow early access to this funds and they do not receive high levels of taxation penalties as a result. 


Unfortunately, a number of individuals promote illegal early-release schemes. The superannuation system review recommended that the government take action to reduce the illegal early release of super, and the two bills before the House today are aimed at addressing just that. Schedule 1 of the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Reducing Illegal Early Release and Other Measures) Bill 2012 provides for civil and criminal penalties for those who promote the legal early release of super. The Income Tax Rates Amendment (Unlawful Payments from Regulated Superannuation Funds) Bill 2012, the ITR bill, amends the law to ensure that superannuation benefits pulled out as part of some illegal early release are taxed at 45 per cent.


Schedule 1 to the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Reducing Illegal Early Release and Other Measures) Bill 2012 amends the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act to introduce civil and criminal sanctions for a person who promotes a scheme that has resulted, or is likely to result, in the illegal early release of superannuation benefits. The government's super system review found that stronger sanctions must exist to deter the promoters of illegal early-release schemes from undermining the government's retirement policy and, in addition, harming members in the process. The review found evidence of promoters who were pushing these schemes charging very high commissions for convincing sometimes unwitting investors to roll their money over from a compliance scheme into one of these early-release schemes and taking as high as 50 per cent in commission—unconscionable behaviour that should be condemned by all members in this place.


Currently, there are no specific penalties for the promoters of illegal early-release schemes who are not themselves trustees of a regulated superannuation fund. Often the promoter will not be a trustee of a purported superannuation fund used in a scheme but instead recruits other parties for the role. This measure delivers on the government's announcement that it would introduce penalties to deter the promotion of these sorts of schemes. It will allow the commissioner to seek civil and criminal penalties for those who promote these early-release schemes. The review also found that those individuals who gain illegal early access to their superannuation benefits should not enjoy the same tax treatment as that which is designed to promote that public policy purpose. The review recommended that amounts released by illegal means should be subject to the superannuation fund non-complying tax rate of 45 per cent.


The Income Tax Rates Amendment (Unlawful Payments from Regulated Superannuation Funds) Bill 2012, being considered in cognate with the first bill, imposes the superannuation non-complying fund rate of 45 per cent on those amounts that are released early by illegal means. These measures will ensure strong sanctions are in place to deter the illegal early release of superannuation.


Schedule 2 to the bill amends the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 to require that superannuation benefits that are rolled over into self-managed superannuation funds are captured as a designated service. The super system review noted that, since trustees and members of SMSFs are generally the same, there is greater scope for assets once received in the self-managed superannuation fund to be diverted for an illicit purpose. By capturing rollovers into self-managed superannuation funds as a designated service under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006, the transferring superannuation fund will have to comply with a range of obligations, including customer identification requirements and reporting obligations. This measure will ensure that consideration is given to the money-laundering and terrorism-financing risk associated with the rollover of assets to a self-managed superannuation fund.


Schedule 3 to the bill amends the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 to introduce administrative consequences for contraventions relating to self-managed superannuation funds. The super system review found that the Commissioner of Taxation, as regulator of self-managed funds, needs to have effective, flexible and proportionate powers to address noncompliance with the superannuation laws. Currently, the commissioner has a very limited number of tools available to address instances of noncompliance. The review acknowledged the benefits that the current penalty regime provides to deal with and deter noncompliance; however, it highlighted some areas of the current regime which limit the commissioner's ability to achieve optimal regulation.


Applying the current penalties can be costly and time consuming, and the potential consequences can be disproportionately high. The absence of graduated penalties results in a number of self-managed superannuation fund trustees avoiding sanction for contravening conduct by simply rectifying the conduct when it is detected. This may be appropriate in some circumstances, but it is not appropriate if the trustees can continue to contravene the law and therefore their actions simply have no consequences. The review recommended that the commissioner be given additional tools, both educational and punitive, in conjunction with existing powers. These tools will support the ongoing integrity of the superannuation system. This measure delivers another stronger super reform for self-managed superannuation funds.


On this side of the House, we have a strong commitment to Australia's superannuation system. It was, after all, the Australian Labor Party that built the system and added to it. We built it over the vehement opposition of the coalition, who have never been supporters of occupational superannuation. They see it as some form of socialist plot. Every time we have had the opportunity to bring into this place measures which advance the capacity of workers to add to their retirement savings, those measures have been met with vehement opposition by those on the other side of the House.


But this government is increasing its commitment to workers' superannuation, particularly by increasing the superannuation guarantee. Those from the coalition parties really did deserve an award in hypocrisy when, in previous weeks, they raised questions and tried to speculate about what might be in the forthcoming budget when it came to workers' superannuation when they themselves, only months earlier, had opposed measures to lift the superannuation guarantee from nine per cent to 12 per cent. This measure alone will boost the retirement savings of 8.4 million Australians by about $85 billion over 10 years and add about $500 billion to our pool of retirement savings by 2035. That means around $118,000 to the retirement superannuation balance for an average worker who is 30 years old today.


Labor's super reforms also provide an annual contribution of up to $500 into the superannuation accounts of workers earning less than $37,000. This is a measure that came into effect on 1 July last year. It will enable workers aged between 70 and 74 to receive contributions for the very first time since the introduction of compulsory superannuation. This is a measure that will come into effect from 1 July this year. It also creates a new low-cost superannuation product called MySuper. Again, this is a measure that will come into effect from 1 July 2013.


In stark contrast, the coalition have confirmed that they would re-impose a 15 per cent tax on Australia's lowest paid workers—that is, those earning below $37,000 per annum. This group of people includes 2.1 million working women. The opposition leader announced at the National Press Club recently that, if elected, the coalition would abolish the low-income superannuation contribution. That is, those workers earning over $37,000 a year who are currently having $500 per year diverted into their accounts by the federal Labor government, adding to their retirement income, will have that reversed—stopped, knocked on the head—if the Leader of the Opposition ever becomes Prime Minister of this country.


The coalition policy constitutes a superannuation tax increase of up to $500 on every Australian worker earning below $37,000. If you just think about it for a moment, their policy is to abolish our policy of increasing the tax-free threshold—nearly tripling the tax-free threshold—up to $18½ thousand, so that nobody earning less than $18½ thousand pays income tax. On top of that, they are going to whack these workers' superannuation by another $500 per annum in additional taxation. It is quite clear to see where their priorities lie, and it is reflected in the focus of their contribution on this legislation.


The purpose of the low-income superannuation contribution is to effectively refund the tax that is paid by low-income earners on their concessional superannuation contributions, including the superannuation guarantee of up to $500 per annum. Because of their lower income tax rate, lower income earners otherwise do not get the same concessional benefits as workers on higher incomes do. They do not have access to a whole heap of the benefits that higher income earners may have when it comes to minimising their tax arrangements through superannuation contributions.


Treasury analysis says that there are around about 3.6 million workers earning less than $37,000 per annum—so it is not a small group of people—including, in my own state, around 1.1 million workers who would be affected by this retrograde change. That is roughly three out of every 10 workers in Australia. So, far from decreasing taxes and increasing retirement savings of Australians, the coalition—led by the member for Warringah—would go into the election opposing the low-income superannuation contribution while also opposing our policy of raising the superannuation guarantee from nine to 12 per cent. It also immediately destroys the coalition's so-called commitment earlier in the week to make no changes to the superannuation system. The re-imposition of a $1 billion per year tax on 3.6 million workers is an unexpected, unfortunate and dramatic change by any assessment.


If Australians want to ensure that they have decent policy protecting their retirement incomes, they should support members in their electorates who support the sort of legislation such as that before the House today, and the party that brought occupational superannuation to the Australian people. I commend the legislation to the House.

"Van Manen, Bert, MP",LP,2013-02-11,"



Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde) (16:20):  It is always wonderful to hear the contribution from the member for Throsby but, as is usual for this government, there was nothing new or constructive to add to the debate.


I rise to speak today on the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Unlawful Payments from Regulated Superannuation Funds) Bill 2012 and the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Reducing Illegal Early Release and Other Measures) Bill 2012. From my experience in the financial planning and superannuation industry before entering this place, these bills are based on the sound recommendations that have come out of the Cooper review. Although that review was brought down some 2½ years ago, it is heartening to see that some steps continue to be made to introduce some of those recommendations that have been very rightly made to preserve and enhance the integrity of our superannuation system.


The bills in essence are designed to reduce the incidence of illegal early withdrawals from superannuation and to impose some realistic penalties on those people who seek to illegally withdraw funds early. It is also worthwhile to note that there are some provisions within the legislation for the early release of super, but it is strictly controlled and under limited circumstances, such as severe financial hardship, total and permanent disablement, temporary incapacity, terminal illness or permanent departure from Australia. These rules have been made deliberately strict because there is an agreement inherent in the structure of superannuation that it is there for the long term for people's retirement, and the consequence is that you get a concessional tax rate for having your money not available until you retire at age 55, 60 or 65.


The Income Tax Rates Amendment (Unlawful Payments from Regulated Superannuation Funds) Bill imposes a penalty tax rate of 45 per cent for money unlawfully released early from a superannuation fund. Forty-five per cent is the current superannuation non-complying tax rate, so it fits in with current regulatory structures. This was recommended by the Cooper review for simplicity and to reflect the top marginal tax rate.


The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Reducing Illegal Early Release and Other Measures) Bill introduces civil and criminal penalties for promoters of schemes that result in or encourage illegal release of superannuation. It also makes superannuation rollovers into self-managed funds subject to the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act.


This range of measures was again recommended in the Cooper review. The anti-money laundering act also applies to APRA-regulated funds and this extends the application to funds being rolled over from an APRA fund to a self-managed super fund. It requires the people involved to be identified to ensure or lower the risk of money laundering and terrorism financing. This ability to use the safe harbour procedures will mean that transferring funds will not have to collect and verify the full range of customer information.


Superannuation is taxed at a preferential rate to encourage people to save for their retirement. This goal is undermined if people illegally access superannuation savings early, and it is also undermined if money released illegally goes in whole or in part as fees to promoters of these illegal schemes, or is channelled into other illegal activities. The measures contained in these bills are broadly supported across the superannuation industry and would not be opposed by the coalition.


There are other issues that also need addressing within the superannuation environment. A large and increasing number of Australians are confronted with excessive and disproportionate tax penalties as a result of genuinely inadvertent errors leading to voluntary superannuation contributions in excess of either their concessional or non-concessional contribution caps. Some Australians have, in effect, been forced to pay an effective tax rate of up to 93 per cent at times, and these actions have been taken completely out of their control by others. This is why we on the coalition side seek to introduce an amendment to give the tax office some discretion to allow those penalties not to be enforced in the event of an inadvertent breach of the regulations. It can be as simple as a contribution being paid at or near the end of June being processed by the superannuation fund early in the new financial year, when it related to that previous financial year. In the following financial year they make their $25,000 contribution, but because the carryover of the previous contribution—or because it was processed in the new financial year—those two amounts are added together and consequently, inadvertently, those people have breached those contributions caps. The coalition proposes to move an amendment to give the ATO discretion to allow taxpayers to correct those inadvertent errors. As the member for Bradfield rightly pointed out, there are some 66,000 Australians who have been caught in that position over the past financial year and they have paid some $174 million in excess super contributions tax, none of which goes to assisting them in accumulating superannuation benefits for their retirement.


The reason for putting this amendment in is that the ATO argues that they do not currently have this discretion, and these inadvertent errors, for example, can occur where an individual has multiple employers and the cap is breached without any possibility of rectification. An employer contribution may be paid a few days earlier or later than expected, and unexpected bonus payments or redundancy payments can also impact on the contributions. Where salary sacrifice arrangements are in place they similarly can have an impact if caps are altered and not changed in time. Before my time in this place I saw that occur firsthand on a number of occasions. We had to quickly review and ensure that clients who were on salary sacrifice arrangements made those adjustments to the salary sacrifice arrangements to avoid getting caught with changes to these contribution limits. The tax penalties involved are clearly excessive, delivering a tax rate of up to 93 per cent.


This measure should have no impact on the budget as the government should not have been planning its budget revenue estimates based on the assumption that people saving to achieve a self-funded retirement will make inadvertent errors and be taxed at up to 93 per cent on their retirement savings. Taxpayers in this situation who are doing the right thing by saving more voluntarily to achieve a self-funded retirement and take the pressure off the public purse, as a result are currently being unfairly and disproportionately penalised.


In the coalition amendments, guidance is given to the commissioner about the circumstances in which the discretion should be exercised. This is a discretion that should be exercised when the excess contributions are the result of inadvertent errors. Can this government stand up and state in good conscience that their forward estimates are based on the assumption that they will take money from people who have made inadvertent mistakes? Given that the government speakers on these bills have been loudly proclaiming the superannuation framework, the fact that they were responsible for introducing superannuation and the fact that they want people to accumulate funds for retirement—a notion that we on this side absolutely support—it is perfectly reasonable for us to ask the government to give the ATO this discretion.


We know that the government needs all the tax revenue that it can get its hands on. That is not because the people of Australia have done the wrong thing over the past five years; it is because we have a government whose profligate spending has created a situation in which it needs to find money in every single nook, cranny and crevice that it can.


When we take a longer term view and consider that we have an ageing population and an ever-increasing call on government resources in a wide variety of areas, and are faced with a government whose only inclination is to continue to tax the very people with the capacity to provide wholly or at least significantly for themselves, the cruel irony is that the very people we should assist and provide a hand up to lose out. This is because we have a government that creates hurdles and disincentives to saving via super for those who want to plan for a self-sufficient retirement. The government applies ridiculously low concessional limits to superannuation while at the same time increases taxes on those who have already done the right thing by seeking to become self-funded in their retirement.


Self-funded retirement is the ideal outcome for any retirement income strategy. The more people who are either fully or partially self-funded, the more funds that are available to assist those who do not have the capacity to fund their own retirement. That is the risk with the short-term nature of some of the decisions made by this government to prop up its budget revenue because of its profligate spending. It appears that this government simply does not understand this. Over the past five years, some $8 billion has been withdrawn from the superannuation system through higher taxes under this government.


I genuinely hope that we are able to see a superannuation system that maintains its integrity and strength for the long term and that the government is not seeking to profiteer further from future self-funded retirees through the proposals set out in these bills that apply to people who inadvertently exceed their contribution limits and finish up potentially paying up to 93 per cent in taxes.

Mr GRIFFIN
 (Bruce) (16:33):  It is a pleasure to follow on from a speaker such as my friend the member for Forde. We often spend some time together on a Thursday morning endeavouring to try and get fit, remembering what we were—well, at least what he was—once like many years ago when it came to the question of sport. I am consistent. I am as bad as I was then: still pretty bad.


This legislation makes a series of amendments to our superannuation law. Schedule 1 of the legislation implements the government's reforms relating to penalties for illegal early release schemes as part of the Stronger Super reforms. The bills will introduce civil and criminal penalties for persons who promote schemes for the illegal early release of superannuation benefits.


Schedule 2 of the legislation allows rollovers to self-managed superannuation funds from regulated superannuation funds that are not SMSFs to be captured as a designated service under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006. This amendment will ensure that consideration is given to the money laundering and terrorism financing risks associated with the rollover of assets to an SMSF and that appropriate customer identification and reporting obligations exist when assets exit the prudentially regulated superannuation sector.


Schedule 3 of the legislation provides for administrative consequences for trustees of self-managed superannuation funds by given the Commissioner of Taxation the power to issue education and rectification directions and impose administrative penalties for contraventions of the Superannuation Industry Supervision Act 1993 and the superannuation industry supervision regulations. These amendments will provide the Commissioner of Taxation with effective, flexible and cost-effective mechanisms to deal with non-compliance with the law.


The ITR bill introduces the superannuation fund non-complying rate of 45 per cent to amounts released by illegal means. The Commissioner of Taxation retains the discretion to determine that it is unreasonable to subject amounts released by illegal means to the 45 per cent rate, having regard to the nature of the fund and the circumstances of release.


Superannuation is an incredibly important part of the financial system for the future of generations of Australians, now and in the future. It is a system that the Labor government has been proud to support over the last 20-plus years and is proud to support at this time. It is an important part of the future security of generations as they get older. I commend the bills to the House.

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (16:36):  Firstly, I would like to thank those members who have contributed to this debate, including the eloquent words of the member for Bruce. Schedule 1 to the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Reducing Illegal Early Release and Other Measures) Bill 2012 introduces civil and criminal sanctions for a person who promotes a scheme that has resulted, or is likely to result, in the illegal early release of superannuation benefits. The Income Tax Rates Amendments (Unlawful Payments from Regulated Superannuation Funds) Bill 2012 imposes the superannuation non-complying fund rate of 45 per cent on those amounts that are released early by illegal means. These measures will further deter promoters of illegal early release scheme from undermining the government's retirement policy and harming members in the process. 


Schedule 2 to the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Reducing Illegal Early Release and Other Measures) Bill 2012 amends the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act to require that superannuation benefits that are rolled over into self-managed superannuation funds are captured as a designated service. This requirement will assist in reducing the risk that superannuation benefits that are rolled over for self-managed superannuation funds are used for illicit purposes. 


Schedule 3 amends the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 to introduce administrative consequences for contraventions relating to self-managed superannuation funds. This measure will give the Commissioner of Taxation, as regulator of self-managed superannuation funds, effective flexible and proportionate powers to address non-compliance with the superannuation laws. These tools will support the ongoing integrity of the superannuation system, and I commend these bills to the House.

 (Dunkley) (20:00):  I move:


That this House:


(1) notes:


(a) the incidence of skin cancer in Australia is the highest in the world and is two to three times that seen in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom; and


(b) that skin cancers account for around 80 per cent of all newly diagnosed cancers in Australia;


(2) supports policies that focus on early detection which will in turn significantly reduce the number of Australian lives lost to skin cancer every year;


(3) notes the importance of training for general practitioners to ensure that family doctors are able to recognise, diagnose and treat the various forms of precursors or early stages of skin cancer; and


(4) acknowledges the work of anti-cancer community organisations, the medical fraternity and the pharmaceutical industry in increasing awareness of skin cancer and risk prevention strategies, promoting the importance of regular skin checks and facilitating affordable access to skin checks and early stage treatments.


And I acknowledge the heartfelt contribution of the member for Grey on the matter just before the House.


I rise to speak on this motion because of its profound significance to so many Australians. Skin cancer is a life-threatening condition that impacts heavily on the lives of many Australians, and I am pleased that the House has tonight devoted some time to this debate. Australia has the highest incidence of skin cancer in the world. Australians are four times as likely to develop a skin cancer as any other form of cancer. Two in three Australians are diagnosed with skin cancer before the age of 70. This is an incredibly sobering statistical picture.


There are three main types of skin cancer: basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma—the non-melanoma skin cancers—and melanoma. This area of medicine has a huge impact on the Australian community. In 2010 alone, the total number of deaths from melanoma in Australia was 1,452. In 2010 there were 445 reported deaths from non-melanoma skin cancer. This is a tragic picture, with greater impact on loss of life than the road toll. In 2009 there were 11½ thousand new cases of melanoma. Overall, numbers of skin cancers are increasing as our population ages. There are approximately 450,000 new cases of non-melanoma skin cancer each year, costing over half a billion dollars to treat. This makes it the most expensive cancer in Australia to manage. Because non-melanoma skin cancer is not a reportable condition, these costs may well be significantly understated compared with the reality of cases diagnosed and treated annually.


It is predicted in research published in November 2012 in the Medical Journal of Australia that the yearly cost of treating Australia's most prevalent cancer will increase to more than $700 million annually within three years. In the research, Medicare data for non-melanoma skin cancer between 1997 and 2012, including basal and squamous cell carcinomas, were examined. The total number of treatments increased by more than 410,000 in 1997 to almost 768,000 in the year 2000, and it was estimated that the number of cases would increase to 939,000 by 2015.


Expenses relating to the treatment of non-melanoma skin cancers, including diagnosis, treatment and pathology, increased from $264 million in 2001 to over half a billion dollars—$511 million—in 2010. It was forecast that this cost would exceed $700 million annually in three years. Public hospitals are struggling to keep up with demand.


The Standing Committee on Health and Ageing recently released a report on suicide that showed that 2,000 Australian lives are, sadly, lost in this manner each year. Indeed, the road toll is of similar proportions. As a community, we are devastated by these statistics and compelled to act. But for skin cancer, where the figures are in the same league, with approximately 1,500 people dying from melanoma and approximately 500 from non-melanoma skin cancers each year, our actions and call to address this issue are less clear and less resonant in the broader community.


More than a million general practice consultations are directly related to skin cancer management, and skin cancer accounts for approximately 80 per cent of all those cancers diagnosed in Australia. We do have an opportunity to cease being the skin cancer capital of the world. Early detection and treatment will save lives. It will also reduce the rapidly increasing cost of the management of the condition and its burden on Australia's health budget and on the many families left to contend with this cancer. With the development of skin awareness and the conducting of regular skin checks comes the opportunity to achieve an early diagnosis. Where early stages of cancer are detected, access to the simple treatments can be afforded, with an excellent chance of a cure. As with most cancers, the best prognosis is achieved before progression to the more problematic stages of malignancies. These are both harder and more costly to treat.


There are some specific steps that can be taken to reduce the frightening toll and the cost of this disease. I urge people to consider these steps. First, if people became more aware of their skin and learned how to self-check their skin regularly so that when a change on the skin was seen they immediately took action to have it diagnosed by a qualified healthcare professional, this would be an important step forward. Secondly, when individuals present with skin changes or when they identify skin damage caused by exposure to the sun's UV radiation, there is a significantly higher chance that the person affected can be successfully diagnosed at a much earlier stage of the disease. Third, with earlier diagnosis comes the ability to provide effective treatments that will slow or halt the progression of the disease. As a direct result, the patient will be more likely to achieve a full cure. Fourth, the treatment at this early stage is significantly less costly and less traumatic to the patient compared with surgery and chemotherapy, which may be needed at the more malignant stages of the disease.


Fifth, Australia is at the forefront of research into skin cancer causes and treatment. Some of these innovations are now becoming commercially viable, and others still need to be further researched. Investment of this kind will be making a difference to the future generations before they are confronted with the morbidity or mortality of skin cancer that occurs with our older citizens today.


Sixth, we can make use of the tools that are available. They can make a significant difference to those that are emerging now and those that have been used in the past. Better awareness, early diagnosis, effective and affordable early treatment should be employed by all Australians. Effective interventions will save thousands of Australian lives that are currently needlessly lost every year. I encourage all Australians to get behind the Know Your Own Skin campaign which has been developed by leading experts to encourage people to check their own skin, the body's biggest organ, at the start of each season for sun damage and ask their local GPs for a skin check during their next visit. Further information can be found at www.knowyourownskin.com.au.


I also acknowledge the work of MoleMap, a local business in the Dunkley electorate that recognised some years ago the capacity for digital photographic technology and its high-resolution capability to be used as an ongoing tool to monitor and review skin condition. Has that worrying wart or that skin discolouration changed? How much has it changed? Is there some transformation in the area of the skin? All of these things can be more effectively tracked by the use of digital photographic technology, and I acknowledge MoleMap as one of the leading local exponents of that capability.


I make a heartfelt plea to my constituents and to the broader Australian community to please check your own skin. Also, go and get your skin regularly checked by those with expertise and knowledge to see if any early concerns are arising. People should also ask their family doctor to include a skin check as part of regular routine medical check-up, as they can diagnose any areas of damage and recommend appropriate treatment, or in some cases recommend further consultation with a specialist medical practitioner.


This motion has been moved to help support the good work of the anti-cancer community organisations, the medical fraternity and the pharmaceutical industry in helping to reduce the number of lives lost to skin cancer, but my message tonight is: please, follow the guidance of the experts, know your own skin, get it checked regularly and encourage those that are near and dear to you to do likewise.

"Griffin, Alan, MP",ALP,2013-02-11,"



Mr GRIFFIN
 (Bruce) (20:09):  I commend the member for Dunkley for the motion that he has brought before the House today. This is a very important issue. It affects the entire Australian community and, no doubt as a constituent of his in the seat of Dunkley and the beach down at Frankston, and the sand and the not-quite surf, certainly it is a situation where he knows, and I know, that that community spends a lot of time outdoors and down the beach on the Mornington Peninsula, and many people in those circumstances are susceptible to skin damage and sun exposure. Probably the member for Dunkley and I are examples more than most. I tend to go from white to pink, to very pink, then back to white. It takes some time, but I know to be careful because I am someone who is a prime example of what can go wrong in a situation where we suffer too much from sun exposure. From the circumstances of having lived for many years with my ex-wife, who was a very fine clinical nurse coordinator for many years at Peter MacCallum, I used to hear the terrible stories on a regular basis of the tragedy of those who suffered, particularly from skin cancers, and the nature of what that can do to a family and to an individual. It certainly brings home to you the fact that this is a very serious subject matter, although we might make light of it on occasion


As the motion says, the incident of skin cancer in Australia is the highest in the world and is two to three times that seen in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom, and skin cancers account for around 80 per cent of all newly diagnosed cancers in Australia. There is no doubt that the rates of melanoma and non-melanoma cancers are on the rise, and although we are seeing a general improvement in attitudes towards tanning, we are still seeing people getting too much sun, and sun protection among young adults and adults is still far from ideal. There was recent information from the Cancer Council with respect to this in a study that was released in February this year, just a few days ago. I quote from that survey:


The research, published in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health, compares the results of the National Sun Protection Survey conducted in summer 2010-11 with the surveys from 2003-4 and 2006-7.


The proportion of adults desiring a tan fell from 39% in 2003-4 and 32% 2006-7, to 27% in 2010-11. Fewer reported getting sunburnt at the weekend—18% in 2003-4 compared with 13% in 2010-11.


Similar changes were reported for adolescents. The proportion of adolescents desiring a tan fell from 60% in 2003-4 and 51% in 2006-7, to 45% in 2010-11 and 25% were sunburnt in 2003-4 and 24% in 2006-7, falling to 21% in 2010-11.


…   …   …


But one in five adolescents and one in eight adults still report getting sunburnt so while attitudes towards tanning are improving, we are still seeing people getting too much sun. This means that approximately 363,000 adolescents and two million adults are still getting sunburnt on any given summer weekend.


…   …   …


Sun protection among adolescents and adults is still far from ideal, with only 23% of adolescents and 45% of adults wearing hats when outdoors. The decrease in adults and adolescents spending time outdoors and hence less sunburn in 2010-11, may also reflect a very wet summer that year. 


…   …   …


While improvements in behaviour are being made, worryingly the number of skin cancers reported is still increasing. The Medical Journal of Australia reported that the total number of non-melanoma skin cancers increased from 412,493 in 1997 to 767,347 in 2010. It is estimated that this will increase to 938,991 by 2015. The cost of treating these cancers exceeds $500 million per year.


When we look at non-melanoma skin cancers, fortunately, the mortality rate is relatively low, but there were still some 445 deaths reported in 2010. Melanoma itself is the fifth most commonly diagnosed cancer, with 11,545 new cases in 2009. It is also the seventh most common cause of cancer death, with 1,452 deaths in 2010. Compared with most cancers, melanoma has a high five-year relative survival with over 90 per cent of people alive five years after their initial diagnosis.


But the incidence rate of melanoma has been rising since national records began in 1982. It is projected that there will be 17,517 new cases of melanoma diagnosed in 2020, an increase of 6,052 cases or 52 per cent compared to the 2009 figure. This is a big problem. It is a problem that is with the community now and getting worse—all the more reason for people to be aware and to take action so that they do not become a statistic.


The motion also talks about supporting policies that focus on early detection, which would in turn significantly reduce the number of Australian lives lost to skin cancer every year. Fighting cancer through prevention, early detection and evidence based treatment and care remain key government priorities. Since 2007, the Australian government has invested more than $2.5 billion in infrastructure, medicines, screening and research to build a world-class cancer care system.


One of the key issues that many of us get involved with when we are looking at the question of what is the best way to deal with skin care is how strong the sunscreen is. We now have on sale sun protection factor ratings of up to 50-plus. That will help in ensuring that people get the sort of preventative care that they need to manage in the Australian skin.


A national skin cancer awareness campaign that ran from 2007-07 to 2009-10 saw some $20 million spent over those four consecutive summers to ensure that there was better awareness of the issue within the community. There have been a range of research grants provided in recent years to try and improve understanding of the nature of the problem, into the early detection of melanoma and into the diagnosis and treatment cancers. That research is important.


The motion also notes the importance of training for general practitioners to ensure that family doctors are able to recognise, diagnose and treat the various forms of precursors or early stages of skin cancer. That is incredibly important. Dermatologists play a crucial role, but the family GP is often going to be the first contact point. The points made by the member for Dunkley about the need for people to more aware of their skin were good ones. People need to ensure that they look for moles that may be changing in shape, size or colour. People need to be on the front foot. Often men are the biggest problem here, because basically on medical issues we are largely stupid.




Mr Hartsuyker:
  Don't admit anything!




Mr GRIFFIN:
  Frankly, we have to think about that more often. Sucking it up can in fact mean that in the end you give it up. That is not what you want to do in the circumstances. I did not catch the interjection from the member for Cowper, so I will not respond in a way that might be inappropriate. I will say that he, with his electorate being on the beautiful north coast, understands the importance of this issue.


The motion also acknowledges the work of anti-cancer community organisations, the medical fraternity and the pharmaceutical industry in increasing the awareness of skin cancer and risk prevention strategies, promoting the importance of regular skin checks and facilitating affordable access to skin checks and early stage treatments. You need a holistic approach when it comes to dealing with issues like this. You need to be in a situation in which you keep people informed, you keep looking for new answers and you do not rest on your laurels.


I would like to mention one particular skin cancer awareness campaign that was kicked off in November last year in Skin Cancer Action Week. It targeted that group that I mentioned before that are largely stupid when it comes to the question of their own care. It is a campaign with John Newcombe and Tony Roche, two great Australian tennis players. The slogan is 'Newk and Rochey say ""Watch your back!""'. In November 2012, tennis legends Newcombe and Roche joined Cancer Council Australia and the Australasian College of Dermatologists to urge all men aged 45 and over to watch their backs as part of Skin Cancer Action Week. Watching your backs in this case relates to the question of skin cancer, not what we would normally be involved in in this place!


What I can say is that men in this age group are at more than double the risk of dying of melanoma than women of the same age. Although melanoma can develop anywhere on the body, around one in three cases in men occur on the back. Men aged 45 and over are likely to have spent a lot of time in the sun in their younger years before we had skin cancer awareness campaigns. 'Slip, slop, slap' started when I was in my twenties and by then I had spent a lot of time out in the sun. Being aware and checking what is going on with your own skin, with your own body and with your own life is a really important thing for men and women to do. We have a responsibility to look after ourselves. These problems will grow in the future. We have a responsibility to ensure that we look after our mates and those around us. If we work together on these issues, we can make a positive impact.


Some of the improvements in community attitudes that I mentioned earlier are an important part of a change that is occurring within Australian society. But if we are going to get to where the member for Dunkley mentioned—being world leaders in some of these areas—we need to keep working at it. This is a motion that is important, because it is important to raise awareness in the Australian community. It is an issue that confronts all of us all of the time. I commend the motion to the House.

Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (20:19):  I commend the member for Bruce for his speech on this motion. I commend the member for Macarthur for stepping into the breach for me by seconding this motion. I am the seconder of this motion in the papers, but unfortunately I was not here in time to be able to do it in the chamber. I thank the member for Macarthur. I commend the member for Dunkley for this motion. The member for Dunkley is an extremely committed member of parliament and someone very dedicated to his electorate and to causes in his electorate. As his is a coastal electorate, he understands the importance of this issue. It is fantastic—and I did not realise this until I heard him speak—that there is a business in his electorate that has developed mole-mapping technology, which is going to be absolutely crucial in the fight against skin cancer. I commend the member for Dunkley for bringing this motion forward. It was an honour for me to be able to second it. It is an honour to be able to talk on this motion tonight.


Skin cancer is something that is growing in prevalence, sadly, in our society. It is something that we must tackle immediately. I have the honour of being one of the co-convenors of the group 'parliamentarians supporting cancer causes'. The very first breakfast that we had was about melanoma. During that breakfast, Marie Karakousis spoke. She has had melanoma. It was one of the most heartfelt speeches that I have heard in this House. It really brought home for me the need for us all to be very vigilant when it comes to skin cancer. 


As a matter of fact, I must thank the House of Representatives and the parliament, because, as a result of bringing doctors to Parliament House to look at people's skin and check them, I went and had a check and I found that I needed to have two skin cancers removed. Fortunately, after they went for testing they were found to be benign. I have also been recommended to go and get mole mapping, which is something that I am going to do. For those who have spent a lot of time under the sun in regional and rural Australia, it is particularly important that you check your body constantly to ensure that there are not moles which could potentially develop into melanomas.


This motion here tonight is extremely timely. The member for Dunkley went through the six key points that you should always have in mind when it comes to dealing with skin cancer. We have moved on a little bit from the Slip, Slop, Slap campaign—that was a great start in making people aware of the need to make sure they covered their skin, especially when the UV was at its highest—but we need to do a lot more now. We have to make sure that we watch our skin and we need to look for any unusual signs that there might be something which is occurring which should not be, and make sure that we get straight onto it and get to our doctors. We also have to make sure that our doctors have the skills to be able to quickly identify potential melanomas and have them dealt with. We also need to keep improving the technology and we have to keep investing in the drugs to deal with skin cancer. Drugs which deal with skin cancer are still extremely expensive and the research into it is still in its infancy. Therefore, we have to make sure there is the money that can go into the medical research to deal with these issues. I commend this motion to the House, I commend the government members for supporting it, but in particular, I commend the member for Dunkley for putting this on the agenda in this House tonight.

"Georganas, Steve, MP",ALP,2013-02-11,"



Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh—Second Deputy Speaker) (20:24):  For most Australians, summer means the beach, barbecues and a variety of other outdoor activities. In my electorate of Hindmarsh, we are lucky enough to have some of the best, most beautiful beaches in Australia, as well as parks, recreational spaces and sporting grounds. These places support our community to be healthy and active, which is important. Like all Australians, I want us to be able to enjoy the lifestyle that we have here in Australia, but there is a danger that too many people who are using these outdoor spaces are ignoring. As we heard from the speaker before, while most of us know—and have known for many years—about the dangers of skin cancer and the clear evidence linking sun exposure to skin cancers, it is still the most common cancer in Australia. We have the world's highest incidence of skin cancers; Australians are four times more likely to develop a skin cancer than any other form of cancer, and approximately two in three Australians will be diagnosed with skin cancer before the age of 70.


While anyone can be at risk of developing skin cancer, the risk increases as you get older. These figures alone are worrying, but there are real and significant personal and economic costs associated with skin cancers. In South Australia alone, about 115 people die from melanoma skin cancer every year. Recent research has found the total costs of treating non-melanoma skin cancers swelled from $264 million in 2001 to $511 million in 2010. This will increase dramatically in the future as our population ages, unless we act now. Even more worrying is the fact that we can prevent skin cancers, but we do not. The majority of skin cancers in Australia are caused by exposure to UV radiation in sunlight and prevention is the single most effective way to save lives, but not enough of us are taking action to reduce this unnecessary exposure. While some steps to address this issue are being taken around the country—with several states, including my very own, announcing plans to ban, for example, commercial tanning beds, which should be applauded—more needs to be done. The biggest issue appears to be that too many of us are complacent about the risks, and we need to take even greater action to protect ourselves from the sun. This issue does not stand alone and should not be the sole responsibility of any single authority or person.


A good example of the broad action required is that a number of schools across my electorate including Sacred Heart College in Somerton Park, Star of the Sea School in Henley Beach and the primary school that I attended, Cowandilla Primary School, just to name a few, were able to build shade structures for their students through the BER funding. Personal responsibility is also paramount and we all need to avoid sunburn by minimising sun exposure, especially in the middle of the day when UV levels are most intense. We need to seek shade and wear a hat that covers the head, neck and ears. We need to wear sun protective clothing and close-fitting sunglasses and sunscreen, which is so important, and we need to avoid using solariums or tanning salons. Where we cannot prevent skin cancer, we must support policies that enable early detection to reduce the number of Australian lives that are needlessly lost to skin cancer every single year, because over 95 per cent of skin cancers can be successfully treated, if found early.


All Australians should become familiar with their skin. Check all of your skin, not just in exposed areas and if you notice anything unusual including any change in shape, colour or size, or the development of a spot, please visit your doctor as soon as possible. I wholeheartedly support the view that prevention is better than cure and we need to do more to take action to reduce those risks as well as educate our friends, family and workmates about the seriousness of, and the susceptibility to, skin cancer. I also want to acknowledge the important work of organisations like the Cancer Council, Surf Life Saving South Australia and schools, as well as the many GPs and health professionals who undertake to care for and educate our community on this important matter. In fact, one of the local chemists at West Beach had a Get to Know Your Skin Day where you could have your skin looked at and any unusual spots were recorded.(Time expired)

"Prentice, Jane, MP",LP,2013-02-11,"



Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (20:30):  I rise to support the member for Dunkley's motion on skin cancer. As my colleagues have already acknowledged throughout this debate, the incidence of skin cancer in Australia is the highest in the world, and is two to three times that seen in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom. In Australia skin cancers account for around 80 per cent of all newly diagnosed cancers. Queensland is world renowned for its warm and sunny weather, which lends itself to the outdoor lifestyle that so many of us enjoy—whether it be at the beach or at a backyard barbeque with friends. Sadly, however, our increased exposure to the sun means that Queensland has the highest rate of skin cancer in the world. Indeed I, like many of my friends, regularly have treatment for skin cancer after many, many years of doing the wrong thing.


According to the latest figures available from Cancer Council Queensland, 3,007 Queenslanders were diagnosed with a melanoma of the skin in 2009, with 250 dying from the disease. Of those, 1,757 were male and 1,250 were female. In addition to those diagnosed with a melanoma, approximately 133,000 non-melanoma skin cancer cases are diagnosed in Queensland each year. Experts agree that early detection will significantly reduce the number of Australians who lose their lives to skin cancer every year. Beyond that, there are a number of simple measures we can all take to prevent skin cancer: minimise your time in the sun between 10am and 3pm, seek shade where possible, wear suitable clothing that provides good sun protection, wear a hat that also protects your neck and ears and apply SPF-30 or higher, water-resistant sunscreen at least 20 minutes before going out into the sun.


As members of this parliament know, I am an extremely proud supporter of the research being undertaken at the University of Queensland in my electorate. I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the outstanding work of one of my constituents, Professor Adele Green, who is this year's Queensland Australian of the Year. Professor Adele Green, who holds an adjunct appointment with University of Queensland's School of Population Health, is a leading melanoma researcher based at the Queensland Institute of Medical Research. Professor Green has been at the forefront of melanoma research for 20 years. As head of Cancer and Population Studies at the Queensland Institute of Medical Research, her work focuses on assessing the impact of environmental factors in the cause and prognosis of melanomas, as well as the effect of genes on the development of melanoma. Professor Green's research establishing that daily sunscreen use can halve the risk of melanoma set the benchmark for prevention. Recently, Professor Green was lead author on a study of more than 26,000 Queenslanders diagnosed early with thin melanomas, which revealed a 20-year survival rate for 96 per cent of patients. The study has been described as a blueprint for assessing thin melanomas with a risk of metastatic disease. Professor Green has also been recognised for her contribution to public health, including Indigenous health, and her leadership in the wider scientific community. I congratulate Professor Adele Green on her work, which is benefiting not just Queenslanders but all Australians.


I also recognise the work of a team of researchers at the University of Queensland's Institute of Molecular Bioscience, whose work was named as one of the 10-best research projects of 2012. IMB Director, Professor Brandon Wainright, his co-chief investigator, Pritinder Kaur, and their team are researching skin cancer and, in particular, basal cell carcinoma. Professor Wainright and his team have made great headway in understanding the genetic pathway behind skin cancer and generating the replenishment of damaged skin. The team's first major breakthrough came with a discovery of the gene named 'patched', which causes basal cell carcinoma. In mapping the gene, they discovered that 'patched' is part of a larger genetic pathway called the 'hedgehog pathway'. The hedgehog pathway is a very important pathway that almost every organ in our body uses to develop. However, it also contributes to the development of a wide range of tumour types. The team is now working to prove that the cells generated by manipulating the hedgehog pathway are true stem cells, and they can cause the hedgehog pathway to affect, repair and regenerate skin. This is important work which has far-reaching applications, including for the treatment of burns and improving our ability to heal wounds. While this groundbreaking research will undoubtedly assist those with more advanced forms of skin cancer, it is essential that Queenslanders regularly examine their skin for signs of skin cancer, especially if they are in the older age group or have sun-damaged skin or multiple moles and freckles, because in doing so, and combined with ongoing research I hope we will see skin cancer significantly decline— (Time expired)

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2013-02-11,"



Ms HALL
 (Shortland) (20:35):  I rise to support the motion moved by the member for Dunkley, a motion that raises awareness of skin cancer in Australia—and Australia has the highest rate of skin cancer in the world. In Australia, we have a lifestyle built around outdoor living and a culture of surf, sun and sand. Australians have always been proud of their bronzed Aussie image, but by trying to become the bronzed Aussie, Australians are potentially putting their lives at risk. The No. 1 cause of skin cancer in Australia is exposure to ultra-violet, or UV, rays. This motion before us raises awareness and points us to the fact that we need to act now.


Skin cancer is divided into two categories: melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers. Non-melanoma skin cancers are the most common in Australia—these are basal and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin. It is estimated that about 474,000 new cases of these cancers will have been diagnosed in 2012, although we do not have those figures as yet. The mortality rate from non-melanoma skin cancers is very low, with 445 deaths reported in 2010. Melanoma is the fifth-most commonly diagnosed cancer, with 11,545 new cases in 2009—but, once again, those are the latest figures. In 2002 Australia had the highest skin cancer rate in the world, as all speakers have pointed out, and about two in three Australians will be diagnosed with non-melanoma skin cancer by the time they reach 70. All my family has had some form of non-melanoma skin cancer. As my mother aged she was constantly having non-melanoma skin cancers removed. It is very common. The older you get the more common it becomes.


The incidence rate of melanoma has been rising. National records began in 1982. It is projected that there will be 17,570 new cases of melanoma diagnosed in 2020, an increase of 6,025 cases, or a 50 per cent increase in comparison with 2009 figures. The cost of treating skin cancer was estimated at $294 million in 2001, and the figure for melanoma was $30 million. Skin cancer places an enormous cost on our health resources. Amongst all hospitalisations with the principal diagnosis of cancer, non-melanoma skin cancer is the most common and melanoma is the 10th most common.


The Australian government has had a commitment to fighting skin cancer. Since 2007 it has invested $2.5 billion in infrastructure, medicine, screening and research. But the real change that needs to take place is a cultural one. We can see that happening with younger people in our society and with children when they are going to school. The culture is changing. Hats are compulsory at schools and the building of COLAs in schools are also giving young children protection against UV rays. Childhood is when the damage really occurs that leads to skin cancer in later life.


I come from the Hunter, where we have been identified by the Cancer Council as being one of the zones that are on the red alert, as is the Central Coast. In those areas we have higher incidence of skin cancer than in other areas. So I would like to encourage the people I represent to think very carefully about skin cancer and what they do. I encourage them to take five steps to save their skin: seek shade, wear protective clothing, wear a broad rimmed hat, wear sunglasses and repeatedly reapply your sunscreen.

At the moment enterprise migration agreements can have a massive impact on the Australian labour market, yet they are completely unregulated. The immigration minister is in effect able to have a big impact on wages and conditions in this country. The Protecting Local Jobs (Regulating Enterprise Migration Agreements) Bill 2012 not only will ensure greater transparency but will put the government to the obligation of applying a simple test. Before an enterprise migration agreement can be signed it will have to be shown that the employer has advertised the job locally and it has not been able to be filled. That is a very simple test and one that I think most people in this country would agree with as a sensible precondition before we seek workers from offshore.

Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (20:41):  I have pleasure in seconding the motion on the second reading of the Protecting Local Jobs (Regulating Enterprise Migration Agreements) Bill 2012. In Queensland, I think the sale of the railways damaged the government in such a way that it could never recover. Also, I think the flying in of 1,740 miners from overseas to make Gina Rinehart richer will damage this government in much the same way. They do not stand up to talk politics, having said that—because I am just trying to scare you blokes into doing the right thing. I am afraid that my scare tactics have failed miserably.


According to the paper—I was looking at it just before I came in—the coal seam gas industry is reputed to provide $45 billion to the Australian economy. This is an absolutely colossal amount of money. The people sitting on that side of the House and on this side of the House gave the entire gas industry away to foreigners. Depending on which set of figures you want to use, it was in the range of 83 per cent to 87 per cent, but another seven per cent is being negotiated for sale as we speak. So you are looking at around 90 per cent of the industry being foreign owned.


The $45 billion comes into Australia at Gladstone and at the two liquefaction plants in Western Australia, and there is one proposed for the Northern Territory. There are no wages—it is just in a pipe with a motor pumping the gas without any requirement for labour. Yes, there will be about 4,000 jobs, but what Australia will be getting out of this vast resource is very, very small beer. We have the highest electricity charges in the world. A lot of other countries have reserved the gas so that they can provide cheap electricity. We have the cheapest electricity in the world in Queensland because my mentor, the great Ron Camm, had taken one-tenth of Utah's coal, and taken it for free, and fired up the Gladstone power station, which was one of the biggest in the world at the time.


Charlie McDonald, the first member for Kennedy—you will see his wonderful painting as you walk out of here—was one of the founders of the labour movement in Australia. His first seven speeches in this place were about shipped-in foreign workers. The founding principles of the Labor Party were that we had fought and literally died. Three people were shot dead at Dagwood Station—Waltzing Matilda—in the sit-in that occurred there. They were bringing these people in from overseas to undermine our pay and conditions that we had fought so hard for. It is eternally shameful to be associated with the current government in Australia, which has been the government responsible not only for the fly-ins but also the section 457s. Opposition spokesman Mr Bourke criticised the Liberal Party about it. They brought in many more section 457s than anyone else. In many towns, like Mackay, Mount Isa and even my own town, Cloncurry, it is becoming 'Spot the Australian', because they are all foreign fly-in workers. If they are working for Australian pay and conditions then I am a Martian astronaut! And all of this is to make Mrs Rinehart rich. You must really be very committed to looking after the billionaires of Australia when you have given all the gas resources away to foreigners. (Time expired)

Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (20:45):  I welcome the debate and am enjoying the debate. It is at times confused. We have spent as much time on coal-seam gas as we did on EMAs. But it is always entertaining. What I find interesting about the proposition is that it has been brought before the House by the member of Melbourne—in goodwill—to restrict migration into this country of skilled workers needed in areas of workforce shortage. It follows hot on the heels of attempts by the member for Melbourne and others in his party to have effectively an uncapped refugee program in this country. We have a confused migration debate surrounding this particular issue.


I want to say a couple of things about the issue. I come from the electorate of Throsby in Illawarra, New South Wales; in my electorate one in four workers comes from somewhere else. If you walk down the main street of any suburb in my electorate on any day, you could hear Macedonian, Italian, Greek, Scottish, Irish and English accents, and that is before you get to the corner. They have all come to Australia in search of work and a better life. We are not unfamiliar with people coming to Australia, bringing their skills, their hopes and their wishes to this country, looking for a better life and opportunities in our workforce. There is nothing new about us bringing new migrant workers into this country.


It is equally true that there is deep unease within the community surrounding 457 visas and enterprise migration agreements. If you drill into the heart of the concerns about these two issues, it gets down to one simple proposition, which is that if we have both unemployment and job opportunities in this country then the job opportunities should be going to the people who are unemployed ahead of us bringing people in from other places.




Mr Katter:
  There are 200,000 in Queensland and 80,000 in WA.




Mr STEPHEN JONES:
  You have had your opportunity, Bob, and it was very entertaining. It was not on point, but it was very entertaining. The objective is to give Australians the first crack at a job, whether it is in the resource sector or anywhere else. That is a proposition that I wholeheartedly support.


The problem with the proposition is that it is misconceived on one particular point, which I will go to. It says that EMAs should not be used unless a job is advertised. The problem with that is that in most instances the job will not exist at the time that the enterprise migration agreement is struck, because an enterprise migration agreement is an agreement which is struck before a project actually starts. It is struck because a lot of these resource projects are getting up and going in remote parts of Australia where there is not a labour force. The history with many of these companies is that they find it very difficult to attract workers to those places. However, they have to attract finance for the project and they have to get their bankers all lined up and their planning all lined up. The one variable that they cannot get lined up in advance is their labour force. So the enterprise migration agreement is the one piece of the puzzle that can enable the project to get up and running. It is not a blank piece of paper, because all the enterprise migration agreements will have a set of conditions that say you cannot bring somebody in on a 457 visa unless you have met those conditions. One of those conditions is that there is nobody available to employ within Australia. I know from my experience that there have been circumstances where local workers have been overlooked in favour of other people, because I have had these people come into my office and talk to me about it. The problem is not with the enterprise migration agreement; it is with the compliance and the policing of the conditions within that agreement.


I would say that this bill is misconceived. It has a noble purpose. The noble purpose is to ensure that Australian workers are at the front of the queue, but I suggest that there may be better ways of achieving that than the legislation that is currently before the House.

Mr MORRISON
 (Cook) (20:50):  We like to speak romantically about the Snowy Mountains Hydro Scheme, the post-war migration labour force that built it and the testament it is to the successful immigration program. But I wonder when I listen to what those in the Labor Party and the trade union movement say about skilled and semi-skilled migration whether these are just stories they like to tell and whether they actually believe the sentiments behind them.


More than 100,000 people, from over thirty countries, came to the mountains to work on that project. Those workers were Australian-born, German, Greek, Irish, Italian, Norwegian, British, Polish and Yugoslav. Up to 7,300 workers provided their labour at any one time. Seventy per cent of all workers were migrants and most migrant workers on the scheme arrived under assisted migration schemes The project cost $820 million to complete at the time and, if repeated today, it would be worth $8 billion to the Australian economy.


In my home town of Sydney, migrants also came to work on another major feat of engineering, the Warragamba Dam—a project that took 20 years to build and at times involved more 1,800 people working across three shifts, seven days a week, to get the job done. The workers were drawn from more than 25 different nationalities. The labour was very difficult and dangerous and 14 men lost their lives in the course of the dam's construction.


A project such as the Snowy, which had an economic contribution of $8 billion in today's terms, makes me think about the Roy Hill Mine project. This project is worth $9.5 billion to Australia, will employ more than 6,000 Australians and requires a maximum of 1,700 foreign skilled workers. Under the agreement, the company will provide up to 2,000 training places for Australians, including 230 apprentices and trainees and preparing 110 indigenous Australians for work in construction. English-language requirements are consistent with what is required under the 457 program, which commenced under the Howard government. The arrangements would be reviewed every six to 12 months, and employers would be bound by migration law to provide overseas workers with the same terms and conditions of employment as Australian project employees. This was all carefully engineered to protect Australian workers and act as a disincentive to the exploitation of foreign labour. If backed up and competently implemented—a big ask for this government—enterprise migration agreements do represent good policy. The government often complains about the lack of support from coalition for their policy measures. We have always said that when you come up with a good policy, we will support. Well guess what? They did. Amazing, I know, but they have come up with a good policy with enterprise migration agreements and we support them.


The government also seeks this bipartisan support, but on the day of the Prime Minister's announcement of the Roy Hill EMA the Prime Minister amazingly claimed to be furious, caved into union pressure and hung her then immigration minister out to dry, casting doubt over the arrangement and the policy. With the departure of that minister, its one remaining champion being the minister for resources, this enterprise migration agreement will be an orphan. We are into another year—this was announced in May—and the agreement and deed has still not been signed. I suppose it is some comfort for the Greens to know that the incompetence of this government will ensure that this EMA will never be signed, it will never happen and they will have nothing to worry about from their perspective. But this creates a real issue in terms of this government's sincerity when they talk about a skilled migration program. When they go out there and talk to investors, they say one thing and announce grand schemes and policies only to never be able to follow through. It now rests with the new Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, from clan O'Connor of the CFMEU clan, who will be there and in a position to oversee whether this arrangement is finalised. I am not going to hold my breath. I do not think the investors will and I do not think the project proponents will, because this policy is withering on the vine and I have no doubt that it will wither with this new union dominated minister.


The bill as intentioned simply tries to add further regulation and further regulatory burden to an already overcomplicated arrangement. The coalition wants to take the regulatory burden off the back of business in this country, not continue to stifle it as this government has done with thousands upon thousands of new regulations bundled onto the back of business in this country and stifling innovation. If you want to know why productivity has fallen off, it is because this government has killed innovation through overregulation. The one key commitment, above all others that the coalition has given to restore productivity, is to attack over regulation. That is why we will not be supporting this bill. We will not be supporting this bill and the government will join us in opposing this bill, but I guarantee you that this government will never sign an EMA.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (20:55):  The former New Zealand politician and head of the World Trade Organisation Michael Moore once had a terrific analogy to describe those who would argue for more foreign aid but also argue for less trade and less migration. He said that attitude was the like the attitude of someone who puts money in the collection plate on Sundays but then behaves badly to the disadvantaged for the rest of the week. It is with the same concern that I rise to speak on this bill today. The attitude that says that we ought to increase our foreign aid, that we ought to increase our refugee intake, but that when workers in our region want to come to Australia to improve their skills and send some remittances back we ought to slam the door in their faces. That is not an attitude that is consistent with the values that I hold dear.


The member for Kennedy was right about one thing in his speech. He said that the old Labor Party would have supported this, and there is an episode of my party's history of which I am not particularly proud. In its early founding in the beginning part of the 20th century it was the party of white Australia and the party that railed against Kanakas. That Labor Party perhaps would have supported this motion, but that Labor Party is gone. Members in this place who said that 'two Wongs don't make a white' have been replaced by members such as Minister Wong, of whom I am greatly proud. Ours is now a party of markets and multiculturalism, a party that recognises that if you do not bring in 1,700 workers to work on a resource project then 6,000 Australian jobs are gone. EMAs are fundamentally about improving the access to megaprojects for Australians. Workers can only come in under EMAs if they are essential to the project. There are key training requirements and this bill would render those EMAs unworkable. Where it does not contain statements of motherhood and statements that are consistent with what occurs already, it requires the tabling in parliament of commercially sensitive information that would then become publicly available. That would cause no company to go ahead with an EMA. As a result, we would have fewer Australian jobs and fewer overseas workers.


Those overseas workers benefit us and they benefit themselves. My colleague Senator Cameron came to Australia through a migration scheme, part of a great post-war migration, and has greatly enriched Australia. But those skills also benefit people in developing countries when they return. Work by Michael Clemens, Claudio Montenegro and Lant Pritchett have estimated that a Haitian who moves to the United States is six times as productive as that very same person was in Haiti. They learn new skills, send money back and often return to their countries to set up businesses.


If you are in favour of reducing global poverty, you should be in favour of EMAs. If you are in favour of boosting Australian jobs, you should be in favour of EMAs. This is a massive boom. We have seen commodity prices go up tenfold. House prices in Moranbah, Queensland, for example, have risen just in one year from $459,000 to $730,000. We have hundreds of Australians flying in and flying out every week, some of them even from Bali. This is a boom the likes of which we have not seen since the gold rushes. Yes, it is placing stresses on the Australian economy, but the right way to respond to those stresses is to make sure that we do not close ourselves off to the world, that we do not make the mistakes that past generations made under White Australia, that we have EMAs with training requirements and that require employers to test the labour market but recognise that guest workers can sometimes make the difference between a project succeeding and a project falling over. Opposition to EMAs can mean that projects will fall over. If you do not want the 1,700 overseas workers, you will not get the 6,000 Aussie jobs and, furthermore, you will not get the development that goes with EMAs.

That this bill be now read a second time.


I will speak very briefly. The seconder of this motion, the member for Kennedy, is not on the speaking list. To allow him time to speak I will speak very briefly. I refer members and those interested in this to my speech when this bill was introduced.


At the moment enterprise migration agreements can have a massive impact on the Australian labour market, yet they are completely unregulated. The immigration minister is in effect able to have a big impact on wages and conditions in this country. The Protecting Local Jobs (Regulating Enterprise Migration Agreements) Bill 2012 not only will ensure greater transparency but will put the government to the obligation of applying a simple test. Before an enterprise migration agreement can be signed it will have to be shown that the employer has advertised the job locally and it has not been able to be filled. That is a very simple test and one that I think most people in this country would agree with as a sensible precondition before we seek workers from offshore.

Actually, it has been reported that three of the actors who appeared in one of the most successful advertising campaigns of all time have died from cancer. One of those actors was Wayne McLaren. He contracted lung cancer in the early 1990s. He had been a smoker for 25 years and died at the age of 51 in 1992. The Philip Morris company initially tried to deny that McLaren had appeared in the ads but later admitted he had. McLaren spent his last few years testifying in favour of antismoking legislation and trying to convince Philip Morris to limit tobacco advertising. It is said that some of his last words were: 'Take care of the children. Tobacco will kill you and I'm living proof of it.'


Tobacco smoking is the largest preventable cause of disease and death in this nation. Lung cancer is the leading cancer related cause of death, and tobacco smoking is by far the leading cause of lung cancer. Each year, over 560 people die from lung cancer in Brisbane alone, in my home state of Queensland. The incidence of lung cancer in Queensland women has increased 2.3 per cent, while the incidence in men has dropped by 1.6 per cent, according to Cancer Council Queensland. Smoking harms men and women. Women who smoke tobacco are more likely to develop cervical cancer and have a higher risk of having stillborn and low-birth-weight babies. They risk reduced fertility and complications during pregnancy and childbirth. It is disturbing that 32,000 Queensland schoolchildren aged 12 to 17 are smoking weekly. There is significant research that links tobacco smoking with social disadvantage in Australia. Quit Victoria reports that there are now over 19,000 tobacco related deaths each year. 


It is imperative that we do all that we can to reduce the incidence of tobacco smoking. Australia is considered a mature market, meaning that tobacco use is in decline. South-East Asia is now big tobacco's largest market, with six million new smokers recruited in 2009 and another 30 million expected to be added by 2014. The World Health Organization calculates that, of the six million people who will die from tobacco use each year, 80 per cent will be in the developing world. Big Tobacco is determined to get young people in developing countries hooked, and their exploitation is a tragedy. 


This federal Labor government is renowned through the world for its stance against Big Tobacco. I commend the former Attorney-General and Minister for Health and Ageing, the member for Gellibrand, for her courage in taking on and tackling tobacco smoking. Thanks to legislation passed in the House, Australia now has the toughest and most comprehensive antismoking measures in the world. Plain packaging laws have come into effect, and there are many other things that we have done, including listing nicotine patches on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme to reduce the price of those patches, producing rounds of antismoking ads and the like. Sadly, still 15 per cent of Australians are daily smokers—compared with about 50 per cent after the Second World War. The social cost, according to the Cancer Council, is $31 billion. Locally, I congratulate the Ipswich City Council for its stance against smoking, banning it from pedestrian malls such as the Nicholas Street Mall and D'Arcy Doyle Place in the CBD.


All of this is why the Labor Party refuses to accept donations from tobacco companies, and has for years. The Liberal and National parties have long been friends of the tobacco industry. In the 2011 financial year, the coalition accepted almost $263,000 from Big Tobacco—Philip Morris and British American Tobacco. Since 2004, Big Tobacco has donated almost $2 million to the Liberal and National parties. On top of that, in the 2011 financial year Imperial Tobacco and Philip Morris invested $4.74 million in political advertising against the federal Labor government's plain packaging of tobacco products initiative. 


The former Howard government health minister and current Leader of the Opposition infamously said on the ABC's AM program in 2009:


… I personally would not get hung up on something, in my view, as trivial as smoking while the kids are in the car.


And former Liberal senator Nick Minchin infamously said on Q&A in 2010 that smokers die early and actually save us money. How Orwellian. The influence of Big Tobacco is all too pervasive, and there is a list of former Liberal Party identities, like Grahame Morris, Tony Barry, Nick Greiner and Chris Argent, all working for Big Tobacco. It is time for all of us—parties, individuals and MPs—to cut ties to Big Tobacco. It is time to say no to tobacco donations. It is time for the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, to kick the habit and say no to tobacco donations.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2013-02-11,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (21:07):  In Australia, smoking is the largest single cause of death and disease, with about 290 people dying from a smoking related illness every week and a total of 15,500 people dying every year. Smoking rates have significantly declined over the years, but there are still 16.4 per cent of Australian males aged 14 and over, and 13.9 per cent of females aged 14 and over smoking in Australia. They are terrible statistics. These numbers are still much higher than we would like to see, yet when we consider that 72 per cent of men were smoking in 1945 and 33 per cent of women were smoking in 1976 we have can see how low the numbers have dropped. The drop in numbers has occurred as a result of sustained federal, state and territory government education campaigns and tobacco control strategies, including tobacco taxes and advertising restrictions. Amongst men, the highest rates of daily smoking are those aged 30 to 39 and 40 to 49, and for women, amongst those aged 40 to 49. Many of these smokers will have been smoking for at least 20 years of their life—20 years of doing damage to their bodies and also damage to the bodies of those affected by their second-hand passive smoke.


Quitting smoking at any age will have health benefits, and obviously the earlier you stop the better. Quitline details the benefits of quitting which can start to occur as early as only 12 hours after quitting when almost all the nicotine is out of your body. After 24 hours the carbon monoxide, a highly toxic gas, has dramatically decreased in a smoker's bloodstream and oxygen has increased. After a year of not smoking, a person will have halved the risk of dying from heart disease of that of a continuing smoker, and after a decade the risk of lung cancer is less than half of a continuing smoker and continues to decline. Despite these benefits many people continue to smoke. Why? Why do they do this? Perhaps because quitting smoking is one of the most difficult things a person can do.


The United States Surgeon General, Regina Benjamin, has stated that tobacco products are as addictive as heroin. Given 80 per cent of smokers have tried to quit but failed, the strength of the dependence on smoking is clear. I can honestly say I have never put a smoke to my lips. The fact that I am out of breath is due to the fact that I have run all the way from the Senate to get here because it is such an important issue and I wanted to have my words recorded on this. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners identifies smoking as the behavioural risk factor responsible for the highest level of preventable and premature death in Australia, even though the smoking rate continues to fall. The college recognises that, if a general practitioner can stop two potential lifelong smokers, they have saved a life. There is no other intervention for a common problem which is this effective.


Whilst someone who is already smoking is likely to continue to do so, we do not really understand why people choose to take up smoking in the first place. There are multitudes of educational campaigns available, yet studies show that many people remain unaware of the extent of the impact of smoking on the body. They know smoking is bad, just not how bad. This is particularly concerning amongst young people. Schools run educational programs, messages are promoted through television programs, and even friends tell each other about the dangers and consequences of smoking. It is therefore shocking and highly concerning that a 2011 survey of Australian school students found current smoking rates amongst boys aged 12 to 17 to be seven per cent and amongst girls in the same aged bracket to be 6.3 per cent. Why do children so young want to smoke, and where are they getting access to tobacco products?


In my electorate of Riverina, the TAFE NSW Riverina Institute became a smoke-free workplace on 10 April last year. This was done to align with community expectations about smoking zones, and the institute also put systems in place to support staff and students who may have used the smoke-free measure as an inspiration to quit. There can be no better means of helping to curb smoking and to stop it being taken up in the first place than with education campaigns. Whilst current campaigns are working, we need to continue to work on finding the reasons why people initially take it up and then choose to continue to do so. Australia has great support networks such as Quitline to assist those who do wish to give up, and it is important we remember it has to be an individual's decision to quit, but we can ensure there are plenty of measures in place to support them during this difficult time.


My father, Lance, passed away through lung cancer in 2008. I can honestly say that any measures that help save a life from smoking is a measure well worth taking.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2013-02-11,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (21:12):  This is something I do not think I have ever done before, but I commend the member for Riverina for his contribution, and I pass on my kind thoughts to him for his family. In rising to support this motion put forward by the member of the Blair, I think there is a lot of bipartisan support for the motion and the idea that the government needs to recognise that tobacco is still Australia's single most preventative cause of death. At least three million Australians still smoke regularly. Unlike the member for Riverina, I cannot say I have never had a smoke. Thankfully, I did give up back in the seventies when I was still a kid. But, sadly, not before I hooked my older sister, Kerry Shearer, and she still hounds me over that. Out of the nine children who are alive in my family, three of them still smoke. So we are certainly a smoking family. Sadly, smoking kills more than 19,000 Australians every year, and I was horrified to see, when researching this, that it went up from 16,000 in 2003.


Smoking costs society more than $31 billion a year. If all those Australians who smoke were to stop smoking, that would actually create enough money to almost half-fill the opposition's budget black hole, so it is obviously something that there should be bipartisan support for. We must do more to discourage people from smoking and I appeal to all those that have spoken or will speak—members, senators, candidates and political parties—to stop accepting donations from tobacco companies. I was horrified to hear some of those figures from the member from Blair of the amount of money that has rolled into the coffers of those opposite over the last few years from tobacco companies. Obviously, the Labor Government today, in 2013, is no friend of tobacco. Already we have increased the excise by 25 per cent to make smoking less affordable.



Honourable members interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Murphy
):  Order! The member for Moreton will resume his seat. The member for Dawson on a point of order.




Mr Christensen:
  I rise on a point of order. The National Party does not receive funding from tobacco.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Dawson knows that there are other means in which he can make a contribution. The member for Moreton.




Mr PERRETT:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I just confirm that the Liberal-National Party in Queensland receives money from the big tobacco companies. That is the fact. There is opportunity for me to correct the record but that is the actual fact. I was interested to see the member for Dawson rise on that point of order.


The reality is that the Labor government has taken significant steps. We have increased the excise by 25 per cent to make smoking less affordable. We have a great record on tobacco control. We have plain packaging because we introduced the world's first legislation for plain packaging for tobacco products. That was the last front for marketing tobacco products. That legislation was not supported by those opposite. We have also banned internet advertising. 




Dr Southcott:
  That's wrong.




Mr PERRETT:
  Would you like me to show you the tweets that were made by those opposite in terms of not supporting the plain packaging?



Dr Southcott interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Murphy
):  Order! The member for Boothby will desist from interjecting. The member for Moreton has the call.




Mr PERRETT:
  Sorry, Deputy Speaker, I stand corrected by the member for Boothby on that. The nanny-state postcards that I received were not from the Liberal Party. I should stress that, although the nanny-state campaign was certainly supported by some members opposite. I particularly commend the courage of the former Attorney-General, the member for Gellibrand, Nicola Roxon, for her stance on this. 


We put nicotine patches on the PBS, making them more affordable, especially for pensioners and low-income earners. And we have had 111,900 dispensed between February and June, which means lives have been saved because people have stopped smoking. We have the social marketing campaign, under which $85 million was invested in campaigns to encourage Australians to quit smoking. The Quitline investment of $5 million was so that people get the support when they need to get off the darbs. 


Obviously, Indigenous communities have been particularly vulnerable to advertising techniques because their smoking rates have increased—particularly for Indigenous women—so we are putting $100 million into Closing the Gap programs across 57 regions in Australia. There has been a record $872 million invested in preventative health programs, including in Tackling Smoking programs through workplaces and councils. 


Sadly, the Liberal Party does not have the same view as the Labor Party in terms of refusing endorsements from large companies including Big Tobacco like British American Tobacco and Phillip Morris. With $2 million since 2004, obviously the head of that organisation, Brian Loughnane, has made the decision to keep on accepting that money. Obviously the Leader of the Opposition has made his decision to keep on accepting that money. (Time expired)

"Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP",LP,2013-02-11,"



Dr SOUTHCOTT
 (Boothby) (21:17):  I rise to speak on the very important issue of tobacco control in Australia. Currently, smoking is a leading cause of preventable death and disease in Australia. There are approximately 3.3 million Australians who still smoke. Half of all long-term smokers will die prematurely because they smoked. The cost of smoking to the community was $31.5 billion in 2004-05, and it would be of a similar order of magnitude today.


In 2010, 15.1 per cent of people over 14 years old were smoking daily but that has come down considerably from 24.3 per cent 20 years earlier. Australia has much to be proud of in the efforts to reduce the incidence of smoking. We have some of the lowest rates of smoking in the world. However, there is still much more to be done. When you look at what has happened to smoking rates over the last 30 years you find that Australia has seen the largest declines in the rates of smoking. And it is not something that has been occurring all around the world. We have seen drops in smoking rates amongst women in the order of 40 per cent, and that has been matched by some of the Scandinavian countries. But if you look at Europe you find that they have seen increases in female smoking rates over the same time period: five or six per cent in countries like France and Germany, and an incredible 44 per cent in Greece. 


Australia has been particularly successful in reducing the smoking rates through a multi-pronged strategy which involves state governments, local governments and the federal government, and addressing all aspects of tobacco control. But there are still significant disparities in the incidence of smoking within certain social demographics. We still see much higher smoking rates amongst lower socio-economic groups. The unemployed, the homeless, the imprisoned, those suffering mental illness and those with drug or alcohol dependencies are much more likely to smoke. Those living in remote areas are more likely to smoke—28.9 per cent compared with 16.8 per cent in the major cities. In 2008 more than 45 per cent of Indigenous Australians over 15 smoked daily.


The coalition has always had a strong track record when it comes to tobacco control, and we will continue to do so. The coalition presided over the biggest decline in smoking rates whilst we were in government. Under the last coalition government the prevalence of smoking declined from 21.8 per cent in 1998 to 16.6 per cent of Australians over the age of 14 by 2007.


It was Robert Menzies who first introduced a voluntary tobacco advertising code for television in 1966. Malcolm Fraser banned tobacco advertising on TV. Dr Michael Wooldridge, in June 1997, announced what at the time was the biggest ever national advertising campaign against smoking. It was the Howard government, and Tony Abbott as health minister, who introduced the graphic health warnings on tobacco products in 2006—something which I think will be very significant in reducing smoking rates. And it was the coalition who first proposed, in opposition, an increase in the tobacco excise in 2009—a measure which was later adopted by the government. 


There is bipartisan support to reduce the incidence of smoking to under 10 per cent—and it can be done. Jurisdictions like California already have a smoking rate below that level. The COAG agreement details how to get to a smoking rate of below 10 per cent and also how to reduce, specifically, the Indigenous smoking rate.


In January this year, the government released the updated National Tobacco Strategy 2012 to 2018. It sets out the framework to help achieve the goal of 10 per cent. The first National Tobacco Strategy was implemented in 2004 under the Howard government. The renewed strategy has nine priority areas, which include increasing mass advertising, reducing the affordability of tobacco and particularly focusing on those populations with a high prevalence of smoking. I think the approach of focusing on all of those nine areas will be the way to get to below 10 per cent. 


Reaching the bipartisan target of 10 per cent will require a comprehensive and sustained approach to tobacco control. There is no one solution and we need to continue to look at all of the approaches outlined in the National Tobacco Strategy to reach those 2018 targets.

Ms SAFFIN
 (Page—Government Whip) (21:22):  I am pleased to be able to speak to this motion that the honourable member for Blair has put before the House, because tobacco fundraising is really not something that we should be making money out of or taking money from. I am also pleased that on 23 June 2011 this House endorsed, without dissent, that all political parties should stop accepting donations from big tobacco. This is one of the current debates in public life and an issue that goes to integrity. There are also these debates going on about superannuation funds and other things like that, about where money is invested and where we put our money. Even though that went through the House, I know that the same cannot be said for the coalition because it seems that the long arm of big tobacco reaches into this chamber.


I say this knowing that over the years political parties have taken donations from all sorts of companies, but there comes a time when you draw a line in the sand and you say, 'Enough.' You refuse it, you withdraw from it and you say, 'I will not be taking any money.' It is really time that everybody in this place, including the coalition, took heed of that as an issue of integrity and also took heed of that motion that actually did go through the House. 


New figures from the Australian Electoral Commission show that big tobacco has invested at least $7 million to influence Canberra since 2004. One of the things that has been interesting with the whole debate on plain packaging and all of that was the extent that the big tobacco companies went to in trying to influence and lobby people and the way they used the legal system to try to stop that as well. They talked about it in terms of free trade, which was really just a lot of nonsense. It just shows the extent they will go to.


It is not as if we are talking about something that is benign; we are talking about something that kills and we know that it kills. We are not talking about banning it, even though some people say, 'If you are going to do this, you should.' We should not, because there has to be a way that we can deal with it—but it does kill. Even though it is in decline in a lot of areas of Australia, South-East Asia—our region, our neighbours—is now big tobacco's biggest market, with six million new smokers recruited in 2009 and another 30 million expected to be added by 2014. The World Health Organization calculates that, of the six million people who will die from tobacco use each year, 80 per cent of them will be in the developing world. So, really, it is an industry that has no moral compass at all. There is no responsibility taken for the lives that it affects.


When I was said 'all of us in this place, including the coalition', I did mean the Liberals but also the National Party. When I look at the list of donations that go to the political parties, I see that they go to the National Party as well. I think I have heard people say here that it does not, but it actually does. It is something that should be stopped.



Dr Southcott interjecting—

(

Ms SAFFIN:
  The people on the other side can throw out whatever they like, but the fact is that it is the people I am talking about on the other side who take the donations. You can do something about it. Shame on you as a doctor as well, because you know better.


In addition, what I would like to say in conclusion is that 15,000 Australians die from smoking related diseases every year. That is more than the people who are employed by big tobacco in this country, and big tobacco says that the new laws will cost the industry jobs. What about the industry and smoking costing lives?

Mr LAMING
 (Bowman) (21:27):  This is a most serious motion that should have been brought to this place by serious members of this parliament, but in effect what we have is a juvenile attempt—presumably by this Prime Minister—to belittle the issue of smoking and take the most innocent and ill-informed government MPs from Queensland, and a wannabe Queensland MP from the government's side as well, to prosecute this ridiculous debate about donations.




Ms KING:
  Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member has just impugned another member and I ask you to call him to order, please.



The SPEAKER:  The member for Bowman should address the motion. If he is going to treat this motion seriously, perhaps he could refer to it.




Mr LAMING:
  What we have here is a juvenile approach to a very serious issue. One in five Aboriginal Australians die of a smoking related illness. These three have presumably been sent down into this great chamber with speaking notes from the Prime Minister's office; you can almost hear the advisers giggling away in the Prime Minister's office, saying, 'Yes, go on, make a political point out of smoking.' What a disgrace! We know how serious this is. There has been bipartisan support about this and all you can make is a juvenile point, direct from your own leader's office.


If you were serious about smoking and the 49 per cent of remote Aboriginal Australians who are desperately trying to kick the habit, you would be more worried about what our Indigenous coordinator is doing, you would be more interested in the investment that is going on in small communities right across this nation to kick smoking and you would take the lead from my previous coalition speaker, who gave a dispassionate, well-informed and completely sober analysis of smoking—which we have not had from the government's side. This is one of these 9.25 pm giggles that is not even worthy of being brought into this chamber. There is no mention of the money from alcohol outlets that the other side of the chamber relies on and there is no mention of the gambling money that festoons itself in the ACT through the Workers Club and the Tradesmen's Club which keeps your entire campaign in the ACT afloat.



The SPEAKER:  I don't think it keeps my campaign afloat. The use of the word 'you' is not appreciated.




Mr LAMING:
  There is the fact that so much more money is taken on the areas of gambling, but of course there is no mention of the great social harm that makes: quite prepared to be holier than thou after a 2004 decision but not willing to pay back any of the money the Labor Party took from smoking companies prior to that; just quite happy to make a cheap political point ever since. This is a serious matter, probably the greatest health challenge facing this nation. We had half an hour in this chamber to address this in a sober way, and that is something that has not happened from this government.

"Gash, Joanna, MP",LP,2013-02-11,"



Mrs GASH
 (Gilmore) (21:30):  Marilia Pereira is Australia's first neurological nurse educator. Marilia was appointed by Parkinson's Australia following a federal funding grant to support the position for two years. The position was located in Nowra and evolved from an initiative of the Parliamentary Friends of Parkinson's group, of which I was chair when in government. I was first introduced to Parkinson's through Rod Irwin, a former diplomat, who was living in Moss Vale when that was in Gilmore. Rod has since passed away, but I will be forever grateful for his guidance on the matter. The group is a bipartisan group with members from across the political spectrum unified by their concern towards sufferers of this insidious and endemic disease.


According to Deloitte Access Economics, it is conservatively estimated that in 2011 over 64,000 Australians were living with Parkinson's; 52 per cent were male and 48 per cent were female. This equates to 283 per 100,000 of the total Australian population, or 857 per 100,000 among the over 50s. I hasten to add that at any time there are many more who are yet to be diagnosed and remain unaware that they have the disease. Based on these estimates alone, approximately one in every 350 people in Australia lives with Parkinson's. Over 80 per cent of sufferers are aged over 65 years. Given Gilmore's above-average demographic in this age group, this was one of the reasons the pilot program was established there. Not only is that figure growing, but victims of the disease are increasingly younger. In 2011 across Australia, nearly 30 new diagnoses of Parkinson's were made every day—30 a day; imagine that. During my period with the Parliamentary Friends of Parkinson's, one sufferer I met was diagnosed when she was 21.


Ms Pereira's appointment and subsequent service to Parkinson's patients has been exceptional. Measured by the sentiments of her many clients, the appointment has been an outstanding success. However, this may came to a sudden halt with the expiry of a two-year trial period. Many of Ms Pereira's clients are fearful that the funding will dry up without continued government support. So concerned are they that they went to the local press to voice their concerns. Jenny Girdlestone was first diagnosed with Parkinson's in 2007. I spoke to David, her husband and carer. In his family alone, who all live in the Shoalhaven, five near-relatives have the disease. I will just quote from our local newspaper, the South CoastRegister, who ran their story:


… she and her husband David have been through some heartbreaking experiences together, as her body and mind is slowly taken over by the insidious disease.


David Girdlestone believed Jenny was a classic example of how the neurological nurse program staffed by Marilia Pereira could save the state money and sufferers and carers heartache.


In the early stages, before the program was established in the Shoalhaven the couple spent many nights in casualty at Shoalhaven Hospital.


“My wife was clinically depressed,” Mr Girdlestone said.


“Depression is part of Parkinson's, so Jen was in and out of the emergency department with panic attacks for quite a while.


“We were in and out of the emergency ward because we didn't know what was happening to her.


“That was the worst period for both of us, it was really hard,” he said.


Mrs Girdlestone said she didn't believe she would be alive today if not for Marilia.


“I have days when I say I've had enough, that I don't want to go on living like this,” she said.


“It is vital that this service continues.”


This is just an example. The South Coast Register story included many other names, and the article in December produced a follow-up piece in January. The thread remains consistent. The Parkinson's nurse is a vital, productive and successful initiative. If a case ever has to be made for continuity of funding, surely this is it. But Parkinson's Australia, to their credit, are not resting on their hands, waiting for benevolence. No, they are actively pursuing voluntary donations to keep this important service going. Such is their need.


I urge the government, in the most emphatic of terms, to show compassion and understanding and to resolve to maintain funding. The statistics show that demand will only increase, not decrease. It may not get better, but at least for those who are blighted by the disease—the carers and families—life can be made just that little bit easier.


I would also like to acknowledge Bendigo Bank's many years of support towards Parkinson's. The Milton and Sussex Inlet branches pay for the upkeep of the nurse's car, allowing her to continue her good work. I hope the government soon sees fit to do the same.


The Prime Minister recently spent $66,000 of taxpayers' funds to upgrade her personal hot water system at the Lodge, which was not even solar. My point is that $66,000 is enough to fund our regional Parkinson's nurse for more than six months. The wellbeing of the hundreds of Parkinson's sufferers in Gilmore, in my mind, should not be negotiable. I urge the government to renew this funding.


I would also like to acknowledge Parkinson's Shakers groups in our electorate. The work they do by simply meeting and communicating is providing much-needed stimulation. It is about each other and about discussing new drugs that are available. (Time expired)

Mrs MOYLAN
 (Pearce) (10:30):  Every year as we celebrate Australia Day and the national honours are announced I cannot help but reflect on the thousands of men, women and children who make a voluntary contribution to their local community. Their generosity in sharing their time, talent and, often, money makes local communities better places to live. It was to acknowledge this contribution that I, early in my election to parliament, established the Pearce Australia Day Awards. Over the years, local people of all ages and from all walks of life have been nominated. This year, country people focus prominently although not exclusively, and 13 people were nominated for the Pearce Australia Day Awards. They are: Peter Winstanley, who established an after-hours justice of the peace signing service; Malcolm Roberts, who has been a justice of the peace in the town of Beverley since 1991 and who was awarded for over 12 years of volunteering in the town; Janny Harris, from York, has been responsible for leading a program to beautify the town and plant trees; Guydan Boyle, a young farmer in the district, raised over $100,000 for Kids Cancer Project and organised a separate big fundraiser for Zoe; Mark Palumbo has led a very successful York basketball team; Emily Mott-Hogan, head girl at the York District High School, had a year of achievements in sport, culture and citizenship and also won the high school citizenship award for 2012; Marshall Jones, a student who has mentored other sportspeople in tennis and basketball, the sport of his love, also received an award; Reilly Joyce is still at primary school and has provided a great role model through his swimming achievements; Jake Duperouzel showed outstanding commitment to the West Australian Water Ski Association and was the Western Australian under-17 champion; Adrian Lister was recognised for outstanding service to the York Golf Club; Sue Chapman was recognised for her achievements as a karate champion; Bernie Finestone organised the annual York children's Christmas street party, with great success; Tess Earnshaw donated her time and musical talent for the benefit of the local church and for community events.


Each individual has achieved excellence in their own field of endeavour while demonstrating a strong commitment to positively shaping their local area. They are great role models for others, and their contributions make sure that their communities are great places to live, to work and to play. I extend my warm congratulations to all those who were nominated for the award.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (11:00):  I would like you to close your eyes and let your mind take a journey back in time to 100 years ago. Life was much less frenetic yet in so many ways far tougher, especially in country areas. As much as 42 per cent of the Australian population lived in the regions then, compared with only one-tenth today. Labor's Andrew Fisher was in the second of his three stints as Prime Minister, and James McGowen was serving as the very first Labor Premier of New South Wales. McGowen had a bit of ticker. His government carried out an active policy of subsidising hospitals and dispensaries in order to bring about the realisation of universal health care, and he took it upon himself to settle a gas workers strike by threatening to replace them with non-union labour. His public works minister, Arthur Griffith, conducted the celebrated turning on of the water at the Yanco regulator on 13 July 1912.


This was obviously a government with a plan for the future—a far cry from now—because the Murrumbidgee irrigation scheme cost 25,374,000 pounds, which was quite an investment. Mr Griffith and two men who worked on the construction of the irrigation network, one of whom was Christopher Younger, winched open a sluicegate on the regulator to allow water to flow into the channels of the irrigation system for the first time. A contemporary report described the event thus:


Mr. Griffith said the irrigation land they hoped to open up was the best in the world, and this settlement should be as successful as any in America. It would be also an insurance to the Riverina pastoralists.


Then he set to work at the winch and in a few moments, with a noise of cheers, a wave of muddy red water broke out and along the surface of the southern channel.


It was a day of great joy for the district. It was the realisation of the vision of the pioneer dubbed 'the Father of the Murrumbidgee irrigation scheme', Samuel McCaughey. He was the first pastoralist to introduce large-scale irrigation to Australia. This Irish-born farmer's son landed in Melbourne in 1856 and headed bush immediately. In 1889 McCaughey purchased Yarrabee Station on Yanco Creek near Narrandera, in conjunction with his brother, John. In 1900 McCaughey bought North Yanco and at considerable cost built about 200 miles of channels and irrigated 40,000 acres. The success of this scheme prompted the New South Wales government to proceed with the dam at Burrinjuck, construction of which began in 1907. North Yanco, including the land on which the town of Leeton now stands, was later sold to the state for close to settlement.


Early European visitors had not held out much hope for the district now known as the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area. The Surveyor General of New South Wales, John Oxley, looking out from Mount Brogden in 1817 saw what he described as:


… a country which, for barrenness and desolation, can I think have no equal. I believe I am the first white man to ever view this desolate landscape and believe I will likely be the last, there is little probability that these desolate plains will ever again be visited by civilised man.


Charles Sturt was just as scathing in his 1829 assessment, yet within a century of these explorations life-giving water transformed once arid stretches into a fertile, bountiful region. Sir Samuel McCaughey, who was knighted in 1905, was right when he declared in 1909 that water was more precious than gold It is fitting that a statue of this remarkable man will be unveiled on 6 April in the Yanco park named in his memory.


The centenary of the turning on of the water was celebrated in style with a re-enactment of the historical events. The weather for last year's commemoration was just the same as it was 100 years ago to the day: sunny but cold with a who's who of politics and the local community turning out en masse for the occasion. The band played, speeches were given and the water which gave this once-bleak landscape life to produce food and underpin not just the area's economy but, indeed, Australia's, was let flow. 'This is a ceremony of gratitude,' said Governor of New South Wales and Narrandera girl Marie Bashir in a marvellous and captivating address. Professor Bashir talked about how optimistic, energetic and committed the pioneers were and said that the 2012 event would be something everyone should be sure to tell their children about. She said:


It's an emotional homecoming for me because I had the happiest of childhoods in this region. 


Here we are participating in a ceremony of gratitude for the vision, the sheer hard work and the determination to turn this region into a veritable Garden of Eden.


This is a great Australian story – I can remember as a child coming to the farms at Leeton to get the fresh oranges and the wonderful apricots.


The need for sensible water policy and to strengthen irrigation was also mentioned often and loudly at last year's memorable ceremony. The motion before the House acknowledges that the MIA was created to control and divert the flow of local river and creek systems for the purpose of food production and is today one of the most diverse and production regions in Australia, contributing more than $5 billion annually to the Australian economy. The Riverina towns of Coleambally, Leeton and Yanco and the city of Griffith, proud communities all, were purpose built and designed as part of the project and are now some of the most thriving and multicultural regional communities in Australia.


Leeton takes its name from Charles Lee, who was Secretary for Public Works from 1904 to 1910, presiding over an extensive public works program including the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area, Cataract Dam for Sydney's water supply, construction of Burrinjuck Dam and the creation of the purpose built, Walter Burley Griffin designed town named in Lee's honour.


Griffith was named after the man who opened the gates on that great day in 1912. The Coleambally Irrigation Area scheme began in the 1950s with potential farmland made available through a ballot system. Those who entered the ballot had to establish that they were financially secure enough to set up a farm as none of the land had fencing or infrastructure. The successful ballot winners were also required to relinquish any other primary interests they had. For these hardy souls it would be all or nothing for Coleambally.


In essence, that is the way it has been for this entire region. Riverina irrigators have always given their all, yet in recent years these marvellous family farmers have not been shown the same faith by the federal government. Members of this place should appreciate that irrigation underpins national and international food security. Further, they ought to know that our irrigation industry in Australia fulfils its role as the food bowl of Asia. It is important to build our food processing industry so it can supply Asia's growing consumer markets and develop the research, technologies and logistics which strengthen irrigation, grow high-yield crops and improve safety.


Irrigation communities such as those in the Murrumbidgee and Coleambally areas as well as those in the southern Riverina around Deniliquin, of my colleague the member for Farrer, and the Goulburn-Murray of the member for Murray, need the Murray-Darling Basin Plan to be implemented in such a way that it does not destroy hard-won rights fought for and utilised to the betterment of this nation for more than a hundred years. The members for Farrer and Murray and I have argued passionately for a triple bottom line of social, economic and environmental outcomes during this 43rd Parliament as the basin plan neared its legislation. I moved to disallow the Basin Plan and had the motion seconded by the member for Murray. It was debated late afternoon on 29 November 2012, the last sitting day. The motion was lost, but it is better to have tried and failed than failed to have tried.


Ten days earlier I had written to the Prime Minister, inviting her to visit the Riverina to address a public meeting to assure the good people there that the hard work they do to help feed our nation and others is valued and that there is a strong future for them after the plan is legislated. I am still waiting to hear back from her office. In her 3 May 2012 speech to the Global Foundation summit in Melbourne the Prime Minister spoke of strengthening irrigation. Her 28 October Asian century white paper acknowledges the huge role Australia has meeting the global food task in the years ahead. Australia is best placed geographically and economically and with our agriculture industry already well established to more than meet the growing demand for food in Asia.


Happily, the Leader of the Opposition on 27 November 2012 made his strongest statement to date on water, saying a future coalition government would cap buyback at 1,500 gigalitres, meaning that with water already recovered there would be only 249 gigalitres to purchase basin-wide. Previously, the New South Wales Minister for Primary Industries had announced a limit on buybacks of three per cent per valley per decade from 15 January 2013. These assurances were welcomed by Riverina irrigators and certainly every Griffith farmer, whom the Australian Farm Institute says feeds 150 Australians and 450 farmers each and every year.


Just last Friday the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, in rejecting a bid by conservationists to lock out mining from Tasmania's Tarkine region, said:


From purely environmental terms, it would have been something that would have been a wonderful thing to be able to do but you have to take into account the impact on people and taking that impact into account meant that I simply couldn't go with the Heritage Council's recommendations.


As Elizabeth Stott, the wife of a Gogeldrie cotton farmer and a strident campaigner for fair water rights, said: 'I couldn't believe it when I heard those words come out of Minister Burke's mouth.' Unions strongly campaigned to allow mining. Australian Workers Union head, Paul Howes, said that the campaign to put the Tarkine region on the heritage register was run by mainland activists and would have been a disaster for Tasmania. Mr Howes further said:


What the Federal Government has done today is a huge win for the people of Tasmania and also for the future of the economic development of north-west Tasmania which sorely needs more jobs …


Given Tony Burke's alienation of irrigation communities during the Basin Plan process, an attitude many of my people saw as unfathomable and unconscionable, perhaps what was needed for their cause was to have the support of a trade union! Sadly, that seems to be the only thing which gets those on the other side moving. So I call on the parliament to support this motion celebrating the centenary of the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area, I call on members to show their support for the people who put food on their table and I call on the Prime Minister to implement the commitment to strengthen irrigation, as promised nine months ago.

"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,2013-02-11,"



Mr ADAMS
 (Lyons) (11:10):  I thank the member for Riverina for bringing this motion to the parliament. These are important issues that he raises; we all know the importance that water plays in our wide brown country—the very dry land that we have. The early farmers recognised that to survive in this naturally arid landscape the availability and control of our water systems and resources would be the key to successful food production. However, we live in a continent of extremely high rainfall variability, with long, severe droughts and massive floods, as we saw this year in Queensland.


It is not as simple as just controlling and diverting rivers. We have to understand the changes in the water cycles over time and how we can drought-proof regions, and each enterprise within those regions, for those years when drought hits hardest. We have to understand and continually research how we can improve our water usage and storage but, by the same token, we need to ensure that the communities around the rivers survive as they help to keep our waterways healthy and productive.


When the Prime Minister was talking at the Global Foundation Summit in Melbourne last year she said, when putting into context what had been quoted in the motion:


… it's not just about more exports. It is about developing the systems and services that add extra value to them and participating in the development of a market-based solution to food security across the region. It would involve building our food processing industry so that it can supply Asia's growing consumer markets and developing the research, technologies and logistics that strengthen irrigation—


make it better than it has been by using new technologies and being very innovative—


grow higher yield crops and improve safety.


So, while the Prime Minister is keen to see the research continue to further improve our production and the safety of our food, we cannot just continue to milk the Murray-Darling Basin without having a really good understanding and plan to ensure that we keep the river flowing too.


Recently, I received a book from Vicky Cullen, the wife of the eminent scientist Peter Cullen, who passed away a year or so ago, entitled, This Land, Our Water: Water Challenges for the 21st Century. I had had some correspondence with Peter over the years, and I was very pleased to receive the book. It is a collection of papers by Peter Cullen and some associates. I think Peter, more than anyone, knew that the science behind water allocation in the past had often been based on European knowledge and that we should be developing our own knowledge on the basis of what is known about Australia here and now, about our own climatic conditions, our own lands and our own river systems.


John Williams of the New South Wales Natural Resources Commission discussed this in his book on page 197:


Peter operated within the firm appreciation of our highly variable climate driving droughts and also flooding rains. He knew that we must work hard to go forward with management that can yield river systems resilient to the shocks of drought as well as massive floods which are often amplified by our engineering interventions. He knew that to perform that management with current climate variability would challenge our science and our society. Further he knew that to add to this mix the impact of climate change, our climate variability and changed probabilities distribution of our rainfall would stretch us to our very limits.


Of course, we see some of that constantly. He continues:


The slow and difficult progress strongly suggests that he was correct.


I would support the recognition of the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area centenary as a significant milestone in the development of Australian agriculture and food production. That river basin has acted as a food bowl for the whole of Australia for a long time. I believe it has played an important role in underpinning national and international food security, but it is not the only area that needs to be recognised, improved and researched. Our water table, river flows and rainfall on the eastern side of Australia need to be continually monitored and understood.


This government has introduced programs that have assisted and will continue to assist this process. In Tasmania, with the help of the state government, we have developed a series of irrigation schemes that will help the drought-prone areas of the Midlands and the east coast to become more self-reliant. Farmers have been persuaded to take part by investing in these schemes for the future on their own properties and many have undertaken to buy water rights. I believe there are still water rights that have not been completely taken up, but as the value of the scheme has become obvious I am sure they will be taken up. People are now starting to see the significance these rights can have for them in their enterprises.


This is a recognition that Tasmania has a lot of rain. I think we have 10 per cent of the rainfall of the continent of Australia on 1½ to two per cent of the landmass. It is a natural advantage, although looking at the dryness and the fires we have at the moment you would not think that is the case; but it is the case. So we have a great natural advantage and we now have the opportunity to use this water in our irrigation schemes to help produce food and make sure the economics of food production work very well.


Bringing water into areas that have been marginal has made a huge difference to the production of new lines, new crops and new ideas in Tasmania. These things are starting to open up and the water has given us the opportunity to open up bigger areas to produce more on a larger scale. Therefore those economics of size are working to benefit many people. This means a lot of jobs and a lot of opportunities, and a lot of these areas are in the great electorate of Lyons. I was very pleased that Mr Rudd, when Labor came to power, gave me the tick for this policy to come into being. The $140 million has been spent, along with the state contribution, in a very successful way. I am very pleased that farmers have been making their own investment in getting pivots and putting in infrastructure to make this become a reality.


For many years the Murray-Darling Basin was treated as though each river system ended at the state boundaries—the state started where the system ended and started again. It is one system, and we need to look at it as a national system, but there are four states involved. I have often said that they should probably give Tasmanians the job—as the honest brokers without any need or self-interest—of sorting this out for everybody.


It has been a long time getting to where we are with some of the ways forward. We do need to go forward, but we do need to recognise our history and the significance of this area. I am very pleased that you have brought forward the National Food Plan and the national plan into the future. I think we have great opportunities in Australia. Our food is safe and we have to continue that way. We have to meet the issues thrown up in the Asian century white paper. There are great opportunities for Australia into the future and we need to make sure that we get it right. But we do need to look at things that are contemporary for our own nation, such as what we know and what sciences we have, and utilise them for the future. I thank the member for Riverina for bringing this forward.

"Ley, Sussan, MP",LP,2013-02-11,"



Ms LEY
 (Farrer) (11:21):  I am pleased to support my colleague the member for Riverina and commend his work in representative politics around water irrigation communities and the people in his electorate that matter so much. I look forward, following the remarks of the member opposite, to the government supporting this motion when we vote on it in the House.


The value of agricultural production in my electorate of Farrer, part of the Murray-Darling Basin, is over $3 billion. The value of irrigated agriculture production is $1.8 billion—that is in the Murray and the Lower Darling. Those figures represent an enormous contribution to Australia's bottom line. People quote these figures, and I do too. We should also understand that they can increase, that we can do better and that we can, as farming methods improve, become much more productive.


When the national debate turns to water and the politics of water, members who represent irrigated agriculture get very frustrated. I would like to go back to the beginning and quote some lines from Henry Lawson, who in the last years of his life spent some time in the Yanco irrigation area near Leeton, a prohibition zone. In his famous poem, which he revised at that time, called Up The Country, he wrote:


I am back from up the country, up the country where I went


Seeking for the Southern poets' land whereon to pitch my tent;


I have shattered many idols out along the dusty track,


Burnt a lot of fancy verses—and I'm glad that I am back.


I believe the Southern poets' dream will not be realised


Till the plains are irrigated and the land is humanised.


The way the early explorers and poets would have seen inland Australia in the part of the southern Murray-Darling Basin that I represent would be nothing like it is today. Sometimes I think that there are people in Australia who do not understand the problem and would take us back to 13-inch rainfalls, scrub country, sheep and, clearly, towns which would be a fraction of their size.


The member for Lyons quoted Peter Cullen, whom I have a lot of respect for and have met many times during the debates on water in this place. The irony is that, when we talk about the politics of water, the national plan as put forward by John Howard and supported by me as a member in this place was about taking the politics out of water. Unfortunately, that has not happened. The plan as it stands is very much expressed in terms of flows at the end of the system in the Lower Lakes. While I have no issue with determining relevant levels of water at that point in the system, I do know that it is a political imperative that has been described by the minister instead of a complete, holistic picture of environmental watering. They say, 'We will deliver this much water to the bottom of the system eight or nine years out of 10.' That is a political objective; so the government's plan has been distorted from the very beginning.


I commend the motion to the House. I place on record in the strongest possible terms that the food-processing industry is vital to the people I represent; that value adding is something that we can do; and that the closer to the source of the primary product you do the value adding the more jobs and industry you get and the more efficient that activity.


The Prime Minister gave a speech in a summit in Melbourne on 3 May 2012 and made a commitment to strengthen irrigation. I have seen no evidence of that. As the government responds to this motion by the member for Riverina, wouldn't it be good if the Prime Minister reconfirmed that commitment and talked about what it really means, in light of a very flawed Murray-Darling Basin Plan, to genuinely support the farmers and the food producers and the communities that represent irrigation in Australia today. As my colleague has said, our irrigation industry fulfils its role as the food bowl of Asia. When you consider what we could produce, how we could export that product and how we could jump up to a completely different level, the figures I quoted at the beginning of this speech could become history and we would have a much higher value of irrigated agricultural production. I support the motion before the House and I look forward to the government's enthusiastic response.

"Stone, Dr Sharman, MP",LP,2013-02-11,"



Dr STONE
 (Murray) (11:26):  I begin my remarks by commending the member for Riverina for putting forward this most important motion, which commemorates 100 years of the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area being established. I think it is a little ironic that Labor have run out of speakers—they have no-one to speak to this motion right now. One of their objections to the motion is that it is to remind the Prime Minister of her commitment—so called—to 'strengthen irrigation'. She stated this on 3 May 2012. We can see their level of commitment by the fact they do not even have any more speakers to this motion in the House.


I call on the Prime Minister to get serious about irrigated agriculture, because it is under extreme threat at the moment, compounded by the Murray-Darling Basin Plan but also by the carbon tax, which makes it prohibitive for anyone to use electricity or diesel, as our irrigators do. It puts an additional cost onto anyone trying to produce value for money when it comes to irrigated agriculture. Of course, this government is standing by, watching the dollar at current values make our exports non-competitive. It is standing by as we see labour prices going through the roof. Labour prices are exacerbated by the Labor government's failure to understand how penalty rates can kill off an industry which does not run nine to five, five days a week.


Irrigated agriculture covers less than 0.5 per cent of land across Australia, but on that 0.5 per cent of land we produce 28 per cent of the total gross value of all agricultural production. That statistic speaks for itself. If that statistic reflected the comparative value of the automotive industry in Australia, or of some other propped-up industry that the Labor government prefers, then we would all be celebrating—but no. It is 0.5 per cent of land that, with irrigation, is producing nearly one-third of the gross value of agricultural production.


I am shocked at what is happening in particular to irrigated agriculture in Victoria. As I celebrate with the member for Riverina the 100 years of the MIA, I point out that irrigation in Victoria began in 1886, some 30 years before it began in New South Wales. The irrigated agricultural area now managed by Goulburn-Murray Water involved a unique engineering feat which made use of gravity to take water from the south to the north, ultimately draining into the Murray River. It set about creating a densely populated great northern plains region in Victoria with irrigated dairy and fruit growing, supporting in turn some 23 food factories. Food manufacturing is, of course, extremely important in multiplying employment prospects in regional Australia. We now have the state-owned irrigation system managed by Goulburn-Murray Water trumpeting the fact that we have gone down from the 1,900 gigalitres of water that was available for irrigation before 2007. Now we are down to 1,000 gigalitres. That is a loss of 900 gigalitres and there is an expectation that we will lose even more before the business of shutting down the irrigation system is complete. The object of Goulburn-Murray Water is to reduce the size of the irrigation system by some 50 per cent. They are going to reduce—as they call it—the 'footprint' by approximately 50 per cent, pushing it back to the backbone. That means that the vast majority of landowners who are on the spurs are going to be, against their will in too many cases, converted to stock and domestic water only. That kills productivity. It kills jobs. It kills communities. It kills the very reason that we put all of that effort into fertilising, genetic diversity and development of our livestock, because there would not be any water security to make sure that at the end of the day we can finish the product off and send it to the market.


I have to say that this is a sad, sad era for irrigation in Australia. The Commonwealth government with its Murray-Darling Basin Plan has no sense of a triple-bottom-line approach. We could have had a great economic, social and environmental outcome if this government understood what was at stake and what was possible. Instead we see just attack upon attack on irrigated agriculture. Who knows where it will end—tragically in tears. I have no doubt there will be less production to meet that enormous food demand growing in the north of our region and fewer jobs in this country.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2013-02-11,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley—Government Whip) (16:01):  I am delighted to continue my contribution to this important bill which, as I said last week, is only an interim step towards recognition of Australia's Indigenous peoples in the Constitution. Before debate was interrupted, I was indicating to the chamber that, while ultimately it will be the voice of Australian people who give constitutional recognition to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, this bill will help raise awareness more broadly in the community of the issue and will also commence a conversation among us all. It remains the resolve of the government to pursue meaningful change to the Constitution that echoes the hopes and aspirations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The bill provides a mechanism for all Australians to become familiar with the possible wording for a constitutional statement that could be included in a future referendum.


I have seen countless times in our area the positive effect that recognition has on people through, for instance, the many award presentations held in the electorate each year, simply acknowledging the good deeds and efforts of individuals and groups. It provides an enormous sense of satisfaction and empowers them to continue to do their work. Imagine how empowering it would be were we to take this to a higher level, the most paramount level, and that is to have existence recognised within the heart of Australia's constitution. This is the sort of effect that the High Court's Mabo decision had on Indigenous people across the country when the court overturned a long-held legal view that this land had not been inhabited prior to European settlement. Overturning the principle of terra nullius acknowledged for the first time in law, for the first time since Captain Cook landed on these shores, that there were people here long before Europeans. It also validated their sense of being, their sense of belonging to the land, their sacred places and stories, and the struggles of all those who came before them. The Mabo decision itself opened the door for everything that has occurred since regarding Indigenous recognition.


It is absolutely important and appropriate to recognise the landmark speech made by former Prime Minister Paul Keating at Redfern Park in December 1992. There he publicly acknowledged to Indigenous Australians that European settlers were responsible for the enormous difficulties that Aboriginal communities continued to face. I quote Mr Keating directly:


We committed the murders.


We took the children from their mothers.


We practiced discrimination and exclusion.


It was our ignorance and our prejudice …


These were important words and should not be viewed simply in the sense of blame but, rather, recognition of past ills and to enable a situation where we can repair our relations and move the country forward. In a similar way, who can forget the tears of joy and relief displayed when former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd gave the formal apology on behalf the parliament and previous governments for the wrongs that had been inflicted on Indigenous Australians under the previous policy of removing children from their families.


This week marks the fifth anniversary of this significant act of reconciliation, for which Indigenous people in the Chifley electorate continue to be enormously thankful. I hasten to add that the Chifley electorate has one of the largest urban Aboriginal populations in the country, and that many Aboriginal people in our electorate are either members of the stolen generation or their direct descendants. Five years after the apology to the stolen generations, people will again gather in Mount Druitt this week to commemorate this significant national event. Long before 'reconciliation' was a commonplace term in our day-to-day vernacular, members of the community, whom I am proud to represent, started gathering each year in Mount Druitt to celebrate Aboriginal culture and to march together as one for reconciliation. Fifteen years later, the Mount Druitt reconciliation march continues to be an important event in the social justice calendar in the Chifley electorate. This event continues to be well attended and is also recognised as part of the ongoing festivities within the Blacktown City Council area.


At this point, I want to note that these types of events do not occur on their own and that within the context of the discussion that we are having in this place it is important to recognise the central figures who drive the work of the Mount Druitt and Districts Reconciliation Group—in particular, Marguerite Tobin, President; Pat Smith, Secretary; Maureen Berger, Vice President; and Debra Robertson, Treasurer. Their work has helped provide a platform to bring people together across our area, and they should be deeply thanked for this.


I also want to make reference at this point to something else which I was enormously proud to be associated with and which I also think has great relevance to this discussion. Last year, as a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, I was involved in the inquiry into Indigenous languages in Australia. I was very enthusiastically supportive of the establishment of the inquiry for a number of reasons, which I will touch upon shortly. I note that in its report titled Our land our languages, the committee recommended that the government support constitutional changes to include the recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages. The two issues of recognition are inextricably linked. The recommendation of constitutional recognition of Indigenous languages is an acknowledgment of the fact that, post Mabo, Australia should no longer be considered a monolingual nation. The committee found that at the time of colonisation there were an estimated 250 Australian Indigenous languages being used and that today we report with great regret that only 18 languages are spoken by significant numbers of people across all age groups.


The committee's report found that Indigenous language is inseparable from culture and a person's capacity to learn, making it a significant barrier to closing the gap on educational performance. As someone who grew up in a household where we learned English as a second language, I can testify to the powerful impact that language has on a sense of identity and a sense of being—and this is particularly so with Indigenous language and the role that it plays in day-to-day existence. I know how important having access to language is. It is a bridge between generations and in forming an important bond with culture. It should not be underestimated.


I cannot stress enough the effort that has been undertaken in the preparation of this report and then to bring those recommendations to life. I can testify with my own eyes and ears—hearing and seeing—what is being done in our area. It is great to see the amount of work that is being undertaken to keep Indigenous languages alive and to teach these languages to young people from within cultures. In particular I note Hebersham Public School and the work that it is doing with its Koori Play and Chat program. This program is designed to teach younger Indigenous Australians the importance of their own language and it does so within the educational context. In the future, how exciting it will be when students from all cultures are able to study and master one or more of our own Indigenous languages. What greater recognition of Indigenous culture could there be? 


The simple answer to that is that there is no greater recognition for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people than the single most important document to our nation—the Australian Constitution. As I indicated earlier, the Constitution sets out rules for the conduct of the Commonwealth of Australia. But, importantly, as a document it helps define who we are and what we value. Also within this document, the truest recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders must and should occur.

Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth) (16:09):  As honourable members are aware, the opposition supports the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012 and warmly supports the long overdue move to provide for the recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Australian Constitution. Indeed, the second of the two referendum proposals which were defeated in 1999 was a personal project of the Prime Minister of the time, John Howard—a new preamble to the Constitution. It was designed, in large measure, to achieve this very objective—to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.


That preamble proposal was, regrettably, defeated in the referendum, as indeed was the change for which I was leading the campaign—to make Australia a republic and ensure that our head of state was no longer the King or Queen of the United Kingdom but rather an Australian citizen chosen by Australians. It is worth noting that the preamble—and this is a cautionary observation—had absolutely unanimous political support. I am not aware of any member of the House of Representatives, the Senate or any political party who opposed the preamble. Notwithstanding that, the preamble achieved fewer votes than the republic proposal. This is a very important point about the practicality of this change to which I will return.


Our Constitution was not a document establishing an independent country. Australia was not an independent country in 1901. It was constituted as a self-governing dominion within the British Empire but subordinate to the imperial government. The Governor-General was not an Australian head of state. The Governor-General was not chosen by Australians or appointed on the recommendation of the Australian government. The Governor-General was an imperial viceroy and indeed was the effective representative of the imperial government in Australia right up until the 1930s—1933, I believe—when there was, for the first time, a British high commissioner appointed to Australia.


So it is important, when you read the Australian Constitution and see references to the Queen—which are defined in the Constitution Act as being references to 'Her Majesty Queen Victoria and her heirs and successors in the sovereignty of the United Kingdom'—that does not, in 1901 terms, mean the Queen as she is today, acting on the advice of the state government; it means the Queen acting on the advice of her imperial ministers and the imperial government. The Constitution is filled with provisions which speak to this subordination of Australia. A very good example—this is one of a number, but I will just recite one—is section 59, which states that the Queen may annul any Australian law within one year of it being enacted. Indeed, under other provisions, the Queen has the ability to withhold consent to any law which had been reserved for her consent by the Governor-General.


So there was a whole scheme. If the Governor-General, the representative of the imperial government, felt there were an Australian law that was out of place, he could refer it back to Whitehall where the Queen or King, acting on the advice of the imperial government, could then knock it back. If, by some mischance, the Governor-General approved a bill and it became law—became an act—the Queen nonetheless could annul it.


That of course raises the interesting constitutional question of what would happen if an incoming government in the 21st century were to advise Her Majesty the Queen that she should annul certain laws passed by the previous government within the previous 12 months. It is an interesting question as to whether that dead letter could rise, vampire-like, from the grave and bedevil all the constitutional lawyers and politicians.


But my point is the Constitution was a document written in and of its own times. It has evolved mightily. It has evolved not very much by the method that the founders imagined, by formal amendment, because it has been so difficult to amend the Constitution. Indeed, of 44 proposals to amend the Constitution, only eight have been successful. The last one which was even remotely controversial that was successful was in 1946. The Aboriginal rights referendum in the 1960s, an initiative of the Holt government, was unanimously supported. And the other referendum changes, at least in my lifetime, that have been successful have been essentially technical ones. How the Constitution has evolved has been largely through Constitutional or political evolution. There were the Statute of Westminster and the Australia acts, which had the result that without changing a line in the Constitution references to the Queen, meaning the Queen acting on the advice of the imperial government, came to mean the Queen acting on the advice of the Australian government. And then you have all of the changes effected by the justices of the High Court as they interpreted the Constitution.


But we have in many respects, as George Winterton once said, in Constitutional terms a frozen continent. We have been unable to change our Constitution in any controversial way. Many people have said that you need bipartisan support to change the Constitution. It is certainly very hard to change it without it, but it is absolutely not enough. The preamble is a very good example of that, a very good demonstration of the force of what I am saying.


In order to successfully change the Constitution you need to have overwhelming public support, a real sense of momentum, the strongest possible support, and very little opposition—somewhere between very little and no opposition. The reason for that, in my judgement—and I acknowledge that it was the Chief Justice Murray Gleeson who drew this to my attention many years ago—is that we have compulsory voting in Australia. So people who are not interested in the issue, not because they are foolish or irresponsible but simply because they are not interested in the issue—people who have chosen not to pay attention to it, who have not read all the literature and have not watched the debates, and are then, as we are in Australia, dragged along by force of law to the polling booth and presented with a proposition—are invariably much more likely to vote no than yes. If you don't know, you are likely to vote no. Indeed, at every referendum which has been contentious the forces against change have said quite openly, 'If you don't know, vote no.' Obviously the less you know about it the more likely you are to be open to scare campaigns and the like. They are not unknown in political circles, so honourable members I think will acknowledge.


So the big challenge we face with this project is not that everyone in this building is not united in their support for having a Constitution that more properly speaks to the Australia of today: the Australia that does not treat Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders as it did in 1901, as not simply second-class citizens but effectively non-persons, noncitizens, not even to be counted, not to vote, as though they had just been airbrushed out of history. That was pretty much where it was in 1901, to our great shame. But all of that has changed. How do we make this document speak to the civilised, just, fair Australia of 2013? How do we get it passed?


Some people would say, 'Oh well, just give it a go. Work up a referendum proposal and see how you go.' The consequences, to my mind, of a referendum proposal on this topic being defeated would be very serious. It would be seen as a national rejection of reconciliation. It would do extraordinary damage to Australia in terms of our own perception of ourselves and indeed to the world's perception of us. So to have a referendum on this topic is a momentous roll of the dice. I think Australia would have been better advised, obviously, to have approved the republic proposal in 1999. I imagine there are many people in the world who still imagine that Australia is in some respects not fully independent because the Queen of the United Kingdom is our head of state, notwithstanding that we are of course as thoroughly an independent country—in fact in some respects more independent—as the United Kingdom. So perceptions matter. But with this question, because it touches on such a sensitive issue of race, the stakes are much higher.


So I am very pleased to see that the bill provides that the minister shall within 12 months of this bill being enacted take soundings, and report on the feasibility of a change being achieved. It is something that is going to have to be undertaken with great care and with great responsibility. There is a tendency in some sections of the media and in some sections of the community to run very hysterical scare campaigns on a range of issues. We are all familiar with those. This is a proposal that is very potentially vulnerable to that. You can well imagine people saying, 'Oh, if we were to make these changes, Aboriginals will be able to claim our backyard, claim our house.' You can imagine all the scare campaigns that could be run. They will have to be resisted with great force, and care. This is going to be a test of our maturity as a nation. Are we able to tell the truth about ourselves? We no longer regard Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as second-class citizens or noncitizens. There may be some people who do, but there is no serious constituency. There is no accounting for a handful of people. But overwhelmingly the vast majority—that is 99.999 per cent—of Australians share the same aspirations as are in this bill. But it is so easy to run a scare campaign.


Of course, you have to remember that in any referendum you have to have a specific proposal. You cannot just have a vote on recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, just like you cannot have a vote on whether Australia should be a republic. You have to have some specific words. It is always possible for people to say, 'Oh well, we agree with the general objective but we object to these words.' They try to clothe their opposition in a technical objection. This bill, which some people have said is pretty innocuous, is much more potent than most of its readers imagine. It is in many respects a challenge to all of us, to all Australians: are we mature enough, are we grown up enough, are we confident enough to say we are not going to play petty politics, scare campaign politics, frightening people politics? Are we going to face up to the facts and maturely and soberly find a set of words that achieve the recognition that we should all support, but does so in a way that it can be carried? This is a great project that we are looking at today and we should all strive very hard to ensure that it is completed successfully.

"O'Neill, Deb, MP",ALP,2013-02-11,"



Ms O'NEILL
 (Robertson) (16:24):  I too rise with some hope and sense of anxiety, I expect. That was very well articulated by the member for Wentworth, because this Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012 is indeed adult reading for an adult nation, and we need to take the necessary precautions to ensure that all Australians come with us on the journey as we move towards this appropriate recognition of the reality of our country and history.


I am proud to be a member of the party that removed the final vestiges of the White Australia policy. I am proud to be a member of the party that handed the first tracts of land back to traditional owners and I am proud to be a member of the party that apologised to the stolen generations. I am proud to stand here in this place as part of a Labor government that continues to make important strides forward in the official recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in our Constitution.


While we should be proud of these strides we made as a government and nation it is also important to recognise that there have been times we should be ashamed of: times that we have gone against our great professed Australian belief in egalitarianism, times in our national history that reveal us as a people failing to meet that sense of our best selves, times in our history where we have had a sense of what we should strive for to ensure we all move forward together and times when, through lack of generosity or fear, the historical record reveals us as far less than the best Australians we could be. So let this time, our time, not be one of those shameful times.


In order to advance Australia toward fairness we, the Gillard government, are introducing this very important bill to the House. On our journey toward community understanding of the substance of a referendum and a confidence that such a referendum will successfully achieve a positive outcome for the entire population—the first Australians and those of us who arrived a bit later on boats and planes—this bill is both an instrument that enables that conversation to occur and a record of our journey toward that day of constitutional recognition.


We find ourselves here, in this House of Representatives, with this Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill before us. It is a bill that will establish an act of recognition acknowledging the unique and special place of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and their descendants as the first people of our nation. It will serve as a stepping stone to holding a successful referendum that will change the Australian Constitution to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. This should be a bipartisan goal, and I am very heartened by the comments of my fellow parliamentarians in this debate. This should be a goal that brings all Australians together, not one that divides us. This should be a goal that we can be proud of, not one tarnished by political gains.


As part of our commitment to recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Australian constitution, this government established an expert panel to lead a discussion with the communities to move this issue forward and to bring it to public consciousness. The expert panel consulted widely, and we in this place should be very proud of the high level of community engagement that was achieved during this process. When the report was handed to parliament in January last year we had a comprehensive set of proposals that would guide our government and future governments toward the effort of recognition.


We have already invested $10 million to help build public awareness and community support for change. In my role as the member for Robertson on the very beautiful Central Coast—Darkinjung and Guringai country—I meet wonderful, active citizens who deeply understand what we are seeking to achieve here. I commend a particular group from my electorate known as Friends of Mingaletta, formerly called Central Coast Citizens for Constitutional Change, and I acknowledge and put on the record today my regard for their work and advocacy in bringing more attention to this issue in the seat of Robertson. The Friends of Mingaletta have already held a number of community meetings, and they have brought together community leaders to enlist their support in promoting and publicising the need for constitutional change and engaging the wider community in that debate. It is a task that has presented quite a challenge and they have certainly risen to that challenge. They know that for this historic and necessary change to come about we have to pull together—we have to come together as a country. And, as the member for Wentworth indicated, there are those whose interest, perhaps, in making money above making a country might interrupt this journey in some way. We need to be very careful to engage our media in enabling an historic, forward-looking campaign to achieve the outcomes that this legislation sets in train.


We have to talk about this issue with colleagues; we have to talk about this issue in schools; we have to talk about this issue through social media and, importantly, we have speak about it in the parliament. Indeed, as parliamentarians we are called to lead discussions in our own communities in very positive ways about the issues that are at hand and being considered through this bill. We have to drive the conversation. We have to ensure that as every week and month passes more non-Indigenous Australians hear about this proposition—that more non-Indigenous Australians say 'yes' to recognition; that more non-Indigenous Australians say yes to closing the gap. Passing this act will continue that momentum for change.


Again, referring to the region in which I live—the seat of Robertson—I am privileged to have a very active and growing local Aboriginal community, ably represented by Sean Gordon, CEO of the local Darkinjung Aboriginal Land Council. I asked him to bring together some of his own thoughts on what this legislation will mean for the local Aboriginal population that he leads at this moment, along with other great leaders in our local Aboriginal community, and I would very much like to read those comments into the record now:


Darkinjung local Aboriginal council is located on the Central Coast of New South Wales representing 9,000 Aboriginal people on the Central Coast and  is the fastest-growing Aboriginal community in Australia based on the 2011 census data. Our experience is similar to that of our remote communities although not to the same severity. What is clear is that Aboriginal people living within urban settings are more likely to be disconnected from country, language and identity due to colonisation and European settlement. The Act of Recognition bill is an important critical step towards Constitutional recognition. This bill provides an opportunity to introduce as an interim measure the concept of recognising Aboriginal people as the first people of this country. The bill is a step in the right direction as it establishes foundation to build the necessary support structures to gain bipartisan agreement within parliament; however, more importantly, the bill allows the Australian community, both black and white, to better understand the importance of recognising aboriginal people in the Constitution. The immediate impact of the Act of Recognition Bill, if recognised, supported and passed by parliament demonstrates that there is a genuine commitment to create a real and lasting change between black and white Australia and demonstrates a sign of good faith that governments care and acknowledge our history. The Act of Recognition bill should not be seen as the solution to address the existing problems between black and white Australians nor should it be seen as the solution to fixing communities. The bill should first and foremost be seen as the first step in a true recognition and a genuine reconciliation. This bill, if passed, will provide our future generations—our next generation of leaders—the opportunity to be proud of our history and proud of who we are as Australians. The bill will hopefully generate and sustain a new generation of leadership amongst Aboriginal people and communities and allow future leaders to concentrate on remedies and solutions to our communities without the burden of recognition or the lack thereof. Finally, if the Act of Recognition bill is passed, it will lay the foundation that is necessary to achieve constitutional recognition of Indigenous Australians and demonstrate what we all know and love: that Australia truly is a great country.


Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, I want to thank Sean Gordon for those words and all the representatives on the land council for their contribution to our life—our cultural life and our physical life on the Central Coast. I have been taught to look with new eyes many times by my Aboriginal brothers and sisters, and I am sure that you have had similar experiences, as we are gifted with opportunities to travel around this great wide brown land.


This legislation makes the clear statement of recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the first inhabitants of Australia. It acknowledges the unique history, culture and connection to traditional lands and waters. It also commits to closing the gap in life outcomes between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and other Australians and acknowledges that constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples is an important part of that process.


This bill should not be a substitute for full recognition but, rather, it should encourage all Australians to become familiar with the need for and the importance of a constitutional change. Sunset provisions in the act will mean that a future parliament will reassess how to move forward with the change and will not allow this legislative instrument to become entrenched at the expense of a referendum. The apology did not bring a full and equal opportunity for Indigenous Australians and, sadly, nor will this referendum, even if it proceeds to a successful conclusion from the perspective we have been discussing here today. Nonetheless both are very important steps in bringing closer that goal and bringing it to reality.


As the Prime Minister's words echoed just the other day, there is much more to do to close the gap, and this bill is, in essence, part of the journey towards closing that gap. I do recall, as a student, accessing a book in the library one Friday afternoon. It was one of those Friday afternoons when perhaps I was avoiding a more onerous task, but I was browsing the shelves and pulled off a book and opened it up. Sometimes in our lives the pages that appear before us are very powerful. The story that was recounted on those pages was of a different interaction that might have occurred when the British arrived here in this country. I read several pages of an interaction in which the white arrivals spoke to the Aboriginal people and marvelled at the richness of their understanding of country, marvelled at the uniqueness of their language, marvelled at the sustainability of the way in which they lived and marvelled at the complex multikinship structures, and I often wonder what a different country we might be if that fantasy had been a reality. The moment for proper engagement and acknowledgement of the richness of Aboriginal culture passed at that time. It is important that at this time, while it is our duty and we are on watch, we make every endeavour possible to ensure that we reach out across the nation, that we engage in sound enabling education that draws us together with an acknowledgement of our common humanity and draws us to a much better and long overdue recognition of the place of the first peoples of this nation. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr LAMING
 (Bowman) (16:39):  Indeed the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012 allows this nation more time to debate the issue of constitutional recognition, to build consensus and to work on increased awareness right across this great country. The debate, I think, has had two important contributions made by the previous speakers. On our side, from the member for Wentworth, there was a very, very clear elucidation of just how complex a referendum change can be, and the previous speaker referred to 'an adult conversation for an adult nation'. It is a theme that I would like to pick up, because the one component of that discussion that has not yet been added to this debate in this parliament is the conversation within Aboriginal Australia about their role in succeeding in this very, very important course of events.


I would like to focus a lot of my speech on a 2009 quarterly essay by Noel Pearson, not because I do not believe that it is, for the very simple and self-evident case, a very important piece of work that will be remembered as really expanding on the role of Indigenous Australia in its own journey towards constitutional recognition but because large elements of this quarterly essay have yet to find their way into Hansard. I believe that important parts of this debate on this day will be looked back on, and we will see the important role that this piece has played in this journey.


Of course Pearson, like many people, is inspired by the readings of others. In this quarterly essay, he focuses on Jonathan Lear's Radical Hope: Ethics in the Face of Cultural Devastation, a work in 2006, where Lear asks the important question: what would it be for such radical hope to be justified for Aboriginal Australia? Those who hold, harbour and project such hope must be serious in order to succeed. Pearson makes the very important point that determination alone is not enough, that it is necessary but not sufficient, that we will need more than that. When you are struggling against all odds, determination is no guarantee of success. He makes the very important observation that discipline is just as important. The 'great vulnerability' that he observes in Aboriginal people has been that the institutions of their culture mandated a seriousness that, met long ago, fell apart and has really struggled to restitute itself. It has been inadequately replaced or inadequately rejuvenated. In the midst of the ruins of the old world and facing the mutations of the new, Aboriginal Australia is seeking an accommodation of those things that make Aboriginal culture something of a serious people.


Pearson postulates that all pre-modern peoples face this very challenge, that they carry within their culture 'some institutional essence of what made and maintained them as peoples', but at the same time they are facing modern people—to use that vernacular—who are secular and unanchored. Modern people come to feel a double-edged sword, because modern people in many ways are free of that traditional orthodoxy. That includes the ability that we have to lose our own identity as modern people and to also succumb to and assimilate easily into a dominant culture, which is not the characteristic of pre-modern people. That is a fascinating observation by Pearson. Those who resist assimilation really have no protection against its inexorable advance, so Pearson asks this very question: what will it take to seriously engage that challenge ahead? Obviously, he makes his case that education is something that can, in a parallel world, be pursued with other elements like constitutional recognition. If I am reading his quarterly essay correctly, he says, 'Never make constitutional recognition something upon which we become utterly reliant but let it be something that we engage in, in parallel.'


Pearson makes two observations about what it takes to be a very, very serious people. The first of those is to live in hard places—the very self-evident observation that, the harder the place, the more serious must be the people. Human societies occupy some of the hardest and most inhospitable and economically irrational corners of the world. They are places on Earth that require serious people to sustain them as homes, and strong rationales are needed to maintain that hearth in hard places. The second element is when people are striving to maintain and transmit to future generations their pre-modern culture in a language of a modern and global world. The more esoteric and the less economically rational that these cultures may be deemed and that languages are to the imperatives of the modern global world, the more serious a challenge these people will face and the more serious they will have to be in order to retain their culture and language.


I think he very, very simply elucidates that the challenge facing elements of traditional and often remote Aboriginal Australia is even more than we can understand as modern people, to use his expression. His notion of seriousness is about orthodoxy—a 'serious person' in the sense that we are concerned with an orthodox person. Pearson makes the interesting observation that one of the great challenges to the traditional life has been alcohol. He notes that in a range of orthodox cultures around the world alcohol is anathema but that that is not the case in traditional Aboriginal Australia where they have faced a range of European vices that are unprecedented and where, he notes, 'Aboriginal Law did not evolve to proscribe these vices according to comparable principles of precedent'—principles that you might find in other cultures. The whole point that he makes about orthodoxy is that in many of the cultures—but not in Aboriginal Australia—elements like alcohol, gambling and illicit drugs have become anathema but that that has not yet occurred in many elements of traditional Australia which have survived to the present but remain 'fatally compromised by the assumption that the Law which underpins this High Culture does not have anything to say about the European vices'.


This is an observation that I was privileged enough to be part of in 1994, when petrol sniffing first arrived at the Central Desert community of Lajamanu in the mid-nineties. These were the first images that senior Aboriginal people on the traditional council had of their grandchildren: with half-cans of Coke tied around their noses and filled with petrol. They called a community meeting in Lajamanu in the first few weeks that I was there. I had no language to understand the discussion, but in their Warlpiri—their emotional, heartfelt Warlpiri—they had no words to describe these very vices, so they simply borrowed from the English. The only parts that I could understand of the entire communication at this community meeting were the English words for the vices for which they had no traditional response. And so what really started these contradictions that we see between a traditional strong culture based on kinship and the almost impotent powerlessness of dealing with external threats is something that Pearson challenges his own people with. He challenges them to have that conversation and to walk in both worlds, where there is both a traditional and a mainstream response to those challenges.


This brings me to the fifth Closing the gap report, where, in a presentation from the Prime Minister that was just touching on some levels of early data about which we can all be optimistic, she then switched back to very much a focus on the banned drinkers registers, on Alice Springs and on disputes between jurisdictions—something which I think belittled that report. I think we were really there for a distillation of the evidence, to be hopeful for where there is promise and to be rightfully concerned where there is not progress. But, in the end, quoted in that very important—and landmark—fifth anniversary speech was data provided by the then Labor minister from the Northern Territory and released prior to the Northern Territory election which compared the impact of the Banned Drinkers Register to its impact the previous year. 


What was not known to anyone—not to those listening to that speech nor even to the Prime Minister who read it out—was that the data attributed to the use of the 'Enough is Enough' Banned Drinkers Register in Alice Springs had actually had lifted out of it all of the alcohol-related antisocial behaviour reports attributed to domestic violence. These reports were not included after the Banned Drinkers Register came into effect, but they of course had all been included prior to the Banned Drinkers Register. This is a comparison of apples and oranges, and a false attribution of the impact of the Banned Drinkers Register when, on any fair and balanced assessment of the data in the Northern Territory, the Banned Drinkers Register had very little impact at all on dysfunctional behaviour or antisocial behaviour in Alice Springs. But that is not what has been carved into stone in the fifth Closing the gap report. That is genuinely unfortunate.


To emerge from these challenges that are fundamentally destructive of any culture, be it traditional or otherwise, the challenge for Aboriginal Australia will be to incorporate into their own belief systems having one foot in mainstream legal systems, and of course to continue also the culture of their people that have for millennia dealt with an enormous number of challenges but are yet to deal with some of the Western vices that I have outlined.


The late Maria Lane, a South Australian Indigenous academic who was mentioned in that quarterly essay, also made an important, though unpublished, contribution which Pearson picks up in his essay. In that paper, Lane observes that, effectively, we have seen a division—which Marcia Langton in her Boyer Lectures this year picked up on again through a slightly different prism. Lane refers to: 'A Welfare-Embedded'—Aboriginal—'Population which is risk- and work-averse, and benefits-, wealth- and security-oriented', and to the other leaf of the dichotomy, 'An Open-Society Population which is opportunity-, effort- and outcome-oriented'. She described this division very early, long before the Boyer Lectures of this year where Marcia Langton referred to a north and a south: a north economically engaging in the mining opportunities of remote Australia, and then very much a more eastern seaboard, urban Aboriginal debate that is predominantly focused on the rights-based debate. She makes the obvious point: 'Why can't we have both?' or 'Should we even be learning from the activities of the north and making sure that we don't become preoccupied with the former?'


Interestingly though, it was Lane who first described this. She talks about the origins of the open society population being found in the forties and the fifties when Indigenous people first started leaving the settlements to move to urban areas and often picked up very menial and basic work. Their children grew up within that ethos. Secondly, she talks about a number of the settlements where people either chose not to, or were unable to, move from remote Australia, predominantly because the welfare system trapped them there on a pedestal—to move from those communities was, effectively, to walk away from a lot of the welfare supports that one relies on in a community. It is interesting that this has been picked up a long time ago and is still informing debate today.


I think the most important thing that Lane talked about was that this open society population has developed almost independently of many of our Indigenous-specific educational interventions. It occurred simply by movement to opportunity, and that is why it is very important to make sure that we never prohibit, or never make it difficult through government policy, for Aboriginal Australians to move to where opportunities are. We should never say to them, 'Well, you'll lose your publicly funded housing'. We should never say to them, 'If you move to take a job, there go your entitlements'. We have to find a way to transition into grasping opportunities, because through capability of course comes opportunity.


Lane scathingly characterised a lot of the programs as being preoccupied with questions of relevance, cultural sensitivity, language and racist theories such as learning styles, theory-appropriate curriculum, role of elders, parents or community, self-esteem, cooperativeness, need for outdoor activity, focus on sport, love of art and all those Aboriginal exceptionalism arguments, which failed to identify that, at the heart of it, all Australians are just wanting the same thing for their children. As a result of the irrelevance of many of these specific policies, Pearson argues that there will be a predicted shift away from this exceptionalism, and back towards a focus that every opportunity that Australia offers should be available to all Australians.


In that ideal, we are now seeing break-outs right across the country, not just in Cape York. Great work is being done in the Kimberley and great work is being done in parts of outer metropolitan urban Indigenous programming as well—not to mention in Queensland the great work being done by QAIHC and the establishment of a range of Aboriginal-controlled medical centres that are working in this area to run on a mainstream model but deliver Indigenous-tailored and Indigenous-centred and controlled care.


In Cape York there is of course the focus on education. They are initiating this debate that says, 'We can walk in both worlds and enjoy the best of both, and that we can realise that by starting with the children.' Chris Sarra, Noel Pearson and a range of others around the country are working on that.


I have explicitly focused on this, because I think the most important thing of all is not to have a mostly non-Indigenous discussion about our Constitution. We also need to have a discussion with Indigenous Australia about the shape of the next Indigenous studying, training and working population. At the moment we have a great dissonance. We have a falling out of educational opportunities for a whole host of reasons, and an expungement of Indigenous language out of a range of state educational curricula. We have children falling out of the system the minute they drop out of school, and we have no community-wide system to ensure that working-age cohorts all get an opportunity. And ultimately, we have not yet developed a mature welfare system that is prepared to support not just an Aboriginal Australian but any Australian who is willing to move further than the 90-minute Centrelink rule to take up an opportunity. Only when our welfare system can mature to that point can we absolutely grasp the opportunity that every Australian family wants, be they Indigenous or otherwise.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2013-02-11,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (16:54):  I too take this opportunity to speak to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012. This legislation follows the report titled Recognising. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Constitution, which was presented about a year ago. I note that the member for Page, who was a member of the expert panel that put together that report, is in the chamber. I say to her on behalf of all of her colleagues that it is, indeed, an excellent report. I have read through it and I believe it sums up the situation of Indigenous people of this country very well.


When I think about Australia's identity and what distinguishes Australia from other nations, the first thing that comes to my mind is the Australian Indigenous people—the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of this country: people whose attachment to this land dates back tens of thousands of years; people with a fascinating and, indeed, unique culture. Since 1788, the place of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the Australian story has been controversial and at times divisive. Since colonisation, Australia does not have a proud history in its treatment of the Indigenous people. It is a history littered with government policy and decisions based on prejudice and ignorance. One only has to look at the speeches of Prime Ministers Edmund Barton and Alfred Deakin to understand the racist thinking of the time. Nor was the racism directly and solely meant for the Indigenous people of this land. In fact, I suspect that most of it was intended towards other people. Policies which in hindsight have been discriminative, racist and heartless arose as a result of thoughts in that era.


In recent decades, however, there has been considerable effort to recognise the rights and equality of Indigenous people in Australia. The 1967 referendum, land rights, Mabo and Indigenous political representation have all been commendable examples of changing attitudes throughout this country, yet many other efforts have had only limited success when assessed against the often substantial resources committed. The issue of Indigenous recognition in the Australian Constitution is a prime example of that. Few people expressly opposed the proposition, yet following through with constitutional recognition has proved incredibly difficult. I heard the speech by the member for Wentworth and he made that very point. He quite rightly also made the point that not only has it proven to be very difficult in the past but also it is likely to be very difficult in the future. That may be partly explained by the broader issue about the difficulty of amending the Australian Constitution. Only eight propositions out of 44 put to the Australian people have been successful. I suspect, however, that it has more been about a lack of commitment by politicians at all levels across Australia. The rhetoric and the platitudes have not always been matched by the necessary commitment and effort required, in a similar way to the lack of commitment that we are seeing on the question of local government recognition.


Indigenous Australians are understandably cautious about the latest proposal. Recognition of Australia's Indigenous people in Australia's Constitution will be more than just a symbolic or patronising gesture. The Australian Constitution sits as the foundation document of Australia's legal framework. It provides a framework for Australian laws and the responsibilities of federal and state governments. It is the founding document of our nation. The absence of any recognition of Indigenous people in the Australian Constitution is a denial of the truth about the origins and history of Australia and perpetuates an injustice that may have been accepted in 1901 but it has no place in Australia today.


Indigenous recognition in the Australian Constitution will recognise the rightful place of Indigenous people in the Australian story, but it will do much more than that. Constitutional recognition, reconciliation and Closing the Gap all intersect. Reconciliation will never be complete without truthful recognition of Indigenous people in Australia's history and its future. Importantly, every act of reconciliation will break down barriers to Closing the Gap strategies. Acknowledging injustice and grievances can be a powerful step in the reconciliation process.


That is why former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's national apology was so important in unifying Australia. The Prime Minister's Closing the Gap statement on Wednesday, 6 February, only last week, highlighted progress made in overcoming Indigenous disadvantage and hardship. The statement also reaffirms the considerable disadvantage that continues to exist throughout Indigenous communities—the kind of disadvantage that led to the Northern Territory intervention policy. I believe that the Northern Territory intervention policy is well intentioned, but it will be some time before a proper evaluation of it can be made. My expectation is that there will be some initial benefits, and those who support the policy will point to those benefits as evidence that the policy is working. There are concerns, however, that over time there will be ways found to circumvent the policy, and just as prohibition did not stop the consumption of liquor in the US, the intervention may result in corruption and illegal activity in order to get around it.


I am also told that intervention is causing considerable resentment amongst many of the Indigenous people. Addressing core problems through education, awareness and inclusion would very likely have much better long-term benefits than protectionist laws which attempt to control behaviour. Whilst disadvantage continues, many of Australia's Indigenous people will continue to feel resentment, continue to feel discriminated against and continue to focus on past injustices. So Closing the Gap will heal wounds and enable reconciliation, and conversely reconciliation will help close the gap. Both will be enhanced by constitutional recognition of Australia's Indigenous people. This legislation, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012, is an important step in that process. It follows the work of the expert panel that I referred to in my opening remarks. Cognisant of the track record of constitutional change, the government wants to ensure that any proposal for Indigenous recognition has the best chance of success. With that in mind, this bill establishes a process for consulting with the Australian people, getting the wording of the proposed constitutional change right and overcoming procedural concerns as obstacle to a successful referendum. 


Last year I was asked to address a forum organised by the City of Salisbury on the question of Indigenous recognition in the Australian Constitution. The Hon. Robyn Layton AO, QC, former Supreme Court justice, currently co-chair of Reconciliation South Australia and, in fact, South Australian of the year, Professor Peter Buckskin, Dean of Indigenous Scholarship, Engagement and Research at the University of South Australia, and Khatija Thomas, Commissioner for Aboriginal Engagement, also spoke at the forum and shared their expert perspectives on the constitutional change and the process required. It was an interesting discussion. I came away from the forum with two clear observations. Firstly, whilst the City of Salisbury team had gone to considerable efforts to organise the event, the numbers participating, although as well as expected, reflected the general lack of interest in the matter. The attendance at the forum was consistent with many other forums that I have attended with respect to Indigenous issues. The point I make is that regardless of how much we try it is quite often very difficult to engage the broader Australian community in questions and issues relating to the Indigenous people of this land. That is certainly one of the observations that I came away with.


Secondly, there was, from memory, unanimous agreement from those present that whilst Indigenous constitutional recognition should occur, there was still considerable work to be done to ensure that a referendum on the question would be successful. The concerns expressed on the night were consistent with the concerns that have been expressed in this place and previously in other places and at other times. It is extremely difficult to change our Constitution. It is even more difficult to change our Constitution when we are dealing with a matter relating to the Indigenous people of this land.


Whilst I note that the states of Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria have all acknowledged Australia's Indigenous people in their state constitutions, I am also conscious of the difficulty that we face in changing the Australian Constitution. In fact I understand that attempts in 1944, 1974, 1988 and 1999 to change the Constitution with respect to Australia's Indigenous people all failed. The only successful attempt was in 1967 and I understand that it was overwhelmingly successful, in fact the most successful change to any Constitutional matter in the history of the nation. I suspect there was also a very good reason for that, and the changes made at a time, I think, were quite logical and understood by the Australian people as being changes that should be made without there being any disagreement from any quarters.


Whilst the Mabo High Court decision of 1992 led to the Native Title Act and the establishment of an Indigenous Land Fund and the delivery of a social justice package, I believe that it also raised profound questions about the Australian Constitution and in particular the moral and legal requirements for Indigenous recognition. For example, if Indigenous ownership pre-dates British occupation, are those lands exempt from colonial law, and what other rights therefore pre-date the Australian Constitution? Such questions will continue to remain unresolved and these are questions about the sovereignty of this nation. I note that the expert panel made some comments about that in the report—very good comments, I might add—but questions remain unresolved and in fact they are questions that now arise, in my view, as a result of the Mabo decision. Furthermore, the Australian Constitution cannot continue to remain silent on a matter which the High Court has now ruled on and which contradicts a critical presumption on which, I understand, the Australian Constitution was framed.


I conclude with a couple of other observations. I note that in many of the recommendations, including some of the propositions put forward by the expert panel, words like 'recognise', 'acknowledge' and 'respect' feature in any proposed wording that may be put to the Australian people as the words that we ought to adopt with our Constitution. I note that the word 'rights' is never mentioned. I do not know how others in the future will interpret words like 'recognise', 'acknowledge' and 'respect' unless you attach specifics to those words. If you do not, then, quite frankly, it will also leave a degree of ambiguity about what the Constitution says about our Indigenous people. It seems to me that if the word 'rights' is not mentioned, and is never going to be mentioned, then the Indigenous people of this land, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, will continue to feel aggrieved. Perhaps, as other nations have done, it is time for this nation to also strike a treaty with the Indigenous people of this land. At least that will then enable Indigenous people and the non-Indigenous people to move forward with a degree of certainty about the rights of each party. With those comments I commend the bill to the House and once again extend my thanks to the expert panel for the work that they have put into presenting their report to the House.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (17:09):  I welcome the introduction of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012 into the House. This is an important step forward in the recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in our nation's Constitution, something I support. It is important that we maintain a bipartisan approach to their constitutional recognition and I welcome the Leader of the Opposition's proposal that both leaders make statements to the House of Representatives affirming support for constitutional recognition. I also commend the government on the establishment of a parliamentary joint select committee following the recommendation of the coalition. In December 2010 the government announced the formation of an expert panel on constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to consult throughout 2011.


I join with my coalition colleagues in thanking Professor Patrick Dodson and Mr Mark Leibler AC for their work in consulting with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to deliver a report on possible options for a constitutional change. It is essential that we work together with this expert panel to achieve this necessary change to the Constitution and to take the important step forward in recognising our first Australians. Achieving meaningful change to the Constitution has long been a commitment in this place of the Liberals and Nationals. 


It was a coalition government which was responsible for the historic 1967 referendum which removed racially discriminatory provisions from the Constitution. That referendum passed with the overwhelming support of the Australian people—more than 90 per cent of all votes cast and all states carrying it. In 1998 Prime Minister John Howard spoke in favour of a constitutional amendment that recognised the prior occupation of Australia by Indigenous peoples and their place in the Australian community as well as their right to preserve their distinctive identity. At the 2007 election the Liberals and Nationals made a commitment to hold a referendum on this matter, which took the Labor Party 2½ years to match. It is the coalition that has maintained its position on constitutional recognition and our commitment to seeing it pass. But we cannot do this alone.


Wagga Wagga based Wiradjuri elder Aunty Isabel Reid said it is time for the parliament to put politics aside and work together to achieve meaningful reform in this area, so I welcome the government's bipartisan, in-principle support of the constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I am pleased that this is now a bipartisan endeavour but there is still much work to be done. 


Given the fact that we are only months away from the federal election, little progress has been made to ensure there is necessary community consensus for this change at a referendum of the people. We just heard the member for Makin say that there have been only eight of 44 referenda passed. Thankfully, the fifth of those, on 27 May 1967, gave the Commonwealth power to make laws for Aboriginal people resident in the states and to include all Aboriginal people in the national census. But generally referenda fail, so it is absolutely crucial that when this referendum is put to the people it passes, as well as recognition in the Constitution for local government. We must make sure that when we do put it as a referendum it absolutely passes with the majority of the people.


Because of this, it is appropriate that we delay a referendum bill on this important issue until a time when there is wide, long-lasting and bipartisan support for constitutional recognition. The coalition has consistently reassured the government and the community of our strong support for the recognition of Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Islander peoples in the Constitution and we want to ensure that this happens in the right way, at a time when it has the most chance of succeeding at a referendum.

"Saffin, Janelle, MP",ALP,2013-02-11,"



Ms SAFFIN
 (Page—Government Whip) (17:13):  I rise to speak in strong support of this bill and it pleases me that it has come before the parliament. Having served on the expert panel, and now being a member of the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Islander Peoples, I have been deeply involved in this issue for quite some time. The contribution I make tonight is a rather small one because of the continuing work that I will be involved in to advance constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.


This bill is a landmark piece of legislation. It may be that it is only for two years, and some people have asked me about that. They have said, 'Why couldn't it last permanently?' I have said that the bill is put here. It is an act of faith. It is an act of faith by this parliament to say that we will work together in a spirit of cooperation with the communities, and have full consultation across the community of Australia with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, to advance the question of constitutional recognition. It is an act of faith, but it is a landmark in what it does for recognition.


It is one of our shorter bills. There are not too many short bills that get put through this place. They are usually longer and far more complex. But it is one of the shorter bills. It is one of our most easily read. It is also one that is easily understood, and it gives expression to that recognition.


One of the other issues that I wanted to talk about was everybody involved with the expert panel, my parliamentary colleagues the honourable member for Hasluck, the honourable member for Lyne and the honourable Senator Rachel Siewert from Western Australia. The four of us worked together in a very cooperative way to ensure that we were able to have input into the expert panel with all of the other members and say, 'We're putting forward the views of representatives of the parliament and also of the major parties, minor parties and Independents.' We were able to do that. The work that came out of the expert panel is a fine piece of work, and it gave the parliament, the government and the opposition something to work with. And it also, for the first time, presented and gave us a way forward with mechanisms for that recognition in the Constitution. It fleshed out all of the legal issues and other issues around it.


In working on the joint select committee on constitutional recognition, chaired by Senator Crossin, we approached our task, our work, in exactly that same way; in the spirit of cooperation and the spirit of working together to advance constitutional recognition. We have had a hearing, we have prepared a report and we have had our meetings and that spirit has prevailed, and that is the spirit that prevailed with the expert panel. The way forward relies on us working to come up with something that is absolutely satisfactory to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. That is essential. That is fundamental. That is a first and something that the Australian people can vote yes for.


We, the expert panel, had a methodology. The methodology that we used had four planks to it. It was to contribute to a more unified and reconciled nation, to be of benefit to and to accord with the wishes of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, to be capable of being supported by an overwhelming majority of Australians from across the political and social spectrums, and to be technically and legally sound. The work the panel was able to do was across those four planks, including being technically and legally sound. We had the time to do that. I know that that sort of methodology, that approach, will be required to continue to make sure that we get to where we want to be, where I want to be and where I know a lot of people want to be at the end of this process.


As tempted as I am to crow about who did what first and who was better at it, I do not want to impart that into this debate. I do not think that is helpful. I just think that we need to put our heads down and get on with the task we have been set. It is one of the most significant tasks that members of parliament and this parliament have been set in terms of an advancement in the relationship among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and all Australians. With those words, I commend this bill to the House.

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2013-02-11,"



Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (17:19):  I firstly thank all of those who have also spoken on this important piece of legislation, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People Recognition Bill 2012, which, if passed, will commit the parliament to placing before the Australian people at a referendum a proposal for constitutional change of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.


The principal purpose of this bill is to articulate the parliament's recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the original inhabitants of Australia and also their ongoing connection with their traditional lands and waters, cultures, languages and heritage. What I would like to do is contextualise this discussion. As you know, I am here as the member for Lingiari. I was first elected in 1987. Prior to my election to the seat of Lingiari I worked as a policy adviser to the Central Land Council in Alice Springs. Prior to that I was a school teacher and prior that I was a researcher at the Australian National University on government programs and their impact on Aboriginal communities. In one way or another, either directly or indirectly, I have been working with or for Aboriginal people for at least 35 years.


Over that period many things have changed. I can recall in the eighties the Aboriginal Treaty Committee, which had as its spearheads Dr Nugget Coombs and Judith Wright. I remember the advancing discussion around the issue of a treaty and recognition in those days and the public discussion that took place around it. I recall well the period after 1976 and the introduction of the Land Rights Act in the Northern Territory. I also recall the struggle that took place in this parliament in the mid-eighties around the issue of national land rights. I recall the divisive nature of the debate. I recall the resistance from the mining sector principally; from conservative governments, including Brian Burke and the Labor government in Western Australia; and from other conservative elements within the community. I remember well the division. I remember well the demonstrations and rallies, of which I was a part, on the front steps of Old Parliament House, regaling the then Hawke Labor government about the importance of looking at a land rights model which did not jeopardise the principles of the Northern Territory Land Rights Act, which was seen as a precedent in principle for all land rights across this country recognising the inalienable right of Aboriginal people over their lands. That was not to be the prospect of the national land rights bill. Had the national land rights legislation been passed, we would have seen the erosion of rights previously given by this parliament in the Northern Territory, and that was not seen as acceptable. Ultimately, as we know, the national land rights bill never went anywhere.


Subsequently I remember the discussions that took place around the formation of ATSIC. I remember the public rally and the discussion which took place around the 1988 Barunga Statement, which hangs so proudly in this parliament. The principles of that statement could well fit this bill. It talks about recognition. It talks about justice. It talks about understanding the imperatives of Aboriginal people, in this case from the Northern Territory. We can go back even further to the sixties and the bark petitions. This year is a significant anniversary of the bark petitions, which of course were a precursor to the discussion around land rights in this place, as well as the issues that arose at around a similar time—the treatment of Aboriginal people in the pastoral industry and the people who walked off Wave Hill et cetera. There is a whole combination of elements which go together to hear the voice of Aboriginal people screaming out for the recognition of rights and the recognition of justice over many years.


I was either a very close observer or a participant in some of these things. The key element for me, though, was the way in which Aboriginal people so proudly and so justly argued their own case, and they did it with such great dignity, until finally this parliament was forced as a result of an action by a Torres Strait Islander in the High Court to once and for all get rid of the concept of terra nullius in the early 90s. We then had native title being recognised. Again, I remember the divisive nature of the debates here in this parliament, of which I was part. I remember vividly the entrenched opposition from vested interests outside this place who claimed the world was going to end. I remember the disgusting maps used by conservatives to advertise what the impact would be of native title if native title legislation was ever passed. Thank God it is now history. I remember well the eloquence of Paul Keating in his Redfern speech in 1992, and I will come to that a little later.


For me, this is a really important piece of legislation for the people I represent. Over 40 per cent of my constituents are Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory—by far the largest proportion in any seat in this parliament. I am proud to represent them in this place and—let there be no doubt—I am here because of them in so many different ways. I have seen old men and old women who argued, for nearly four decades now, the justice of what we are now accepting as a principle in this parliament.


Many of those old advocates, those people of great wisdom, have sadly passed and are no longer with us. But if they were here they would applaud the way in which this parliament has now come together around these issues. They would say, I am certain: 'This is the place we need to be to have our rights properly recognised, to see that we are getting recognition at last for who we are and for how important we are as a people, as part of the national community, as part of the national conversation and as part of our national narrative.' That, to me, is ultimately what this is about: to say to these old men and women, 'The sacrifices you have made in the past and the sacrifices which are being made now have been to some avail.' We now have in front of us this Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill. I could not have imagined this a decade ago; in fact, quite possibly not even five or six years ago. But here we are in this place, people of goodwill, coming together to support this legislation.


I thought I should refer more directly to that wonderful speech by Paul Keating. Whilst I will not read it all I do want to refer to a couple of elements of it. This is surely one of the great speeches made by any great leader in this country since federation, and certainly in terms of the cause of recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and their rights this is first among them. He said:


And, as I say, the starting point might be to recognise that the problem starts with us non-Aboriginal Australians.


It begins, I think, with the act of recognition.


How right he was and how right he remains in the context of this piece of legislation. He referred to the Mabo judgement:


By doing away with the bizarre conceit that this continent had no owners prior to the settlement of Europeans, Mabo establishes a fundamental truth and lays the basis for justice.


I agree and I think we now all agree. There is little division over this issue anymore.


He described Mabo as 'an historic decision'. Then he said: 


The message should be that there is nothing to fear or to lose in the recognition of historical truth, or the extension of social justice, or the deepening of Australian social democracy to include indigenous Australians.


There is everything to gain.


How we know that now. Ultimately, later in this parliament we joined together in the Apology, which was so finely given by the former Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd. The Apology again addressed this issue of our history and justice, the understanding of the sacrifice and the hurt of the stolen generations. Former Prime Minister Paul Keating in his speech:


Where Aboriginal Australians have been included in the life of Australia they have made remarkable contributions.


He also said in this speech: 


Ever so gradually we are learning how to see Australia through Aboriginal eyes, beginning to recognise the wisdom contained in their epic story.


This is now a fundamental truth—something which is now beyond debate in this country.


I want to conclude my contribution by reading the last 30 or 40 words from Paul Keating's speech:


I said we non-indigenous Australians should try to imagine the Aboriginal view.


It can't be too hard.


Someone imagined this event today, and it is now a marvellous reality and a great reason for hope.


There is one thing today we cannot imagine.


We cannot imagine that the descendants of people whose genius and resilience maintained a culture here through fifty thousand years or more, through cataclysmic changes to the climate and environment, and who then survived two centuries of dispossession and abuse, will be denied their place in the modern Australian nation.


We cannot imagine that.


We cannot imagine that we will fail.


And with the spirit that is here today I am confident that we won't.


I am confident that we will succeed in this decade.


We did not succeed in that decade but we will succeed in this decade. I think it is a tribute to this parliament that we have come across the aisle to support this very important piece of legislation that will, I hope, lead us to a referendum which will finally and once and for all give Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people the recognition, which is their just deserts.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2013-02-11,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley—Government Whip) (16:01):  I am delighted to continue my contribution to this important bill which, as I said last week, is only an interim step towards recognition of Australia's Indigenous peoples in the Constitution. Before debate was interrupted, I was indicating to the chamber that, while ultimately it will be the voice of Australian people who give constitutional recognition to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, this bill will help raise awareness more broadly in the community of the issue and will also commence a conversation among us all. It remains the resolve of the government to pursue meaningful change to the Constitution that echoes the hopes and aspirations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The bill provides a mechanism for all Australians to become familiar with the possible wording for a constitutional statement that could be included in a future referendum.


I have seen countless times in our area the positive effect that recognition has on people through, for instance, the many award presentations held in the electorate each year, simply acknowledging the good deeds and efforts of individuals and groups. It provides an enormous sense of satisfaction and empowers them to continue to do their work. Imagine how empowering it would be were we to take this to a higher level, the most paramount level, and that is to have existence recognised within the heart of Australia's constitution. This is the sort of effect that the High Court's Mabo decision had on Indigenous people across the country when the court overturned a long-held legal view that this land had not been inhabited prior to European settlement. Overturning the principle of terra nullius acknowledged for the first time in law, for the first time since Captain Cook landed on these shores, that there were people here long before Europeans. It also validated their sense of being, their sense of belonging to the land, their sacred places and stories, and the struggles of all those who came before them. The Mabo decision itself opened the door for everything that has occurred since regarding Indigenous recognition.


It is absolutely important and appropriate to recognise the landmark speech made by former Prime Minister Paul Keating at Redfern Park in December 1992. There he publicly acknowledged to Indigenous Australians that European settlers were responsible for the enormous difficulties that Aboriginal communities continued to face. I quote Mr Keating directly:


We committed the murders.


We took the children from their mothers.


We practiced discrimination and exclusion.


It was our ignorance and our prejudice …


These were important words and should not be viewed simply in the sense of blame but, rather, recognition of past ills and to enable a situation where we can repair our relations and move the country forward. In a similar way, who can forget the tears of joy and relief displayed when former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd gave the formal apology on behalf the parliament and previous governments for the wrongs that had been inflicted on Indigenous Australians under the previous policy of removing children from their families.


This week marks the fifth anniversary of this significant act of reconciliation, for which Indigenous people in the Chifley electorate continue to be enormously thankful. I hasten to add that the Chifley electorate has one of the largest urban Aboriginal populations in the country, and that many Aboriginal people in our electorate are either members of the stolen generation or their direct descendants. Five years after the apology to the stolen generations, people will again gather in Mount Druitt this week to commemorate this significant national event. Long before 'reconciliation' was a commonplace term in our day-to-day vernacular, members of the community, whom I am proud to represent, started gathering each year in Mount Druitt to celebrate Aboriginal culture and to march together as one for reconciliation. Fifteen years later, the Mount Druitt reconciliation march continues to be an important event in the social justice calendar in the Chifley electorate. This event continues to be well attended and is also recognised as part of the ongoing festivities within the Blacktown City Council area.


At this point, I want to note that these types of events do not occur on their own and that within the context of the discussion that we are having in this place it is important to recognise the central figures who drive the work of the Mount Druitt and Districts Reconciliation Group—in particular, Marguerite Tobin, President; Pat Smith, Secretary; Maureen Berger, Vice President; and Debra Robertson, Treasurer. Their work has helped provide a platform to bring people together across our area, and they should be deeply thanked for this.


I also want to make reference at this point to something else which I was enormously proud to be associated with and which I also think has great relevance to this discussion. Last year, as a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, I was involved in the inquiry into Indigenous languages in Australia. I was very enthusiastically supportive of the establishment of the inquiry for a number of reasons, which I will touch upon shortly. I note that in its report titled Our land our languages, the committee recommended that the government support constitutional changes to include the recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages. The two issues of recognition are inextricably linked. The recommendation of constitutional recognition of Indigenous languages is an acknowledgment of the fact that, post Mabo, Australia should no longer be considered a monolingual nation. The committee found that at the time of colonisation there were an estimated 250 Australian Indigenous languages being used and that today we report with great regret that only 18 languages are spoken by significant numbers of people across all age groups.


The committee's report found that Indigenous language is inseparable from culture and a person's capacity to learn, making it a significant barrier to closing the gap on educational performance. As someone who grew up in a household where we learned English as a second language, I can testify to the powerful impact that language has on a sense of identity and a sense of being—and this is particularly so with Indigenous language and the role that it plays in day-to-day existence. I know how important having access to language is. It is a bridge between generations and in forming an important bond with culture. It should not be underestimated.


I cannot stress enough the effort that has been undertaken in the preparation of this report and then to bring those recommendations to life. I can testify with my own eyes and ears—hearing and seeing—what is being done in our area. It is great to see the amount of work that is being undertaken to keep Indigenous languages alive and to teach these languages to young people from within cultures. In particular I note Hebersham Public School and the work that it is doing with its Koori Play and Chat program. This program is designed to teach younger Indigenous Australians the importance of their own language and it does so within the educational context. In the future, how exciting it will be when students from all cultures are able to study and master one or more of our own Indigenous languages. What greater recognition of Indigenous culture could there be? 


The simple answer to that is that there is no greater recognition for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people than the single most important document to our nation—the Australian Constitution. As I indicated earlier, the Constitution sets out rules for the conduct of the Commonwealth of Australia. But, importantly, as a document it helps define who we are and what we value. Also within this document, the truest recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders must and should occur.

"Turnbull, Malcolm, MP",LP,2013-02-11,"



Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth) (16:09):  As honourable members are aware, the opposition supports the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012 and warmly supports the long overdue move to provide for the recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Australian Constitution. Indeed, the second of the two referendum proposals which were defeated in 1999 was a personal project of the Prime Minister of the time, John Howard—a new preamble to the Constitution. It was designed, in large measure, to achieve this very objective—to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.


That preamble proposal was, regrettably, defeated in the referendum, as indeed was the change for which I was leading the campaign—to make Australia a republic and ensure that our head of state was no longer the King or Queen of the United Kingdom but rather an Australian citizen chosen by Australians. It is worth noting that the preamble—and this is a cautionary observation—had absolutely unanimous political support. I am not aware of any member of the House of Representatives, the Senate or any political party who opposed the preamble. Notwithstanding that, the preamble achieved fewer votes than the republic proposal. This is a very important point about the practicality of this change to which I will return.


Our Constitution was not a document establishing an independent country. Australia was not an independent country in 1901. It was constituted as a self-governing dominion within the British Empire but subordinate to the imperial government. The Governor-General was not an Australian head of state. The Governor-General was not chosen by Australians or appointed on the recommendation of the Australian government. The Governor-General was an imperial viceroy and indeed was the effective representative of the imperial government in Australia right up until the 1930s—1933, I believe—when there was, for the first time, a British high commissioner appointed to Australia.


So it is important, when you read the Australian Constitution and see references to the Queen—which are defined in the Constitution Act as being references to 'Her Majesty Queen Victoria and her heirs and successors in the sovereignty of the United Kingdom'—that does not, in 1901 terms, mean the Queen as she is today, acting on the advice of the state government; it means the Queen acting on the advice of her imperial ministers and the imperial government. The Constitution is filled with provisions which speak to this subordination of Australia. A very good example—this is one of a number, but I will just recite one—is section 59, which states that the Queen may annul any Australian law within one year of it being enacted. Indeed, under other provisions, the Queen has the ability to withhold consent to any law which had been reserved for her consent by the Governor-General.


So there was a whole scheme. If the Governor-General, the representative of the imperial government, felt there were an Australian law that was out of place, he could refer it back to Whitehall where the Queen or King, acting on the advice of the imperial government, could then knock it back. If, by some mischance, the Governor-General approved a bill and it became law—became an act—the Queen nonetheless could annul it.


That of course raises the interesting constitutional question of what would happen if an incoming government in the 21st century were to advise Her Majesty the Queen that she should annul certain laws passed by the previous government within the previous 12 months. It is an interesting question as to whether that dead letter could rise, vampire-like, from the grave and bedevil all the constitutional lawyers and politicians.


But my point is the Constitution was a document written in and of its own times. It has evolved mightily. It has evolved not very much by the method that the founders imagined, by formal amendment, because it has been so difficult to amend the Constitution. Indeed, of 44 proposals to amend the Constitution, only eight have been successful. The last one which was even remotely controversial that was successful was in 1946. The Aboriginal rights referendum in the 1960s, an initiative of the Holt government, was unanimously supported. And the other referendum changes, at least in my lifetime, that have been successful have been essentially technical ones. How the Constitution has evolved has been largely through Constitutional or political evolution. There were the Statute of Westminster and the Australia acts, which had the result that without changing a line in the Constitution references to the Queen, meaning the Queen acting on the advice of the imperial government, came to mean the Queen acting on the advice of the Australian government. And then you have all of the changes effected by the justices of the High Court as they interpreted the Constitution.


But we have in many respects, as George Winterton once said, in Constitutional terms a frozen continent. We have been unable to change our Constitution in any controversial way. Many people have said that you need bipartisan support to change the Constitution. It is certainly very hard to change it without it, but it is absolutely not enough. The preamble is a very good example of that, a very good demonstration of the force of what I am saying.


In order to successfully change the Constitution you need to have overwhelming public support, a real sense of momentum, the strongest possible support, and very little opposition—somewhere between very little and no opposition. The reason for that, in my judgement—and I acknowledge that it was the Chief Justice Murray Gleeson who drew this to my attention many years ago—is that we have compulsory voting in Australia. So people who are not interested in the issue, not because they are foolish or irresponsible but simply because they are not interested in the issue—people who have chosen not to pay attention to it, who have not read all the literature and have not watched the debates, and are then, as we are in Australia, dragged along by force of law to the polling booth and presented with a proposition—are invariably much more likely to vote no than yes. If you don't know, you are likely to vote no. Indeed, at every referendum which has been contentious the forces against change have said quite openly, 'If you don't know, vote no.' Obviously the less you know about it the more likely you are to be open to scare campaigns and the like. They are not unknown in political circles, so honourable members I think will acknowledge.


So the big challenge we face with this project is not that everyone in this building is not united in their support for having a Constitution that more properly speaks to the Australia of today: the Australia that does not treat Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders as it did in 1901, as not simply second-class citizens but effectively non-persons, noncitizens, not even to be counted, not to vote, as though they had just been airbrushed out of history. That was pretty much where it was in 1901, to our great shame. But all of that has changed. How do we make this document speak to the civilised, just, fair Australia of 2013? How do we get it passed?


Some people would say, 'Oh well, just give it a go. Work up a referendum proposal and see how you go.' The consequences, to my mind, of a referendum proposal on this topic being defeated would be very serious. It would be seen as a national rejection of reconciliation. It would do extraordinary damage to Australia in terms of our own perception of ourselves and indeed to the world's perception of us. So to have a referendum on this topic is a momentous roll of the dice. I think Australia would have been better advised, obviously, to have approved the republic proposal in 1999. I imagine there are many people in the world who still imagine that Australia is in some respects not fully independent because the Queen of the United Kingdom is our head of state, notwithstanding that we are of course as thoroughly an independent country—in fact in some respects more independent—as the United Kingdom. So perceptions matter. But with this question, because it touches on such a sensitive issue of race, the stakes are much higher.


So I am very pleased to see that the bill provides that the minister shall within 12 months of this bill being enacted take soundings, and report on the feasibility of a change being achieved. It is something that is going to have to be undertaken with great care and with great responsibility. There is a tendency in some sections of the media and in some sections of the community to run very hysterical scare campaigns on a range of issues. We are all familiar with those. This is a proposal that is very potentially vulnerable to that. You can well imagine people saying, 'Oh, if we were to make these changes, Aboriginals will be able to claim our backyard, claim our house.' You can imagine all the scare campaigns that could be run. They will have to be resisted with great force, and care. This is going to be a test of our maturity as a nation. Are we able to tell the truth about ourselves? We no longer regard Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as second-class citizens or noncitizens. There may be some people who do, but there is no serious constituency. There is no accounting for a handful of people. But overwhelmingly the vast majority—that is 99.999 per cent—of Australians share the same aspirations as are in this bill. But it is so easy to run a scare campaign.


Of course, you have to remember that in any referendum you have to have a specific proposal. You cannot just have a vote on recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, just like you cannot have a vote on whether Australia should be a republic. You have to have some specific words. It is always possible for people to say, 'Oh well, we agree with the general objective but we object to these words.' They try to clothe their opposition in a technical objection. This bill, which some people have said is pretty innocuous, is much more potent than most of its readers imagine. It is in many respects a challenge to all of us, to all Australians: are we mature enough, are we grown up enough, are we confident enough to say we are not going to play petty politics, scare campaign politics, frightening people politics? Are we going to face up to the facts and maturely and soberly find a set of words that achieve the recognition that we should all support, but does so in a way that it can be carried? This is a great project that we are looking at today and we should all strive very hard to ensure that it is completed successfully.

"O'Neill, Deb, MP",ALP,2013-02-11,"



Ms O'NEILL
 (Robertson) (16:24):  I too rise with some hope and sense of anxiety, I expect. That was very well articulated by the member for Wentworth, because this Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012 is indeed adult reading for an adult nation, and we need to take the necessary precautions to ensure that all Australians come with us on the journey as we move towards this appropriate recognition of the reality of our country and history.


I am proud to be a member of the party that removed the final vestiges of the White Australia policy. I am proud to be a member of the party that handed the first tracts of land back to traditional owners and I am proud to be a member of the party that apologised to the stolen generations. I am proud to stand here in this place as part of a Labor government that continues to make important strides forward in the official recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in our Constitution.


While we should be proud of these strides we made as a government and nation it is also important to recognise that there have been times we should be ashamed of: times that we have gone against our great professed Australian belief in egalitarianism, times in our national history that reveal us as a people failing to meet that sense of our best selves, times in our history where we have had a sense of what we should strive for to ensure we all move forward together and times when, through lack of generosity or fear, the historical record reveals us as far less than the best Australians we could be. So let this time, our time, not be one of those shameful times.


In order to advance Australia toward fairness we, the Gillard government, are introducing this very important bill to the House. On our journey toward community understanding of the substance of a referendum and a confidence that such a referendum will successfully achieve a positive outcome for the entire population—the first Australians and those of us who arrived a bit later on boats and planes—this bill is both an instrument that enables that conversation to occur and a record of our journey toward that day of constitutional recognition.


We find ourselves here, in this House of Representatives, with this Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill before us. It is a bill that will establish an act of recognition acknowledging the unique and special place of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and their descendants as the first people of our nation. It will serve as a stepping stone to holding a successful referendum that will change the Australian Constitution to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. This should be a bipartisan goal, and I am very heartened by the comments of my fellow parliamentarians in this debate. This should be a goal that brings all Australians together, not one that divides us. This should be a goal that we can be proud of, not one tarnished by political gains.


As part of our commitment to recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Australian constitution, this government established an expert panel to lead a discussion with the communities to move this issue forward and to bring it to public consciousness. The expert panel consulted widely, and we in this place should be very proud of the high level of community engagement that was achieved during this process. When the report was handed to parliament in January last year we had a comprehensive set of proposals that would guide our government and future governments toward the effort of recognition.


We have already invested $10 million to help build public awareness and community support for change. In my role as the member for Robertson on the very beautiful Central Coast—Darkinjung and Guringai country—I meet wonderful, active citizens who deeply understand what we are seeking to achieve here. I commend a particular group from my electorate known as Friends of Mingaletta, formerly called Central Coast Citizens for Constitutional Change, and I acknowledge and put on the record today my regard for their work and advocacy in bringing more attention to this issue in the seat of Robertson. The Friends of Mingaletta have already held a number of community meetings, and they have brought together community leaders to enlist their support in promoting and publicising the need for constitutional change and engaging the wider community in that debate. It is a task that has presented quite a challenge and they have certainly risen to that challenge. They know that for this historic and necessary change to come about we have to pull together—we have to come together as a country. And, as the member for Wentworth indicated, there are those whose interest, perhaps, in making money above making a country might interrupt this journey in some way. We need to be very careful to engage our media in enabling an historic, forward-looking campaign to achieve the outcomes that this legislation sets in train.


We have to talk about this issue with colleagues; we have to talk about this issue in schools; we have to talk about this issue through social media and, importantly, we have speak about it in the parliament. Indeed, as parliamentarians we are called to lead discussions in our own communities in very positive ways about the issues that are at hand and being considered through this bill. We have to drive the conversation. We have to ensure that as every week and month passes more non-Indigenous Australians hear about this proposition—that more non-Indigenous Australians say 'yes' to recognition; that more non-Indigenous Australians say yes to closing the gap. Passing this act will continue that momentum for change.


Again, referring to the region in which I live—the seat of Robertson—I am privileged to have a very active and growing local Aboriginal community, ably represented by Sean Gordon, CEO of the local Darkinjung Aboriginal Land Council. I asked him to bring together some of his own thoughts on what this legislation will mean for the local Aboriginal population that he leads at this moment, along with other great leaders in our local Aboriginal community, and I would very much like to read those comments into the record now:


Darkinjung local Aboriginal council is located on the Central Coast of New South Wales representing 9,000 Aboriginal people on the Central Coast and  is the fastest-growing Aboriginal community in Australia based on the 2011 census data. Our experience is similar to that of our remote communities although not to the same severity. What is clear is that Aboriginal people living within urban settings are more likely to be disconnected from country, language and identity due to colonisation and European settlement. The Act of Recognition bill is an important critical step towards Constitutional recognition. This bill provides an opportunity to introduce as an interim measure the concept of recognising Aboriginal people as the first people of this country. The bill is a step in the right direction as it establishes foundation to build the necessary support structures to gain bipartisan agreement within parliament; however, more importantly, the bill allows the Australian community, both black and white, to better understand the importance of recognising aboriginal people in the Constitution. The immediate impact of the Act of Recognition Bill, if recognised, supported and passed by parliament demonstrates that there is a genuine commitment to create a real and lasting change between black and white Australia and demonstrates a sign of good faith that governments care and acknowledge our history. The Act of Recognition bill should not be seen as the solution to address the existing problems between black and white Australians nor should it be seen as the solution to fixing communities. The bill should first and foremost be seen as the first step in a true recognition and a genuine reconciliation. This bill, if passed, will provide our future generations—our next generation of leaders—the opportunity to be proud of our history and proud of who we are as Australians. The bill will hopefully generate and sustain a new generation of leadership amongst Aboriginal people and communities and allow future leaders to concentrate on remedies and solutions to our communities without the burden of recognition or the lack thereof. Finally, if the Act of Recognition bill is passed, it will lay the foundation that is necessary to achieve constitutional recognition of Indigenous Australians and demonstrate what we all know and love: that Australia truly is a great country.


Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, I want to thank Sean Gordon for those words and all the representatives on the land council for their contribution to our life—our cultural life and our physical life on the Central Coast. I have been taught to look with new eyes many times by my Aboriginal brothers and sisters, and I am sure that you have had similar experiences, as we are gifted with opportunities to travel around this great wide brown land.


This legislation makes the clear statement of recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the first inhabitants of Australia. It acknowledges the unique history, culture and connection to traditional lands and waters. It also commits to closing the gap in life outcomes between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and other Australians and acknowledges that constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples is an important part of that process.


This bill should not be a substitute for full recognition but, rather, it should encourage all Australians to become familiar with the need for and the importance of a constitutional change. Sunset provisions in the act will mean that a future parliament will reassess how to move forward with the change and will not allow this legislative instrument to become entrenched at the expense of a referendum. The apology did not bring a full and equal opportunity for Indigenous Australians and, sadly, nor will this referendum, even if it proceeds to a successful conclusion from the perspective we have been discussing here today. Nonetheless both are very important steps in bringing closer that goal and bringing it to reality.


As the Prime Minister's words echoed just the other day, there is much more to do to close the gap, and this bill is, in essence, part of the journey towards closing that gap. I do recall, as a student, accessing a book in the library one Friday afternoon. It was one of those Friday afternoons when perhaps I was avoiding a more onerous task, but I was browsing the shelves and pulled off a book and opened it up. Sometimes in our lives the pages that appear before us are very powerful. The story that was recounted on those pages was of a different interaction that might have occurred when the British arrived here in this country. I read several pages of an interaction in which the white arrivals spoke to the Aboriginal people and marvelled at the richness of their understanding of country, marvelled at the uniqueness of their language, marvelled at the sustainability of the way in which they lived and marvelled at the complex multikinship structures, and I often wonder what a different country we might be if that fantasy had been a reality. The moment for proper engagement and acknowledgement of the richness of Aboriginal culture passed at that time. It is important that at this time, while it is our duty and we are on watch, we make every endeavour possible to ensure that we reach out across the nation, that we engage in sound enabling education that draws us together with an acknowledgement of our common humanity and draws us to a much better and long overdue recognition of the place of the first peoples of this nation. I commend the bill to the House.

"Laming, Andrew, MP",LP,2013-02-11,"



Mr LAMING
 (Bowman) (16:39):  Indeed the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012 allows this nation more time to debate the issue of constitutional recognition, to build consensus and to work on increased awareness right across this great country. The debate, I think, has had two important contributions made by the previous speakers. On our side, from the member for Wentworth, there was a very, very clear elucidation of just how complex a referendum change can be, and the previous speaker referred to 'an adult conversation for an adult nation'. It is a theme that I would like to pick up, because the one component of that discussion that has not yet been added to this debate in this parliament is the conversation within Aboriginal Australia about their role in succeeding in this very, very important course of events.


I would like to focus a lot of my speech on a 2009 quarterly essay by Noel Pearson, not because I do not believe that it is, for the very simple and self-evident case, a very important piece of work that will be remembered as really expanding on the role of Indigenous Australia in its own journey towards constitutional recognition but because large elements of this quarterly essay have yet to find their way into Hansard. I believe that important parts of this debate on this day will be looked back on, and we will see the important role that this piece has played in this journey.


Of course Pearson, like many people, is inspired by the readings of others. In this quarterly essay, he focuses on Jonathan Lear's Radical Hope: Ethics in the Face of Cultural Devastation, a work in 2006, where Lear asks the important question: what would it be for such radical hope to be justified for Aboriginal Australia? Those who hold, harbour and project such hope must be serious in order to succeed. Pearson makes the very important point that determination alone is not enough, that it is necessary but not sufficient, that we will need more than that. When you are struggling against all odds, determination is no guarantee of success. He makes the very important observation that discipline is just as important. The 'great vulnerability' that he observes in Aboriginal people has been that the institutions of their culture mandated a seriousness that, met long ago, fell apart and has really struggled to restitute itself. It has been inadequately replaced or inadequately rejuvenated. In the midst of the ruins of the old world and facing the mutations of the new, Aboriginal Australia is seeking an accommodation of those things that make Aboriginal culture something of a serious people.


Pearson postulates that all pre-modern peoples face this very challenge, that they carry within their culture 'some institutional essence of what made and maintained them as peoples', but at the same time they are facing modern people—to use that vernacular—who are secular and unanchored. Modern people come to feel a double-edged sword, because modern people in many ways are free of that traditional orthodoxy. That includes the ability that we have to lose our own identity as modern people and to also succumb to and assimilate easily into a dominant culture, which is not the characteristic of pre-modern people. That is a fascinating observation by Pearson. Those who resist assimilation really have no protection against its inexorable advance, so Pearson asks this very question: what will it take to seriously engage that challenge ahead? Obviously, he makes his case that education is something that can, in a parallel world, be pursued with other elements like constitutional recognition. If I am reading his quarterly essay correctly, he says, 'Never make constitutional recognition something upon which we become utterly reliant but let it be something that we engage in, in parallel.'


Pearson makes two observations about what it takes to be a very, very serious people. The first of those is to live in hard places—the very self-evident observation that, the harder the place, the more serious must be the people. Human societies occupy some of the hardest and most inhospitable and economically irrational corners of the world. They are places on Earth that require serious people to sustain them as homes, and strong rationales are needed to maintain that hearth in hard places. The second element is when people are striving to maintain and transmit to future generations their pre-modern culture in a language of a modern and global world. The more esoteric and the less economically rational that these cultures may be deemed and that languages are to the imperatives of the modern global world, the more serious a challenge these people will face and the more serious they will have to be in order to retain their culture and language.


I think he very, very simply elucidates that the challenge facing elements of traditional and often remote Aboriginal Australia is even more than we can understand as modern people, to use his expression. His notion of seriousness is about orthodoxy—a 'serious person' in the sense that we are concerned with an orthodox person. Pearson makes the interesting observation that one of the great challenges to the traditional life has been alcohol. He notes that in a range of orthodox cultures around the world alcohol is anathema but that that is not the case in traditional Aboriginal Australia where they have faced a range of European vices that are unprecedented and where, he notes, 'Aboriginal Law did not evolve to proscribe these vices according to comparable principles of precedent'—principles that you might find in other cultures. The whole point that he makes about orthodoxy is that in many of the cultures—but not in Aboriginal Australia—elements like alcohol, gambling and illicit drugs have become anathema but that that has not yet occurred in many elements of traditional Australia which have survived to the present but remain 'fatally compromised by the assumption that the Law which underpins this High Culture does not have anything to say about the European vices'.


This is an observation that I was privileged enough to be part of in 1994, when petrol sniffing first arrived at the Central Desert community of Lajamanu in the mid-nineties. These were the first images that senior Aboriginal people on the traditional council had of their grandchildren: with half-cans of Coke tied around their noses and filled with petrol. They called a community meeting in Lajamanu in the first few weeks that I was there. I had no language to understand the discussion, but in their Warlpiri—their emotional, heartfelt Warlpiri—they had no words to describe these very vices, so they simply borrowed from the English. The only parts that I could understand of the entire communication at this community meeting were the English words for the vices for which they had no traditional response. And so what really started these contradictions that we see between a traditional strong culture based on kinship and the almost impotent powerlessness of dealing with external threats is something that Pearson challenges his own people with. He challenges them to have that conversation and to walk in both worlds, where there is both a traditional and a mainstream response to those challenges.


This brings me to the fifth Closing the gap report, where, in a presentation from the Prime Minister that was just touching on some levels of early data about which we can all be optimistic, she then switched back to very much a focus on the banned drinkers registers, on Alice Springs and on disputes between jurisdictions—something which I think belittled that report. I think we were really there for a distillation of the evidence, to be hopeful for where there is promise and to be rightfully concerned where there is not progress. But, in the end, quoted in that very important—and landmark—fifth anniversary speech was data provided by the then Labor minister from the Northern Territory and released prior to the Northern Territory election which compared the impact of the Banned Drinkers Register to its impact the previous year. 


What was not known to anyone—not to those listening to that speech nor even to the Prime Minister who read it out—was that the data attributed to the use of the 'Enough is Enough' Banned Drinkers Register in Alice Springs had actually had lifted out of it all of the alcohol-related antisocial behaviour reports attributed to domestic violence. These reports were not included after the Banned Drinkers Register came into effect, but they of course had all been included prior to the Banned Drinkers Register. This is a comparison of apples and oranges, and a false attribution of the impact of the Banned Drinkers Register when, on any fair and balanced assessment of the data in the Northern Territory, the Banned Drinkers Register had very little impact at all on dysfunctional behaviour or antisocial behaviour in Alice Springs. But that is not what has been carved into stone in the fifth Closing the gap report. That is genuinely unfortunate.


To emerge from these challenges that are fundamentally destructive of any culture, be it traditional or otherwise, the challenge for Aboriginal Australia will be to incorporate into their own belief systems having one foot in mainstream legal systems, and of course to continue also the culture of their people that have for millennia dealt with an enormous number of challenges but are yet to deal with some of the Western vices that I have outlined.


The late Maria Lane, a South Australian Indigenous academic who was mentioned in that quarterly essay, also made an important, though unpublished, contribution which Pearson picks up in his essay. In that paper, Lane observes that, effectively, we have seen a division—which Marcia Langton in her Boyer Lectures this year picked up on again through a slightly different prism. Lane refers to: 'A Welfare-Embedded'—Aboriginal—'Population which is risk- and work-averse, and benefits-, wealth- and security-oriented', and to the other leaf of the dichotomy, 'An Open-Society Population which is opportunity-, effort- and outcome-oriented'. She described this division very early, long before the Boyer Lectures of this year where Marcia Langton referred to a north and a south: a north economically engaging in the mining opportunities of remote Australia, and then very much a more eastern seaboard, urban Aboriginal debate that is predominantly focused on the rights-based debate. She makes the obvious point: 'Why can't we have both?' or 'Should we even be learning from the activities of the north and making sure that we don't become preoccupied with the former?'


Interestingly though, it was Lane who first described this. She talks about the origins of the open society population being found in the forties and the fifties when Indigenous people first started leaving the settlements to move to urban areas and often picked up very menial and basic work. Their children grew up within that ethos. Secondly, she talks about a number of the settlements where people either chose not to, or were unable to, move from remote Australia, predominantly because the welfare system trapped them there on a pedestal—to move from those communities was, effectively, to walk away from a lot of the welfare supports that one relies on in a community. It is interesting that this has been picked up a long time ago and is still informing debate today.


I think the most important thing that Lane talked about was that this open society population has developed almost independently of many of our Indigenous-specific educational interventions. It occurred simply by movement to opportunity, and that is why it is very important to make sure that we never prohibit, or never make it difficult through government policy, for Aboriginal Australians to move to where opportunities are. We should never say to them, 'Well, you'll lose your publicly funded housing'. We should never say to them, 'If you move to take a job, there go your entitlements'. We have to find a way to transition into grasping opportunities, because through capability of course comes opportunity.


Lane scathingly characterised a lot of the programs as being preoccupied with questions of relevance, cultural sensitivity, language and racist theories such as learning styles, theory-appropriate curriculum, role of elders, parents or community, self-esteem, cooperativeness, need for outdoor activity, focus on sport, love of art and all those Aboriginal exceptionalism arguments, which failed to identify that, at the heart of it, all Australians are just wanting the same thing for their children. As a result of the irrelevance of many of these specific policies, Pearson argues that there will be a predicted shift away from this exceptionalism, and back towards a focus that every opportunity that Australia offers should be available to all Australians.


In that ideal, we are now seeing break-outs right across the country, not just in Cape York. Great work is being done in the Kimberley and great work is being done in parts of outer metropolitan urban Indigenous programming as well—not to mention in Queensland the great work being done by QAIHC and the establishment of a range of Aboriginal-controlled medical centres that are working in this area to run on a mainstream model but deliver Indigenous-tailored and Indigenous-centred and controlled care.


In Cape York there is of course the focus on education. They are initiating this debate that says, 'We can walk in both worlds and enjoy the best of both, and that we can realise that by starting with the children.' Chris Sarra, Noel Pearson and a range of others around the country are working on that.


I have explicitly focused on this, because I think the most important thing of all is not to have a mostly non-Indigenous discussion about our Constitution. We also need to have a discussion with Indigenous Australia about the shape of the next Indigenous studying, training and working population. At the moment we have a great dissonance. We have a falling out of educational opportunities for a whole host of reasons, and an expungement of Indigenous language out of a range of state educational curricula. We have children falling out of the system the minute they drop out of school, and we have no community-wide system to ensure that working-age cohorts all get an opportunity. And ultimately, we have not yet developed a mature welfare system that is prepared to support not just an Aboriginal Australian but any Australian who is willing to move further than the 90-minute Centrelink rule to take up an opportunity. Only when our welfare system can mature to that point can we absolutely grasp the opportunity that every Australian family wants, be they Indigenous or otherwise.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2013-02-11,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (16:54):  I too take this opportunity to speak to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012. This legislation follows the report titled Recognising. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Constitution, which was presented about a year ago. I note that the member for Page, who was a member of the expert panel that put together that report, is in the chamber. I say to her on behalf of all of her colleagues that it is, indeed, an excellent report. I have read through it and I believe it sums up the situation of Indigenous people of this country very well.


When I think about Australia's identity and what distinguishes Australia from other nations, the first thing that comes to my mind is the Australian Indigenous people—the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of this country: people whose attachment to this land dates back tens of thousands of years; people with a fascinating and, indeed, unique culture. Since 1788, the place of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the Australian story has been controversial and at times divisive. Since colonisation, Australia does not have a proud history in its treatment of the Indigenous people. It is a history littered with government policy and decisions based on prejudice and ignorance. One only has to look at the speeches of Prime Ministers Edmund Barton and Alfred Deakin to understand the racist thinking of the time. Nor was the racism directly and solely meant for the Indigenous people of this land. In fact, I suspect that most of it was intended towards other people. Policies which in hindsight have been discriminative, racist and heartless arose as a result of thoughts in that era.


In recent decades, however, there has been considerable effort to recognise the rights and equality of Indigenous people in Australia. The 1967 referendum, land rights, Mabo and Indigenous political representation have all been commendable examples of changing attitudes throughout this country, yet many other efforts have had only limited success when assessed against the often substantial resources committed. The issue of Indigenous recognition in the Australian Constitution is a prime example of that. Few people expressly opposed the proposition, yet following through with constitutional recognition has proved incredibly difficult. I heard the speech by the member for Wentworth and he made that very point. He quite rightly also made the point that not only has it proven to be very difficult in the past but also it is likely to be very difficult in the future. That may be partly explained by the broader issue about the difficulty of amending the Australian Constitution. Only eight propositions out of 44 put to the Australian people have been successful. I suspect, however, that it has more been about a lack of commitment by politicians at all levels across Australia. The rhetoric and the platitudes have not always been matched by the necessary commitment and effort required, in a similar way to the lack of commitment that we are seeing on the question of local government recognition.


Indigenous Australians are understandably cautious about the latest proposal. Recognition of Australia's Indigenous people in Australia's Constitution will be more than just a symbolic or patronising gesture. The Australian Constitution sits as the foundation document of Australia's legal framework. It provides a framework for Australian laws and the responsibilities of federal and state governments. It is the founding document of our nation. The absence of any recognition of Indigenous people in the Australian Constitution is a denial of the truth about the origins and history of Australia and perpetuates an injustice that may have been accepted in 1901 but it has no place in Australia today.


Indigenous recognition in the Australian Constitution will recognise the rightful place of Indigenous people in the Australian story, but it will do much more than that. Constitutional recognition, reconciliation and Closing the Gap all intersect. Reconciliation will never be complete without truthful recognition of Indigenous people in Australia's history and its future. Importantly, every act of reconciliation will break down barriers to Closing the Gap strategies. Acknowledging injustice and grievances can be a powerful step in the reconciliation process.


That is why former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's national apology was so important in unifying Australia. The Prime Minister's Closing the Gap statement on Wednesday, 6 February, only last week, highlighted progress made in overcoming Indigenous disadvantage and hardship. The statement also reaffirms the considerable disadvantage that continues to exist throughout Indigenous communities—the kind of disadvantage that led to the Northern Territory intervention policy. I believe that the Northern Territory intervention policy is well intentioned, but it will be some time before a proper evaluation of it can be made. My expectation is that there will be some initial benefits, and those who support the policy will point to those benefits as evidence that the policy is working. There are concerns, however, that over time there will be ways found to circumvent the policy, and just as prohibition did not stop the consumption of liquor in the US, the intervention may result in corruption and illegal activity in order to get around it.


I am also told that intervention is causing considerable resentment amongst many of the Indigenous people. Addressing core problems through education, awareness and inclusion would very likely have much better long-term benefits than protectionist laws which attempt to control behaviour. Whilst disadvantage continues, many of Australia's Indigenous people will continue to feel resentment, continue to feel discriminated against and continue to focus on past injustices. So Closing the Gap will heal wounds and enable reconciliation, and conversely reconciliation will help close the gap. Both will be enhanced by constitutional recognition of Australia's Indigenous people. This legislation, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012, is an important step in that process. It follows the work of the expert panel that I referred to in my opening remarks. Cognisant of the track record of constitutional change, the government wants to ensure that any proposal for Indigenous recognition has the best chance of success. With that in mind, this bill establishes a process for consulting with the Australian people, getting the wording of the proposed constitutional change right and overcoming procedural concerns as obstacle to a successful referendum. 


Last year I was asked to address a forum organised by the City of Salisbury on the question of Indigenous recognition in the Australian Constitution. The Hon. Robyn Layton AO, QC, former Supreme Court justice, currently co-chair of Reconciliation South Australia and, in fact, South Australian of the year, Professor Peter Buckskin, Dean of Indigenous Scholarship, Engagement and Research at the University of South Australia, and Khatija Thomas, Commissioner for Aboriginal Engagement, also spoke at the forum and shared their expert perspectives on the constitutional change and the process required. It was an interesting discussion. I came away from the forum with two clear observations. Firstly, whilst the City of Salisbury team had gone to considerable efforts to organise the event, the numbers participating, although as well as expected, reflected the general lack of interest in the matter. The attendance at the forum was consistent with many other forums that I have attended with respect to Indigenous issues. The point I make is that regardless of how much we try it is quite often very difficult to engage the broader Australian community in questions and issues relating to the Indigenous people of this land. That is certainly one of the observations that I came away with.


Secondly, there was, from memory, unanimous agreement from those present that whilst Indigenous constitutional recognition should occur, there was still considerable work to be done to ensure that a referendum on the question would be successful. The concerns expressed on the night were consistent with the concerns that have been expressed in this place and previously in other places and at other times. It is extremely difficult to change our Constitution. It is even more difficult to change our Constitution when we are dealing with a matter relating to the Indigenous people of this land.


Whilst I note that the states of Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria have all acknowledged Australia's Indigenous people in their state constitutions, I am also conscious of the difficulty that we face in changing the Australian Constitution. In fact I understand that attempts in 1944, 1974, 1988 and 1999 to change the Constitution with respect to Australia's Indigenous people all failed. The only successful attempt was in 1967 and I understand that it was overwhelmingly successful, in fact the most successful change to any Constitutional matter in the history of the nation. I suspect there was also a very good reason for that, and the changes made at a time, I think, were quite logical and understood by the Australian people as being changes that should be made without there being any disagreement from any quarters.


Whilst the Mabo High Court decision of 1992 led to the Native Title Act and the establishment of an Indigenous Land Fund and the delivery of a social justice package, I believe that it also raised profound questions about the Australian Constitution and in particular the moral and legal requirements for Indigenous recognition. For example, if Indigenous ownership pre-dates British occupation, are those lands exempt from colonial law, and what other rights therefore pre-date the Australian Constitution? Such questions will continue to remain unresolved and these are questions about the sovereignty of this nation. I note that the expert panel made some comments about that in the report—very good comments, I might add—but questions remain unresolved and in fact they are questions that now arise, in my view, as a result of the Mabo decision. Furthermore, the Australian Constitution cannot continue to remain silent on a matter which the High Court has now ruled on and which contradicts a critical presumption on which, I understand, the Australian Constitution was framed.


I conclude with a couple of other observations. I note that in many of the recommendations, including some of the propositions put forward by the expert panel, words like 'recognise', 'acknowledge' and 'respect' feature in any proposed wording that may be put to the Australian people as the words that we ought to adopt with our Constitution. I note that the word 'rights' is never mentioned. I do not know how others in the future will interpret words like 'recognise', 'acknowledge' and 'respect' unless you attach specifics to those words. If you do not, then, quite frankly, it will also leave a degree of ambiguity about what the Constitution says about our Indigenous people. It seems to me that if the word 'rights' is not mentioned, and is never going to be mentioned, then the Indigenous people of this land, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, will continue to feel aggrieved. Perhaps, as other nations have done, it is time for this nation to also strike a treaty with the Indigenous people of this land. At least that will then enable Indigenous people and the non-Indigenous people to move forward with a degree of certainty about the rights of each party. With those comments I commend the bill to the House and once again extend my thanks to the expert panel for the work that they have put into presenting their report to the House.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2013-02-11,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (17:09):  I welcome the introduction of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012 into the House. This is an important step forward in the recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in our nation's Constitution, something I support. It is important that we maintain a bipartisan approach to their constitutional recognition and I welcome the Leader of the Opposition's proposal that both leaders make statements to the House of Representatives affirming support for constitutional recognition. I also commend the government on the establishment of a parliamentary joint select committee following the recommendation of the coalition. In December 2010 the government announced the formation of an expert panel on constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to consult throughout 2011.


I join with my coalition colleagues in thanking Professor Patrick Dodson and Mr Mark Leibler AC for their work in consulting with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to deliver a report on possible options for a constitutional change. It is essential that we work together with this expert panel to achieve this necessary change to the Constitution and to take the important step forward in recognising our first Australians. Achieving meaningful change to the Constitution has long been a commitment in this place of the Liberals and Nationals. 


It was a coalition government which was responsible for the historic 1967 referendum which removed racially discriminatory provisions from the Constitution. That referendum passed with the overwhelming support of the Australian people—more than 90 per cent of all votes cast and all states carrying it. In 1998 Prime Minister John Howard spoke in favour of a constitutional amendment that recognised the prior occupation of Australia by Indigenous peoples and their place in the Australian community as well as their right to preserve their distinctive identity. At the 2007 election the Liberals and Nationals made a commitment to hold a referendum on this matter, which took the Labor Party 2½ years to match. It is the coalition that has maintained its position on constitutional recognition and our commitment to seeing it pass. But we cannot do this alone.


Wagga Wagga based Wiradjuri elder Aunty Isabel Reid said it is time for the parliament to put politics aside and work together to achieve meaningful reform in this area, so I welcome the government's bipartisan, in-principle support of the constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I am pleased that this is now a bipartisan endeavour but there is still much work to be done. 


Given the fact that we are only months away from the federal election, little progress has been made to ensure there is necessary community consensus for this change at a referendum of the people. We just heard the member for Makin say that there have been only eight of 44 referenda passed. Thankfully, the fifth of those, on 27 May 1967, gave the Commonwealth power to make laws for Aboriginal people resident in the states and to include all Aboriginal people in the national census. But generally referenda fail, so it is absolutely crucial that when this referendum is put to the people it passes, as well as recognition in the Constitution for local government. We must make sure that when we do put it as a referendum it absolutely passes with the majority of the people.


Because of this, it is appropriate that we delay a referendum bill on this important issue until a time when there is wide, long-lasting and bipartisan support for constitutional recognition. The coalition has consistently reassured the government and the community of our strong support for the recognition of Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Islander peoples in the Constitution and we want to ensure that this happens in the right way, at a time when it has the most chance of succeeding at a referendum.

Ms SAFFIN
 (Page—Government Whip) (17:13):  I rise to speak in strong support of this bill and it pleases me that it has come before the parliament. Having served on the expert panel, and now being a member of the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Islander Peoples, I have been deeply involved in this issue for quite some time. The contribution I make tonight is a rather small one because of the continuing work that I will be involved in to advance constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.


This bill is a landmark piece of legislation. It may be that it is only for two years, and some people have asked me about that. They have said, 'Why couldn't it last permanently?' I have said that the bill is put here. It is an act of faith. It is an act of faith by this parliament to say that we will work together in a spirit of cooperation with the communities, and have full consultation across the community of Australia with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, to advance the question of constitutional recognition. It is an act of faith, but it is a landmark in what it does for recognition.


It is one of our shorter bills. There are not too many short bills that get put through this place. They are usually longer and far more complex. But it is one of the shorter bills. It is one of our most easily read. It is also one that is easily understood, and it gives expression to that recognition.


One of the other issues that I wanted to talk about was everybody involved with the expert panel, my parliamentary colleagues the honourable member for Hasluck, the honourable member for Lyne and the honourable Senator Rachel Siewert from Western Australia. The four of us worked together in a very cooperative way to ensure that we were able to have input into the expert panel with all of the other members and say, 'We're putting forward the views of representatives of the parliament and also of the major parties, minor parties and Independents.' We were able to do that. The work that came out of the expert panel is a fine piece of work, and it gave the parliament, the government and the opposition something to work with. And it also, for the first time, presented and gave us a way forward with mechanisms for that recognition in the Constitution. It fleshed out all of the legal issues and other issues around it.


In working on the joint select committee on constitutional recognition, chaired by Senator Crossin, we approached our task, our work, in exactly that same way; in the spirit of cooperation and the spirit of working together to advance constitutional recognition. We have had a hearing, we have prepared a report and we have had our meetings and that spirit has prevailed, and that is the spirit that prevailed with the expert panel. The way forward relies on us working to come up with something that is absolutely satisfactory to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. That is essential. That is fundamental. That is a first and something that the Australian people can vote yes for.


We, the expert panel, had a methodology. The methodology that we used had four planks to it. It was to contribute to a more unified and reconciled nation, to be of benefit to and to accord with the wishes of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, to be capable of being supported by an overwhelming majority of Australians from across the political and social spectrums, and to be technically and legally sound. The work the panel was able to do was across those four planks, including being technically and legally sound. We had the time to do that. I know that that sort of methodology, that approach, will be required to continue to make sure that we get to where we want to be, where I want to be and where I know a lot of people want to be at the end of this process.


As tempted as I am to crow about who did what first and who was better at it, I do not want to impart that into this debate. I do not think that is helpful. I just think that we need to put our heads down and get on with the task we have been set. It is one of the most significant tasks that members of parliament and this parliament have been set in terms of an advancement in the relationship among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and all Australians. With those words, I commend this bill to the House.

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2013-02-11,"



Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (17:19):  I firstly thank all of those who have also spoken on this important piece of legislation, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People Recognition Bill 2012, which, if passed, will commit the parliament to placing before the Australian people at a referendum a proposal for constitutional change of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.


The principal purpose of this bill is to articulate the parliament's recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the original inhabitants of Australia and also their ongoing connection with their traditional lands and waters, cultures, languages and heritage. What I would like to do is contextualise this discussion. As you know, I am here as the member for Lingiari. I was first elected in 1987. Prior to my election to the seat of Lingiari I worked as a policy adviser to the Central Land Council in Alice Springs. Prior to that I was a school teacher and prior that I was a researcher at the Australian National University on government programs and their impact on Aboriginal communities. In one way or another, either directly or indirectly, I have been working with or for Aboriginal people for at least 35 years.


Over that period many things have changed. I can recall in the eighties the Aboriginal Treaty Committee, which had as its spearheads Dr Nugget Coombs and Judith Wright. I remember the advancing discussion around the issue of a treaty and recognition in those days and the public discussion that took place around it. I recall well the period after 1976 and the introduction of the Land Rights Act in the Northern Territory. I also recall the struggle that took place in this parliament in the mid-eighties around the issue of national land rights. I recall the divisive nature of the debate. I recall the resistance from the mining sector principally; from conservative governments, including Brian Burke and the Labor government in Western Australia; and from other conservative elements within the community. I remember well the division. I remember well the demonstrations and rallies, of which I was a part, on the front steps of Old Parliament House, regaling the then Hawke Labor government about the importance of looking at a land rights model which did not jeopardise the principles of the Northern Territory Land Rights Act, which was seen as a precedent in principle for all land rights across this country recognising the inalienable right of Aboriginal people over their lands. That was not to be the prospect of the national land rights bill. Had the national land rights legislation been passed, we would have seen the erosion of rights previously given by this parliament in the Northern Territory, and that was not seen as acceptable. Ultimately, as we know, the national land rights bill never went anywhere.


Subsequently I remember the discussions that took place around the formation of ATSIC. I remember the public rally and the discussion which took place around the 1988 Barunga Statement, which hangs so proudly in this parliament. The principles of that statement could well fit this bill. It talks about recognition. It talks about justice. It talks about understanding the imperatives of Aboriginal people, in this case from the Northern Territory. We can go back even further to the sixties and the bark petitions. This year is a significant anniversary of the bark petitions, which of course were a precursor to the discussion around land rights in this place, as well as the issues that arose at around a similar time—the treatment of Aboriginal people in the pastoral industry and the people who walked off Wave Hill et cetera. There is a whole combination of elements which go together to hear the voice of Aboriginal people screaming out for the recognition of rights and the recognition of justice over many years.


I was either a very close observer or a participant in some of these things. The key element for me, though, was the way in which Aboriginal people so proudly and so justly argued their own case, and they did it with such great dignity, until finally this parliament was forced as a result of an action by a Torres Strait Islander in the High Court to once and for all get rid of the concept of terra nullius in the early 90s. We then had native title being recognised. Again, I remember the divisive nature of the debates here in this parliament, of which I was part. I remember vividly the entrenched opposition from vested interests outside this place who claimed the world was going to end. I remember the disgusting maps used by conservatives to advertise what the impact would be of native title if native title legislation was ever passed. Thank God it is now history. I remember well the eloquence of Paul Keating in his Redfern speech in 1992, and I will come to that a little later.


For me, this is a really important piece of legislation for the people I represent. Over 40 per cent of my constituents are Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory—by far the largest proportion in any seat in this parliament. I am proud to represent them in this place and—let there be no doubt—I am here because of them in so many different ways. I have seen old men and old women who argued, for nearly four decades now, the justice of what we are now accepting as a principle in this parliament.


Many of those old advocates, those people of great wisdom, have sadly passed and are no longer with us. But if they were here they would applaud the way in which this parliament has now come together around these issues. They would say, I am certain: 'This is the place we need to be to have our rights properly recognised, to see that we are getting recognition at last for who we are and for how important we are as a people, as part of the national community, as part of the national conversation and as part of our national narrative.' That, to me, is ultimately what this is about: to say to these old men and women, 'The sacrifices you have made in the past and the sacrifices which are being made now have been to some avail.' We now have in front of us this Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill. I could not have imagined this a decade ago; in fact, quite possibly not even five or six years ago. But here we are in this place, people of goodwill, coming together to support this legislation.


I thought I should refer more directly to that wonderful speech by Paul Keating. Whilst I will not read it all I do want to refer to a couple of elements of it. This is surely one of the great speeches made by any great leader in this country since federation, and certainly in terms of the cause of recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and their rights this is first among them. He said:


And, as I say, the starting point might be to recognise that the problem starts with us non-Aboriginal Australians.


It begins, I think, with the act of recognition.


How right he was and how right he remains in the context of this piece of legislation. He referred to the Mabo judgement:


By doing away with the bizarre conceit that this continent had no owners prior to the settlement of Europeans, Mabo establishes a fundamental truth and lays the basis for justice.


I agree and I think we now all agree. There is little division over this issue anymore.


He described Mabo as 'an historic decision'. Then he said: 


The message should be that there is nothing to fear or to lose in the recognition of historical truth, or the extension of social justice, or the deepening of Australian social democracy to include indigenous Australians.


There is everything to gain.


How we know that now. Ultimately, later in this parliament we joined together in the Apology, which was so finely given by the former Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd. The Apology again addressed this issue of our history and justice, the understanding of the sacrifice and the hurt of the stolen generations. Former Prime Minister Paul Keating in his speech:


Where Aboriginal Australians have been included in the life of Australia they have made remarkable contributions.


He also said in this speech: 


Ever so gradually we are learning how to see Australia through Aboriginal eyes, beginning to recognise the wisdom contained in their epic story.


This is now a fundamental truth—something which is now beyond debate in this country.


I want to conclude my contribution by reading the last 30 or 40 words from Paul Keating's speech:


I said we non-indigenous Australians should try to imagine the Aboriginal view.


It can't be too hard.


Someone imagined this event today, and it is now a marvellous reality and a great reason for hope.


There is one thing today we cannot imagine.


We cannot imagine that the descendants of people whose genius and resilience maintained a culture here through fifty thousand years or more, through cataclysmic changes to the climate and environment, and who then survived two centuries of dispossession and abuse, will be denied their place in the modern Australian nation.


We cannot imagine that.


We cannot imagine that we will fail.


And with the spirit that is here today I am confident that we won't.


I am confident that we will succeed in this decade.


We did not succeed in that decade but we will succeed in this decade. I think it is a tribute to this parliament that we have come across the aisle to support this very important piece of legislation that will, I hope, lead us to a referendum which will finally and once and for all give Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people the recognition, which is their just deserts.


Debate adjourned.

"Smith, Tony, MP",LP,2013-02-11,"



Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (18:27):  Wrongful acts in English Common Law can be subdivided into two general categories known by Latin terms: malum prohibitum and malum in se. The Oxford English Dictionary defines 'malum prohibitum' as:


Something which is not intrinsically wicked but which is regarded as wrong because it contravenes a law or regulation.


Tossing an orange peel out of your car window, for example, is littering and illegal, but we all agree it is not an act so vile as to incite a rebellion of our moral sensibilities. By contrast, 'malum in se' translates into English as 'evil in and of itself', an action so inherently depraved that no law is required to deem it or tell us it is an abomination.


This motion calls upon the House to condemn the mother of all mala in se. It calls upon this House to denounce the attack on Malala Yousafzai as a crime so incontestably heinous, so irreducibly vicious, that its perpetrators are consigned to the dark netherworld of barbarism. As we grapple with our detestation of this atrocity, we might wonder how anyone might become so warped as to commit it. We might ponder what foul fires of fanaticism could so incinerate the human soul as to mark a helpless teenage girl out for death. The answer to that question is found within a tragic truth of our time. It is found within the medieval doctrines of Talibanism that seek to bludgeon the world into the heart of a gothic darkness. Central to this totalitarian mindset is the belief that women must be kept subservient, subordinate and illiterate.


But it was an outright refusal to accept the subjugation of her gender that caused Malala to fall afoul of the Taliban. She has been a wonderful advocate for female equality, growing up in the Swat Valley, ground zero of Pakistan's jihadi insurgency. She saw firsthand the violent campaign to terrorise girls schools into closure. But Malala refused to submit to Taliban thuggery. In a televised address before the Peshawar Press Club, she issued a defiant challenge to the barbarians who sought to rob her of the future simply because of who she was. She said:


How dare the Taliban take away my basic right to education?


Her audience of hard-bitten journalists was awed by the appearance of a young girl, at that point not even in her teens, who combined courage and eloquence in equal measure. The BBC was impressed enough to offer her a column on the network's Urdu website. In January 2009, Malala penned her first piece, describing her intention to defy a Taliban edict that forbade girls from attending school. Relating how her principal advised students to refrain from coming to school in uniform or colourful clothes, she wrote:


I decided to wear my favourite pink dress.


Through that small act of rebellion, Malala placed another stone in that palisade of ideas that defends liberty from the encroachments of tyranny. Needless to say, the Taliban took extreme exception to this adolescent advocate for female freedom. These jihadi barbarians responded through the only language they understand: they placed Malala in the crosshairs of their hit list. In October last year, Taliban assassins finally caught up with Malala as she was doing what she does best—furthering her education. They waylaid her school bus as she was coming home from class and forced their way aboard at gunpoint. Malala was armed with schoolbooks and they, of course, were armed with guns. After identifying her by name, they shot her without mercy, leaving her for dead. But die she did not.


It was touch and go for a while and Malala was flown to the UK for surgery. Happily, as we all know in this place, she is well on the road to recovery. In fact, just last week Malala gave her first televised interview since being attacked last October. She described the myriad notes of benediction received from people across the world, saying:


Because of these prayers, God has given me this new life and this is a second life.


I want to serve the people and I want every girl, every child, to be educated …


A fortnight ago, Malala was nominated for the 2013 Nobel Peace Prize by three members of the Norwegian parliament. I cannot think of a more worthy recipient. I applaud this initiative by our Scandinavian colleagues, and I believe the House does well tonight by expressing its words of admiration for Malala Yousafzai. Malala's father, Zia Yousafzai, himself a school principal and advocate for female education, is also worthy of our greatest respect. We should all be humbled by the example of this young hero's bravery and integrity. I know I am, and I know that those speaking on this motion are as well.

Ms SAFFIN
 (Page—Government Whip) (18:35):  I would like to thank the honourable member for Casey for bringing this motion before the parliament so that all members, representing everyone, can speak in this House in a way that gives support to Malala Yousufzai, to this one girl, but also supports the rights of girls and women to education and to equality across the world. The honourable member for Casey just thanked the Norwegian parliamentarians for nominating Malala for the Nobel Peace Prize, and we can also do that as well as members of parliament, so that might be something that we can have a conversation about later. She would be a most worthy recipient.


It was on 9 October that Malala was shot by the Pakistani Taliban, or the Tehrik-i-Taliban—the TTP, as they are called—while climbing onto a school bus. Can you imagine sending your daughter or your child off to school on a school bus and they are shot by some very, very extreme people? Pakistani media reported that two of Malala's classmates were also injured in the shooting, and I am not sure what happened to them but it would be good to find out.


Malala grew to prominence by writing an online diary on BBC Urdu about her time in the Swat Valley during Taliban rule in the area, which was late 2007 to mid-2009. I note that her father had also been involved in education activism as well, so obviously education was something that her family was committed to. Following the Taliban's displacement from the area, Malala continued to be an activist for education and youth rights in the Swat Valley and in Pakistan. As a result of her efforts, she was one of five nominees for the International Children's Peace Prize in 2011 and she also won the inaugural Pakistan National Peace Award in December 2011. After she was shot, she was medically evacuated to the United Kingdom for specialist treatment in Birmingham and her prognosis looked very grave indeed. I think that everybody has been heartened by and is so pleased to see her remarkable recovery.


On 2 February this year Malala successfully underwent major surgery,  including a cranial reconstruction aimed at mending parts of her skull with a titanium plate as well as the placement of a cochlear implant designed to restore hearing on her left side. Her injuries were horrific. She will continue her rehabilitation at the family's new temporary home in Birmingham. I understand that her father is now working there and working in their consulate, and they have relocated there. He is education attache at the Pakistan consulate in Birmingham for a period of three years. That means that all of the family are together and they are able to look after each other. 


The Pakistan Taliban, or the TTP, have claimed responsibility for the attack, with the spokesperson, Ehsanullah Ehsan, saying that Malala was pro-West, she was speaking against the Taliban and she was calling President Obama her idol. She was young, but she was promoting Western culture in Pashtun areas. Ehsan went on to say that the attack served as a warning to all youngsters involved in similar activities, and noted that Malala would be targeted again if she survived. The Pakistan Taliban have vowed to target her again. I did notice, in reading some of the commentary on the internet, that it seemed as though they had started to change what they were saying, but the fact is that they took responsibility—they did it. It is just unbelievable.


In a speech to mark the inaugural International Day of the Girl Child on Wednesday, 10 October last year, Prime Minister Julia Gillard expressed her shock at the attack and her admiration for Malala's activism and commitment to girls' rights in education. As I have said, we all expressed our shock. I have never seen anything draw such widespread condemnation so quickly and right across the globe. President Zardari has been reported in Pakistan media as saying that such attacks would not shape the resolve of Pakistan and that the nation would continue to fight against the militants, and that was welcome too. Also, the Interior Minister, Rehman Malik, has vowed to bring to justice the Taliban attackers behind Malala's shooting, saying, 'No matter where the terrorists may escape, we will bring them to justice.' But, despite reports of several arrests being made in connection with the attack, there is no evidence yet of those who actually committed the attack being brought to justice, and I know that is something that people will be watching quite closely.


Among the comments that were made worldwide was a statement by the White House on behalf of the President. There were also comments by the EU and the UK—already quoted here. The UN Secretary-General's United Nations Special Envoy for Global Education, former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, called for a global day of action on 10 November 2012 to support the goal of education for all children, and that became known as Malala Day. That was commemorated in over 100 countries. That was a way that all of us in the international community could join hands and give an expression of support for her and support for the right of girls, particularly, to have access to education freely and in a framework of not being seen as somehow deviant. For God's sake, it is unbelievable to think that someone would get shot for it in this day and age.


Malala has been the recipient of several international awards and accolades since the attack, including the Simone de Beauvoir Prize for Women's Freedom and the Rome Prize for Peace and Humanitarian Action. Malala's plight is now regularly evoked in major international meetings, such as the recent World Economic Forum in Davos and meetings of the United Nations and specialised agencies. Indeed, at the moment we are talking in this place about Malala and what happened to her.


I will speak a little on how our government responded at the time. They obviously responded strongly and were appalled at what I call an attempted assassination of child activist Malala in western Pakistan. The government said at the time that they commended the Pakistan government for the financial support and assistance that they provided. I am sure that when she was taken to the UK they would have done everything they possibly could to provide care—and I am sure that they are doing that—and it was good to see that that happened immediately.


The right to an education is something that we take for granted here, so it is something on which we can all join together and say, 'That has to be the right worldwide.' Indeed, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights enshrines the right to education. We have to make sure that we can support that, as we do here, everywhere else.


I conclude by saying that Australia has long supported these rights and has provided education assistance for female students in some of Pakistan's most remote and marginalised communities. One of the important things that we can do with our ODA is to make sure that we spend it in a way that is going to provide those girls who are students with educational support. I would just like to say to Malala: good on her for what she has done for girls and for education. We wish her a speedy and wonderful recovery.

Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (18:45):  I rise today to speak in support of this excellent motion proposed by my good friend and colleague the member for Casey. I join with my colleagues opposite in universal acclamation for the commitment that we are expressing in this House today to girls' education and the tribute to Malala Yousafzai.


On 9 October 2012, in the Swat Valley in Pakistan, three cowardly Taliban terrorists boarded Malala's school bus, sought her out by name and deliberately shot her point blank in the head and in the neck in an attempt to kill her and silence her forever. Happily for the world, they were not successful. Their violent act of misogyny left Malala in a critical condition, unresponsive for three days as doctors fought to save her life. In less than five weeks, Malala went from an intensive care unit in Pakistan, showing no signs of consciousness, to walking, writing and reading again in a hospital in Birmingham, Britain. Only in the last weeks has she been discharged from hospital. As an advocate for girls' education in her native Swat Valley, Malala's life had been at risk from the Taliban for a number of years for simply wanting to have an education like her brothers. Her father said of her that she:


… got influenced by what was going on and gradually she joined me in our struggle against extremism.


She was then 11 years of age.


The Taliban has had a long history of trying to prevent girls from attending schools through violence, even going to the extent of physically destroying schools, with some estimating that the Taliban destroyed over 150 schools in Pakistan in 2008 alone. As they sought to impose their austere interpretation of sharia law, the Pakistani Taliban threatened girls, their families and their teachers, despite the fact that at the time there was a pledge by the Pakistani government to safeguard girls' education and their schools from such extremists. The Taliban's efforts to disrupt and prevent girls' education continue to this day. Amazingly, given the violent threats they have been faced with, there are brave girls throughout Pakistan willing to risk their welfare so that they can attend school and improve their chances in life for themselves and for their families.


In 2009, Malala began blogging for the BBC's online Urdu news service under a pseudonym, describing the Taliban's repression of girls' education. Malala wrote, 'I was afraid going to school because the Taliban had issued an edict banning all girls from attending schools,' before describing how a number of her friends had moved out of the Swat Valley to Peshawar, Lahore and Rawalpindi to be able to continue their education in a safer environment. For those that stayed, the very real and present Taliban threats of reprisals on families meant that many did not send their daughters to school. In late 2009, Malala took up a position as chair of the District Child Assembly of Swat, leading discussions between young people as to what they wanted their future in the Swat Valley to look like. Over the next few years, Malala continued to agitate for girls' education in her blogs, on television and radio and in social media. When in October 2011 she was nominated by Desmond Tutu for the International Children's Peace Prize, and in December of 2011 she received Pakistan's National Youth Peace Prize, the risk to Malala and her family was brought into the open, with death threats published in newspapers and slipped under the family's door. Yet, despite this, Malala continued to campaign for girls' education, describing it as 'our basic right'.


I commend those in Pakistan and throughout the world who have joined with her. The newly formed Malala Fund will help girls just like Malala. One of the instigators of this fund, Alyse Nelson, said:


We stand with Malala and girls around the globe who are boldly speaking out as advocates for education and equality. When girls move forward, they take their communities forward too.


This is so true. Malala has said when speaking of her recovery:


… because of these prayers God has given me this new life … and this is a second life. And I want to serve. I want to serve the people. I want every girl, every child, to be educated.


Malala Yousafzai is a brave young woman, a true feminist, a warrior against the evils of real misogyny. She is an inspiration to me and an example to us all. On 8 March, which is International Women's Day, we must focus on the issues facing women right around the world. This is one of the critical issues facing our sisters throughout the world: to have an education, to have a right to education and to have that education in a safe environment. Malala, you are a true inspiration.

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (18:50):  It is a great pleasure and honour to speak on this motion tonight and I commend and congratulate the member for Casey for bringing it forward. Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani schoolgirl the Taliban tried to assassinate, is thankfully recovering albeit slowly and is in relatively good health.


On 9 October 2012 when this young activist living in the Swat district of Pakistan was attacked by the Pakistani Taliban on her way to school, Malala grabbed worldwide attention when she began to tell her story online, a story of the Taliban's repressive regime. In the period following the dislodgement of the Taliban, Malala persisted in informing the world about the situation and in particular the difficulties confronting young girls striving for an education.


Malala was one of five nominees for the International Children's Peace Prize in 2011 and she was awarded the inaugural Pakistan National Peace Award in December 2011. After the attack on her bus, Malala was evacuated to Birmingham where she underwent major surgery. After being discharged, Malala is reported as saying that she will be an advocate for the right for 'every girl, every child, to be educated'. Malala is an inspiration to us all because she has taken a very brave and public stance against repression by the Taliban of women and the rights of women to be educated. 


When the mujahideen and later the Taliban took control of regions of Afghanistan in the 1980s and early 1990s, they set about burning thousands of schools. The Taliban and their allies murdered thousands of teachers. They destroyed the education system and created a fear of learning in the areas they controlled. From the mid-1990s the Taliban began a campaign of violent repression aimed at preventing school-age girls and boys from obtaining an education. 


In some quarters it is fashionable to oppose the work that we are doing in Afghanistan. Yet over the past decade there has been a recognised increase in children attending schools and getting a much-valued education. There are media reports highlighting how parents in Afghanistan and Pakistan are desperately trying to get their children into education. Parents in these countries quite understandably want their children to be taught to read and write and learn science and maths so that they can get good jobs and support their families. I read one account from an Afghani woman who said of the Taliban:


We supported them for 10 years … And what have we got in return? They're not letting us send our children to school or to the provincial hospital. I guess their next idea will be to bury our daughters alive to make sure they never go to school, work in an office, or walk around without a veil.


It is not just Afghanistan where the Taliban's repression is suppressing young people seeking an education. According to data from UNICEF, only about one-third Pakistani children aged between five and nine are enrolled in primary education and UNICEF reports that two-thirds of girls and almost half of the boys in Pakistan do not complete primary school. 


In Pakistan there exists a thriving market for private education because there are parts of that country where it is almost impossible for young girls and boys to attend school. Both the Pakistani government and opposition leaders widely condemn the attack on Malala and they have vowed to continue to fight against extremism. Yet it has taken the bravery of Malala to bring to the fore the situation that exists in her country and also in Afghanistan. The Taliban's education policy is pretty straightforward: they oppose reading, they oppose books, they oppose kites, they oppose public education and, most of all, they oppose girls being educated. 


The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan is improving—and I saw it firsthand on my visit to Afghanistan two years ago—but it is only happening in certain areas. The Australian government has provided education assistance for female students in some of Pakistan's most remote and marginalised communities. In Afghanistan, I understand that a million girls are now going to school, which is an extraordinary and dramatic achievement in such a short period of time. When I was there I enjoyed seeing these girls skipping along in their uniforms with their little friends, heading off to school or coming home from school at the end of the day, having had a wonderful experience of learning and being educated and working to build their nation. 


Prime Minister Gillard has stated on the record our resolve to continue supporting Malala's work and to pursue measures so that young girls like Malala can be free to go to school to learn and to have the opportunity to be educated in a safe environment. I wish Malala a full and speedy recovery and I wish her and her family a safe, happy and educated life.

Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (18:55):  I rise to support the motion moved by my colleague the member for Casey and I congratulate him for putting forward such an important motion on such a powerful issue. The story of Malala Yousafzai is an inspiring one. It is the story of a young woman wise beyond her years and possessing a grasp of the way things in her homeland should be, not just how they are. It is the story of a young woman's steady determination to stand up and make a difference, to stand up for what is right and to stare down evil. At just 11 years of age, Malala was reported to have said in a speech to local journalists: 'How dare the Taliban take away my right to basic education?' This was after a Taliban edict banning education for girls as they sought to impose their austere interpretation of sharia law and as they went about destroying over 150 schools in the region.


Malala caught the Taliban's attention in 2009 when she began writing a blog for the BBC about her life growing up in Pakistan's Swat Valley. That led the New York Times to release a documentary about Malala and she became a sought-after international spokesperson for her struggles against the Taliban's sadistic mediaeval rule. Despite threats from the Taliban, Malala rarely showed fear and she did not hide her face. She said in an interview in 2011: 'I have the right to an education, I have the right to play, I have the right to sing, I have the right to talk, I have the right to go to a market and I have the right to speak up.' A reporter then asked her, 'Why do you risk your life to raise your voice?' And she answered: 'I shall raise my voice. If I didn't do it, who would?'


The Taliban reacted in the way they often do when faced with the forces of freedom of speech. They sent their assassins to murder the 15-year-old girl. On 9 October last year two Taliban gunmen walked onto her school bus, asked for her by name and, from point-blank range, fired two bullets into her head and neck. But they were not able to kill her. And, as often happens with acts of evil, it had the exact opposite effect: they turned her into an even bigger international heroine. They created worldwide publicity for her cause and they captured global attention for the struggle for women's rights in Pakistan. In their failure they sent a timely reminder to the world of the sick and perverted thinking and barbaric evil ways of Taliban extremists. They are little more than cowardly savages.


Several weeks after Malala was struck in the head and neck by the bullets she was airlifted to the UK where, after months of surgery, just a few days ago the 15-year-old walked down the hall of the British hospital under her own power and gave a videotaped interview. Despite being the victim of such a horrific attack, this passionate young woman has not altered her views. She said after recovering, 'I want every girl, every child, to be educated,' in direct defiance of the criminals that have vowed to kill her.


Young Malala's story is remarkable in so many ways. She has rallied the world in a fight to educate young girls, but her greatest gift has been to demonstrate to the world, including the Pakistani people, that it is possible to stand up to the Taliban. Her courage is infectious. But perhaps her greatest gift is to remind the world that our freedoms must be fought for and protected and that we should not cower in the darkness when faced with evil. She reminds us, as that old quotation goes, that all that is necessary for evil to flourish is for good men to do nothing. And, as her case shows, those 'good men' even include 15-year-old schoolgirls. She is a hero in every sense of the word. There could not be a more worthy nominee for the Nobel Peace Prize.

Ms VAMVAKINOU
 (Calwell) (19:00):  Last October, a 15-year-old schoolgirl in Pakistan, Malala Yousafzai, was singled out and shot in the head on board a school bus by a member of the Taliban. She miraculously survived after life-saving surgery and was recently discharged from a UK hospital. I want to wish Malala well, as I am sure all colleagues in this chamber do. The Taliban stated that they shot Malala, who is a campaigner for girls' education, for promoting secularism. These hardliners consider the education of females to be an abomination rather than a human right, and not surprisingly this shooting sparked domestic and international outrage. On 1 February Malala gave her first public interview since her recovery. In a courageous display of vision this teenage girl made a vow to continue to serve her people and fight for the right of every girl and child in her home region of the Swat Valley to be educated. Malala has come to represent one of the many females who are the contemporary face of activism in the Muslim world. They speak up for justice where girls and women face a continuing tirade of misogyny embedded in the cultural mores of their communities


One of these women is Miss Tasneem Chopra, Chairperson of the Australian Muslim Women's Centre for Human Rights. I would like to quote Tasneem:


It is no coincidence that Malala was targeted in this attack. Evidence shows that Muslim women and girls who stand at the front line of activism frequently find themselves at the front line of attacks, often facing dire circumstances. Radicals do not target women activists by accident. This is a deliberate strategy to undermine their pathways to sovereignty through education and equality. 


Miss Chopra explained that the Taliban in their extraordinary feudal interpretation of Islam enact brutal acts of misogyny. The attempted murder of Malala is by no means an isolated event. Young girls wanting to go to school in areas like Pakistan's Swat valley and neighbouring Afghanistan have come to typify a growing resistance against the Taliban, which seeks to subjugate them completely. In recent years in Afghanistan, they have carried out multiple atrocities aimed at schoolgirls, some of which include the November 2008 attack on 16 schoolgirls with acid while they were walking to school, a poisonous gas attack on a girls school in May 2009, and in August 2010 seven Kabul schoolgirls were hospitalised after another poisonous gas attack on their classroom. In April 2012, 150 Afghan school girls were hospitalised after drinking poisoned water in their school. 


These are despicable acts of evil. But, unfortunately, they are done often in the name of Islam, so it is crucial to highlight that the Islamic faith strongly encourages the education of Muslim males and females. In fact, countries such as Indonesia and Egypt, for example, boast amongst the highest rates of Muslim female literacy and tertiary qualifications in the world. It is the Taliban's selective view of Islam that favours a patriarchal interpretation. Theirs is premised on a belief that in order to control society they must control their women. Because of these tactics, the Taliban ensure that, if you are a female, Afghanistan is recognised as one of the most dangerous countries on earth. 


In our quest to right these wrongs that are committed against women and children in the region, we must be very mindful and note that as long as men continue to define what makes a women's role in society acceptable the parameters of her life chances will never be her choice. That is why strides must be made for women's sovereignty both at home and abroad, and they must continue to be a matter of global significance. From the rights of the girl child to eliminating violence against women, we all have a stake in the protection of females in order that we progress into healthier societies. It will always be women who remain best placed to articulate their lives, their lived realities, to speak of their disadvantage, their burden, their glass ceiling and how these injuries must end. So I want to join with all my colleagues and recognise that this Thursday, 14 February, marks the celebration of a global movement known as One Billion Rising, an international movement where for one day women, men and children stand together in solidarity to end abuse against women. This is an event that was put together by One Billion Rising founder Eve Ensler, who has said that the reality is that one in three women on the planet will be raped or beaten in her lifetime, and that is one billion violated, and that is an atrocity.


Debate adjourned.

"Neville, Paul, MP",Nats,2013-02-11,"



Mr NEVILLE
 (Hinkler—The Nationals Deputy Whip) (20:48):  It gives me great pleasure to speak in the grievance debate. There are two matters I wish to grieve about. My electorate of Hinkler and, to a lesser extent, the seats of Flynn, Wide Bay and Capricornia were the focus of the Australia Day tornadoes, followed by the floods that ensued as Cyclone Oswald turned into a rain depression. That rain depression was quite hard to predict. It moved inland into the headwaters of many of many of our rivers and caused a flood circumstance of a magnitude we have not seen before. Just to give the Federation Chamber some scale, in 1890 we had 9.05 metres, in 1942 we had 8.5 and in 2011 we had 7.9. But this time we went up to 5.4 metres—in other words, 1.6 metres over the last flood circumstance and half a metre from the all-time high. It was uncharted territory. 


What I want to grieve about is this: we saw in the last floods in 2011, especially at Grantham, the first murmurings of 'We have to do something different.' We do this in parts of Australia endlessly over and over again. We race to the aid of our fellow Australians, as well we should. We go through the torture of evacuating people, of cleaning out houses, of mourning the dead and of rebuilding, but we do not do a heck of a lot about reconstruction and relocation. We should. You really have to ask yourself when you go back over nearly 100 years of well-documented floods, what are we really doing to stop this happening? There are always plenty of us around, including our ministers and shadow ministers, and again it is appropriate that they should be there and they should support people. We certainly go through the traumas of the flood, the evacuation centres, the people who work endless hours in emergency services, the people who shift rubbish, the mud armies—all this kind of thing. They are all appropriate and I am not in any way detracting from them one iota. But you really have to ask yourself, after every one of these floods what is the way up between what we spent and what we achieved the next time? 


I think we should have a commission of inquiry into that and that we should have some sort of restoration commission and that both sides of politics perhaps should come together and have a bipartisan horizon of 10 years in which we take a totally new look at this thing. I do not know what the right figure is and that is what the commission could find out, but it could be perhaps $200 million a year for 10 years, $2 billion over 10 years, to start a whole series of things. One is to put certain houses on high stumps, the old Queenslander, quite common in Queensland and northern New South Wales. Providing the house is sound and aesthetically pleasing, why wouldn't you? If you do get a flood and it washes through the bottom, it is not the end of the world. Another is that all councils have land banks of one sort or another. Why not develop some of those, create a new suburb and start moving houses. Again, the house has got to have aesthetic and construction integrity. We are not suggesting that you put all the run-down houses in all the run-down suburbs that get wet and put them all into one estate to create some sort of slum. I am not suggesting that for a minute. But where they are aesthetically pleasing and can be restored you put them there. You would have an incentive program for people to move to those places. Finally, with the ones that are just not worth moving but need to be knocked down, you have some program with a public housing component to it where a person could get a nice three-bedroom cottage on condition they moved to this new site. If we did this over a 10-year period, we would not solve all of them and some people would be slow to move and there would be lots of problems, but we will not solve it by standing back and pretending it is not happening. It is happening and if we are moving into a period of more extreme weather conditions—I am not going into the pros and cons of climate change, I am talking broadly—we are going into a period of more violent weather conditions then perhaps we should be looking at it fairly soon.


The other thing I want to grieve about is insurance. I am just not convinced that we are getting a good deal from our insurance companies. I am going to be radical tonight—it is not like me, a member of the coalition and a member of the National Party, to say this—because I think we have come to a point where we should reconsider the State Government Insurance Offices. You might say 'shock, horror, it has all got to be done by free enterprise'. Well, yes and no. With communications, if we cannot get telecommunications providers to go to a certain area, the provider of last resort is Telstra. We accept that; all Australians accept that. I think that if we had an SGIO in each state that took responsibility for a certain area of insurance—and we have very good SGIOs in Queensland and New South Wales, and I am sure in other states, and I am told the SGIO in the Northern Territory which is still in practice is effective—that would provide us with an insurer of last resort. I am not suggesting for a minute that this insurer would take unreasonable risks. 


Equally, we would not have situations like the case of one of our members here in this parliament—who shall remain nameless but is from a western Queensland town—whose insurance was $1,500 a year and after the recent floods it was put up to $10,000 a year. He objected to that and had it changed but the point was that he lived at one end of the street which was up high and the flood area was down low, yet the insurance company just said that he was in such-and-such a street and would have to pay the higher premium. It did not accord with what the real flood risk was. As if that is not bad enough, there are people in high-rises that are paying incredible figures now. People who are buying units for their retirement just cannot afford to live in them. Something is radically wrong. 



At other times, insurance companies work on the basis of postcodes—postcodes! For God's sake, in any town there are hills, there are valleys and there are low-lying areas, and there are some places that have not experienced a flood since Australia was settled. And, yet, that postcode cops this insurance rates premium. This has happened to me personally. I am nowhere near a flood area in Bundaberg, and yet my premium was—until I objected very strongly—to go up radically. I think we have got to get to a new point. All councils today have contour lines on the maps. In fact, most councils now can deliver that information for every house in a town or suburb. It is not beyond the capacity of insurance companies to come to terms with that, and to set their premiums on what the basis of insurance used to be—controlling risk. It is a matter of assessing risk, looking over a broad horizon of so many years, looking at what it might cost in a bad eventuality and taking into account other things, and then setting the premium. We have to get back to that. (Time expired)
