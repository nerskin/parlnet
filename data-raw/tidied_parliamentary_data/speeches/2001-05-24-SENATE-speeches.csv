CANBERRA   ACT   2600
Dear Minister
I refer to the Export Inspection and Meat Charges Collection Amendment Regulations 2000 (No. 1), Statutory Rules 2000 No. 342, that provide that the Secretary has a discretion, in specified circumstances, to refund some or all of the amount of a charge.
Item 3 of the Amendments gives the Secretary a discretionary power to remit or refund charges if the total number of animals slaughtered in a year, or if the quantity of meat or meat products presented for export inspection, “is significantly less” than in the financial year before the charge period. The Committee seeks clarification regarding the manner in which this criterion is determined and applied.
The Committee would appreciate your advice as soon as possible but before 16 March 2001 to enable it to finalise its consideration of these regulations. Correspondence should be directed to the Chair, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG 49, Parliament House, Canberra.

Dear Senator Coonan
Thank you for your letter of 8 February 2001 regarding the Export Inspection and Meat Charges Collection Amendment Regulations 2000 (No. 1), Statutory Rules 2000 No 342.
In your letter you sought clarification about Item 3 of those regulations that gives the Secretary a discretionary power to remit or refund charges if the total number of animals slaughtered in a year, or if the quantity of meat or meat products presented for export inspection, is significantly less than in the financial year before the charge period.
The Export Inspection and Meat Charges Collection Regulations 1985, made under the Export Inspection and Meat Charges Collection Act 1985 (the Act) make provision for the collection of charges imposed by a number of Acts, including the Export Inspection (Establishment Registration Charges) Act 1985 and subordinate to that Act, the Export Inspection and Meat (Establishment Registration Charges) Regulations 1985.
The Export Inspection and Meat (Establishment Registration Charges) Regulations 1985, prescribe among other things, the registration charges payable by establishments that slaughter animals or process meat for export. Under the regulations, the rate of charge payable by an establishment for a financial year is determined by the throughput levels of the previous financial year. Registration charges are payable on a quarterly basis.
Item 3 of the Export Inspection and Meat Charges Collection Amendment Regulations provides the Secretary with a discretionary power to refund or remit some or all of the amount of a charge when circumstances change, that result in a reduction in throughput levels. As an example an abattoir may reduce its level of production in a year by reducing the number of shifts it operates in a day, in response to a drop in demand for its product. As a consequence, throughput for that year is significantly less than the previous financial year. The amendment allows the Secretary under such circumstances to remit some of the charge that would normally be payable for the current year, or to refund part of any charge already paid for the current year.
To ensure a uniform application of this discretionary power, a criterion has been developed with peak meat industry bodies to clarify the circumstances under which the discretion will be applied. This criterion is currently being considered by members of the peak bodies. A copy is attached for your information.
I trust this meets the needs of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances.
Yours sincerely
Warren Truss
Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry
Encl. Attachment 1: Draft - AQIS/Industry Agreed Policy for Review of Registration Category
DRAFT
AQIS/INDUSTRY AGREED POLICY FOR REVIEW
OF REGISTRATION CATEGORY
The Export Inspection (Establishment Registration Charges) Regulations are in the process of being amended to enable the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry - Australia (or delegate) to review and change the registration charging category of an export meat establishment in special circumstances.
AQIS and Peak Industry Bodies have agreed that the following policy is to be applied by the Secretary in any such review process:
1.	The registration fee will generally be determined on the basis of the previous year's throughput. No allowance will be made for plants closed during the previous year for periods less than 3 months unless there has been some significant structural change to the plant (eg. commissioning or decommissioning new slaughter chains).
2.	The registration charging category will reflect the establishment's likely operations for the annual charging period. Where the situation has changed, the registered occupier can apply to the Secretary for consideration of a lower rate based on the projected scale of operations for the period of registration.
3.	Where the Secretary agrees to a lesser rate, he may impose conditions on that. Should the circumstances subsequently change in that charging period, the Secretary will have the right to review the establishment's charging category. The occupier will have to agree that if throughput exceeds the previously estimated levels, resulting the plant going into the next registration category for 3 consecutive months, then the full rate will apply, backdated 3 months.
4.	If a charge for a closed establishment has been reduced to the lowest category, the Secretary will review the category on the plant's reopening and amend the charge to reflect expected production levels. If the production levels increase above estimated production levels and result in the plant going into the next category, the higher rate will be applied, backdated 3 months.
5.	For future charging periods the establishment will revert to the normal system for determining the charging category, ie tonnes of product slaughtered for export in the previous financial year.

Instrument fixing charges to be paid to APRA, made under paragraph 51(1)(a) of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998

Senator the Hon Rod Kemp
Assistant Treasurer
Parliament House
CANBERRA   ACT   2600
Dear Minister
I refer to the Instrument Fixing Charges to be Paid to APRA made under paragraph 51(1)(a) of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998, that specifies the charge to be paid to APRA by persons participating in a conference to be held by APRA in April 2001.
The Committee notes that the instrument is made under paragraph 51(1)(a) of the enabling Act, which states that APRA may, by written instrument, fix charges to be paid to APRA by a person in respect of services and facilities APRA provides the person. While it can be argued that a conference can be categorised as a `service or facility', the Committee seeks your advice on whether the intention behind paragraph 51(1)(a) is that it should apply to a conference registration fee.
The Committee would appreciate your advice as soon as possible but before 28 March 2001 to enable it to finalise its consideration of this instrument. Correspondence should be directed to the Chair, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG 49, Parliament House, Canberra.

CANBERRA ACT 2600
Dear Senator Coonan
I refer to your letter dated 1 March 2001 to the Assistant Treasurer in relation to the Instrument Fixing Charges to be paid to APRA made under paragraph 51(1)(a) of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998 which he has referred to me as the Minister responsible. The instrument fixed an amount to be paid to APRA by persons participating in a conference on the general insurance industry, to be held by APRA in April 2001.
Specifically, your Committee has sought advice on whether the intention behind paragraph 51(1)(a) is that it should apply to a conference registration fee.
Description of the conference
The conference for which the attendance fee is proposed is called “The New General Insurance Regime” and is to be held on 1 May 2001. It will form part of APRA's consultation process with the industry on general insurance reform. APRA will issue proposed amendments of the Insurance Act 1973 and revised drafts of the new Prudential Standards and Guidance Notes ahead of the conference, and they will form the basis of the day's discussions. Speakers will include key APRA representatives, senior members of the general insurance industry and I am also scheduled to speak.
The attendees will principally comprise members of the general insurance industry and service providers to the industry such as actuaries and lawyers. Of course, attendance at the conference is voluntary.
The conference venue is the Sydney Convention Centre. Lunch and written material will be provided to attendees.
APRA has calculated the amount of the fee, $195 per attendee, on a strict cost-recovery basis. APRA has had to hire the venue, hire a caterer to provide lunch and morning and afternoon refreshments, and engage a consultant to coordinate the conference.
Organising the conference falls within the scope of APRA's functions and powers
Section 9 of the APRA Act specifies APRA's functions. It provides, so far as here relevant:
“9	APRA has the following functions: 
(a) the functions conferred on it by or under this Act or any other laws of the Commonwealth;
(b) ...
(c) ...”
Section 11 of the Act specifies APRA's powers. It provides, so far as here relevant:
“11(1)	APRA has powers to do anything that is necessary or convenient to be done for or in connection with its functions.
(2)	APRA's powers include, but are not limited to, the following powers:
...
(e)	the power to do anything incidental to any of its functions.”
The Insurance Act confers on APRA numerous functions and powers relating to the regulation of the general insurance industry. Informing and consulting the industry about proposed changes to the Insurance Act and to the system of regulation applying to that industry are activities that are clearly incidental to the regulatory functions conferred on APRA by the Insurance Act - indeed, regular consultation is an indispensable pre-requisite to effective regulation.
Accordingly, organising the conference falls within the scope of APRA's statutory functions and powers.
Need for a section 51 instrument
Subsection 51(1) of the APRA Act provides, so far as here relevant:
“51(1)	APRA may, by written instrument, fix charges to be paid to APRA by a person in respect of:
(a)	services and facilities APRA provides the person; or
(b)	...”
Subsection 51(2) requires the charges to be calculated on a cost-recovery basis. It provides:
“51(2)	A charge fixed under subsection (1) must be reasonably related to the costs and expenses incurred or to be incurred by APRA in relation to the matters to which the charge relates and must not be such as to amount to taxation.”
“Charges” has a wide meaning and, in APRA's view, it encompasses the attendance fees that APRA proposes to charge.
The “services and facilities” referred to in paragraph 51(1)(a), for which APRA is authorised to set charges, include any services or facilities provided by APRA in the course of performing its regulatory functions.
The conference is clearly a “service” provided to the regulated community, and the provision of the venue would also seem to be a “facility” that is provided to that community as part of the “service”. Since organising and delivering the conference is part of the performance of APRA's statutory functions, and the provision of the conference constitutes the provision of “service” or “facility”, APRA is authorised to set charges for the conference, on a cost-recovery basis, under section 51 of the Act, and made an instrument accordingly. While it could be argued that it is not necessary to make an instrument to cover a relatively minor charge of this nature, APRA nevertheless decided that it would be prudent to do so.
I trust that this alleviates your concerns in relation to the instrument.
Yours sincerely
Joe Hockey MP
Minister for Financial Services & Regulation

Parliament House
CANBERRA   ACT   2600
Dear Minister
I refer to the National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Regulations 2000 (No. 1), Statutory Rules 2000 No. 369, that prescribe the bodies that may nominate persons for selection for appointment as members of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee.
New subsection 38A(2) of the Regulations states that “For paragraph 100B (1A) (b) of the Act, the following professional associations of economists are prescribed:”. 
However, paragraph 100B(1A)(b) of the National Health Act 1953 requires that a person must be appointed from nominations made by “professional associations of health economists”. The Committee seeks advice on why the new subsection appears to provide for representation beyond the scope of the enabling Act.
Also, the Committee notes that paragraph 38A(2)(b) then prescribes the Economic Society of Australia Inc. as a body that may nominate persons for the purposes of paragraph 100B(1A)(b) of the National Health Act 1953. As that paragraph of the Act requires that a person must be appointed from nominations made by “professional associations of health economists”, the Committee seeks advice on whether the Economic Society of Australia Inc. is a professional association of health economists. 
The Committee would appreciate your advice as soon as possible but before 16 March 2001 to enable it to finalise its consideration of these regulations. Correspondence should be directed to the Chair, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG 49, Parliament House, Canberra.

Dear Senator Coonan
Thank you for your letter of 8 February 2001 concerning the National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Regulations 2000 (No. 1) (Statutory Rules No. 369 of 2000).
In your letter you draw my attention to the fact that the amending regulations go beyond the scope of the enabling provision in the National Health Act 1953 (the Act), in that paragraph 100B(lA)(b) of the Act requires that a person must be appointed from nominations made by professional associations of health economists whereas subregulation 38A(2) of the Regulations states that certain associations of economists are prescribed.
I wish to advise the Committee that this was an inadvertent error made in the drafting of the amending regulations. An appropriate amendment to subregulation 38A(2) will be included amongst a number of other amendments to the National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Regulations 1960 that will shortly be submitted to the Executive Council.
You also note that paragraph 38A(2)(b) of the Regulations prescribes the Economics Society of Australia Inc. as a body that may nominate persons for the purposes of paragraph 100B(1A)(b) of the Act, and seek advice as to whether or not that Society is a professional association of health economists. In this regard, I would advise that the Economics Society of Australia Inc. is a professional body of economists of various disciplines, one of which is health economics. The persons who were nominated by that Society are health economists.
I trust this information is satisfactory to the Committee.

Dear Minister
Thank you for your letter dated 16 March 2001 responding to the Committee's concerns with the National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Regulations 2000 (No.1), Statutory Rules 2000 No.369.
The Committee appreciates your advice that the Regulations will be amended to provide for persons to be appointed from nominations made by professional associations of health economists.
The Committee notes that s.100B(1A)(b) of the Act specifies that persons must be nominated from `professional associations of health economists'. The Committee further notes your advice that the Economics Society is a professional association of economists that includes health economists. The Committee would therefore appreciate your advice on whether the charter or the constitution of the Society expressly recognises health economists as part of its membership.
The Committee also seeks clarification on whether the requirement in the Act means `professional associations of economists that includes (expressly or otherwise) health economists' or `professional associations that are restricted in membership to health economists.
The Committee appreciates that it may be difficult to respond promptly to its further concerns before 2 April 2001 which is the last sitting day on which a notice of motion to disallow may be given. If this is the case, the Committee proposes to proceed with a notice of motion to disallow in order to preserve its options while it awaits your response on the above matters.

Thank you for your further letter of 29 March 2001 concerning the National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Regulations 2000 (No. 1) (Statutory Rules No. 369 of 2000).
I appreciate the Standing Committee's concern that paragraph 38A(2)(b) of the National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Regulations 1960 prescribes the Economics Society of Australia Inc. as a body that may nominate persons for the purposes of paragraph 100B(lA)(b) of the National Health Act 1953 (the Act), and whether or not that Society is a professional association of health economists. In this regard, I have previously advised that the Economics Society of Australia Inc. is a professional body of economists of various disciplines, one of which is health economics. The persons who were nominated by that Society are health economists.
You ask whether the Society expressly recognises health economists as part of its membership. The constitution of the Society does not recognise any economic specialisation, including health economics. It is a broad based organisation and its membership includes economists who work across the public, private and universities sectors.
The intention of the Act is to allow for the appointment of a health economist from a professional association that includes health economists. It was never intended that other than an economist with expertise in health financing should be appointed to the health economist position on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee.
I trust this information is satisfactory to the Committee.

Senator the Hon Robert Hill
Minister for Environment and Heritage
Parliament House
CANBERRA   ACT   2600
Dear Minister
I refer to the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Regulations 2001, Statutory Rules 2001 No. 2. The Committee seeks your advice on four aspects of these regulations. 
Regulation 3 defines the terms `native forest' and `plantation' in terms of definitions found in the Native Forest Policy Statement. The National Library advises that it has no holdings of the Policy Statement. Further, the Regulations states that the ISBN of that Policy Statement is 0 644 46430 5. The Committee, however, has been advised that the correct number for this Statement is 0 642 18239 6. The Committee seeks your advice as to whether it would be more appropriate to include the meanings given to these terms in Regulation 3, rather than having a definition by cross-reference.
Regulation 14 sets out the general formula for determining the amount of electricity generated by an accredited power station. The Committee seeks clarification on the construction and application of this formula.
Regulation 28 specifies a number of fees for registration and other matters. The Explanatory Statement does not explain the basis on which these fees have been determined. The Committee would appreciate your advice on the basis for these fees.
Item 1 of Schedule 2 to the Regulations deals with revocation of accreditation. The heading to the Item refers to paragraph 4(2)(b) of the Regulations. Firstly, that paragraph states that Schedule 2 sets out guidelines for eligibility and revocation of eligibility for accreditation. The Committee notes that Schedule 2 does not expressly provide guidelines for eligibility for accreditation. Secondly, paragraph 4(2)(b) is expressed to be made for the purposes of subsection 14(4) of the Act. However, there does not appear to be any reference in that subsection, or in any part of section 14, to the revocation of accreditation. The Committee would therefore appreciate your advice on the legislative basis for the provisions in Schedule 2 of the Regulations.
The Committee would appreciate your advice as soon as possible but before 28 March 2001 to enable it to finalise its consideration of these determinations. Correspondence should be directed to the Chair, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG 49, Parliament House, Canberra.

Dear Senator Coonan
Thank you for your letter of 1 March 2001 regarding the comments of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances on the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Regulations 2001.
In regard to the definition of native forests in regulation 3, the Government has re-examined the reference provided by the Office of Regulatory Drafting in the drafting instructions and agrees that the reference provided in the regulations will need to be revised. The correct reference should be National Forest Policy Statement and the correct ISBN for the policy statement 0 642 18239 6. An amendment to the regulations, to include newly certified solar water heaters, will be made soon and this issue will be addressed at this time.
The general formula for eligible generation outlined in regulation 14 is designed to ensure the point of measurement for eligible generation is consistent with the point of measurement for relevant acquisitions, or liability. In determining the point at which liability should be measured, the Renewables Target Working Group, established in 1998 to develop implementation recommendations for the target, considered the issue in the context of physical electricity flows and existing electricity supply system measurement points. Wholesale purchases in the NEM, accounting for approximately 85% of electricity generation in Australia, are measured at the wholesale pool. However, electricity generation is normally measured at the generator terminals (at a point prior to being dispatched to the transmission system and wholesale pool). It was considered inequitable if eligibility and liability for renewable energy certificates were measured at different measurement points. Adopting the same measurement point for eligibility and liability is achieved by adjusting eligible generation for transmission losses, which results in certificates only being created for the amount of electricity made available for consumption.
In addition, the formula also allows for the situation where a self-generator may use all or some of the generation in an on-site process. Under such a scenario certificates could be created for electricity used in on-site processes, such as the manufacture of a product, and transmission losses would only be deducted for the electricity sent off site (Dispatched Level of Generation).
A number of issues were taken into account in determining the level of fees to be applied to the services performed by and on behalf of the Office of the Renewable Energy Regulator. The fees for registration of persons and companies and accreditation of power stations are set at a level so as to partially recover the costs incurred, at an administrative and technical level, by the regulator in performing this service. The structure of the fees will allow for work involved in analysing the highly differing levels of data, in both quality and complexity, received from power stations seeking accreditation. They are also structured so as not to discourage smaller generators, notably persons with small generating units and solar water heaters, from participating in the scheme.
In regard to determining the fees for registration and surrender of certificates a number of objectives were considered, including providing a high level of service to system users and governments, but at a cost that encouraged participation in the measure. The Government conducted a competitive tender process to select the service provider which could meet the Government's needs at acceptable cost.
The final fee structure was based on the estimates of the cost of providing the service developed by the preferred tenderer, taking into consideration likely contractual volumes in the five year term of the contract. The fees in the regulations reflect the best estimates of the likely costs of providing an internet-based renewable energy certificate registry and surrender facility.
You also question the legislative basis on which regulation 4(2)(b) draws authority to revoke accreditation. The Office of Legislative Drafting, in drafting the regulations, has advised that this power arises from provisions in the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 which allow a party with the right to confer a benefit to also withdraw that benefit. As the Renewable Energy Regulator has the ability to accredit power stations, and therefore disaccredit power stations, it was considered necessary to include guidelines for the use of this power in the regulations to provide greater transparency for industry.

Dear Minister
Thank you for your letter dated 28 March 2001 responding to the Committee's concerns on the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Regulations 2001.
The Committee appreciates your advice that the reference to the ISBN for the policy statement was incorrect and will be revised. However, the Committee previously sought your advice on whether it would be more appropriate to include the meaning given to these terms in Regulation 3 rather than by cross-reference to the policy statement. The Committee has considered this matter further and is of the view that cross-referencing a policy statement for a definition is wrong in principle as a policy statement it not meant to be normative. The Committee therefore seeks your further advice on whether it would be more appropriate that the definition be included in the Regulations.
In addition, the Committee notes your advice on the legislative basis for the revocation of an accreditation. The Committee would appreciate receiving a copy of the Office of Legislative Drafting advice to enable it to inform itself properly on this aspect of the instrument.
The Committee appreciates that it may be difficult to respond promptly to its further concerns before 2 April 2001 which is the last sitting day on which a notice of motion to disallow may be given.

Thank you for your letter of 29 March 2001 regarding the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Regulations 2001 and my previous response to your letter of 1 March 2001.
In response to your further queries I have instructed the Office of Legislative drafting to replace existing references to definitions contained within the National Forest Policy Statement with the actual definitions of native forests and plantations contained in the statement. Drafting is currently underway to address a number of other necessary amendments this amendment will be incorporated as part of that process. I anticipate making the amendments to the regulations available for public comment, in line with the requirements of the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000 in early May, with consideration of the revised regulations expected in June 2001.
I have contacted the Office of the Legislative Drafting seeking the written advice you requested on the powers of the Renewable Energy Regulator to revoke accreditation of power stations. The written advice of the Office of Legislative Drafting is attached for your information, confirming that the Office considers the revocation powers to be valid.
Yours sincerely

RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) REGULATIONS 2001
I refer to your letter of 4 April seeking written advice on the legislative basis of Schedule 2 of the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Regulations 2001.
2.	During the drafting of the regulations, I considered whether regulations could be made under the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000 to provide for guidelines for revocation of accreditation of eligible power stations. I concluded, and advised you orally, that they could.
3.	Subsection 33(3) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 provides that:
Where an Act confers power to make, grant or issue any instrument (including rules, regulations or by-laws) the power shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be construed as including a power exercisable in the like manner and subject to the like conditions (if any) to repeal, rescind, revoke, amend, or vary any such instrument.
4.	For the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act, the relevant instrument is the Regulator's determination, under section 15, that a power station is eligible for accreditation.
5.	Under subsection 14(4) of the Act, the Regulator must make a determination under paragraph 14(1)(b) (whether the power station is eligible for accreditation) `in accordance with guidelines prescribed in the regulations'. The determination is clearly intended by the Act to be in the form of an instrument. For this purpose, an instrument does not have to be legislative in character. It can also be of an executive or administrative nature.
6.	If section 15 includes, by force of subsection 33(3) of the Acts Interpretation Act, power to revoke a determination of eligibility for accreditation, then subsection 14(4) includes power to make guidelines for revocation of eligibility for accreditation.
7.	Please let me know if you need any further assistance in this matter.

CANBERRA   ACT   2600
Dear Minister
I refer to the Fisheries Management Amendment Regulations 2001 (No. 2), Statutory Rules 2001 No. 22, that provide new procedures for public notification of determinations regarding logbooks made by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority.
New subregulation 32(6) gives AFMA the choice of either publishing in a newspaper a notice of the making of a determination (but not the entire determination itself), or sending a copy of the entire determination by post to each holder of a relevant fishing licence.  According to the Explanatory Statement, the purpose of this amendment is to “streamline the procedures for publicly notifying the making of a determination” and, in the case of notification by post, to provide a mechanism that “will be less costly and more effective for some small fisheries”.  The Explanatory Statement does not indicate the criteria which will be used to determine when the postal notification method is used instead of notification in a newspaper.  The Committee therefore seeks clarification on the factors that determine when either of these procedures would be used.
This query aside, the Committee appreciates the helpful detail that was provided in the Explanatory Statement for this instrument, and those for Statutory Rules 2001 Nos. 21 and 23, both dealing with fisheries management.
The Committee would appreciate your advice as soon as possible but before 4 April 2001 to enable it to finalise its consideration of these regulations. Correspondence should be directed to the Chair, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG 49, Parliament House, Canberra.

Dear Senator Coonan
Thank you for your letter of 29 March 2001 seeking clarification on the new procedures for public notification of determinations regarding logbooks made by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA). In your letter you specifically sought advice in respect of a new subregulation 32(6) on the criterion which may be utilised to determine when the postal notification will be used instead of notification in a newspaper.
I have sought advice from the AFMA in responding to your query. AFMA has advised the primary criterion that will be used to determine whether determinations will be notified by post is cost. If it is less expensive to send the determination to each operator in the fishery by registered mail than it is to advertise in an appropriate newspaper then AFMA will choose to notify by post. In each case this will depend on the number and distribution of operators in the relevant fishery, and the costs of advertising in the appropriate newspaper. For example, The Australian newspaper is often the appropriate newspaper for advertising in relation to a fishery where operators are located in a wide range of locations. The cost of advertising a notice of the making of a logbook determination in this newspaper is approximately $1000 against which the costs of notifying each operator by post in these fisheries would be compared. In the largest fisheries, such as the Northern Prawn Fishery, it may still be more cost effective to advertise in the newspaper but in most other fisheries, it will be more cost effective to notify by post.
I trust that this elaboration of the information in the Explanatory Statement on the public notification process clarifies the situation for the Standing Committee.
Yours sincerely

Guidelines for Detention of, Dealing with, and Disposal of Drug like substances, made under subsection 99ZS(1) of the National Health Act 1953
Health Insurance Commission Export of Pharmaceutical Benefits Guidelines, made under subsection 99ZS(2) of the National Health Act 1953

Dear Minister
I refer to the Guidelines for Detention of, Dealing with, and Disposal of Drug like substances and the Health Insurance Commission Export of Pharmaceutical Benefits Guidelines made under subsections 99ZS(1) and (2) of the National Health Act 1953. These Guidelines specify guidelines for the Australian Customs Service and the Health Insurance Commission concerning the export of Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme Prescription Drugs.
These two sets of guidelines appear to be complementary, dealing with the procedures to be adopted by the Customs Office and the Health Insurance Commission (HIC), respectively.  The Customs guidelines provide that where drugs are detained they will be placed in an approved Customs evidence bag and sealed.  The guidelines then state that “Where HIC staff are immediately available to take control of the drugs, this will not be necessary”.  The Customs guidelines do not indicate why an evidence bag is not necessary in the latter case.  It may be that the answer is supplied by item 3.3 of the HIC guidelines, which states that “the Commission officer shall ensure the security of the drug like substance once in their possession for conveyance to the Commission office”, and item 3.4 which states that prior to drugs being conveyed to the Commission, “the Commission officer will place the suspected drug like substance/s in a tamper proof bag” which is then sealed.  The Committee would, however, appreciate clarification on the operation of these procedures and an assurance that drugs which are detained are secured from tampering at all stages before they are examined by the Commission.
The Committee draws to your attention a typographical error in the HIC guidelines at item 4, where the word “unsure” should be “ensure”.  
The Committee would appreciate your advice as soon as possible but before 4 April 2001 to enable it to finalise its consideration of these guidelines. Correspondence should be directed to the Chair, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG 49, Parliament House, Canberra.

Dear Senator Coonan
Thank you for your letter of 29 March 2001 concerning the guidelines made under subsections 99ZS(1) and (2) of the National Health Act 1953 (the Act).
The two sets of guidelines are complementary, dealing with procedures to be followed by officers of the Australian Customs Service and the Health Insurance Commission respectively in relation to matters arising under Division 4D of Part VII of the Act. That Division deals with restrictions on the exports of drugs supplied under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.
Your Committee notes that the Customs Guidelines provide that detained drugs are to be placed in an approved Customs bag and sealed, except where Health Insurance Commission (HIC) staff are immediately available to take control of the drugs. You ask why an evidence bag is not necessary in the latter case, surmising that provisions in the HIC Guidelines are applicable.
I wish to advise that the Committee's assumption is correct. When an officer of the HIC is immediately available, that officer will take control of the drugs and follow the procedures described in items 3.3 and 3.4 of the Guidelines. I wish to assure the Committee that drugs which are. detained will at all stages be secured from tampering prior to their examination by the HIC.
Thank you for pointing out the typographical error in item 4 of the HIC Guidelines. It has been drawn to the attention of the HIC and will be corrected at the first available opportunity.
With kind regards,
Yours sincerely

CANBERRA   ACT   2600
Dear Minister
I refer to the Interstate Road Transport Amendment Regulations 2001 (No 1), Statutory Rules 2001 No. 15, that make new provisions governing the suspension of registration of a motor vehicle or trailer registered under the Interstate Road Transport Act 1985.
The Explanatory Statement notes that the amendment in item 7 to subregulation 52(1) is required, in part, because of a misdescription in regulation 12 of Statutory Rules 1996 No. 250. That misdescription concerned regulation 12ZAB. However, regulation 12 of the 1996 Statutory Rules also refers to regulation 12ZAB. Hence it is not clear what error it is that the present amendment seeks to rectify. The Committee would therefore appreciate clarification on the reason for this amendment.
The Committee would appreciate your advice as soon as possible but before 2 April 2001 to enable it to finalise its consideration of these determinations. Correspondence should be directed to the Chair, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG 49, Parliament House, Canberra.

Dear Senator Coonan
I refer to your letter of 1 March 2001 to my ministerial colleague, Senator the Hon Ian Macdonald, regarding recent amendments to the Interstate Road Transport Regulations 1986 in Statutory Rules 15 of 2001. As these regulations fall within my direct portfolio responsibilities, I consider it appropriate to reply personally on this matter.
I note your query about the need for item 7 which amends subregulation 52(1), particularly the addition of regulation of 12ZAB to the list of items included in the definition of “prescribed penalty” which, as you point out, was included as an amendment in Statutory Rules 12 of 1996.
I am advised that regulation 12 of Statutory Rules 1996 No. 250 was regarded as misdescribed because of a `rogue' comma included after the reference to “subregulation 15(1)”. The inclusion of a reference to “regulation 12ZAB” was in fact correct and was the intent of the amendment. The present amendment therefore seeks to achieve the original intent of regulation 12 of Statutory Rules 1996 No. 250 by inserting the reference to “regulation 12ZAB” in subregulation 52(1).
I note that the drafters have also taken the opportunity to update the drafting of the provision generally, to make it consistent with current drafting practices.
I hope that this response addresses your concerns satisfactorily.

I refer to the Radiocommunications Licence Conditions (Broadcasting Licence) Amendment Determination 2001 (No. 1) made under paragraph 107(1)(f) of the Radiocommunications Act 1992, that imposes a new `use it or lose it' condition on low power open narrowcasting licences.
Paragraph 4.11(1)(b) of the amended Determination requires a licensee to provide the low power narrowcasting service “with reasonable regularity” for the period specified in the licence.  The Committee would appreciate your advice on the meaning of “reasonable regularity” in this context.

Dear Senator Coonan
Thank you for your letter of 29 March 2001 seeking advice on the meaning of “reasonable regularity” in the context of paragraph 4.11(1)(b) of the Radiocommunications Licence Conditions (Broadcasting Licence) Amendment Determination 2001 (No 1).
The Australian Communications Authority (ACA) formulated the Determination. I have therefore consulted the ACA which advised the following:
The intent of the recent amendments to the above Licence Conditions Determination (LCD) is to ensure that the limited spectrum available for low power open narrowcasting (LPON) is actually used to provide services to the community, not speculative gain to a few individuals and companies.
Currently there are about 1500 licences on issue throughout Australia, of which it is estimated about 65% are not operating. Those which are operating offer a range of narrowcasting programs such as tourist information, horse racing results, snow and skiing information, sporting events, ethnic language programs, religious programs, school programs and dance programs.
In framing the conditions necessary to ensure usage (paragraph 4.11(1)(b)), account was paid to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 definition of open narrowcasting services. Section 18 of that Act states:
“Open narrowcasting services are broadcasting services:
a)	whose reception is limited:
(i)	by being targeted to special interest groups; or
(ii)	by being intended only for limited locations, for example, arenas or
	business premises; or
(iii)	by being provided during a limited period or to cover a special
	event; or
(iv)	because they provide programs of limited appeal; or
(v)	for some other reason; and
b)	that comply with any determinations or clarifications under section 19 in relation to open narrowcasting services.”
In practice, many LPONs operate over restricted and varied periods. A snow/skiing LPON service may only operate in the winter months and may not operate twenty-four hours a day. Religious LPON services may only operate on Sundays. Those LPONs used to cover sporting events at a stadium may operate only when events are scheduled and then only for the duration of the event. Conversely, an ethnic language LPON service may operate twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. All of the above situations are acceptable LPON services.
The condition is intended to apply in all possible circumstances. Specifying a minimum number of hours of transmission per period was not appropriate in all cases and could be considered onerous by some licensees - hence the term “reasonable regularity”.
Generally the test of what is reasonable depends on the circumstances and is a question of fact for the decision-maker (or tribunal). What is required has to be within the limits of reason, and not something greatly less or more than might be thought likely or appropriate. It is not a subjective test by which the licensee can determine what is simply convenient. The test requires that the nature of the service and its regularity and the circumstances must be looked at objectively.
Should it be necessary to investigate a complaint that an operator of an LPON is not providing a service, the LPON licensee may need to justify, as part of the process, that the hours of service he or she is providing are both “reasonable” and “regular” and are appropriate to the type of narrowcasting program format he or she purports to transmit.
I hope this information is of assistance.

Dear Senator
I refer to your letter of 8 March 2001 about the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) (SES Scores Guidelines) Approval 2000 (“the Approval”) made under section 7 of the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 2000. I apologise for the delay in responding to your letter which has only recently come to my attention.
An Explanatory Statement for the Approval is attached.
You requested advice in relation to clause 3 of the Approval about the circumstances where it would be impracticable to geocode student residential addresses. Clause 3 of the Schedule of the Approval states that each student residential address contained in the statement of addresses for a school is to be geocoded unless it is not reasonably practicable to geocode that address.
Geocoding is the process of assigning a student residential address to one of the Census Collection Districts designated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics for the purposes of the 1996 Census of Population and Housing. For an address to be geocoded it must be located in Australia in a geographical sense and there must be sufficient information available to the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs to allow the address to be assigned to a particular Census Collection District. Where an address cannot be geocoded it is not included in calculating an SES score for a school.
It is intended that all student residential addresses be geocoded and this general rule is set out in clause 3. However, this is not always possible and examples follow of circumstances where it is not. Therefore, there is an exception to the general rule so that an address need not be geocoded where it is not reasonably practicable to do so. This allows an SES score to be calculated for a school notwithstanding that all addresses have not been geocoded, thereby avoiding disadvantaging the school through delays or otherwise.
The circumstances where geocoding is not reasonably practicable include instances where the student boards either with a school or privately and whose Australian parents live overseas and do not maintain an Australian address. The overseas address of the parents would be included in the statement of addresses for the school but would not be geocoded as the address is not in Australia. A similar situation would exist for students with Australian residency (temporary or permanent) but with no Australian residential address.
There are also situations where the school does not hold enough address information for a student and the parents of the student cannot be contacted to obtain further details to enable the address to be geocoded. Addresses such as these would include Post Office Box numbers only, street addresses without street numbers, and property names without additional location information. If no further details could be obtained through the school within a reasonable time, then these addresses would not be geocoded.
In summary, the reasons why a student residential address would not be geocoded are associated with the technical aspects of geocoding and it is essential that there be an exception to the general rule that all student residential addresses be geocoded to deal with those cases. Otherwise some schools could be seriously disadvantaged.
I trust this information is of assistance to the Committee and that the Committee will not proceed with the motion to disallow the Approval.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-05-24,"—I note the Labor Party's objection to general business notice of motion No. 912 being taken as a formal motion and, pursuant to contingent notice, I move:
That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Brown moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely, a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion No. 912.
The motion reads:
That the Senate, on the 50th anniversary of China's military takeover of Tibet, calls on Australian individuals, agencies and companies working in Tibet to ensure that they do not:
	(a)	deplete natural resources, with little or no benefit to the Tibetan people—
I will ask the Labor Party to explain why it opposes that—
	(b)	facilitate the erosion of Tibetan culture and traditions—
I will ask the Labor Party why it objects to that—
	(c)	facilitate the migration and settlement of non-Tibetans into Tibet—
I will ask the Labor Party why it objects to Australians not doing so—
	(d)	negatively affect the sustainability of Tibet's ecosystems—
I will ask the Labor Party why it objects to Australians not harming Tibet's ecosystems—
	(e)	transfer ownership of Tibetan land and natural resources to non-Tibetans—
I will ask the Labor Party and the government why they object to that—
	(f)	initiate and operate projects without the participation of affected Tibetans; or
	(g)	facilitate large-scale, capital-intensive and commercial projects.
I ask the Labor Party why it objects even to a debate on Australians being restrained or asked to not go against the interests of Tibetans when Australians are working in Tibet. This is the 50th anniversary of China's military takeover of Tibet. It is very important for us to note the difference between what is happening in Washington—where, overnight, President Bush commendably received the Dalai Lama at the White House—and the attitude in Australia, where the Australian government has decided to send a representative to a disgusting and obscene celebration of the takeover of Tibet at the communist Chinese embassy.
Here we have the Howard government deciding that it is going to celebrate the death of a million Tibetans, the enslavement of a country, the biggest military occupation that exists anywhere on the face of the planet, the continued imprisonment and torture of Buddhist monks and nuns—who, as we debate this this morning, are in the prisons in their hundreds in their home country—and the flight over the Himalayas into Nepal each winter of some 4,000 Tibetans. This is a disgusting and cruel occupation of Tibet by the communist regime in Beijing, and here we have the coalition government going down to sip champagne to celebrate that.
Prime Minister Howard should call it off. It is one thing to go down and talk trade with Beijing; it is another to go down and celebrate the agony of Tibet with the Beijing regime. This is a black spot in Australian diplomatic affairs if ever there was one. What can be gained from the Howard government sending an Australian emissary around to the Chinese embassy tonight to celebrate the occupation of Tibet? Would it send, as the Australia Tibet Council points out, an emissary around to an Iraqi facility to celebrate the takeover of Kuwait?
Australia has diplomatic relationships with China. But to celebrate the destruction of Tibet's culture, the denial of human rights in Tibet and the imprisonment of freedom fighters—and they are peaceful; these are monks and nuns we are talking about—in their hundreds in the Chinese embassy tonight is simply disgusting, and the Australian people will not endorse that, I can tell you, Madam President. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer, has made a mistake and Prime Minister Howard should rectify it and call it off. There will be Tibetans outside the embassy tonight. They are a small number—they are outnumbered—but they will be there as a little act of defiance against this cowardly kowtowing to Beijing by the Howard government. My motion calls for Australian companies and entities who go to Tibet to act ethically. I ask the Labor Party why it cannot support that. This is not a foreign affairs matter. This is saying to domestic Australian entities: do the right thing in Tibet.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2001-05-24,"—I did listen carefully to Senator Brown's arguments. Most of them went to the substance of the motion, and I am not critical of him for presenting his case in that way. But we need to acknowledge what is before the Senate at the moment, and that is a suspension of standing orders motion that has been moved by Senator Brown to enable this chamber to give priority to debate on the general business notice of motion that Senator Brown in some detail has outlined. The truth of the matter is that what now faces the chamber is whether we decide to give priority to debating those issues.
I am willing to say to Senator Brown that of course the issues he raises are significant ones. They are among any number of important issues that this chamber can give time to and consider. No-one in the opposition is going to deny that, and I do not think anyone in the chamber would deny it. But let us be clear what we have before us. At the moment, we have a cognate package of four bills on which a resolution has passed in this chamber that the Senate will debate and finalise it before it adjourns this evening. We have a choice of dealing with that cognate package of bills, which includes the Compensation (Japanese Internment) Bill 2001, the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (One-off Payment to the Aged) Bill 2001, the Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Further Assistance for Older Australians) Bill 2001 and the Taxation Laws Amendment (Changes for Senior Australians) Bill 2001. Those matters are before the chamber now. We have a decision made that the Senate will sit until we do finalise that particular package of legislation.
The opposition, for our part, had other priorities, and I would like Senator Brown to take this into account. We were very keen to deal with a motion in relation to the spectrum auction and digital datacasting, but we have—and, Senator Brown, I ask you to consider this—in what I think is a generous and magnanimous gesture, agreed to give up debate on those important issues this afternoon to allow us to deal with the priority legislation that is before the chamber. So that is the issue. No-one is suggesting the matters that you raise are not important; they are important, just like the issues that the opposition wanted to debate are important as well. But our choice, our decision, is a decision now only of what to give priority to. We are saying that we are going to give priority to the legislation program for that package of four bills that is before the chamber and that the Senate must deal with and finalise hopefully today and not in the wee small hours of tomorrow or in an extended Senate sitting tomorrow.
The other point that must be made in relation to any motion such as the one Senator Brown moves is this: we have a very blunt instrument here. All we can do as a Senate under the Senate's procedures is agree to this motion in its entirety if we do not have debate. We either vote for it or we vote against it. It just so happens on many motions like this one that the opposition, perhaps the government and other senators as well might have different points of view. They might even oppose the spirit of certain motions that come before the chamber and would like to have an opportunity to amend them. There is no choice here. It is a blunt instrument: you either support it in its entirety or you oppose it. That is the choice that the opposition face and that is why our approach will be to not support the suspension of standing orders, and we will oppose the substantive motion.

"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,2001-05-24,"—On behalf of the opposition, I rise to indicate that we will support the Compensation (Japanese Internment) Bill 2001, which the government announced in the budget but which had been strategically leaked by the government some weeks ago. It was leaked because of the political damage that Mr Shane Stone's memo to the Prime Minister had caused the government. Lo and behold, out of nowhere, a story appears in the press that the government would be including in the budget a proposal to pay compensation to those who had been prisoners of war of the Japanese. In recent months, there had been some publicity and lobbying on behalf of the POW association and others in the veterans community for this compensation in view of the British government's announcement, within the last 12 months, that they would make a one-off payment. 
As I say, the opposition welcomes the government's decision to pay this compensation and it has agreed to support the bill going through the Senate by the end of today so that the compensation can be paid as soon as possible. However, that does not stop the opposition from raising a number of questions about the structure of the bill and the way certain issues raised by the bill will have to be dealt with. The opposition indicates that, although we will not move amendments in committee, we will use the committee stage as an opportunity to ask further questions about certain matters in the bill.
First of all, on behalf of the opposition, may I say that we find it rather strange that these bills have to be rushed through parliament this week. I note that, in the compensation bill, the compensation payment is paid out of this financial year's budget. The PBS document provided to all senators for the estimates, and the minister's statement, state that the amount of compensation paid will total about $247 million. According to the minister's statement, apparently that will be paid out of this year's budget. No reason has been given as to why the money will come out of this year's budget. I presume there might be an argument that this means it can be paid as soon as possible. I do not know whether there is some difficulty for the government in trying to keep the budget surplus at $1.5 billion for the next financial year and they do not want the $247 million knocked off the $1.5 billion surplus as that might stretch their economic credentials, because they predicted two or three years ago that this budget would have a surplus of about $14 billion. That was the figure predicted for the out years in the budget papers two or three years ago. Of course, that shows that the government have gone berserk in the last couple of years, busting their own economic credentials by spending money in every direction when the Prime Minister has run into political problems. It shows that their claim to be economic managers is now extremely threadbare as they have turned a proposed budget surplus, as estimated three years ago, of nearly $14 billion, into $1.5 billion. I certainly want to get an explanation from the government of why the money has to be paid out this financial year rather than next year.
I note that the payment is to be made to all POWs of the Japanese who were alive at 1 January or their war widows or spouses who were alive at that time, and, if any of them has died between then and now, the money will be paid into their estate. I also see that the same provision is provided to the so-called internees—civilians who were interned and received the same terrible treatment as our POWs. We have no objection, of course, to the cut-off date, and we have no objection to POWs' war widows being eligible for the full payment. I had a query on this issue in my office this morning. I presume that the payment is made to the last war widow who is still alive. If a POW who had been married for many years divorced his wife and subsequently remarried, even for only six months last year, I presume that it is the last widow still standing—to use that phrase—who gets the payment.
I can imagine that there will be some complaint in the veterans community and amongst war widows. Some may have spent most of their adult life as the spouse of a POW and provided the care that went with that since 1945. It is now 55 years ago, so let us say they provided care for 40-odd years. After the marriage failed, the POW married somebody else, perhaps only six or eight months ago, and that person will get the full benefit. I am not sure that I have an answer to that, but I can imagine that there will be some angst amongst widows who spent most of their life with a POW and often had to be the informal, unpaid carer of a POW, but will get none of the benefit. That is unfortunate and I admit that I do not have a solution, but I am sure that the minister will informally and formally receive comments about such an outcome.
I also note that the bill does not amend the Veterans' Entitlements Act—it is a special bill. I can understand that, because it pays benefits to non-veterans—that is, civilian detainees. I make the point to the minister and to the department that they have established the payment of a special benefit, although it is not under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, to civilian people who certainly deserve it. I therefore see no reason why a policy decision cannot be reached that the 400-odd Vietnam civilian doctors and nurses should also receive special benefits, as we proposed earlier this year in an amendment to the Veterans' Entitlements Act or, if it has to be done, by a special act of parliament. The opposition would certainly support that. I appreciate that the government has established a precedent whereby, under the Veterans' Entitlements Act or by a special act, civilian nurses and doctors who were in Vietnam and who provided distinguished service should also be paid the same entitlements as those who served in our military forces in Vietnam.
I also want to make a point—it might be better to raise it in committee, if the minister cannot answer it in reply to the second reading debate—regarding a list of the civilians who were detained. How was that list compiled? For prisoners of war and those who joined various units, who were captured in the Pacific theatre of war and returned home, there are clear records in the veterans' affairs department and in the military. How do you establish a record that verifies that certain people were civilian detainees in the Pacific? Does the detainee have to be an Australian citizen at the time they were detained? An example that was raised with me only yesterday involves an Australian woman whose husband was a British citizen in PNG at the time of its occupation by the Japanese. Her husband was detained and executed by the Japanese, but he was clearly a civilian detainee. She is an Australian citizen. Is she, as the widow of a civilian detainee, entitled to the benefit? Minister, I would like an answer to that. I think that your advisers might be able to make some comment. I will not acknowledge the adviser politely making signals to me from the box. I appreciate that very much; they are trying to be helpful, but I want that answer on the record.
Are civilian detainees who were British citizens or other citizens and who subsequently came to Australia and took out Australian citizenship some time after the Second World War eligible for this payment to civilian detainees? Again, because this benefit is now available, many people in that grey area will ask why they have missed out. They have been citizens of Australia for a long time, or their spouses were Australian citizens, and they will miss out although they in no way suffered less pain than the Australians suffered and they were in an Australian colony at the time.
The next issue, which comes to light as a result of the bill's being rapidly introduced into parliament, has not been properly explained or investigated. Of course, this bill will be passed by the parliament before the Senate estimates committee considers the Department of Veterans' Affairs budget, which is less than two weeks away. It is an unfortunate arrangement whereby the bill will be passed before the estimates committee of the Senate has a chance to examine the measure. This precedent should not be entered into by governments in a capricious way—it undermines the standing of the Senate estimates committee process, which is an excellent process, whether you are in government or in opposition. The estimates committee process has enhanced the status of the Senate and it probably gives more value to the role of the Senate than any other part of our activities. But the bill will go through, and even if we ask relevant questions and information comes out during the estimates hearings—which, as we know, go on for several days—it will be too late to amend it.
This is an unfortunate precedent and process because if we discover, through the Senate estimates, anomalies and weaknesses in this legislation that, because it is being rammed through the parliament at the request of the government today, we have not had a chance to find then it will be a deficiency in the parliamentary system for which the government has to take full responsibility. Nevertheless, we support the bill. But maybe at the committee stage some of these matters that I am now raising could be answered for me.
An issue in this bill that I note is that the payment is not exempt from the deeming provisions. This means, if I understand it correctly, that if somebody has already got an investment of $20,000 or $30,000 and gets the $25,000 payment and does not spend it—puts it into an investment—they therefore would have a deeming rate of around five per cent. That five per cent on $25,000 by my very rough mathematics—and I stand to be corrected—is an income of about $1,200 per annum. That will therefore be assessed as income if they have other benefits coming from elsewhere within the social security system. Therefore, that could reduce their other social security benefits.
I am not sure that that is a correct procedure because this is not a benefit: this is a compensation payment. Why is a compensation payment being hit by the deeming provisions? If the beneficiary of this payment takes the $25,000 and spends it on a trip overseas or blows it at the casino, the deeming will not apply because they have spent it—they have blown it. But why shouldn't we be encouraging veterans to invest it and use the income from it to guarantee their lifestyle and to improve their living standard while they or their widow are still alive? I think putting the deeming regime on this payment is an anomaly. I would like the minister to explain because the second reading speech of this bill, made and tabled by the minister in the parliament late yesterday, was deficient in so many ways in explaining these matters. That is a problem of rushed legislation—but we will come back to that later.
The final issue I want to raise in the time I have left is the issue of those who have missed out on the payment. Already, since the speculation occurred three or four weeks ago that it was to be paid to the POWs of the Japanese, many veterans who were POWs in the European theatre of war have been complaining. On Tuesday night, I returned from attending the 60th anniversary of the battles of Greece and Crete as part of the official delegation. There were a number of veterans there and seven of them from my count in the official book produced by Veterans' Affairs ended up being prisoners of war when captured in Greece or in Crete.
When you read their descriptions in the official book produced by Veterans' Affairs, you cannot say that these people had an easy time. I will quote one man in particular but draw everybody's attention to this document and the names of the veterans who were prisoners of war. They were Thomas Anderson, Francis Atkins, Terry Fairbairn, Charles Frampton, Arthur Leggett, Charles Parrot and Ian Rutter.
Let me read the description of what happened to Charles Parrot. When I first met him on the delegation in the Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery at Athens, I was walking down the row of tombstones of the Australians who lost their lives. Charlie was standing next to a tombstone and I said, `Did you know this man?' He said, `Yes, I did, Senator. He, a friend of mine, died of starvation in the Salonika prisoner of war camp in December 41. This is the first time in 60 years I have been able to stand here and put a red poppy on his tombstone.'
Charlie Parrot did not die of starvation. This is what his own words are in the document produced by Veterans Affairs', and I would have to say that if this is not a case for him individually to be given similar treatment I do not know what is! He said, `Despite hiding out in the hills, we were eventually captured and taken by cargo boat to Greece. Life in a POW camp in Salonika was terrible. The food was atrocious and many POWs died, mostly from starvation.'
The prisoners were moved to a POW camp in Germany, where they were put to work building a canal. They again moved, to Stalag 8B at Landsdorf, and were sent to work in a coal mine. After a long period of illness, including gangrene in his leg, Charlie was forced to take part in a 780-kilometre march ahead of the Russian troops, but at the end of the first day he hid in a cellar. When the Russians arrived, they were no better than the Germans. They left him in the snow until he was saved by two Poles, who took him to a nearby convent. He received treatment for several weeks and was eventually able to walk again on crutches. Charlie was then imprisoned by the Russians before being put on a British ship back to Britain.
By the way, he told me personally that he spent 17 days in an open cattle train going from Poland to Odessa in the Crimea before he was shipped back. He spent a year working in an underground Polish coal mine. He still has injuries in his hands from the work in the coal mine. Can you say that this man is not as deserving? I do not think you can.
I will turn to another story in this book produced by Veterans' Affairs. This is by Terry Fairbairn, who had similar treatment. The Germans, because they thought he might have been connected to Ireland, offered to put him into a special unit made up of Irish people who might oppose the British Empire, to go and fight for the Germans. He refused. When Terry refused to betray his country, he was singled out for special treatment and spent the next nine months in handcuffs. He was put in handcuffs for nine months. What sort of treatment is that? That is terrible. 
After Terry was sent to the POW camp at Rotenburg in January 1945, the prisoners were marched out, first south and then westwards of the advancing Russians. He was forced into a march of several hundred kilometres by the German authorities. I draw the attention of the department to their own book. Look up the seven people here, representative of the 15,000-plus Australian prisoners of war in Europe. Look at the prisoners who were captured in either North Africa, Greece or Crete and look at the POWs who were shot down from Bomber Command and put into prisoner of war camps.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2001-05-24,"—Senator Schacht addressed that part of the cognate debate relating to the Compensation (Japanese Internment) Bill 2001. I intend to direct my remarks in the cognate debate to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Changes for Senior Australians) Bill 2001. My colleague Senator Chris Evans, in his contribution to the cognate debate, will later this morning address the community service bills—the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (One-off Payment to the Aged) Bill 2001 and the Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Further Assistance for Older Australians) Bill 2001.
In the budget on Tuesday night the government put to the people and to this parliament that it wanted this legislation immediately. That is why we are debating these measures today so soon after the budget was brought down. It is true that that is unusual, but the Labor opposition believes that we should speed the passage of this legislation to make sure that the benefits contained in it are delivered on time—albeit we reserve our view that in many respects the benefits are inadequate to the needs of Australians. But that reservation does not mean to say that they should not get what is available as quickly as possible.
I will now turn to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Changes for Senior Australians) Bill 2001. This bill attempts to do a number of things to give effect to the government's desire to appeal to those so badly hurt by the GST; that is, our older Australians—or, in the rubric that is now used, `seniors'. Firstly, the bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to enable an increase in the tax rebate available to senior Australians, an increase that will be realised through regulation. Secondly, the bill amends the Medicare Levy Act 1986 to ensure that senior Australians who are entitled to the increased rebates as a result of this bill do not pay the Medicare levy if their taxable income is less than $20,000. The bill also seeks to ensure that those Australians under the pension age who receive a taxable Commonwealth pension will not have to pay the Medicare levy if their income is below $15,970. Thirdly, the bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act to exempt from tax the one-off $300 payment to the aged. That is the purpose of the legislation before us.
These measures are intended to take effect from 1 July 2000, which I consider to be a clear sign that the government acknowledges that it got it wrong when it decided to impose on Australians a GST without adequate compensation. It is clear that the government is now trying to atone for its unwillingness to foresee the pain that it has caused. Let us make no mistake here: this bill is part of the government's compensation drive, despite its unwillingness to admit it. The government broke its promise that no-one would be worse off under the GST. As we are clearly seeing, so many Australians are worse off. The notorious—or, as some would have it, infamous—undertaking by the Prime Minister that no-one would be worse off as a consequence of the GST is palpably and demonstrably wrong. Although in our view these compensation measures do not go far enough, they at least go some way to addressing and correcting that misleading promise.
The one-off $300 grant to pensioners is clearly part of the government's desperate attempt to win back some of those who have realised the government has failed them—one might say it has a political purpose. It was interesting to note that Peter Costello must know just how inadequate the $300 payment is, because, in spite of his best efforts to make it seem generous, he could not help but refer to it repeatedly in his National Press Club address yesterday incorrectly as being a per annum payment. It is not; it is a one-off payment. It is a one-off payment, a cash handout, to help compensate for the GST, but the GST of course goes on forever.
It should be noted that hundreds of thousands of pensioners reasonably believed that they would be entitled to the $1,000 aged persons savings bonus under the GST compensation package. However, they found that when they applied for the bonus they did not meet the strict requirements imposed by the government. They want to know where the other $700 is! The $1,000 bonus payment offered by the government had devil in the detail. When those who believed they were entitled looked at the detail, the government was able to say that they were not entitled.
The government has sought throughout its budget documents, its speeches and this bill to draw distinctions amongst those aged 55 plus by the use of a number of terms: `aged person', `senior Australian', `older Australian', `age pensioner', `pensioner' and `self-funded retiree'—a plethora of terms, some of which are indistinctly defined and lack particular, pointed meaning. These distinctions are used, however, to ensure that not all those who might have reasonably expected to finally be compensated for some of the hurt this government has imposed upon them in the form of the GST will miss out yet again.
One of the most tricky things about this bill is that, when the government put forward its compensation package as part of its GST legislation, it was happy to consider that a self-funded retiree was someone who, in short, was aged 55 years or more, had not received certain pensions or benefits for the three months leading up to the introduction of the GST and had limited business and wages income. Now we find that it suits the government and in particular the Treasurer, Mr Costello, to redefine what a self-funded retiree is so that the government will escape having to redress the damage done to all older Australians.
Pensioners will want to know when the two per cent pension clawback will be given back. The pension clawback is short-changing single pensioners by $7.90 and couples by $13.20 every fortnight. Also, many retirees will soon be wanting to know when the government will deliver on its promised $450 tax rebate on savings. It was half-heartedly introduced only to be later abolished. The extension in the concessions contained within this bill puts back just a fraction of the $750 million in cuts that the government inflicted in 1996, when it axed free dental treatment, cut back on free hearing aids and jacked up the cost of medicines bought on cards. Pensioners will also know that, whatever John Howard gives he will find a way to claw it back again. This is a `give with one hand and take with the other' budget. The government has devalued our elderly. Now it is trying to buy them off at a discounted price.
Labor will not be opposing this bill. Labor remains committed to the task of rolling back the GST. However, we recognise that there are so many Australians hurting because of the unfair burden placed upon them by the GST that they should rightly receive immediate relief, before we get the opportunity in government to make it fairer and to make it simpler.",SENATE,<title>COMPENSATION (JAPANESE INTERNMENT) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2001-05-24,"—Ilistened carefully to the comments made by Senator Schacht in relation to theCompensation (Japanese Internment) Bill 2001. The issues he raised about European internment are issues on which I similarly await advice from the department. He raised some unusual instances and, on that basis, it would be extremely unfortunate if those people were not considered under the legislation. However, I do understand that the government has a view to ensuring that former POWs and widows of POWs are dealt with in a kind manner. The government's approach to this can only be measured by its response to some of the questions that Senator Schacht raised, such as the instance of the British POW and whether he would also be entitled to the payment.
Turning now to the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (One-off Payment to the Aged) Bill 2001, the opposition will support this bill; we believe that it is of benefit to pensioners. The government has provided for a one-off $300 payment to pensioners in its budget, and that payment will certainly go some way to addressing their concerns. The one-off payment creates an interesting position for them. One wonders, though, how they would have felt had they received the $1,000 which I understood the government to have originally promised them. Maybe the government could have considered longer term strategies that may have been able to assist pensioners with their difficulties in coming to grips with the GST. Of course, that is a matter that we will not know about because, as we are fully cognisant, the government has pointed to the fine print in relation to that one-off payment to pensioners.
The opposition would not, of course, oppose the one-off payment of $300 to pensioners. I am sure pensioners will be very pleased to receive such a payment, but one has to consider that it is not an ongoing measure. It is not a measure that provides some relief for pensioners over the longer period because, as we know, the GST is here to stay. Every year pensioners will have to confront the GST in their cost structures, and one hopes that the $300 will help them. I notice that the member for Lilley has taken the view that older Australians have been short-changed as a consequence of this one-off payment.
Some might say that, for pensioners, the GST is a life sentence. Hundreds of thousands of pensioners, as I said, were promised a payment of $1,000. But, in some instances, they will be short-changed by $700 and will receive only $300. Let us look at the two per cent pension increase that this government clawed back. The pension clawback short-changed pensioners by an amount of $7.90 per fortnight for singles and $13.20 per fortnight for couples. The issue for self-funded retirees is not currently before the Senate, but it goes to the same general area and will provide problems for pensioners in the longer run.
In conclusion, while Labor support the package of four bills, we note that the government has brought them before the Senate in a very short space of time and has sought an immediate response to the bills. We have been forthcoming. However, in the light of day better scrutiny might have provided a more considered response.",SENATE,<title>COMPENSATION (JAPANESE INTERNMENT) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2001-05-24,"—I rise to speak on the Compensation (Japanese Internment) Bill 2001 and related bills and indicate again that the Labor opposition will be supporting the bills. I will address a few remarks to those measures directed at pensioners and self-funded retirees, as they fall within my shadow ministerial responsibilities. In moving around the country since the introduction of the GST, one of the first issues of concern to be raised with me at all the meetings and in all the contacts I have had with elderly Australians has been about the impact of the GST and the inadequacy of their compensation. The GST has really hit them hard, hit them often and hit them in ways they had not expected. Despite all the discussion about the GST before it was introduced, people did not realise the enormity of its reach and the regularity with which it would be applied to everything they consumed or paid for.
People on fixed incomes have suffered the most. These people did not benefit largely from the tax cuts and their compensation was limited to the very meagre measures provided by the government. Those on fixed incomes—age pensions, disability pensions, unemployment benefits and self-funded retirees on fixed incomes—found it most hard to cope with the impact of the GST. They have found it really difficult when their house insurance, electricity bills and those sorts of bills have arrived with an added 10 per cent on everything. It has been foremost in their minds that they have really suffered under the GST and that they did not receive some of the offsetting benefits, such as huge tax cuts, in the tax package as did middle-income earners or two-income families. They have really felt the pressure. It has been recognised in community debates and in published polling that people on fixed incomes have suffered. It has affected their view of the government, their view of the GST and the tax package in general.
This measure by the government is obviously an attempt to deal with the politics of that situation and in some way to provide more compensation. Although the government does not say that this is GST compensation, everybody else in Australia—apart from government spokespersons—acknowledges that it is GST compensation, which has had to be legislated because of the impact of the GST on the lives of those on fixed incomes and pensions and because of the resultant political heat the government has felt from those groups in society. No doubt the Prime Minister and other ministers have had the same feedback I have had when they have spoken to elderly Australians.
Elderly Australians are particularly annoyed because the $1,000 pensioner bonus that was promised by the Prime Minister during and after the campaign did not materialise for many of them. Many of them have said to me, `I thought I was going to get $1,000.' Some got cheques for $1, which they sent back in disgust. Others got a couple of hundred dollars. I visited nursing homes where there was a great deal of disquiet as people received varying amounts in cheques forwarded to the nursing home where they reside. There were arguments and concerns about the differing amounts paid to people and about the failure to meet expectations when people had budgeted for $1,000. There was a great deal of upset and anger that it had not been delivered.
As we now know, 40 per cent of those aged over 60 got nothing, and most of them expected the $1,000 bonus. The government has gone some way to try to recover its ground with this $300 payment to pensioners. Labor support that measure because it is in part recognition of the impact of the GST on pensioners and recognition that their compensation package was inadequate. But, when asked to comment on the budget in the last day or so, many pensioners have said that they want to know where the other $700 is, and others have wanted to know why it was suddenly $300.
It is interesting to try to understand how the government arrived at the amount of $300 and how a one-off payment of $300 somehow compensates people for the GST. I think the point Senator Ludwig made is the key point, and it is the point pensioners have been making to me in the last couple of days about the budget—the GST goes on forever but the compensation is a one-off payment. I think that is why many of them are not quite as grateful as the government might have expected. They wanted an adequate compensation package that dealt with the ongoing impact of the GST; instead they will get a one-off payment of $300 to try to bribe them to change their view about the adequacy of the compensation. Pensioners know that the compensation is inadequate. While the $300 will be a help, it will not solve the basic inequity of the GST and its impact on those on low and fixed incomes. I do not think it will change their minds about the efficacy or the fairness of the GST.
One of the issues I want to particularly mention in my remarks today is the concern I have about the lack of social equity in the treatment of those on age pensions and those on disability pensions. I think there has been quite a deal of reaction in the community about this package and about what it means for people on DSP. I think there has been some concern more generally from people who have had the package oversold to them. When they ring the hotline and get more information, they realise they are not going to be beneficiaries of some of the largesse that the package seemed to indicate. I know there was an argument in the other place about a footnote. I do not want to go into that. The reality is that a lot of people had the impression that they were going to get some tax reductions and some benefits that it appears they will not now get.
The most important point I want to make is about people on disability support pensions. I think for them the argument about GST compensation is the same or stronger than for those on age pensions. These are people trying to support themselves on a low fixed income who suffer from often quite serious disabilities. They have the same problems that pensioners do in surviving in the face of the GST with the increase in their living costs and the impact of the GST on all the goods and services they purchase. But people with a disability are larger purchasers of services. There have been a number of research projects undertaken which prove that the impact of the GST has fallen harder and has disproportionately affected people on disability support pensions because the costs of disability have risen as part of the impact of the GST.
Despite the government's attempts to exclude a number of areas such as health costs from the impact of the GST, people on disability support pensions know that they are paying GST on aids and services to assist them to get through life, to try to live as normal a life as possible every day. For instance, one of the issues that is raised with me now is things like batteries for battery operated wheelchairs. People are paying enormous GST costs on replacements for those sorts of things. These are absolutely essential to their daily life, their mobility and their ability to participate in society, yet these are additional costs that the GST has imposed on them. It is those people who are really feeling—like the age pensioners—the full impact of the GST. It is seriously affecting their standard of living and their ability to participate in society.
They have not shared in the largesse that the government saw fit to bring about in the budget. The Treasurer said, `This is not GST compensation.' He said that this is about allowing those people on pensions who have been doing it tough to share in the economic good times and benefits of what he claimed was good economic management. But he has said to the disability pensioners, `You do not get to share. You are not deserving; you are the undeserving.' The age pensioners are the deserving poor; the disability pensioners are the undeserving poor. What is the rationale for this? What is the social equity at the basis of this? There has been no explanation given. Those people on DSP—many of whom have contacted my office and other parliamentarians' offices in the last couple of days—are very upset about the fact that not only they were not able to access the payment but also it reflects the attitude the government has to them and to their needs and circumstances that have arisen as a result of the GST. That is a very important issue that I wanted to highlight today—the impact on those on DSP and also on carers.
Carers are another group who are excluded by virtue of this government decision. They cannot understand why their worth was not recognised, why the disadvantage they have suffered as result of the GST was not acknowledged, and why they have not shared in the economic largesse that the Treasurer sought to bestow on age pensioners. None of this is an argument against age pensioners receiving the bonus, because it seems to me the case is very strongly established that the GST compensation was inadequate. We have their disquiet and anger about the failure to deliver the $1,000 bonus and then we have their anger at the clawback of the two per cent of the pension increase which occurred in the last adjustment. Those two events were signals to aged persons in Australia that the government was not interested in them and was not concerned about their welfare but was being, in Mr Stone's words `mean and tricky' in its attitude.
I think this is an attempt to recover some of that political ground. The key point to make, while supporting the bonus, is that it does not structurally affect the impact being imposed on pensioners and those on fixed and low incomes as a result of the GST. While the $300 will help in a one-off instance, the fact is that the GST will go on forever. The inadequacy of their compensation is now structurally entrenched, and their disadvantage will continue to be felt unless more fundamental changes are made.
I do not want to talk too much about some of the other measures. I know we have given a commitment to pass this legislation today, even though we have had very little time to look at it. I think some of the details are only now coming to light, but we have given an undertaking to ensure the passage of the legislation and to ensure that pensioners have the opportunity to access the payment as soon as possible. We will certainly be honouring that.
I note what Senator Schacht and Senator Ludwig said about POWs. I went home last night and watched the Australians at War series on ABC television—an example of good local production, Senator Alston. It is an excellent program. The focus last night was on the Second World War and the experiences of Australian servicemen in the Pacific region and of those held captive as POWs by the Japanese. It certainly brought home again—if one needed to be reminded—the horror of their experience and the terrible conditions under which they lived. I have a friend who was a POW in Changi who unfortunately died a couple of years ago. The impact it made on those men's lives is incalculable. Certainly any measure by the Australian community to recognise their suffering and their service is welcome.
I want to reiterate that in supporting this measure we have some concerns about those who have been excluded from the benefits of additional GST compensation. Those who are equally deserving of assistance, such as disability support pensioners and carers, have missed out. I express some concern about some of the misinformation on who will get access to health care cards and tax rebates and the implication that somehow some of the people who are retirees but who are not yet 65 would benefit from these measures. Apparently they will not. Already I think there is some anger in the community about how some of those people have been treated, because the initial sell indicated that those people would receive the benefits, and now they are finding out that they will not. There are a whole range of issues like that. But, as I said, the Labor opposition announced very early on that we would support the measures in order to provide as much relief as possible, as early as possible, to those suffering as a result of inadequate compensation for the GST. 
In that light, I want to indicate that there is a foreshadowed second reading amendment from Senator Bartlett, which I gather he will be moving shortly. I agree with every word—but I will not be voting for it, despite expressing some of the sentiments that I have expressed in my remarks today. I agree with most of the sentiments in it, but the reality of the politics of the time is that we have agreed to pass these bills today in order for them to be enacted and the payments made. As a result of that, we have agreed not to move amendments or to use any procedural devices such as committee inquiries or other such things to delay passage. The support of a second reading amendment would only do that and would necessitate them going back to the House of Representatives et cetera. I think second reading amendments are a device that is sometimes overused to make a political point. I accept it is a useful vehicle for Senator Bartlett and the Democrats to express their concerns on these bills—most of which I agree with—but the Labor opposition have given their commitment to the government and to the Australian public to ensure these bills are passed today and we will not be supporting that second reading amendment. As I say, it is not a philosophical thing but a practical decision about ensuring quick passage. With those remarks, I thank the Senate for its indulgence and reiterate that the opposition will be ensuring passage of the bills today. ",SENATE,<title>COMPENSATION (JAPANESE INTERNMENT) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-05-24,"—I speak on behalf of the Australian Democrats to the Compensation (Japanese Internment) Bill 2001, the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (One-off Payment to the Aged) Bill 2001, the Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Further Assistance for Older Australians) Bill 2001, and the Taxation Laws Amendment (Changes for Senior Australians) Bill 2001. It should be noted that the Senate is being extremely cooperative in enabling the very prompt passage of these bills because we support the measures contained in them. However, I think it is an action that is occurring only because of the insistence of the government. It should be noted that cooperation is being provided, and the government should remember that for any other times when it likes to try to generate some myth about Senate obstruction. I think the Senate is being exceptionally cooperative. It is also worth noting, particularly with measures of this size, that rushing things through is not necessarily wise public policy when you are dealing with payments through the social security system to large numbers of people. There is always a risk if things are rushed through of glitches being contained therein. Certainly any support the Democrats give to these bills is conditional on the recognition that glitches that may be contained in the bills are solely the fault of the government because of their insistence on rushing these measures through.
The four bills deal with a range of measures that were only announced a couple of nights ago in the government's budget. Whilst they are positive measures, I think the message underpinning them is an attempt to repair some of the damage that the government have caused through a range of their policies over the less than six years that they have been in government. I will speak specifically to a few of the measures in the bills. Firstly, the one-off payment to the aged is to be made to those people who, as of last Tuesday, have reached age pension age and are receiving a social security pension or benefit or service pension and also to those older Australians who are self-funded retirees outside the tax or social security system. The intent is for it to be paid by 30 June this year. The enormity of the administrative task for Centrelink within such a short time frame constitutes an admirable goal and one which the Democrats certainly hope will be efficiently carried out by Centrelink. 
As an example of the potential problems that can arise, the Democrats have only recently learned that up to a six-month delay is being experienced by Centrelink in transferring people from the disability support pension to the age pension once they reach age pension age. We understand from constituents that what used to be a standard procedure has, in recent times, in some cases taken several months. We certainly hope that nobody gets caught in a no-man's land in the situation where they are of age pension age but the Centrelink record has not been updated accurately to record this fact. We hope they will not be disadvantaged by any delays or be unable to receive that bonus. I am sure that all efforts will be taken to ensure that nobody misses out. Again, it simply shows the sorts of glitches that can arise. I am certainly not in any way wanting to criticise Centrelink staff. They are dedicated and do a huge job in an environment that is significantly underresourced. A component in the budget providing more staff in that area is a recognition that Centrelink have been underresourced in the staffing area. They will be making nearly two million payments available in less than six weeks. We must ensure that we are not at the risk of the sorts of inaccuracies that were identified in the recent Australian National Audit Office performance audit of Centrelink's assessment of age pensions, which noted error rates of 13.5 per cent. It would be a pity to impose any level of inaccuracy at all, let alone levels of inaccuracy of that size on payments to nearly two million Australians.
The Democrats do not oppose the $300 payment, but it must be pointed out that this payment of $600 million in one month is only marginally less—about $170 million less—than the entire net four-year budget funding allocated to the whole welfare reform program. The mockery that welfare reform was to be the centrepiece of the budget is further enhanced by the fact that, whilst more than $600 million is being paid to older Australians in one month, only $76 million is being spent over the next 12 months on all of the welfare reform measures. The one-off payment, whilst not undeserved by older Australians, totally disregards the needs and financial difficulties of all other Australian income support recipients, including the unemployed, sole parents, the disabled and students, many of whom are obliged to survive on income support levels that are lower than the age pension. We certainly do not begrudge the payment, but it needs to be pointed out that the fact the payment is being made is a recognition that many older Australians have been struggling with extra hardship in recent times due to a range of things. Not surprisingly, the opposition is focusing on the GST but, as I indicated in my second reading amendment, there have been a range of government cutbacks, increases in petrol prices, user-pays charges, deregulations and privatisations, all of which have had impacts on age pensioners as well as others.
The key point is that these are having impacts not just on older Australians but also on people throughout the community. I think disability support pensioners and age pensioners are experiencing equal difficulties and hardships. There is no extra assistance for disability support pensioners either through this payment or through other measures in the budget, and there has been a lack of acknowledgment on the part of the government of the extra hardship that that part of the community also feels at the moment. This can only strengthen people's cynicism that this measure is for electoral purposes and is not a serious policy attempt to address the areas of greatest social need. Disability pensioners have no extra income and they do not have any extra assistance in this budget, but they often have extra costs as a consequence of their disability. This again highlights the things that were not in the budget. Aspects of the McClure welfare reform review were not picked up by the government. The review recommended providing extra specific assistance for disabled people in recognition of some of the extra costs that the disabilities can impose upon them.
The Democrats appreciate and acknowledge the contribution older Australians have made and continue to make to society. Indeed, through their efforts many are able to fund their own retirement, albeit at a low or modest level, and it is this group which receives the benefit of the one-off payment of $300. The government is ignoring the reality that disability support pensioners suffer from the impact of government policies and GST price rises in the same way as pensioners and that, because of their disability, they are less able to participate economically in many cases. The financial disadvantage of a 65-year-old Australian should not be worth more in compensation than that of a 55-year-old disabled person, particularly one who will not have access to superannuation because they have not been able to compete in the employment market.
I have circulated a second reading amendment on behalf of the Democrats, which I am disappointed to hear that the ALP will not support. I do not understand the procedural argument there. I did not see why moving this amendment should delay passage of this bill one way or the other. It should not hold it up at all. All it will do is more firmly express the Senate's view that the needs and financial difficulties of other income support recipients are being ignored by this government and have been ignored in the overall budget. I will press this amendment. I move the second reading amendment on behalf of the Democrats:
At the end of the motion, add:
		“But the Senate is of the view that the making of the one-off payment only to Australians of age pension age:
	(a)	disregards the needs and financial difficulties of all other Australian income support recipients including unemployed, sole parents, the disabled and students, many of whom are obliged to survive on income support levels less than the age pension;
	(b)	ignores disability support pensioners in particular, who suffer the same impact of GST increases and market force price increases, for which the GST compensation was inadequate, and who, because of their disability, are unable to participate economically; and
	(c)	further disregards the disadvantage suffered by older unemployed Australians on income support, who have not reached age pension age but who have needs and financial difficulties identical to Australians of age pension age”.
I will now turn to some of the other legislation. The Family and Community Services and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Further Assistance for Older Australians) Bill 2001 has three principal elements: exempting superannuation as an assessable asset from the social security means test for people aged between 55 and the age pension age, extending payment of the telephone allowance and increasing the income limits for qualification for the seniors' health card. That is another area where the government is painting something as a major initiative, a significant reform and a great commitment, but it is simply repairing the damage that it has caused in the past.
The measure to treat superannuation as an asset for unemployed Australians when they reach the age of 55 was introduced by the government in their first budget. The outcome since that time, since 1997, has been that, for many unemployed persons 55 and over, dependence on government and income support was possible for only 39 weeks, notwithstanding that their average duration of unemployment is around 104 weeks. Thereafter, any superannuation or rollover assets they had put aside for their retirement were taken to be assessable assets, and this frequently resulted in the cancellation of entitlement to an allowance. It had the further effect of forcing a person in receipt of Newstart or any other income support payment to approach their superannuation fund for the release of an income stream for current living costs, even though they wished to continue to work. They were not able to make further contributions to the fund if they subsequently found a job. So it was simply not consistent with the policy objective of maximising financial independence. Superannuation has been promoted as the 21st century savings vehicle for retirement, and the opportunity of adding any more savings to a superannuation fund was relinquished once and for all once the superannuation fund was opened to provide an income stream.
Given the relatively tight level of the assets test, many individuals have been financially very disadvantaged by the assessment of their superannuation. This cut across the advantages that could be gained by maintaining and adding to their savings in the super fund until retirement. It has been a poor retirement income policy. It has had bad effects. The Democrats are pleased that the government has reversed it, but again it is simply to repair the damage that previous policies have caused, as is the $300 payment, which is an attempt to try to alleviate some of the hardship already caused by this government and its policies. Just putting back what you have taken out can hardly be seen as a great leap forward. Nonetheless, we obviously support the reversal of negative policy decisions and will support this measure.
It is worth noting, similarly, that the largest single expenditure item in the so-called welfare reform package—the introduction of a working credits scheme—is a version of the earnings credit scheme that was previously in place but was removed by the government. Again, this simple action of repairing damage is being portrayed as a significant reworking and reform of a welfare system that does need significant improvement. Without doubt, there is a growing degree of hardship within the Australian community for a variety of reasons, many to do with the economic policy directions set by both the major parties in this place. We do need a fundamental shift. The budget has failed to deliver that, both in direct fiscal policy and in the broader policy framework.
The government supports measures to do with telephone allowance and measures which increase the income limits under which a person can qualify for the seniors health card. This will provide self-funded retirees on modest incomes with the opportunity to access a seniors health card. The Democrats note that it is a great pity that similar attention was not paid by the government in the budget to other disadvantaged Australians who, through no fault of their own, are particularly vulnerable to long-term unemployment or who, because of disability or significant social disadvantage, will be denied the ability to contribute to superannuation to attain low, let alone modest, levels of income in their lifetimes. The unacceptable admission and acknowledgment by the government that it is prepared to settle for an increase in unemployment must be pointed out and condemned repeatedly.
I would also like to speak on the Compensation (Japanese Internment) Bill 2001. Because we are debating all these bills together to enable them to be rushed through, I am not speaking as extensively as I would like on this particular bill. As the veterans spokesperson for the Democrats, I think it is important to acknowledge the value of this measure. It is a once only payment of $25,000 to various veterans and to widows or widowers of veterans, prisoners of war and civilians who were interned by Japan between December 1941 and October 1945.
It is appropriate to take the opportunity to acknowledge the more than 22,000 Australian men and women who were taken prisoner by the Japanese, some for up to 3½ years. These service personnel and civilians suffered in the most horrific conditions imaginable—indeed, probably conditions that are unimaginable to most of us. They endured starvation and extremely brutal treatment at the hands of their captors. They were forced into slave labour on projects like the Burma-Thailand railway. They were sent on forced marches, such as the notorious death march, during which more than 2,000 Australian and Allied prisoners of war died. The names of these areas—Changi and Burma—are synonymous with the horrors visited upon Australian prisoners by the Japanese during World War II. By the war's end, more than 8,000 Australian POWs, 36 per cent of those taken prisoner, had died. Of those that came home, today they are all over 80 years old, and only a little over 2,000 remain. They are currently dying at a rate of about 10 a week.
This measure is worth noting in terms of the value of perseverance for people. We are dealing with an issue which is close to 50 years old and which calls for special compensation and extra assistance for Japanese POWs, who have been around for a significant time. Many people over many years have been frustrated by the lack of action such as this by governments of both major parties, but perseverance has paid off in this case. The government is to be commended for this measure but, more particularly, the veterans, their supporters and their families, who have fought so hard for measures such as this, are to be commended. Their perseverance and persistence should also be acknowledged. Everyone in this place will be aware of the stories told by constituents—who are now mainly very frail—about the terrible time in Japan, and all members of the public will be familiar with the books, films and images from that time. It is often very hard for someone of my generation to comprehend the suffering that people went through. This is, for all generations, one small and significant way of acknowledging the courage and the experience of these people.
The unique nature of the Japanese internment of Australians and those of other nations has been recognised since the 1950s, when those who had been held became eligible for modest payments from Japanese assets made under the provisions of the 1951 San Francisco Treaty of Peace with Japan. In the intervening years, the RSL and former prisoners of the Japanese unsuccessfully pursued the issue of additional compensation with Japan. More recently, British, New Zealand, Dutch, American and Canadian POWs successfully campaigned for their governments to make similar payments to the payment contained in this bill.
The Democrats acknowledge that veterans of other campaigns were taken prisoners of war, and we are now making an exception for the Australian veterans who were held prisoner by the Japanese during the Second World War in recognition of the unique circumstances of their collective captivity. We support this bill in recognition of their unique ordeal. We particularly welcome the payment being extended to the surviving widows and widowers of former prisoners, acknowledging those who lost their spouses to the POW camps or who supported their partner on their return from the war.
Bearing in mind that many veterans, citizens and their widows are now aged and frail, the Democrats call on the government to provide the maximum level of assistance to enable claims to be made by entitled persons. Australians do owe a debt to those who went into captivity in South-East Asia and, whilst due administrative process must occur, the ability to claim entitlements must not be muddied by myriad complex obligations. I note some of the questions that Senator Schacht raised in his contribution and I hope that those are addressed by the government. I hope the extreme haste with which this measure is being introduced by the government does not lead to unintended glitches in the administration and distribution of this payment. We should all do what we can to prevent that from occurring.
I should note that, despite praising this measure, there are still other significant aspects and concerns from the veterans community which were not addressed by this government, particularly the ongoing insistence on treating veterans disability pensions as income under the social security income test for age pensions. That is one of the major concerns of the veterans community. It would have been, in a budget that was talking about welfare reform, the ideal time to address that longstanding anomaly. It is a concern of the Democrats that once again that has failed to occur. Nonetheless, we support the measures that are contained in these bills because the Democrats believe that in large part they are repairing damage caused by this government.

"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2001-05-24,"—I would like to thank senators for their contributions to the debate and thank them for the indications of support. Senator Bartlett said there were some questions put down by Senator Schacht, and I would like to briefly answer them. He asked first why the money for this measure had to be paid out this year. The answer is: to make the payments as soon as possible. He asked what the position would be if after many years a POW divorced his wife then remarried perhaps only for a short period. Is it the last wife who gets the $25,000 payment? The answer to that is fairly simple: a divorcee is not a widower. Divorcees are not eligible. He pointed out that the government establishes a precedent in having a stand-alone bill to pay non-veterans, and why couldn't the government use the same method to pay 400 civilian doctors and medical staff who were in Vietnam, as apparently the ALP have sought earlier. The answer to that is that the factual circumstances were totally different. There were no deaths amongst SEATO medical staff.
He then asked: how do we confirm that a person was a civilian internee; do they have to have been in Australia at the time of internment—for example, if the husband was an interned British citizen but the wife Australian? The answer is that Australian citizenship did not exist in 1949. The test in the bill is based on domicile in Australia immediately before internment. The domicile test is well known. It is based on an intention to remain indefinitely at a place. He also asked why the payment was applying only to POWs of the Japanese. They experienced a particular hardship. Those people suffered fairly unique ordeals, and that is clearly shown by the difference in death rates. The POWs that were interned in Japan had a death rate of 36 per cent, whereas those that were interned in Europe had a rate of three per cent. A dramatically different treatment was endured by the POWs in Japan, resulting in 36 per cent dying in captivity, whereas that rate was three per cent in Europe.
His last question was: why not exempt the payment from deeming? The answer to that is that the payment of the $25,000 will not be counted under the income and assets test. The investment of the $25,000 will be counted under normal rules in relation to the income earned from that investment, and that is the same treatment that has been given to other types of exempt income and assets, including other compensation payments under this legislation.
Coming back to the point of Senator Schacht's about the measures being delivered now, I repeat that of course we want the benefits to go out as soon as possible. This budget delivered the fifth consecutive cash surplus—the longest run of cash surpluses in about 30 years—and that enables us to make these payments. I am very pleased that opposition members support the passage of these bills. 
Briefly, on the matter of the new tax system, the government had a number of measures to assist older Australians, such as real increases in pensions and allowances; lower income tax rates; lower capital gains tax rates; one-off non-taxable bonuses of up to, depending on your position, $3,000; and refunds of excess imputation credits. That stands in stark contrast to the behaviour of the previous government who, when they increased wholesale sales taxes—usually after elections and without announcements—did not pay any compensation or assistance to pensioners and self-funded retirees.
 (Senator McKiernan)—The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Bartlett be agreed to.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2001-05-24,"—I asked a question in relation to the amendment yesterday, and I was hoping to receive a reply. Perhaps I can give a quick reminder. Although we support the amendment, the question went to 8A(3A) to ensure that, if there were a discharge of sewage from a vessel—which no-one would want to see—the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority would be able to board the relevant vessel and pursue an offence, and that offence would be held valid under any regulation. It goes to ensuring that the legislation passed in this house is appropriate. Hopefully, now that we have the relevant minister here, we will be able to get an appropriate response.
The second matter is really a pre-emptive one in relation to (3B) and one which exercised my mind. The bill talks about a penalty for an offence under the regulation, but it goes on to say that the regulation would not be able to provide penalties of imprisonment. I understand the import of that. However, what concerned me was whether there would be a default if the matter were brought as a complaint before a magistrate and the magistrate were to fine or otherwise deal with the person, what that default might be and whether the magistrate would be limited by (3B). If the magistrate were not limited and were able to implement a fine with a default imprisonment, notwithstanding (3B), I was concerned about whether the magistrate would feel constrained to have a levy or community order and whether that would be within their jurisdiction. If a warrant of execution were placed upon them to pay the fine, I wondered whether the magistrate would be limited by (3B) or find themselves held by the Penalties and Sentences Act in Queensland and be able to impose any penalty they saw fit—something which would escape the import of (3B). In other words, they might be able to get to the end result of providing a prison penalty, which is not contemplated by the legislation. The government has had overnight to consider the matter of (3A). I am sure the minister will be able to provide a short answer on (3B) as well.",SENATE,<title>GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2001-05-24,"—We have overnight taken further legal advice, and that advice is to the effect that the regulation is not inconsistent with the proposed regulatory power.

My amendment is to enlarge the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, but I want to follow up on Senator Hill's second reading speech by saying that I add my support to this legislation and to the tougher penalties that are involved in it. As a deterrent, they will help to protect the Great Barrier Reef in the future but will not be able to give total blanket protection against those who will do the wrong thing. My amendment aims to enlarge the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park by extending its boundary to the exclusive economic zone to the east. For those who may have looked at the map, that would extend the park by approximately tripling it in size. It would also have a monumental value added effect on the conservation values of the park. By extending the boundary of the park and giving it the least restrictive zoning, all existing activities will remain unaffected, with the exception of mining and mineral exploration.
A recent proposal by TGS-NOPEC for seismic testing for oil in the Townsville trough, 50 kilometres offshore from the Whitsunday section of the park, was referred to Senator Hill under the EPBC Act, and he very wisely moved to stop that. The proposal had drawn strong public opposition, and the Queensland government also opposed it. There was concern that it would not only have a detrimental effect on marine life in the surrounding area but also pave the way for further oil production activities. The concerns about mining and seismic exploration focus primarily on the potential impact on the reef of incidents in extreme weather events—which are likely to become more intense and frequent through climate change—as well as on the potential impact of seismic exploration on the migration of whales and other marine mammals.
In other parts of the world, oil spills from wells have travelled over 1,000 kilometres and have caused serious environmental damage. Given the prevailing onshore winds off Central and Northern Queensland for most of the year, a major oil spill from any part of the Australian waters on the seaward side of the area would pose a major threat to significant and substantial areas of the reef and the industries that depend upon it. A recent spill in the Galapagos Islands off Ecuador demonstrated the inability of the petroleum industry to guarantee the safety of these areas against the impacts of its activities.
At the time of the seismic exploration proposal, there were public calls from environment groups like the Australian Conservation Foundation and from Queensland groups for a more permanent solution to ensure the protection of the conservation and economic values of the reef—specifically, to instigate a legislative prohibition on any oil exploration and development in Australian waters to the seaward side of the region. There has been little exploration in the area to date, as it is generally not considered to have high geological prospectivity for petroleum, though there may be some gas prospectivity, and the extension of the boundary would not prevent further scientific research but it would give legislative backing to that concern that there be a prohibition on oil exploration and such things as seismic testing east of the reef.
It is a window of opportunity to protect the reef from mining exploration and activities to the east without infringing upon other activities, like fishing and tourism, and so on, if the park were to be given the least restrictive zoning, which is inherently recommended in the amendment. What a great opportunity to give added protection and kudos to one of the nation's most loved, most visited, most significant and iconic regions, the Great Barrier Reef. A national park extension would logically be followed by a world heritage nomination for that extension. I recommend this amendment to the Senate. In the run to the election, I say to Senator Hill that it would be a great opportunity for the government as well. It would not really be stepping on anybody's toes but it would get resounding support from the Australian community.",SENATE,<title>GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2001-05-24,"—The first point that I should make is that we have actually been expanding the park within the existing region. I am pleased that those expansions have taken place in the last 12 months. That has not been an easy negotiation with the Queensland government; nevertheless, it has been achieved. Senator Brown, however, is suggesting that the region be greatly expanded to presumably facilitate a further expansion, in due course, of the park within the region. The figures I have been given show that it would be an expansion of the region from some 345,000 square kilometres—so it is obviously a big region now—to 1,328,000 square kilometres. It would be over 3.5 times the size of the existing reef.
Not surprisingly, we think that that proposal for enormous expansion requires a little more consideration than has been given to it as an additional issue to this particular debate, which is principally about improving the management effectiveness of the existing park and improving the tools with which it can be effectively managed. I could talk about it for some time but, in terms of getting a better outcome for the park, I would prefer the bill to be carried and to get the new penalties into effect.
I am not saying that there should not be a debate for the future as to whether we have the boundaries right, but I am saying that I do not think now is the time for it and would respectfully suggest that there might be other avenues open to Senator Brown to cause that other debate to take place in a considered and scientific way and to see whether such a huge expansion is actually justified. On that basis, I cannot accept the amendment from Senator Brown, whilst I acknowledge his obvious good intentions in relation to it, and I trust that the Senate will nevertheless support the bill in order that the new penalties can be implemented as quickly as possible.",SENATE,<title>GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2001-05-24,"—On behalf of Senator Bolkus and the Labor Party, I would like to put a couple of points on the record. We recognise that the events in the Townsville trough last year did cause some considerable concern in the community and we also support the actions of the minister to stop that seismic testing in the Townsville trough. We also recognise that seismic exploration will potentially have an impact on the habitat of whales and other large mammals and that oil and chemical spills could have significant impacts on the Great Barrier Reef.
However, Labor are not convinced that Senator Brown's proposal about the extension of the park boundaries is necessary to protect the world heritage area and feel that, in the absence of a stronger case for the need for the extension, it is somewhat premature. It is a very large and significant addition to the park. We will not rule out this option at a later stage. We would like to see a more detailed examination of the implications of such an extension in terms of both the impact on existing activities and the protection of the reef in the long term. We would certainly consider any scientific advice or recommendations to extend the area of the marine park, but Labor cannot support the amendment at this time.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2001-05-24,"—The Communications and the Arts Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 amends aspects of several acts administered within the Communications, Information Technology and the Arts portfolio. The opposition supports the amendments to various acts that are contained in this bill. I would like to briefly describe the measures included in this bill according to the acts that are amended. The bill amends four acts: the Public Lending Right Act 1985, the Telecommunications Act 1997, the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999 and the Trade Practices Act 1974.
The first category of amendments relates to the Public Lending Right Act 1985, or the PLR Act. The PLR Act provides for a public lending right scheme that compensates authors, at least in part, for income lost by the free multiple use of their books in public libraries. In 1999, a departmental evaluation of the scheme made several recommendations, including the need to address the lack of clarity in definition and articulation of the scheme. Pursuant to that recommendation, this bill inserts a statement of objectives of the scheme into the PLR Act. The bill also clarifies the process of making final payments in respect of deceased authors under the scheme. Payments may be made to a prescribed person, which does not include beneficiaries. In this way, beneficiaries are not paid directly by the scheme; rather, payments go to the legal personal representative of the deceased. Since 1996, the PLR scheme has ceased making payments directly to beneficiaries. This amendment reflects that arrangement and incorporates it into the act. 
The second act amended by this bill is the Telecommunications Act 1997. Pursuant to existing section 315 of the Telecommunications Act, a senior police officer may request that a carriage service provider suspend the supply of the carriage service in certain circumstances. Those circumstances include where the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that an individual with access to that service has inflicted serious personal injury or threatened to kill or seriously injure another person, and suspension of the service is necessary to prevent the threat being made again. The carriage service provider may comply with the request but is not bound to do so. The proposed new sections provide that carriage service providers, their employees or agents will not be liable for acts or omissions done in good faith in compliance with such a request to suspend supply of the carriage service. Essentially, these provisions exclude the liability of carriage service providers for acts or omissions under this section of the act.
The third set of amendments in this bill amend the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999. This amendment simply changes a reference in the act to the Australian company number, or ACN, of the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman with a reference to its new Australian business number, or ABN. 
Finally, this bill amends the Trade Practices Act 1974, or the TPA. The bill amends Part XIB of the TPA, which contains the telecommunications specific regime and includes prohibition of anticompetitive conduct. In the case of contravention of the prohibition of anticompetitive conduct—or the competition rule, as it is commonly known—the ACCC is empowered to seek an injunction and issue a competition notice stating the contravention. Section 151ABQ of the TPA deals with advisory notices issued by the ACCC in conjunction with a competition notice. Advisory notices provide guidance on how the recipient can remedy its conduct so it is not contravening the competition rule. As the act presently stands, advisory notices may only be issued when the competition notice is in force.
Item 9 of this bill allows an advisory notice to be issued at the same time as, or at any time after, the issue of a competition notice. Item 18 of the bill allows the chairperson or a sitting member nominated by the chairperson to exercise the procedural powers of the ACCC when resolving telecommunications disputes by arbitration. This amendment enables the ACCC to overcome its present inability to exercise procedural powers if a sitting member is absent or not available. In conclusion, all of the amendments contained in the bill are sensible changes to the relevant acts. They address the various shortcomings with provisions of those acts that have been identified. The opposition supports the amendments.",SENATE,<title>COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2001-05-24,"—I thank Senator Bishop for his contribution. As he said, the Communications and the Arts Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 makes a series of minor but nonetheless important housekeeping amendments to a number of pieces of legislation.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2001-05-24,"—I indicate on behalf of the opposition that we will be supporting passage of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment Bill 2001.The bill is legislation that is required to overcome some problems that have arisen as a result of the High Court's decision in R v. Hughes. That case is quite well known to many members by now because, in that decision, the High Court found that there were situations where it was not necessarily constitutionally valid for Commonwealth officials and authorities to exercise powers and functions that may have been referred to them by the states. That has led to the necessity to amend this legislation—and I understand other pieces of Commonwealth legislation—to overcome that difficulty. The High Court decision is more detailed than I have just outlined, but this bill—as we are advised—will clarify the situation so that, where Commonwealth officials and authorities do exercise powers that have been referred by state jurisdictions, they will have Commonwealth authority to do so.
I would indicate that, on the basis that the legislation seeks to correct deficiencies arising from that case—and also to correct some other difficulties that have been discovered as a result of examining the legislation following the Hughes case—we are happy to support this bill. It is a technical bill in nature, and we support it.",SENATE,<title>AGRICULTURAL AND VETERINARY CHEMICALS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2001-05-24,"—I would like to thank Senator Forshaw for his contribution. As he said, the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment Bill 2001 addresses the implication of the High Court's decision in the Hughes case, which cast doubt on the duties, functions and powers of the Commonwealth authorities and officers within the National Registration Scheme for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals. The roles played by Commonwealth authorities and officers are critical for the effective operation of the scheme. It also addresses legislative gaps which have been identified in the conferral of state functions on Commonwealth authorities under the national registration scheme arising independently of the implication of Hughes.
The overall aim of the bill is to ensure the validity of the actions of the Commonwealth authorities and officers under the scheme as it presently exists. It does not make any substantive policy or operational changes to the scheme. It is supported by all states and territories. Corresponding state laws which validate the past actions of the Commonwealth authorities and officers will be enacted following the passage of this bill. Together these Commonwealth and state measures will ensure the national registration scheme continues to operate in a stable legislative framework, and delivers safe and effective usage of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. I commend the bill to the Senate.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2001-05-24,"—Senator Sherry asked me a question on the 22nd of this month, and I seek leave to incorporate a response to his question.
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
TREASURY
SENATE QUESTION
Senator Sherry asked the Assistant Treasurer, on 22 Tuesday:
Could the Minister explain why, in its year 2000 annual report, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority stated that it did not expect that the new standards for the insurance industry would be introduced until mid 2002, despite the fact that a review of these standards began in September 1999?
Senator Kemp:-The Minister for Financial Services and Regulation has provided the following answer:
On 2 November 2000 the Minister for Financial Services & Regulation announced that the Government would undertake the most significant reform of the Insurance Act 1973 (the Act), since its inception nearly 30 years ago. The proposals bring Australia's prudential regime for general insurance up to international best practice, consistent with the Government's financial sector reforms.
The Government expected that if all legislative amendments were in place by July 2001, the proposed new prudential arrangements would begin in July 2002. A transitional period of five years would be provided to general insurers before full compliance with the new regime was required.
Due to the fundamental and complex nature of the changes, the general insurance industry was widely consulted on the proposals and the new regime was road tested against historical data. The Government considered it important to have all the key issues identified, fully considered and comprehensively addressed. As a consequence, further work was required on the prudential requirements. Accordingly, the expected commencement date needed to be adjusted to 1 January 2003.
However, on 14 May 2001 the Government announced that it planned to bring forward the implementation of the new regime. It is now proposed to commence the new regime from 1 July 2002, and phase out the transition period by 1 July 2004. This brings forward the commencement of the full regime by three years. The industry fully supports the revised timetable.
The reforms require fundamental amendments to the Act. They will significantly increase the amount of minimum statutory capital held by the industry, improve the consistency and reliability of liability estimates as well as establish far more rigorous and transparent risk management systems within authorised general insurance companies.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Australian Prudential Regulation Authority: Insurance Industry Reforms</title>,Questions Without Notice,29,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2001-05-24,"—by leave—I wish to respond to an order made yesterday following a motion moved by Senator Conroy that, as the Minister representing the Treasurer, I table certain documents after question time today.
The documents requested relate to representations made since March 1996 by, or on behalf of, HIH Insurance Pty Ltd and all associated companies, to any minister or parliamentary secretary or his or her office, or to any agency of the Commonwealth in relation to the proposed amendments to the Insurance Act 1973 or proposals for the enhancement of prudential regulation of the insurance and finance industries.
I would like to make some initial comments about the breadth of the order and the context in which it has been made. In March this year, the New South Wales Supreme Court appointed a provisional liquidator to the HIH group of companies. In recognition of the extreme financial difficulties the collapse of the HIH group has caused for many people, the government recently announced a package of more than $500 million in hardship relief and has set up a hotline for those who seek to be considered for relief. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission is already undertaking an inquiry into the collapse. On Monday this week, the government announced that there will be a royal commission to investigate the matter thoroughly, the terms of reference of which are expected to be released shortly.
As for the breadth of the Senate order, it requires a search by government agencies, departments and ministerial and parliamentary secretaries' offices for documents dating back to early 1996, the time of the commencement of the Wallis inquiry. The documents sought are those received from, or on behalf of, HIH Insurance Pty Ltd and its associated companies. Even assuming a narrow interpretation of `associated companies', that is, companies that are controlled by HIH, I am advised that the search would need to encompass correspondence from approximately 280 entities. Assuming a broader interpretation of `associated companies', the search would probably need to encompass correspondence from a considerably larger group, possibly 300, 400 or even more. Factoring in the words `on behalf of' presumably adds to the list because it includes solicitors, accountants, industry groups and others that may have acted on behalf of any of these companies.
Clearly, the order will require an extensive search which will take a significant time and will use substantial government resources—finite resources—some of which could otherwise be used to protect the interests of people hurt by the HIH collapse. And all this was to be done by today. It is hard to believe that it was a serious request. In the circumstances, particularly given the current ASIC inquiry and the forthcoming royal commission, this request, I regret to say, seems to be nothing more than a political stunt by Senator Conroy. It is a cynical ploy designed to seek political point scoring opportunities, and it does nothing to assist those who have suffered from the HIH collapse. In the context that I have described, it can only be described as politically motivated and, in my view, it is irresponsible.
It is not appropriate to table documents which deal with matters that will be considered by the forthcoming royal commission—an inquiry, I point out, that has coercive powers of discovery and interrogation—or to permit the diversion of extensive public service resources to locate documents of the kind described, when these resources can certainly be better deployed elsewhere. All that, in the shadow of two inquiries that will extensively investigate the collapse of HIH and related matters, would not, in my view, be responsible or in the public interest. Therefore, I do not propose to authorise the resources necessary to respond to the Senate's order.",SENATE,<title>HIH INSURANCE</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,30,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2001-05-24,"— by leave—I do hope that the minister who has just made the statement and who now appears to be departing the chamber remains while the opposition makes a response to his comments, because this is a serious matter. Thousands of Australians have been damaged by the HIH collapse, businesses are facing bankruptcy and people are being badly hurt. I want to respond, however, to what the minister has said.
The first point that needs to be made is that, although the minister levelled his attack at Senator Conroy, the person who moved this motion, and described the motion as cynical and politically motivated, that was a diversion. The truth is that this is a motion of the Senate that was adopted by the Senate in a division yesterday. This is a decision by the Senate, not by any individual senator, no matter how a government minister might regard that person to be motivated. This is a decision by the Senate requesting the tabling of these documents, and it is a request of this chamber of this parliament representing the people of Australia to the executive wing of government to make documents available for public scrutiny. It is not good enough for the government to say to this chamber and, through it, to the people, `We shall not make those documents available.' That is what this minister has said today: `We shall not make these documents available.' That is offensive to the Senate and it is offensive to the people of Australia.
I now want to deal with the grounds upon which he has made that statement. Essentially, they come down to this: that the government has announced a royal commission into the collapse of HIH and for that reason it wants to give its efforts to that royal commission rather than divert its energies to making information that the Senate requests from it available to the Senate. That is not a substantial reason at all under any circumstances not to make the information available or under any test not to make the information available. It is true that the government has announced a royal commission. At this pointof time, we do not know what the terms of reference of that royal commission will be. We do not know, for example, whether the terms of reference of that royal commission will focus on the issue of the return to order that the Senate has requested. There is no guarantee in the minister's statement that the royal commission's terms of reference will in fact cover the area that we have requested documentation from.
One has to be very suspicious about this government. It is not for nothing that the President of the Liberal Party, Shane Stone, describes it to the Prime Minister as mean and tricky. It is not for nothing that the President of the Liberal Party says that. And if the Liberal Party President is saying that to his own Prime Minister, we are entitled to be somewhat suspicious as well about the government's motivation here, because this return to order requests papers that may have been sent between the government and HIH on the issue of political donations. I do not know whether the government, in its royal commission terms of reference, is going to examine the issue of HIH's political donations to the Liberal Party. The fact that there is no guarantee from the minister today but an assertion that the royal commission will examine this issue is no assurance to the opposition that the royal commission will examine this issue—political donations between HIH and the Liberal Party. That is the first point.
But in any case it needs to be said that the proceedings of a royal commission are not sub judice. Criminal proceedings in a court of law are sub judice, but the proceedings of a royal commission are not. There is no reason why this chamber, which is elected by the people of Australia, should not exercise its rights on their behalf to inquire into a matter of national public importance that is damaging thousands of Australians and sending companies to the wall—there is no reason. In fact, on the contrary, you can make a strong case why it is our duty, as elected representatives of the people, to inquire into a matter of such major public importance as that.
The other issue is political donations. Are we being mischievous? The minister seems to think so—he has accused Senator Conroy of being cynical and politically motivated about this return to order. The implication is that there is no smoking gun and that this is simply mischief by the parliament to create grief for the government. Let us look at that proposition. These are the facts of the matter: the chief executive of HIH, Mr Ray Williams, and HIH as a company are among the biggest single donors to the Liberal Party of any company in Australia. They donated $650,000 to the Liberal Party over the last five years—more than half a million. They are a significant donor. That is an established fact—we know it to be true because of the public disclosure records.
We also know that it is true that the insurance industry, when making representations to the government about the nature of government regulation for this industry—the industry led in these talks by HIH—sought from the government a commitment to putting the onus on the industry for self-regulation; that is to say, they asked the government to impose light regulation on them, promising the government that they would regulate themselves. They asked the government to stand back, saying that they would impose their own regulations. That is a fact. That is what the industry is on the public record as saying, that is what the government has said, and it is the justification for the government's imposing very light regulation on the industry and enabling the industry's wish of self-regulation to be pre-eminent.
But we also know that the regulatory authority, APRA, when confronted with the collapse of HIH, said publicly—after all, it is an independent authority—`We had insufficient powers to detect this collapse in advance and insufficient powers to do anything about it when occurred.' The industry sought from the government light regulation—not sufficient powers—with an emphasis on self-regulation. The regulatory authority says, when the collapse occurs, `We did not have the power to detect it in advance or prevent it.'
It is reasonable, therefore, to ask: was there any influence bought by the $650,000 party donations over the last five years by HIH to the Liberal Party that caused the government to require that the regulator did not have sufficient authority to detect malfeasance in this case? The return to order that we have sought—the documents that we have sought in this chamber—would reveal whether or not there is a paper trail that establishes innocence or culpability on behalf of the government.
When the facts are as clear as that and when the government declines to table the documents, you ask yourself this: if they have nothing to hide, why are they not tabling the documents? The old saw here is, `If you have nothing to hide, hide nothing.' If there is a reason for dispelling the suspicion that is reasonably held in these circumstances, dispel it—prove your case, put the documents down and get rid of the suspicion and let us concentrate on other, more constructive areas of parliamentary responsibility. But if there is not, do what you are doing now. I say through you, Madam Deputy President, to the government: do not put the documents down and use the specious explanation that there is a royal commission to justify your not tabling those documents.
This does smell like a cover-up. The quickest way that the government can remove that odour is by coming clean. If it does not, then the stink will get worse. If in the royal commission's terms of reference, which we are today advised will be imminently tabled and made public, there is not a term of reference that requires Their Honours who will inquiring into this matter to examine the link of political donations to the issue of the collapse of HIH, then we will come back to this chamber and we will again seek the tabling of these documents because the cover will then be blown. Remember: the excuse today is, `There will be a royal commission that is going to look into that, so you don't look into it.' But if the royal commission terms of reference do not look into it, then that cover is blown, that excuse is null and void and there is no defence. The government then has to come clean and table the documents.
Let me just mop up some of the other detail that the minister has used as an excuse on this occasion. He, in what was a slender explanation, flimsily based, spent an inordinate amount of time in the short time he made available for himself on the argument that the breadth of the order we seek requires a diversion of resources and effort by the department at a time when the department is gearing up for a royal commission and that therefore we are somehow artificially interfering with the department's responsibility. The first point I make is this: the department is responsible, through the minister, to the parliament and the parliament is asking for these documents. In any classic definition of the department's responsibility, it certainly is to this parliament. But leave that aside for the moment.
The minister said that in a narrow definition of HIH and its associated entities there would be up to 200 entities and, in a broad definition of HIH and its associated entities, there would be up to 400 entities. The implication is that that is a huge task. As an aside, that one company can trade with about 200 associates that all hark back to it as the principal company or up to 400, albeit they be legal advisers and so forth, is a pretty revealing comment on the type of company organisation that goes on in this industry sector. But it is not as if departmental records on these issues are hard to come by. The department, if you believe the minister, is getting these records together in any case for the royal commission. Most of the incoming correspondence of departments is tabulated and available by pressing a switch on a computer to get an immediate print-out. This is not a huge task, although the argument is that 200 or 400 is unfair. In this electronic age—the age of IT and record keeping in cyberspace—with a flick of a switch, you can get most of this information.
As far as departmental resources are concerned, I have to some extent covered them. But here is the trap the minister has set for himself: he has said that we cannot have this information because of the royal commission. The implication is that if departmental resources are being—to use his word—diverted, then this information is not being acquired by the department for the royal commission, which does lend support to the conclusion that maybe it is not in the terms of reference of the royal commission. If departmental resources are being organised to serve what will be the terms of the royal commission, then this information is not a diversion of resources and this material should be available.
I conclude by saying that it is offensive to the Senate that the government should deny its request. It is even more offensive to the Senate that the government, in doing so, should select one senator and accuse him of base motives, when he is acting in the public interest. In any case, it is not up to him; it is a matter for the Senate. 
We are asking for a narrow band of documents that relate to political donations from HIH to the government, and the government is refusing to make them available. This does smell of a cover-up, because it is unlikely that the royal commission will actually investigate this area—after all, the government is going to appoint it and determine its terms of reference. 
But I do leave this before the chamber, and mark this spot: if the terms of reference for the royal commission do not adequately examine this matter, we will seek these documents again and we will press our demand. The quickest way the government can avoid us doing that and turning this into a major parliamentary debate is by including in the terms of reference an examination of political donations, confidence buying and so forth in the commercial sector of this industry. This is the biggest corporate collapse in Australian history. Thousands of Australians are hurt, businesses are going to the wall—and the buck stops with this government.",SENATE,<title>HIH INSURANCE</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,30,1
"Watson, Sen John",LP,2001-05-24,"—by leave—I have listened very carefully to both sides of the HIH debate. I am very pleased that Senator Cook has realised the enormity of the Senate request and virtually acceded, with some qualifications, to the position of the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp. While I am never one to query the orders or resolutions of the Senate, given the enormity of the issue, the hundreds of companies involved and the thousands of files that would have to be traversed very carefully—simply because there are tremendous consequences in missing one letter in so many thousands of files—I think the time frame for the request from the Senate is quite unreasonable, particularly given the huge demand it would place on the officers of ASIC and staff of HIH. 
In any company collapse there is always a loss of skilled staff. I would like to pay tribute to the professional manner of the investigation conducted by ASIC. I think ASIC have jumped onto this investigation very quickly. They have applied an enormous amount of resources to the inquiry, and their investigations are now well under way. 
We senators have to ask ourselves: how many inquiries do we really want in relation to one particular entity, HIH? True, it is the second largest general insurer in Australia and it has failed. It is a massive loss, and thousands of people right across Australia have been hurt. The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services actually deferred hearing from Mr Knott of ASIC and APRA until 12 June because we felt earlier that the first priorities were to get payments out, to get a resolution with the insurance companies as to how best to pick up the problems and to get some sort of justice for all those people who are so adversely affected. 
ASIC must continue its investigation with all the rigour that is required, and adequate resources appear to have been given to this investigation. There will also be an additional inquiry conducted by a royal commission. The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services has also an oversighting role. I know the Labor members on that committee are very anxious that there is a parliamentary input. So we have to be very careful about using scarce resources to give virtually the same or similar information to a whole host of separate inquiries. Problems could develop in terms of the interpretation given to each inquiry. I now congratulate Senator Cook on his recognition of the fact that it is going to be a difficult exercise to get the relevant information and for saying that he will wait and maybe look into it at a later date. I ask all senators to consider the enormity of the issue and the extreme pressure that is going to be placed on the resources of ASIC.
I would also like to pay tribute to a man who has come under a bit of fire lately, Mr Knott. I note his resignation as a director of APRA; that is appropriate. It is equally important that he continues as head of ASIC, because he has certainly got his finger on the pulse and understands the task. Under the circumstances, we have to keep ASIC fully resourced and focused on the enormity of the problem it faces and focused on bringing out a report and working closely with the royal commission.

Parliament House
CANBERRA  ACT  2600
Dear Senator McKiernan
I refer to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee inquiry into the following:  the need for privacy legislation for the private sector; the appropriateness of using the Privacy Commissioner's National Principles for the Fair Handling of Personal Information as the basis for a co-regulatory scheme; and the appropriateness of the provisions of the Privacy Amendment Bill 1998 which was passed by the House of Representatives on 1 April 1998.  As you know, the Committee tabled the Report of its inquiry, titled “Privacy and the Private Sector” on 25 March 1999.
The recommendations made by the Committee in its Report have been addressed publicly by the debate and enactment of the Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Act 2000. As you may be aware, I have proposed that the Privacy Commissioner conduct a review of the operation of the private sector privacy legislation after two years.  
I am grateful for the contribution of the Committee on the issue of private sector privacy and took into account the issues raised in the Report in the development of the legislation.  
Yours sincerely

Building Australia's Trade and Investment Relationship with South America
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE
The Government thanks the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade for the comprehensive inquiry conducted into Australia's trade and investment relationship with South America.  The report is a welcome and timely follow-up to the last report on South America by the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade in 1992.
The report makes thirty recommendations regarding Australia's trade and investment relationship with South America.  The Government's response to these recommendations is provided below.
List of Recommendations
Coalition Building, Economic and Regional Considerations
Recommendation 1
The Committee recommends that the Australian Government, along with the New Zealand Government, urge the Mercosur countries to reinvigorate the CER-Mercosur dialogue.
Australia has been active in putting forward initiatives for the dialogue.  However, progress has been modest.  The main problem is the heavy negotiating load with other external partners on the Mercosur side.  We have made some progress on technical issues (such as science and technology cooperation) and will continue to seize opportunities as they arise.  The CER-Mercosur dialogue will be examined in a major Government report by DFAT's East Asia Analytical Unit on business opportunities in Latin America. The report is due for completion in August 2001.
Recommendation 2
The Committee recommends that the Australian Government pursue as a priority the development of an Australia-Mercosur free trade agreement.
The Government closely monitors regional trade developments in Latin America in order to protect and advance our commercial interests.  The Government remains open to the idea of a regional trade arrangement with Mercosur and/or other countries in the region consistent with its policy that such arrangements would deliver substantial gains to Australia across all sectors which cannot be achieved in a similar timeframe otherwise.  However, at the moment, we can discern little interest on the Mercosur side which has, like ourselves, other priority countries/ regions for such agreements.
Recommendation 3
The Committee recommends that the Australian Parliament, under the Inter-Parliamentary Union, establish an Australia/Andean Community Parliamentary Group.
This is a matter for Parliament to resolve.
Recommendation 4
The Committee recommends that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, along with its portfolio partner Austrade, develop a strategy to establish Australia as a bridge to Asia for the economies of South America.
This is already a feature of trade development and promotion messages in Australia and in the portfolio's work in the region.
Building a Sound Trade and Investment Relationship
Recommendation 5
The Committee recommends that the Australian Government establish an Australia-South America Foundation.
The Government has announced the creation of a Council on Australia Latin America Relations (COALAR), aimed at strengthening ties between Australia and the countries of Latin America.  The Council will be established by mid 2001.
Recommendation 6
The Committee recommends that the Australia-South America Foundation be serviced by a secretariat located in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.
The Council on Australia Latin America Relations, referred to above, will be serviced by a secretariat in DFAT.
Recommendation 7
The Committee recommends that the Australian diplomatic missions in Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Venezuela and the consulates in Sáo Paulo, Brazil and Lima, Peru, promote the activities of the Australia-South America Foundation in South America.
We envisage our posts being involved in the promotion of individual programs and activities of the COALAR, such as exchanges of young business executives.  These activities would be in addition to the public diplomacy and trade promotion work already being undertaken by posts.
Recommendation 8
The Committee recommends that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, in cooperation with Austrade, form a South America Working Group to enable greater cooperation and information exchange between governments, both federal and state, business and business forums on the opportunities, activities, initiatives and developments in South America.
The proposed body being developed by DFAT in response to recommendation 5 above will facilitate greater cooperation and information exchange between government and business on opportunities in South America.
Recommendation 9
The Committee recommends that the Prime Minister visit the South American region.
The Government agrees that personal contact can contribute in an important way to building a sound trade and investment relationship.  Annual APEC economic leaders' meetings provide opportunities for regular contact at head of government level with Chile and Peru (as well as Mexico).  A visit by the Prime Minister to the South American region at a mutually convenient time would further contribute.
Recommendation 10
The Committee recommends that the visit of the Prime Minister to South America be followed closely by the Minister for Trade visiting the region accompanied by Australian business representatives.
Mr Vaile will visit the region when he chairs a Ministerial meeting of the Cairns Group due to be held in Uruguay in September 2001.  If time permits, he intends to visit other countries and consideration will be given to taking a business delegation with him.  Mr Vaile visited Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil and Peru in September 1999.
Recommendation 11
The Committee recommends that the Australian Government, in partnership with industry, establish an exchange program for young executives between Australia and the countries of South America.
DFAT and Austrade would promote this initiative through the Council on Australia Latin America Relations and the Australia-Latin America Business Council.  Such an exchange program has also been recommended as a cooperative project of the Forum for East Asia Latin America Cooperation.
Recommendation 12
The Committee recommends that, as an initiative of the Australia-South America Foundation, the Australian Government investigate the development of a program to provide the less developed countries of South America with the opportunity to capture the expertise and skills of people who have retired from the Australian workforce.
The Government agrees that it would be useful to be able to harness the skills and expertise of people who have retired from the Australian workforce, for example former Ambassadors/Trade Commissioners, in South America.  An example of where this is done successfully is the AESOP program, which places volunteers in developing countries in the Asia Pacific region.  (AESOP receives financial support from AusAID).  A similar program could be investigated by the COALAR.  However, like AESOP, it would need some government financial support.
Recommendation 13
The Committee recommends that the Australian Tourist Commission substantially increase its efforts in South America to capitalise on the tourism potential.
There are a number of factors which can assist in maximising tourism growth out of the South American market - marketing is one, availability of air services is another.  In terms of marketing, the ATC has been allocating resources to the development of Latin American markets since 1987.  Latin America is managed through the ATC's Los Angeles office and is part of the Americas region.  The USA and Canada accounted for 80 per cent and 15 per cent of arrivals from the region in 1999; Latin America accounted for 5 per cent, mostly from Argentina and Brazil.
While the ATC believes that the funding allocated to Latin America from the Americas regional budget is consistent with the outputs that can presently be generated from this region, the ATC does recognise the potential of the Latin American market in the longer term.  Accordingly, the ATC will continue to monitor developments to maximise its growth potential commensurate with its global budget.
Recommendation 14
The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs introduce the Electronic Travel Authority into Argentina, Brazil and Chile, followed by the other South American countries.
At present, the ETA is available to passport holders of 32 countries and locations.  The extension of the ETA to Hong Kong and Taiwan on 1 July 1999 represented the completion of the first stage of the ETA rollout.  The first stage rollout has meant that within a period of 4 years, some 9 million ETAs have been issued.  ETAs now represent between 80% to 90% of all visitor visas issued.  The ETA system is the most advanced and streamlined travel authorisation system in the world, with more than 70 airlines and over 300 000 travel agents worldwide currently able to participate in the system.  Against the background of this very rapid increase in the use of ETAs, the Government decided that there should be a period of consolidation whilst the system is fully bedded-down.
The Government considers that following this period of consolidation, other countries can be considered for ETA extension subject to two major factors:
that visitors from any proposed country should represent a very low immigration risk, particularly in terms of non-return rates; and
that the size of the visitor market from the proposed country should be sufficient to warrant ETA extension.  While the ETA has been extended to a number of countries which deliver very small numbers of visitors, each of these smaller source countries lies within or in close proximity to a much larger country or region where ETA has been extended (eg. The Vatican within Italy).  Because generally the same travel agents service these smaller countries, it was considered financially feasible to extend ETA to those countries at the same time.
With regard to the recommendation to extend the ETA to Argentina, Brazil and Chile, the Government notes that each of these three countries represents a relatively small number of visitors annually.  In 1999/00, there were 8561 visitor visas issued to Brazilian nationals (0.26% of total visitor visas issued), 6926 to Argentinians (0.21% of total visitor visas issued) and 2936 to Chilean nationals (0.09% of total visitor visas issued).
Of greater significance, however, is that non-return rates for visitors from Brazil and Chile are very high.  The non-return rate for Brazilian nationals rose sharply from 5.0% to 9.4% in 1999-00, while the rate for Chilean nationals remained very high at 12.1% in the same year .  The Government notes that this is between 4 to 6 times higher than the global non-return rate of 2.4% and between 5 to 8 times higher than the average non-return rate of visitors from all ETA countries.  Indeed, there are relatively few countries from which Australia receives more than 2000 visitors per year that have non-return rates greater than those of visitors from Chile and Brazil.
Given the relatively high non-return rates for Brazil and Chile, there is no case at this time for the ETA to be extended to these countries. The Government notes that the United States Visa Waiver Program and the Canadian Visa Exemption Program, the US and Canadian equivalents of the ETA, have not been introduced for these two countries.  The Government also notes that visitor visa grants to nationals of Brazil and Chile increased by 24% and 13.6% respectively in 1999/00.
The Government has had under examination for some time the case for extending ETA to Argentina, but at this stage has made no firm commitment to proceed.  The issue will be examined further.  In the interim, the Government notes that existing visa processing arrangements for Argentina are highly efficient and provide for a 24-hour turn-around for most applicants.  Visitor visa grants to Argentinians increased by 6.6% in 1999/00 over 1998/99.
Recommendation 15
The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs introduce a visa category that allows persons to be sponsored by Australian business to work not only in the company in Australia but to undertake formal study at the same time.
There is an existing range of visa options for people wishing to come to Australia for study and work purposes.
Student visas are available to genuine students who wish to come to Australia to study in full time courses registered on the Commonwealth Register of Intensive Courses for Overseas Students (CRICOS).  Students are permitted to apply for work rights after they commence their courses in Australia.  Work rights involve up to 20 hours work per week, but this should be incidental to the study component.
The level of work rights available to student visa holders is one of the most generous in the world.  The Australian overseas students industry recently rejected a proposal to increase the level of work rights available to overseas students.
An option available for Australian businesses seeking to sponsor a business entrant who also wishes to do some study is the Temporary Business (long stay) visa, subclass 457.  Visa holders under this subclass are not restricted from enrolling or participating in courses of study at any level in Australia.  Visa holders have as a mandatory condition (8107) that they must not change occupation or employer without the permission of DIMA, but this condition does not restrict access to courses of study.
Further visa options to combine study with other forms of activity include:
·	visitor visas where a tourist can undertake some study as part of the visit to Australia;
·	business visitor visas where a short term business entrant (less than 3 months) can undertake study in addition to business activities; and
·	working holiday maker visas where the entrant can combine a holiday with work and study.
Additionally, there are a number of permanent entry options available for businesses to sponsor overseas employees to work and study in Australia.  The Employer Nomination Scheme and the Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme allow employers to sponsor people from overseas to fill positions that cannot be filled from the local labour market.  If successful, the applicant and family are able to access Australian education in the same way as any other resident of Australia.
Recommendation 16
The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs revise its visa processing requirements in South America to streamline the process and reduce the compliance costs to applicants.
DIMA is required by the Government to achieve a balance between facilitating the Government's foreign policy/trade agenda whilst maintaining the strong focus on immigration integrity that the Government is committed to.  DIMA cannot and does not operate with only one of these two objectives in mind.  It must strike a balance.
The structure of DIMA's visa processing arrangements in all parts of the world are driven by the volume of applications and the level of immigration risk.  As a result, high volume, high risk countries such as China and India have seen significant increases in DIMA resources in recent years.  DIMA constantly monitors the emerging trends in application rates, processing arrangements and staffing in all parts of the world, including South America.
The volume of visa applications from South America has traditionally been low although immigration risk has been relatively high.  Increases in visa applications in 1999/00, however, suggest that a re-examination of DIMA's delivery structure in South America is appropriate. DIMA has, over the past twelve months, and in response to the concerns raised by the Committee:
·	considered a range of options for redistributing existing resources within the Region which would provide an opportunity for the Department to address the Committee's concerns as well as respond to emerging trends in South America. Several options for realignment of resources were explored, including establishing an A-based presence in Brazil (in either Brasilia or Sao Paolo), Buenos Aires and/or in Mexico City.  Taking into account staffing, security, accommodation, associated costs and workload business cases for the Region, it was decided to establish a DIMA A-based presence in Brasilia of two A-based officers. Both officers took up their positions in Brasilia recently;
·	appointed two additional Locally Engaged Employees at the Embassy in Brasilia;
·	considered the feasibility of cooperative arrangements with the Australian export education industry to provide more efficient student visa processing in the Region; and
·	considered the feasibility of locating a mobile visa processing resource in the Region.
APEC in South America
The Australian Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum (APEC) forum of 21 economies (including Chile, Mexico, and Peru) recognises the need for business people to move quickly in pursing trade and investment opportunities. APEC economies aim to make it easier for APEC business people to travel through the Region. In this regard, a significant recent initiative has been the development and implementation of the APEC business travel card scheme. This scheme provides pre-clearance for the holders of accreditation cards and access to priority processing lanes at airports of participating economies.  The travel card is valid for up to three years and provides for entry for up to three months on each visit.
Peru announced its decision to join the APEC Business Travel Card Scheme in August 2000, providing accredited Peruvian cardholders with streamlined entry to Australia.  There are now ten participants in the Scheme, including Chile and Australia.
Student visa applications from Colombia.
It is noted that at present there is no Australian mission (DFAT or otherwise) in Colombia.  This limits the range of visa processing arrangements that can be put in place.  The current arrangements require applicants to mail their applications to Santiago in Chile.
DIMA provided the Committee with a detailed submission on the costs associated with student visa processing from Colombia, broken down into various scenarios depending on the completeness of the initial application.  If an incomplete application is lodged, the DIMA visa processing office in Santiago will contact the applicant and request submission of the missing documents.  The applicant will then have to pay courier costs in addition to costs associated with lodging their application.
The current visa application charge is US$185 and DIMA understands that the usual cost of couriering documents one way is US$40.  Couriers are used for document security reasons and because postal services are known to be unreliable.  One well-known courier company offers a service whereby for a one-off fee of US$65, applicants can send all their documents to Santiago and have the passport couriered back to Colombia.  Student applicants are informed of this service in the student visa information package.
With respect to processing times, the processing of student applications is cyclical and geared to the commencement of the study year in Australia.  The average processing time for Colombian student applications decided in Santiago was 29 days for the 1999 calender year.  That is the average number of days between lodgement of the student visa application and finalisation of the case.
This processing time is subject to the time it takes to process larger numbers of student visa applications in peak processing periods which usually occur from late November through to early February and again in the middle of the calender year.  Processing times can be longer during such times, depending upon the number of applications lodged.
DIMA will continue to examine alternative service delivery options that would provide a faster and less expensive process from the perspective of applicants, but notes that there are very significant safety issues involved in locating any form of stand-alone operation (ie without DFAT support) in Colombia.  DIMA also notes that there is a very high level of detected fraud in the Colombian student caseload that makes significant improvements in processing times difficult to achieve.
Recommendation 17
The Committee recommends that the Australian Government reassess priorities for the negotiation of double taxation agreements and move to negotiate double taxation agreements with more South American countries.
A double taxation agreement was finalised with Argentina in December 1999.  The Government is close to finalising a double taxation agreement with Mexico.  The Government has approved the negotiation of a similar agreement with Chile.  (It should be noted however that Chile is a recent entrant into the field of double taxation agreements and has a long list of potential tax treaty partners, focussed on their South American neighbours and major trading partners in North America and Europe).
On 11 November 1999 the Treasurer, responding to the recommendations of the Ralph Review of Business Taxation, announced on behalf of the Government that priority will now be given to renegotiating Australia's ageing tax treaties with our major trading partners (in particular, the United Kingdom, the United States and Japan) and that the Government would also review its overall tax treaty policy to ensure that a greater focus is placed on the taxation of foreign source income.  The ATO's available tax treaty resources are currently fully occupied with implementing the Government's response to the Ralph recommendations.
While the Government is unable to support the Committee's recommendation to move to negotiate double taxation agreements with more South American countries at this stage, this would not prevent Australia from entering into such negotiations in the future, where that is in accord with Australia's interests.
Recommendation 18
The Committee recommends that the Australian Government give consideration to Australia becoming a member of the Inter-American Development Bank.
The Government acknowledges that there may be potential trade benefits to be derived by Australia through membership of the IADB .  We consider, however, that membership of any international financial institution (IFI) needs to be considered in a balanced way, taking into account all relevant factors, such as our already wide and existing commitments to other international and regional fora and where we are best placed to influence outcomes that are consistent with Australia's overall international objectives.  In this context, we are conscious of the need to achieve the greatest impact from the investment of our limited available resources.
The Government is also conscious of the current tight budgetary climate, particularly given the Government's overall fiscal strategy, and our increased aid focus on the Asia Pacific region since the Asian financial crisis, both directly (eg East Timor, PNG) and indirectly through our existing IFI shareholdings (eg IMF, World Bank, Asian Development Bank).  In this context, the Asia Pacific region remains a key priority for the Government in terms of our funding for, and activities in, the IFIs.
In light of these considerations, we do not believe that Australian membership of the IADB is warranted at this time.
Recommendation 19
The Committee recommends that AusAID provide a budget allocation for development projects in South America in cooperation with the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank.
The Australian overseas aid program is currently concentrated in the Asia Pacific, with selective involvement in South Asia, Africa and the Middle East.  In “Better Aid for a Better Future”, the Government announced that the focus of the Australian aid program would continue to be in our own region.  This regional focus enhances the effectiveness and efficiency of the aid program by concentrating AusAID's skills and resources in a smaller number of countries in close proximity to Australia.  On this basis, AusAID would not support a proposal to expand the aid program's focus to include Latin America.
As noted in the report, the Australian aid program has recently provided humanitarian and emergency assistance to Peru and Venezuela to assist with demining and the provision of medicine, bedding and clothing.  In 1998, Australia provided A$1 million for relief efforts in the wake of Hurricane Mitch.  The Government has said that it will continue to respond flexibly to such humanitarian and emergency relief situations within and beyond the Asia Pacific region.
Government Support for Australian Companies
Recommendation 20
The Committee recommends that the Australian Government provide the Australian mission in Caracas, Venezuela, with additional resources to allow an appropriate level of service and support for the development of Australian trade and investment interests in the markets of Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela.
DFAT and Austrade have agreed that formalised trade promotion training and support will be given to a nominated member of staff at the Caracas mission.
Recommendation 21
The Committee recommends that the Canada, Latin America and Caribbean Section of the Americas Branch in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade be realigned, with the Canada desk to be placed in another section.
The Executive Officer who handles Canadian affairs in the Canada, Latin America and Caribbean Section tends to work directly to the Branch Head and is, in effect, autonomous within the Section.  DFAT intends to retain the current arrangements.
Recommendation 22
The Committee recommends that Austrade examine the resources provided to the Americas regional office in Canberra and the level of information flow coming from the Trade Commissioners to harmonise more effectively its relationship with Austrade South America.
As a first step, Austrade's Americas Regional Office in Canberra has recently increased staffing to 3 people.  As well, the recently appointed Executive General Manager for the Americas is reviewing these issues in light of the Committee's report, and Austrade's Information Age project is examining possible improvements in both internal and external information flows.
Recommendation 23
The Committee recommends that Austrade, in consultation with its portfolio partner the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, implement an information exchange strategy between the partners to ensure greater awareness and knowledge of potential and available business opportunities for Australia in South America.
The Government agrees that the flow of information between DFAT and Austrade is vital.  This objective is at the heart of DFAT and Austrade's joint Latin American Action Agenda.   Information exchange was a major focus of the meeting of the Australian Heads of Mission in Latin America and the Caribbean in Buenos Aires in December 2000 in which senior Austrade representatives from the region participated.
Recommendation 24
The Committee recommends that Austrade review its user pay cost structure and introduce a concessional fee-for-service rate to assist small to medium enterprises to enter emerging markets.
Austrade services reflect the three different stages identified in the international business learning curve.  Austrade's services are designed to assist Australian companies move along the curve faster than normal, while also reducing the risks and costs associated with developing an export business.
Thus, Austrade's services are grouped into three broad segments: 
Tier 1: Seeking general information and advice about exporting: at the start, Austrade helps Australians thinking about export, by providing a range of general information and advice that will assist them in the decision-making process.
Tier 2: Selecting, understanding and entering new markets: when companies are ready to export, Austrade helps them select, understand and enter export markets, through focused advice and assistance in Australia and overseas.
Tier 3: Expanding overseas business: Austrade provides tailored assistance and strategic advice to existing exporters looking to expand their overseas business.
Austrade charges fees for Tier 2 (A$100 per hour first 10 hours, A$150 per hour thereafter) and 3 services (A$150 per hour), in accord with Government policy.  In practice, this Client Service Policy means that most Austrade services to small and medium enterprises are either free of charge, or else attract a subsidised fee.  In addition, Austrade fees can be usually claimed under the EMDG scheme, subject to the eligibility criteria.  Experience has shown that Austrade fees are normally only a small proportion of a small to medium enterprise's total costs of entering an overseas market.
Austrade therefore believes that there is a high degree of concessionality within the existing fee structure.  Nevertheless, Austrade has noted this recommendation and will take the Committee's view into account when next reviewing fee structures.  This will take place when the outcome of the Productivity Commission inquiry into cost recovery by Commonwealth agencies is known.
Recommendation 25
The Committee recommends that the Australian Government provide an additional budget allocation to assist the introduction of the concessional fee-for-service by Austrade.
Austrade believes that under its three-tier pricing structure a subsidy is already built into Austrade pricing
Recommendation 26
The Committee recommends that Austrade show separately the information on key performance indicators for South America in its Annual Report.
Austrade will examine the feasibility of including regional-level performance details in future Annual Reports.
Recommendation 27
The Committee recommends that Austrade implement a publicity strategy to raise the profile of South America within the Australian community as a potential export and investment destination.
This objective is prominent in DFAT and Austrade's current joint Latin American Action Agenda.  The portfolio was pleased with the results of the first “Latin America - Expand Your Horizons” nationwide seminar series in April 2000 and the second “Capture the Americas-Latin America” nationwide seminar series in March 2001. Both seminar series included Austrade Trade Commissioners from the region, DFAT representatives, key allies and exporters involved in Latin America.  The series profiled Latin America as a potential export and investment destination as well as highlighting some of the pitfalls exporters may experience when dealing with the region.
Recommendation 28
The Committee recommends that the Foreign Affairs and Trade Portfolio, as part of its Brazil sectoral papers series under the Latin America Action Agenda, prepare a paper on the services sector.
The publication will specifically highlight opportunities in the services sector.
Recommendation 29
The Committee recommends that Austrade improve the quality of its presentation at international fairs and expositions to ensure that Australia is properly promoted.
Austrade's presence at fairs and exhibitions is usually of a high standard.  An example from South America was the Austrade stand at Expomin in Santiago, Chile in May 2000.  There were in excess of forty Australian companies exhibiting and the Australian Pavilion was the fourth largest country pavilion after the USA, Canada and Germany.  The design and construction of the Pavilion cost USD30,000.  Australian exhibitors forecast new business arising from the trade show over the next twelve months in excess of A$17 million.  Eighty-five per cent of exhibitors rated the Pavilion design and facilities as excellent or very good; seventy-nine per cent rated Austrade's service on site as excellent or very good.
Nevertheless, Austrade notes the views expressed in evidence before the Committee and is putting in place procedures to ensure that the best practice standards demonstrated at Expomin are applied at all other Australian promotions in the region. 
Recommendation 30
The Committee recommends that EFIC actively participate in trade shows in South America focusing on the benefits over the long term rather than taking the short term outcome approach to participation.
EFIC will consider opportunities to participate in trade shows in South America as they arise, on their merits.  In consultation with Austrade and exporters, EFIC will consider participation taking account of all potential benefits of participation.

GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE REPORT OF THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON TREATIES - REPORT NO.32
Recommendation
“The Committee recommends that the Attorney-General and the Minister for Family and Community Services monitor the operation of the two child and spousal maintenance treaties to ensure that they operate in a fair and reasonable manner, without limiting the rights of custodial parents, non-custodial parents or children; or impeding the contact between non-custodial parents and their children. The monitoring should culminate in a comprehensive review of the operation of the treaties and their impact upon all parties three years after binding action is taken.  A copy of the review report should be provided to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties”.
Response
The Government welcomes the support by the Committee for accession to the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Decisions Relating to Maintenance Obligations and for the conclusion of the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of New Zealand on Child and Spousal Maintenance. The Government accepts the recommendation by the Committee that the operation of the two treaties should be monitored and that their operation and impact should be reviewed after three years.  This work will be undertaken jointly by the Attorney-General's Department and the Child Support Agency.  A copy of the report on the proposed review will be provided to the Committee.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reports: Government Responses</title>,Committees,31,1

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2001-05-24,"—Budgets are about choices. They are about a government's values and the priorities the government sets for them. You can tell everything about this government not so much by what is in these budget papers but by what is not. There is nothing in this budget to help ordinaryAustralian families. There is no relief from the GST for families facing financial hardship and nothing for small businesses badly hurt by this tax. There is nothing in health and education to attempt to repair our public hospital system or help our struggling poorer schools. There is little to help the jobless in the year that unemployment is expected to rise—in fact, this budget opens an even bigger divide between the rich and poor. And this budget proves that the government is determined to go ahead with the sale of Telstra against the wishes of Australians all around this country—it is right there in the budget papers.
This budget shows once again that the Howard government has stopped listening to people, that it is out of touch with what ordinary families want. You cannot blame people for thinking this budget is just a cynical exercise to try to buy votes from the elderly—from our older Australians who have been flattened by the GST. Soon most Australians watching this speech will be called on to vote in a federal election. We in the Labor Party are going to give people a real choice—a choice between a Labor government that wants to help people and that is on the side of Australian families, and an increasingly out of touch government interested only in trying to buy its way back into office. We will return to Australian values—decent standards in public hospitals, looking after our elderly in their need, making sure every Australian child gets a good education and maintaining living standards in the country as well as the cities. And, most importantly, we will look at ways to ensure a good future for our children in the knowledge nation. 
There is no reason why this country cannot be a place that invents and produces the best products in the world. Yet there is nothing in this budget to help Australia build a strong future, to give our talented young people the best education and training so they will want to stay here and develop ideas to make this country prosper. Instead, this budget confirms what Australians have long known: whatever John Howard gives people he will take away with the GST in the blink of an eye. We all know that he has broken the promise that the GST would result in a simpler, fairer tax system. We all know that his claim—that Australian people and the national economy would be better off under the GST—was a fraud. And we can now see very clearly that the government is panicking. All the billions of dollars of backflips revealed in this budget are spent merely to try to shore up the government's vote.
Tonight I am going to lay out the choices between the two major parties in Australia very clearly. The most important promise I can make is this: the Labor Party in government will put jobs, health and education—wherever you live—right back at the top of the priority list. The greatest cause of this year's economic slide, as revealed in this budget, is the GST. People were told it would be good for their families, good for business and good for the overall economy. The Howard government has failed on all three counts, and Australians know this. The GST is the Howard government's answer to all Australia's challenges. But it is the wrong answer. The Labor Party is going to give you a very clear choice. The government believes in slugging everybody with this unfair GST. The Labor Party pledges to roll it back. The government believes in selling the rest of its stake in Australia's biggest company, Telstra. No government led by Kim Beazley will ever sell this great national company, Telstra, and that is a rock solid guarantee.
This government spends hundreds of millions a year on wasteful advertising and consultancies. Last year the federal government spent more on advertising than Toyota, McDonald's or Coca-Cola—in fact, it was Australia's number one advertiser. This government wasted more than $200 million on advertising for the GST alone. That is 20 times as much as it spent on the carer payment for those looking after profoundly disabled children. That is not right, and everybody knows it.
Tonight we are going to do something unusual in a budget reply speech. I am going to give some even more concrete examples of the stark choices at the next election. I am going to give you several fully costed, fully funded policies as an example of the choice facing Australians. But first let me say this: this is the biggest spending, biggest taxing government in Australian history and it has left a set of low surpluses in the years to come. At the same time, bad priorities have left serious holes in the services Australians value most: health and aged care, jobs and education. This combination of high spending and inadequate services poses a challenge both to this government and any incoming one.
Labor's response to this challenge is threefold: first and foremost, Labor is about reducing, not increasing, the burden of tax on Australian families.
—Why don't you shut up.
—I won't shut up!
—Never drink and come into the chamber; that's a rule.
—Madam President, I rise on a point of order. I ask you to ask Senator Evans to withdraw what he said. He made an implication that I had been drinking. I find that offensive and I ask him to withdraw it.
—I did not hear the remark.
—Madam President, on the point of order: this is the most disgraceful abuse I have seen in my time in the Senate chamber. To interrupt the shadow minister representing the shadow treasurer in this chamber presenting the Leader of the Opposition's reply to the budget is an absolute and unprecedented disgrace, and Senator Patterson stands condemned for doing it.
—That is not relevant to the point of order. Senator Evans, if you did say something unparliamentary, it should be withdrawn.
—Madam President, what I said across the chamber to those senators interjecting was: never drink and come into the chamber. I do not think that was unparliamentary. It is a bit of good advice. They ought to take it.
—It seems to be inappropriate language for the Senate. There should not be the interjections that were actually taking place at the time.
—I repeat: Labor's response to this challenge is threefold. First and foremost, Labor is about reducing, not increasing, the burden of tax on Australian families. That is what roll-back means. Families will benefit from GST roll-back, while Labor will not increase personal income tax rates. That is an absolute guarantee. Secondly, the Howard government's bad priorities clearly provide opportunities for cutting waste, extravagance and unfairness and investing in services that help all Australians. With our policy announcements tonight, we are giving a concrete demonstration of how this can be done. And most importantly, Labor's plans are not just quick fixes from one budget to the next. We have a long-term plan to make this nation a fairer and better place to live. This plan will be carried out at a pace and on a scale determined by what the budget can afford.
Labor already has a total of 70 policies publicly announced and available on our web site or through our members' offices—that is, 70 more than the Liberal and National parties. We have pledged to give the costings of all our policies—that is, what we will do and how we will pay for it—as soon as the government reveals the true state of the economy in the charter of budget honesty delivered during the election campaign. There will be no `non-core' promises from us. You will go to the polls knowing exactly what we will do, unlike the fraudulent behaviour of our opponents when they first ran for office.
Tonight I thought I would give you a clear insight, with more detail into how our policies match a Labor government's values. Tonight we announce that we will cut wasteful spending on advertising and consultancies by $195 million over three years in order to fund a national fight against cancer and to ensure all Australians can get medical help outside working hours. This government has given the richest category 1 private schools an extra $1 million a year. Tonight we announce that Labor will redirect these funds away from these wealthy schools to improve the quality of our government schools as well as the quality of teaching in the nation's classrooms.
This government wants to give a tax deduction to wealthy donors—to people who can afford to give big donations to political parties. Tonight we announce a plan that will use this money—$45 million over three years—to start rolling the GST back from charities that care for the most disadvantaged in our community. These are the sorts of priorities the government should have announced in this week's budget.
As I have said, the Howard government has spent huge and unprecedented amounts of public money on consultancies and government advertising. Spending on consultants amounted to a staggering $1 billion over the three years to 30 June 2000. In one year, the government spent $368 million, an increase of $119 million over the previous year. The advertising bill alone blew out to $210 million as the government tried desperately to convert people to its GST. We all know that the `Unchain my heart' GST ads were nothing more than political propaganda and should have been funded by the Liberal Party. Labor, in government, will reduce this spending on advertising and consultancies by at least $65 million per annum—a 15 per cent cut. And we will introduce strict guidelines to cut this blatant political advertising. This money will be used to tackle an area of health we want to make one of Labor's high priorities—the fight against cancer. 
Each year, over 70,000 Australians are diagnosed with cancer. We all know someone who has struggled with, and survived, the disease and most of us know someone who has died from it. In our hearts we also know that no-one is immune. I want to help control cancer, and I want to make sure cancer patients receive the highest quality treatment.
Tonight I am announcing that Labor will commit $90 million over the next three years to mount a fight against cancer. We will also redesign the government's cervical cancer screening program and combine this with other unspent cancer money so that $149 million will be available over three years for the fight against cancer. We will build a new national cancer alliance to link our scientists with cancer specialists. We will create comprehensive cancer centres to improve treatment services. We will boost public health programs on tobacco and fund screening programs for other cancers.
Labor will rebuild Medicare and, unlike the government, public hospitals are our highest priority. Last August Mr Beazley announced Labor's Medicare After Hours policy that will fix the shortage of GP services at night and on weekends. This policy has two parts: after hours GP services working with local hospital emergency departments and a 24-hour medical advice line staffed by trained nurses under the supervision of doctors. 
Tonight I am able to announce that Labor will spend $55 million over its first three years to establish the 24-hour medical phone service. When a parent is confronted with a medical emergency or is anxious about a child's health, they need immediate medical advice. Labor's 24-hour phone line will give them basic advice and direct callers to the best place to get more help. In this budget the government has tried to steal Labor's policy by announcing $43 million over the next four years to establish services that imitate Medicare After Hours. But it is a very weak imitation. It includes no 24-hour advice line and it is not a national program. Like much of what the Howard government has done, its attempt to copy Medicare After Hours is a case of too little, too late. A service like this is way overdue, and Labor will deliver it.
Our small population gives us a challenge and an opportunity. If we are to be the world's leaders in new industries and new developments in biotechnology, medical research, environmental management and IT, we need better education and training for more of our people. Our greatest assets are the 250,000 new children born every year. We have to give all of them the best education we can—all of them. But this government believes in giving a good start in life only to a chosen elite. The Howard government believes in giving millions of dollars extra per year to wealthy category 1 private schools, like the King's School and Geelong Grammar, that already have the best of everything. These schools, I might say, are attended by less than two per cent of Australians, but count about 60 per cent of this cabinet among their old boys and girls.
More broadly in education, since coming to office John Howard has cut spending on universities and R&D by $5 billion. And, for the first time in many years, university enrolments fell last year. In 1995-96 Commonwealth support for science and innovation was 0.75 per cent of GDP. In the coming year it is estimated to fall to 0.65 per cent of GDP. The research and development tax concession in Labor's last year of office was worth $800 million to industry. Next year it is only $470 million—so much for their much touted innovation statement.
There are no Australians more important than our teachers. There would be nobody watching tonight who could not recall their best teacher. A good teacher changes lives. Every parent knows that the best way to improve their child's chances of staying at school and going on to university is to make sure their children's teachers are experts in their subjects—and yet under the Howard government up to 40 per cent of junior secondary students are taught maths by a teacher without specialist training to teach that subject. Many rural and regional schools cannot even fill vacancies for maths and science teachers. 
I am tonight announcing the funding for three initiatives to tackle these problems. Firstly, under Labor $100 million will be spent over three years to improve the classrooms, libraries and laboratories of our government schools—all the things that will bring back pride in the basic school system that has given us so many leaders in this country. Half of this money will come from the Commonwealth, and it will be matched by the states. Secondly, Labor will award 1,000 prestigious new scholarships each year to high achieving graduates who enter teaching, especially in the key disciplines of maths and science. These teacher excellence scholarships will pay the HECS debts of graduates for every year they remain in teaching. This measure will mean a new generation of committed and idealistic teachers in our classrooms. Thirdly, Labor will update the skills of Australia's existing teachers through a new program we call Teacher Development Partnerships, costing $50 million over three years. The Commonwealth will pay the course costs for 10,000 teachers to undertake refresher retraining, and will pay them $2,000 on completion of their training.
So this is the choice we offer the Australian people—million dollar increases for the wealthiest private schools or $100 million to improve government schools, 1,000 scholarships a year to recruit the best and brightest into teaching and professional development courses for 10,000 existing teachers. 
Labor will also invest in university education and research to give regional Australians the skills to create their own destinies. We will provide an additional $10 million over three years to help regional universities and campuses meet the cost of communications, which they need to access the world of knowledge, and to provide quality distance education over the Internet. We will spend a further $15 million to create 400 new postgraduate research positions at regional campuses, increasing research on fisheries, agriculture, mining and tourism.
The Howard government has introduced legislation to increase the maximum tax deductibility threshold for donations to political parties from $100 to $1,500. In other words, the cap on the amount you can claim from the tax office for political donations has been lifted substantially, no doubt aimed at collecting more from groups like the HIH company. The government estimates this will cost a total of $45 million over three years. The legislation is currently before the Senate. We do not believe the taxpayer should be required to subsidise such donations. Labor opposes this legislation and in government will maintain the threshold at its current level of $100. And we will spend the $45 million instead in starting to roll back the GST on charities! When this government launched its GST, it promised to free the charities and catch the tax cheats. Now we know the truth. This Howard government has freed the tax cheats, and mugged the charities.
Let me give you an illustration of just how unfair this GST is. When a big company gets a million dollar electricity bill, it can claim back nearly 10 per cent of the bill from the tax office as a tax credit. But if a charity moves in to help a needy family in a crisis, and pays the family's overdue electricity bill, the charity is slugged a full 10 per cent in GST—and cannot claim back a cent. This is a clear double standard. Worse than that, it is just plain unfair. Well, that might be acceptable to the Prime Minister, but it is not acceptable to us. And Labor will start the process of rolling back this GST by helping Australian charities get on with the great work they do in our communities.
The government's GST has hit, and hit hard, Australian families, particularly those who are struggling to meet the increased pressures of work and family life, and the high cost of child care. It has severely hurt small business people trying to come to grips with the BAS forms, which have not been improved, in spite of all the government's promises. The GST has harmed businesses, cost jobs, and hurt the economy.
Remember who said in 1998, `The combination of higher growth and improved work incentives will deliver more jobs and lower unemployment'? It was the author of the budget papers, Treasurer Peter Costello. The budget itself shows how wrong these predictions were. They show `slower than expected growth' in the economy as a result of the GST. The budget says residential construction industries were particularly hard-hit. I quote:
The downturn in this sector had flow-on effects to other parts of the economy through its impact on employment, consumer spending and business sentiment.
Only last November Peter Costello said unemployment could go down to five per cent. `You could see a figure with a five in front of it,' he told the 7.30 Report. He now has to admit that unemployment will rise to at least seven per cent. By the end of its second term the government will only have been able to get unemployment down by around one percentage point, and the majority of new jobs are part-time. 
This budget shows that John Howard and Peter Costello think the vote of the elderly people of this country is worth a mere $300. The Labor Party has a lot more respect for those who took us through the Depression and several wars, building the sinews of this country. They all know they were promised $1,000, not less than one-third of that. It always pays to check the fine print with this government. By no means all pensioners are getting the $300. Our offices, and I expect it is the same with those opposite, have been logging literally hundreds of calls a day from disability support pensioners in particular, and other pensioners, who have just discovered that they do not get a cent. Many of these people are struggling to pay for expensive medicines. Many were injured at work. They have simply been cut adrift by this government, which calculates it does not need their vote. Our offices are taking call after call from self-funded retirees between the ages of 55 and 65 who feel duped by the government. They thought the budget promised them tax relief and, in the end, there was not a bean. In fact, far from all self-funded retirees benefiting from the extra budget measures announced on Tuesday, about 350,000 will miss out. 
I want to remind you of Treasurer Costello's budget speech on Tuesday night when he quoted from the first Commonwealth budget brought down by one of this country's Federation founders, George Turner. Mr Costello quoted Turner telling the parliament of Australia that `in the early stages of our career' it should avoid `extravagance'—and we agree that it should. But it says a lot about the values, the lack of imagination, of this government that the Treasurer skipped right over a far better quote from George Turner only a sentence or two earlier in his speech. That first Australian Treasurer said:
I feel that in dealing with the finances we all fully realize the great responsibility which rests upon our shoulders, and I am certain that, whatever our opinions on the fiscal question may be, we shall give each other credit for being animated by but one desire—to do that which is best for Australia, and fair, just and equitable for all states, and to all classes and sections of our community.
That is the missing part of the Treasurer's speech of 2001—a commitment to justice and fairness for all, for struggling Australian families, not just the people this government needs to get itself re-elected. At the next election—only months away at most—the people of this country will be faced with a very stark choice. They will have on offer a stale, five-year-old government that has stopped listening, and run out of ideas, a government whose only vision for Australia was to introduce a new tax, the botched, unfair, and badly administered GST.
The Labor Party has a stronger vision. We look to a future of greater prosperity for all Australians— those who live in the cities and those who choose the quieter roads. We want to create a future where the protection of our beautiful environment is an integral part of our growth and development as a nation. We want a future in which our people's health care is provided by virtue of citizenship, not of wealth. We will work for a future in which quality education is there for all, not just the privileged. We will work to make Australia one of the world's leading knowledge nations, harnessing the new age of communications for the benefit of all of our people.
These things will put bread and butter on our tables and ensure our people survive and prosper. But we need food for the soul as well. We need to be a unified nation, reconciled with this country's first inhabitants. We need to bring home our Constitution and make an Australian our head of state. These reflect the values Australians have discovered in themselves as they built this great nation over the past 100 years. And let me assure all of you tonight that these are the values that will inspire and govern Australia under a Beazley Labor government. ",SENATE,<title>BUDGET 2001-02</title>,<title>Statement and Documents</title>,Miscellaneous,37,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2001-05-24,"—Two days ago, the Treasurer told us that the 2001 budget would build a stronger Australia and strengthen our economy. Since then, the Leader of the Opposition has said that the budget was `desperate back covering', `mean-spirited', `contains no new ideas for the future', `smacks of a government in panic', is `backward looking' and `mean and tricky'. The truth, of course, is somewhere in between. Over the next few weeks, there will be more in-depth analysis and further focus on how the budget will impact on Australians. Many observers feel analysis of the budget is more difficult in recent years, since the introduction of the so-called charter of budget honesty has made it much harder to follow the progress of particular programs from budget to budget. Ross Gittens, the economics editor of the Sydney Morning Herald, has described it as the `charter of budget opacity'. One could argue that the most honest thing about the charter for budget honesty is the opening line of the 1998 act, which reads:
Nothing in the Charter of Budget Honesty creates rights or duties that are enforceable in judicial or other proceedings. 
The Australian Democrats believe that the 2001 federal budget contains a few, mostly small, initiatives to be commended, a number of which we either called for, or secured in negotiations or by amendments in the parliament. There are aspects to be condemned, but what is of particular concern is what is missing and who has been forgotten. The budget fails to even begin to bridge the social divide, other than in some limited measures for regional and rural areas and a few ad hoc initiatives for low income older Australians. There was no vision, unless you count a fiscal surplus fuelled fantasy of winning back votes. 
The greatest tragedy of this budget is that it forecasts a rise in unemployment and it does not deliver on job creation. The 2001 federal budget was a lost opportunity. But I will start with the good news. There are initiatives in this budget that the Australian Democrats commend, such as increased efforts to prevent plant and animal disease entering Australia— although it is replacing previous cuts and tourism will pay the price—and the $500 million HIH hardship allowance. The rural nursing funding is a start. The initiatives for older Australians will also alleviate some hardship, including the extension of pensioner concessions to low income self-funded retirees; the one-off payment of $300 to some 2.2 million low income self-funded retirees and pensioners to offset price rises; the increase in the Medicare levy threshold to $20,000 per annum for senior Australians; and the increase in the tax free threshold.
The one-off $25,000 payment to prisoners of war of the Japanese and POW widows is commendable, although the Democrats wish that veterans did not have to wait so long for such payments. In environmental protection, there are a few, very bright—
Government senators interjecting—
—Madam President, you would think they would listen while I am commending them.
There are very small bright spots such as $5 million for the National Pollutant Inventory and $5 million for the implementation of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The annual $100 million allocation for the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality is better than nothing, but inadequate in comparison to the $3.7 billion per annum that the National Farmers Federation and the Australian Conservation Foundation predict is needed for land and water repair. The provision of 670 extra funded places per year over four years in regional universities is positive, but it does not go even halfway to making up the $170 million that has been cut from these institutions over the past few years. 
We acknowledge the positive aspects of welfare reform such as the $800 training credit for Work for the Dole participants. Although, to put it in context, this would pay only one HECS subject if people were studying university subjects. More Centrelink staff and personalised welfare delivery are overdue. We hope this initiative will mean tailored assistance to welfare recipients to help the long-term unemployed and older jobless to find training or other mutual obligation activities, and that it will not just mean more breaching of welfare recipients.
Not surprisingly, we welcome the initiatives that the Democrats secured in negotiations, in amendments or have long called for, including the $115 million alcohol education and rehabilitation foundation, which the Democrats initiated, and of course the $44 million for indigenous organisations as compensation for the FBT changes. The extension of health care cards to foster children was a successful Democrat amendment. Funding for research and education to prevent problem gambling was clearly prompted by the amendments moved by the Australian Democrats during the debate on the Interactive Gambling (Moratorium) Bill. And the Democrats helped to ensure the increase in the Australian Research Council funding.
The `working credits' initiative, which will allow people on welfare and students to undertake some casual work without the loss of their social security payments, should be commended, although the Democrats do believe that the thresholds are still too low; that is, before income support is lost. We are relieved that the government did respond to concerns raised by the Democrats and many welfare groups and did not impose an activity test on disability support pensioners, as was originally floated, although they did toughen the eligibility test. So that was the good news in the 2001 federal budget. The Democrats believe in giving the government fair credit where credit is due.
The measures in the budget that the Australian Democrats have concerns with—indeed, we condemn them—include continuing reductions in total funding for the Natural Heritage Trust and inadequate funding for the ABC of $17.8 million extra per year, given that this government cut $67 million per year in their first term.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this budget is welfare reform. We were told that welfare reform would be a `centrepiece' of this budget. Instead of a budget headline, welfare reform turned out to be a footnote. Rather than the $1 billion that Patrick McClure of Mission Australia and the chair of the welfare reform group suggested was the minimum required as an initial investment in welfare reform, we have less than $1 billion over four years. Instead of the `comprehensive strategy' on welfare reform promised by the former minister, Senator Jocelyn Newman, we have a threadbare approach that is high on rhetoric and low on actual assistance to those in need. And when it comes to the sensible five areas for action advocated by the former minister, we have: a complex and intimidating pension and benefit system, instead of `a simple and responsive income support structure'; tougher eligibility criteria and penalties, rather than `incentives and financial assistance'; coercive, one-sided activity requirements, instead of `mutual obligations'; crowd control at Centrelink, instead of `individualised service delivery'; and a growing social divide, instead of the promised `social partnerships'.
As a sideshow, we also have the ongoing performance of `good cop/bad cop' being played out by the Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Amanda Vanstone, and the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, Minister Abbott. They do not appear to be able to decide whether the social security system is tough or compassionate, proactive or punitive, or a hindrance or a help. The only thing that is now certain is that Australia's social security system is neither social nor secure.
Defence got an extra half a billion dollars this year alone and this will increase by $27.6 billion over the next decade. Business got $5 billion in tax cuts. There was much more money involved in the tax changes for company vehicles and, of course, the backflip on trusts than the $76 million for welfare reform in the first year. How could the Minister for Family and Community Services, in all budget honesty, describe welfare reform as a centrepiece of this budget? The government cherry picked from the McClure recommendations, chose the most punitive and cheapest options, and left hanging the hardest cases: the long-term unemployed and those with particular disadvantages.
The Democrats oppose: extending mutual obligation to sole parents; the abolition of the mature age allowance and the partner allowance; and the introduction of compulsory annual interviews for mature age partner allowance and for the widows allowance, about whether or not they should re-enter the work force. The McClure report did not suggest the extension of mutual obligation to older Australians, but the government ignored that and will extend Work for the Dole to the age of 39 and introduce other compulsory mutual obligation activities for older Australians.
The budget refers to `intensive assistance'—something the Democrats support—but in the last budget $80 million was taken from intensive assistance and redirected to the extension of Work for the Dole. The additional Work for the Dole funding, this time around, would have been better directed as employment subsidies or tax breaks to encourage employers to take on or retain older workers.
But the budget's greatest failing is what was missing: a vision for health, education, environment and job creation. These are areas that you invest in now, and the long-term returns are priceless. I am sorry that the government does not agree. Where were the major initiatives that would make for a better Australia in 30 or even 50 years time? There were a few measures to help those who are suffering today. Most of those people are forgotten in this budget. Two to three million Australians live in poverty. Real welfare reform would have raised payments to above the poverty line. Four hundred thousand young Australians—young unemployed and students—live significantly below the poverty line.
Government senators interjecting—
—I am glad that Senator Ferguson thinks that that is a joke. The budget contained no comprehensive efforts to protect the most vulnerable—those on low incomes—from the impact of rising prices. There was little funding for Aboriginal health. An injection of $250 million would have been a move towards giving indigenous Australians the same level of federal health funding per capita that flows to non-indigenous Australians. The number of people being granted legal aid has declined, and caps on assistance can mean that funding can run out part way through a case. Disappointingly, legal aid and community legal centres received little additional funding in this budget. Overseas aid remains at a record low level of 0.25 per cent of GDP—a long way from the 0.7 per cent of GDP that is recommended by the United Nations. Of the 21 donor countries in the OECD, Australia is in the bottom third in terms of overseas aid.
In regard to environmental protection, there is insufficient investment in renewable energy sources and reducing water consumption. The Natural Heritage Trust is extended but overall there is a long-term drop in funding and there are no other new measures to plug the gaps in the environment budget from previous years. The budget fails to adequately address the pressing issues of land clearing and climate change. The National Farmers Federation estimates that land degradation is costing Australia $2 billion a year. That is in lost productivity. However, the initiatives and funding announced will not lead to a reduction in current land clearing rates. Money is provided for tree planting, but ongoing vegetation clearing will not be curbed. We are clearing much faster than we are planting. Australia is going to be one of the countries hardest hit by climate change, but the small additional initiatives announced in this budget suggest that, other than the measures the Democrats previously secured to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the government is giving up on the aims of the Kyoto agreement.
In addition to environmental protection, the other vital investment a country can make in its future is of course education, but the funding crisis in our schools and universities has largely been ignored in this budget. The government acknowledged that the innovation package was a `first step' in reinvesting in Australia's education and research capability. However, there is no `second step' in this budget. The innovation package presupposes robust teaching and learning but there is no recognition that increased funding to our universities is urgently required. Indeed, the budget is characterised by further shifting the costs to students, whether it is in the previously announced postgraduate loans scheme or the removal of funded places in bridging programs. The Commonwealth's direct contribution has actually fallen in real terms since 1996, while student numbers have increased by 60,000.
Housing and tourism are key areas for which the Democrats would have liked to see more support. Tourism provides employment, particularly for young people and in rural and regional areas. Rather than invest in the post-Olympic opportunities to sizeably increase overseas visitor numbers, the government has largely left the tourism sector to fend for itself. Gaps in affordable housing were another part of the McClure report into welfare reform that the government ignored. Last year, public housing waiting lists lengthened from 178,000 to 218,000—that is 218,000 Australians and their families waiting for public housing. According to the Australian newspaper, in six months last year almost 700 people lost their unemployment payments for moving to areas where the unemployment rate was higher but the housing was cheaper.
At the same time, there is a high level of unemployment in the construction industry. Research estimates the number of new housing starts in the current financial year will be the lowest since the recession of the early 1980s. That is a slump of 34 per cent from last financial year—the biggest annual decline in 25 years. One might have reasonably expected in this budget some sort of stimulus for this important sector. A Democrat suggestion would be to extend the first home buyers grant to specifically target environmental initiatives such as solar power, or to make housing suitable for people with disabilities, including making homes wheelchair accessible. That would provide the foundations for economic as well as environmental and social benefits.
This was not a budget to set an economically or environmentally sustainable blueprint for the 21st century. This was a budget to try and buoy the polls over the next six months or less. A number of the positive initiatives in this budget are compensation for past misdeeds. Treasurer Costello's sixth budget is largely about minimising the adverse impact of the first five budgets and the government's wider reform agenda. The $142 million for dairy farmers, funded by a levy on milk sales, is compensation to help repair the damage done by deregulation and national competition policy. Work for the Dole and training initiatives are a poor substitute for labour market programs scrapped in 1996. Reintroduction of an earnings credit for unemployed people is restoring a similar measure that the government withdrew a few years ago.
The $300 for low income older Australians is an admission that the inadequacy of GST compensation will need to be re-examined after two years. This is an undertaking that the Democrats secured during negotiations, that is, that the impact of the GST would be assessed. Extending the time line for expenditures on GST compliance for small business is another admission by this government that they underestimated the administrative difficulties of the new taxation system. And the need for HIH compensation is in part the consequence of a slack regulatory structure that the government has resisted calls to reform.
Federal budgets do two things: they report on the past and set out a vision for the future. In the past, it was easier for the government to claim to be a `good economic manager', when strong world growth was buoying up the Australian economy. The Treasurer cannot take credit for the past five years of domestic economic growth and then turn around and blame today's economic conditions on the global economy. There has been a global economic downturn, global growth is down and this government has no real plan.
The economic conditions for the budget are predicated on 3.25 per cent growth and a seven per cent unemployment forecast. Australia presently has low inflation, low interest rates, a low dollar and low levels of government debt. And, some might say, low morale. Business and consumer confidence is flat. Actually, it seems like the only things going up in Australia are unemployment and insurance premiums.
For the last five years, Treasurer Costello's mantra has been `debt reduction'. Yet Australia has one of the lowest levels of debt in the OECD. This budget's projected surplus is $1.5 billion, but it is not the size of your surplus but what you do with it that counts. When unemployment is going up, that is the time that governments should consider the benefit of deficit budgets because perpetual surpluses mean that the government is continually taking more money out of the economy than it is putting in. The Democrats believe that spending money to stimulate the economy is desirable when there is low growth and rising unemployment. The government has not taken this opportunity to invest in our future. Government debt which is used to fund public investments with long-term benefits is no more irresponsible than a mortgage to fund the family home. It is a sensible, secure way of ensuring immediate and future wellbeing. But—as every family knows—spending up on a big party on the credit card is unlikely to reap long-term benefits.
Much has been made, especially by this government, of the need to leave future generations debt free, but what about leaving them an inheritance? A good education, good health, a solid infrastructure and a clean environment are the endowments for future generations. That is what they will need, and this budget does little to secure any of them. Why was there not sizeable investment in human capital, in innovation and in research and development? This budget had no guts and little glory, and I do not think it is going to age well.
When we talk about a balanced budget—in the sense of revenue and expenditure being equal—we have to allow for a few billion dollars in error. In 1991, Treasury underestimated the budget deficit by $4.6 billion. In 1995, it was out by $3.6 billion. The budget 2000 forecast was a $5.4 billion surplus, but the actual surplus is now estimated to be around $2.3 billion. The planned surplus has been eroded by significant spending commitments in recent months and, of course, a slowing economy. But last year's budget was always pretty optimistic. You may recall one of the highlights of last year's budget was the $2.6 billion spectrum sale windfall—which, of course, disappeared into the thin air from where it came.
For an election budget, in some ways this budget is surprisingly ungenerous. There was very little for health, education, environment or employment, which is strange because these are the issues which polling shows people are concerned about. If we really want a surplus in the long run, reduce unemployment now. It has been estimated that a one per cent fall in unemployment could cut a deficit by around $1.5 billion. Aside from the benefit to the economic bottom line and the broader social benefits for everyone, it would also make a difference to the 100,000 Australians that one per cent unemployment figure represents.
When we talk about these percentages, we should never forget that we are talking about individual people's lives. At the end of the 20th century, there were more than 614,000 unemployed Australians. In the first four months of this century, that figure rose by 56,000 people. In April 2001, there were more than 670,000 unemployed Australians. And there are only 95,000 job vacancies. The government's own budget forecast is that those figures are going to worsen with an unemployment rate forecast of seven per cent. The problem is: not enough jobs. The Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business has boasted that this budget abolishes `passive welfare'. Well, this budget certainly reinforces passive job creation.
The budget offered the unemployed training credits, working credits, more mutual obligation and Work for the Dole, but it did not offer them a job. Even the small increase in public service jobs in this budget is mostly for casual jobs. When I asked the government in question time yesterday about job creation initiatives, the only real answer I got from Senator Kemp was that the government wants the Democrats to change their position and agree to pass the unfair dismissals legislation. I do not believe that making it easier to fire people will reduce unemployment.
One way or another, Prime Minister Howard may not be Prime Minister at the time of the next federal budget. In the document titled The Australia I believe in: the values, directions and policy priorities of a coalition government in 1995, John Howard described youth unemployment as `a crisis that is shameful, wasteful and longstanding'. That was April 1995, and it was true. In April this year there were 260,300 unemployed 15- to 24-year-olds. So, regrettably, it is still true. Mr Howard also wrote:
One of the great distinguishing characteristics of Australian society has been the capacity of each generation to hand on to the next a higher standard of living and a wider range of opportunities than those which were handed on to it. The current generation of Australians runs the real risk of being the first which will fail to achieve this outcome for Australian youth.
That was Prime Minister Howard—then Mr John Howard. When Mr Howard wrote that in 1995 it was also true. After six years of his government, it still is. Australia needs an alternative approach. It needs an alternative approach to that taken by either of two old parties.
The Australian Democrats want a tax system that is environmentally responsible, not overly complex, and one that is fair. Collection should be simple and the spending should be smart. While the government is offering an extra $300 here and an exemption there, and the opposition will probably offer to double it, the Democrats believe that what a lot of Australians want is a better future for their children and their grandchildren. I suspect many Australians, older and younger, are remembering the good old days when banks paid you for leaving money with them, when you protected yourself against unforeseen disaster by having insurance and when BAS meant the Bass Strait.
When you look at this budget and consider whether or not you will be better off, I urge you to also look at the last six budgets and the 13 years before that under Labor. Look at the impact that their policies have had on the triple bottom line—not just the economic but the social and environmental outcomes. Then ask yourself: what is my vote worth?",SENATE,<title>BUDGET 2001-02</title>,<title>Statement and Documents</title>,Miscellaneous,37,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2001-05-24,"—I rise this evening to respond to the Howard-Costello budget, which has been framed by a desperate government that has at long last realised that the blind obsession for the global economy that has benefited Internet technology, exporters, importers and the banking sector of the Australian economy has had an unparalleled impact on other sectors. This budget is obviously one of self-preservation and appeasement on behalf of the Treasurer, Mr Costello, and his government. While superficially it appears to offer much to many, in reality it offers very little to many and nothing to most. Claims by the Treasurer that the initiatives in this budget are directed towards supporting older Australians and improving the welfare system and the health and living standards of all Australians, not to mention the mandatory categories of rural and regional Australia and the special case for preferential funding of indigenous issues, are merely a slip of the tongue.
The government claims that the introduction of the GST has brought many underground businesses out of the black economy, yet no mention has been made about the biggest black economy of all—that is, the 1953 tax avoidance scheme known as the `double tax act', which is offered to overseas based businesses that operate within Australia and that repatriate their lucrative profits back to overseas tax havens. The latest figure I have been able to obtain on this is in the billion dollar category. I wonder if this amount of money could be more usefully employed in the Australian economy.
The title `Australians working together' has very soothing conciliatory overtones aimed at uniting us all. The aim of bringing workers up to scratch in their work skills is really commendable. However, I am curious to know what was wrong with the work skills of the workers at Impulse Airlines, the workers at the Arnott's factory in Victoria and the skilled technicians at Telstra. Were their skills needful of any attention, or were they just further victims of this government's romance with national competition policy and Hilmer's theories?
Australia's dairy farmers have both practical and business skills that have been proven throughout this country over many years; yet they, too, obviously must need the benefits of further work skilling or they would not be in the unenviable position they are in today. Through this budget, the federal government claims to ease the pain of the deregulation of the dairy industry; however, there are many anomalies now appearing in the proposals. The dairy deregulation funding is creating divisions between farmers—that is, between those who are receiving restructuring funding and those who are not. Many of those who are not receiving funding are young farmers or those who have wished to stay in the industry by trying to build up herds to produce more milk. They were advised by their industry leaders in the time leading up to deregulation that increased volume was the way to survive. Milk prices have not responded as these farmers were told by industry leaders they would. So they have large debts and lower than expected returns and, now that the government has realised what is seriously wrong with the industry, they miss out again.
The other unexpected result is the proportion of extremely large dairies that were expected to survive deregulation but have decided to opt out of the industry; in doing so, they have put pressure on the supply of fresh milk. The public is being grossly misled about the $140 million that is being raised by extending the 11c per litre levy; it is not from government revenue. The industry is very aware that, rather than the 11c coming from an increase in the price of milk—that is, the levy is paid by the consumer—the 11c is being deducted from the price that the dairy farmers are paid for their milk. Another way to highlight the plight of the dairy industry is that a dairy producer would have to sell 22 litres of milk at the farm gate so that, after the production costs and taxes, he would be able to go into the local supermarket and buy a litre of milk over the counter.
The additional package for dairy farmers is reported as being part of the budget. As I said before, it will be financed by an extension of the 11c levy that funds the DSAP scheme. I have a question for the government: they say that farmers can take this additional package up front; if the package is being funded by the 11c per litre levy, where will the money come from to pay them up front? In the farmers' view, the additional $20 million for DSAP is a laugh. In some cases it has been wilfully wasted on stupid things like polocrosse fields and a meat pie factory and, to the other extreme, $660,000 was given to the Bega Cheese factory. Surely a public company has to finance itself and not take money from a fund that was to help dairy farmers through a very hard time. I say: put the money through the farmers and they will distribute it into their local communities better than anyone.
In relation to the beef industry, I draw two issues to the attention of the Treasurer: the meat inspection levies and the GST on livestock. The increase in money for the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, AQIS, to increase our defences against exotic disease is welcome, but it should be noted that this is only a partial return of resources removed from AQIS and AFFA over the past five years. I contrast this with the attitude of the US government to its agriculture: vast and increasing resources are allocated in each US budget towards increasing the power of US agriculture both at home and on the world market. The US government pays for all meat inspection in the US industry. In Australia, under the current government and this budget, the industry has to pay for meat inspection—some $55 million each year. This is a figure that must be passed back to the producer; it equals nearly $8 per beast slaughtered. This is more than the average producer's net profit for most of the last decade. This impost on the industry lessens Australia's competitiveness in Japan and Korea, where the US continues to take market share in both volume and price from Australia. A nation with a debt of over $300 billion and with competition policy as its creed should help, not hinder, its exporters.
The other issue I draw to the Treasurer's attention is the GST on cattle. There is no GST on domestic fresh beef sales or on exported beef, so abattoirs get no reimbursement from the next link. They must obtain additional finance of 10 per cent to pay producers until reimbursement from the tax office arrives. I note that the recent closure of Prom Meats in Victoria is attributed to this additional liquidity burden. As there is no net benefit to the government from the tax on slaughtered animals, I ask the Treasurer—as I have asked on a previous occasion—to remove this pointless burden from the beef industry.
Several initiatives announced by the Treasurer on Tuesday night are straight out of One Nation's policies. I congratulate the government on listening to One Nation in the areas of Defence, aged care privatisation, immigration and illegal immigrants. The concern I have, though, is that the government is reticent to publicly admit this.
The parliament of Australia sits at the centre of one of the most draconian, randomly targeted, restrictive programs ever enacted on Australian sheep farmers. The problem I refer to is the national ovine Johne's disease program. This program is supposedly being run for the benefit of the national sheep industry, but no account of its effects on individual farmers has been taken. Farmers living within 200 kilometres of this building have been driven out of business, some even to suicide, yet not one word has been mentioned in the budget papers about addressing this situation.
The federal government must move to take control of this state of affairs. It has become a national issue. The individual states involved are unable to agree upon a plan of action that would alleviate the distress of affected sheep farmers. These farmers have had their trading rights suspended indefinitely for national sheep industry benefit, with no thought given to any sort of compensation. Every respectable quality assurance program I know of obligates members of the program to pay some levy for the assurance being sought. The national ovine Johne's program is conspicuously reluctant to address this issue. 
Within a month, a mid-term review of this program and a Senate committee report are due in this parliament. The government budget papers should have allocated funding to redress the terrible wrongs committed randomly upon innocent farmers under the guise of working in the national sheep industry's interest. I expect that the mid-term review and the Senate committee report will recommend such action.
I come to the issue of private rulings by the ATO, such as the Bud Plan. The ATO issued discussion paper PCD 9 in December 1995 relating to research and development investments and tax deductibility, but it issued no notices of intention to reassess until 1998. Many investors made investments based on those original private rulings and submitted their taxation returns based on those rulings. It now appears that the ATO may have acted contrary to parliamentary intent and its own established practices, because the ATO has acted to apply new rulings, announced by media releases and meetings of private groups. These retrospective rulings apply to past events and past ATO decisions. 
With these retrospective tax rulings, the ATO is acting more powerfully than the parliament and the courts. Has the ATO become the fourth arm of government under the separation of powers doctrine? Unfortunately this may be true. The parliament, the executive government and the judiciary operate under the separation of powers. The difference is that, unlike these, the Australian Taxation Office appears to have combined all three—it now makes law, it prosecutes and it enforces without reference to the parliament or to the courts. 
The ATO routinely accepts this form of loan structure that I have been speaking of for other business ventures in Australia, such as big resource developments with tax deferrals. With regard to this issue, where the ATO has changed rulings, the ATO has sent out taxation bills—in some cases as high as $150,000—to individuals. These include penalties that the ATO is attempting to enforce, although court cases to assess the action of the ATO have been set for hearing. These hard working Australians, who are endeavouring to save for their retirement, deserve a better deal, but there appears to be no recognition of that in this budget.
I move on now to the age pensioners. A one-off $300 payment to our pensioners—you have to be kidding! This is retribution for the impact of the GST. The pensioners are only one of the many groups within this country that will bear witness to this. First, we had the Clayton's $1,000 offer for the erosion of pensioners' savings. This was to be based on a pensioner's savings in their bank account as of 1 July 2000. But if an elderly pensioner had not updated the amount of savings to the social security department, they would only receive a proportion of the $1,000 based on their previous disclosure—even if that previous disclosure was 10 years old and they had considerably more savings on 1 July. This $1,000 offer was whipped away from most pensioners and now is being followed up by the $300 card. I thought it would have been more honest of this government to honour the $1,000 bonus to our pensioners or, in the case of the $300 trick, give it yearly and index it and include those people who also are on disability pensions.
Bankruptcies have skyrocketed since the introduction of the GST. It is not just small business that has been telling the government so. Accountants have what they do best—the figures and the facts to support this claim. So it is not just crocodile tears that we are witnessing here. This budget offered no recognition of the costs of the new tax system on the businesses that have been so impacted. Any understanding or empathy with the small business fraternity has not been forthcoming. The Minister for Small Business, Mr Ian Macfarlane, has very sympathetically stated that small business owners would just have to absorb those compliance costs as an investment in their enterprise. Well, Mr Ian Macfarlane, this was the government's GST. I think it is only fair that you as the government should wear the costs. 
Despite the demonstrable compliance costs burden, the Howard government has chosen to turn a blind eye to the very real concerns of small businesses and simply tinker at the edges of the tax. Their response to the pleas of small business for some assistance, such as an extension of the transitional arrangements which would allow for 100 per cent write-off of equipment purchases required to collate the tax from July 2001 until next year, are at best insipid and at worst demonstrate a lack of compassion and concern for the sector which is the true driver of employment growth in Australia. The budget will do nothing to convince micro, small and medium sized family-owned grocers that the coalition genuinely cares about their futures. It is clear that many small family-owned businesses are finding it impossible to meet their GST commitments and continue to pay their creditors. Many are forced into bankruptcy. A tax cut is of no value when you are not making any profit. You now know why the press has been having so much fun with the `mean and tricky' cliche—it seems apt, doesn't it?
The espoused growth in the Australian economy is purely through the management skills of our businesses and our wonderful Australian work force. Any claims by this government that any of the kudos belongs to their macro-economic management is merely unjustifiably claiming glory that does not belong to them. Just witness the machinations of the Australian dollar and the repercussions this has had on our way of life and our standard of living. The only saving grace from this debacle is the benefits that our farming and exporting businesses are gaining. If measures were afoot to improve the living standards for all Australians, then serious consideration needs to be given to the present driving ideology of this government towards globalisation, with the devastating repercussions this is having on our manufacturing industries and consequently our loss of jobs.
There has been no concerted effort in this budget to address the cultural and social as well as economic issues in the rural and regional areas against city divide. Difficulties being faced by our farming and rural communities continue to compound, while at the same time we hear of the illustrious standard of living and the educational and job opportunities being offered to our city cousins. At the same time the constant, incessant closing down of banks and government services in rural and regional Australia continues unabated. If this is what is meant by improving the living standards of all Australians, then I obviously do not have the same dream and aspirations for this country and its people as does this government. Witness the benefits being offered to business: taxation rates of 30 per cent, no Medicare levy as well as the opportunity to purchase a new vehicle with apparently no reasonable cost ceiling being imposed and ultimately free of GST; while working Australians pay up to 48½ per cent in their taxation payments to the Treasury coffers and studiously pay their GST payments on their new cars. 
An amount of $900 million over four years for the health system is sorely needed. Again our health system has also been a victim of Hilmer's national competition policy. While I have heard quotes that Allan Fels maintains the theory is correct, I think there might just be some difference in the reality factor. I have witnessed whole public hospital wards being kept closed, cardiac patients being kept down in emergency departments while awaiting the availability of beds in wards, patients needing immediate surgery and even our elderly are being denied life saving heart operations—and all to no avail as the funds have been so viciously restricted that it is futile. Staffing levels in our public hospitals have also been severely curtailed leading to very low morale and subsequently poorer delivery of services, all thanks to the cost cutting mentality of the present elected government.
The government's aim to develop better social and economic infrastructure in rural and regional Australia is an about-face to what has been taking place in these areas over the last five years. Daily I witness the closure of businesses and the cessation of farming enterprises in these small towns due to the government's intervention. I am witness to this in my own community of Mareeba, which is presently going through the government implemented closure of the tobacco farming industry. This will lead to a yearly loss of $50 million in tobacco income to this small community—not to mention the flow-on effects and the loss of jobs. This is another government implemented rural policy. It is easy to see where the government's heart lies, and nothing will convince me that it rests with the interests of Australia for the benefit of Australians.
In relation to Telstra, this enterprise should never have been sold off in the first place. This wonderful cash producing asset belonged to the Australian people and was operated for the Australian people. What an act of deceit to sell this asset owned by the people to private enterprise, and now the government will continue to pursue the sell-off of the remainder of Telstra. If Telstra had not been stolen from the Australian people, the present evolving situation of difficulty of access to satisfactory communication would not exist for all those people who reside outside the main metropolitan areas. We would not now be listening to the placatory words `improving rural and regional telecommunications and Internet services'. In rural areas, there are difficulties in having repairs carried out because it is uncertain who has the responsibility of maintaining this infrastructure. 
I turn now to the issue of roads. In North Queensland the main highway leading north from Cairns to Cape York Peninsula is little better than a fourth world country, one-lane goat track. If you are lucky, you can access it in the dry season; but in the wet season, do not even contemplate it. On the main road which runs from Cowan through to the Jardine River, I have stood in potholes up to my chest. I ask those who live in their cosy suburbs with suburban streets: how would you feel if you could not get to the shops for three months of the year to buy your groceries? This happens every year in the wet season in Far North Queensland. The budget does nothing in the way of appropriating funds for special issues relating to remote rural areas. The economic cost to the businesses and cattle producers in this area, to my knowledge, has not been quantified. I do not really think anyone cares. May I suggest that the $162 million being proposed for sports centres over the next four years would be better spent on roads in areas like this. If the government cannot or will not manage this, we will happily settle for the $90 million allocated for the Melbourne cricket pitch. After all, we would not want people to think that we were greedy.
Question resolved in the affirmative. ",SENATE,<title>BUDGET 2001-02</title>,<title>Statement and Documents</title>,Miscellaneous,37,1
"Tierney, Sen John",LP,2001-05-24,"—Australia has always had a very rich migrant history. People from all kinds of diverse ethnic backgrounds have come to Australia and prospered, and the tradition continues today. I rise tonight to talk about a man who came to Australia from Poland in 1949. His name is Feliks Dangel. He became one of the best known members of the Polish community not only in the Hunter Valley but throughout Australia. Feliks unfortunately passed away recently. Tonight I want to remember him and the work he did for the Polish community and the town of Maitland, which became his home. 
At the end of the Second World War, 170,000 people came to Australia from all over the world. Most were displaced from their country and were looking for a better life and new opportunities for their families. Of those people who came to Australia between 1947 and 1954, 60,000 were Polish. Feliks Dangel was one of those people. In 1949 the minister for immigration, the Hon. Arthur Calwell, greeted many migrants who had come to Australia during those years, including a 12-year-old Polish girl. In a speech to the minister in August 1949 in Fremantle, when the ship Fairsea arrived in that city, this Polish girl captured the feelings of the many migrants who had come to a new land with these words:
I have the honour of greeting you in the name of the Poles arriving in Australia. Our way to freedom was long and very hard. It led us from being oppressed by the invaders of Poland, through concentration camps, captivity, slave labour and long waiting in DP camps. But we are happy to see a free country and its citizens as we were 10 years ago. We are thankful to you, Sir, and to the Australian Government for putting an end to our homeless life. On our side we are promising to do our best when living in Australia and working for Australia, a country for freedom.
With the massive influx of migrants, camps were set up around the country where people could learn English and eventually move on to settle in various parts of Australia. Feliks Dangel was part of the Greta Migrant Camp near Maitland. There was a movie made about this camp, called Silver City. It was named as such because it was made up of army Nissen huts that were painted silver. At that camp, Feliks had a job with the department of immigration as arts and amenities director. The arts were a passion and interest for Feliks for all of his life. He carried out this job between 1949 and 1951. It did not take him long to settle in the Hunter Valley. He moved to Lochinvar near Maitland with his wife, Aleksandra, in 1952. Four years later he was naturalised. 
Throughout his life, Feliks Dangel was a man who worked tirelessly for the city of Maitland and the Polish community, holding many positions in both spheres. He was elected president of the Polish Association and was an alderman on the Maitland City Council, where he had a keen interest in the arts. He was vice-president of the Federal Council of Polish Associations in Australia. Feliks gave new meaning to the phrase `community leader'. I will not go through all the groups he was involved with, but they did include the Maitland Bicentennial Committee, the Maitland Cultural Committee, the Heritage Committee and the Maitland Hospital Ethnic Advisory Committee. Feliks was also given numerous awards throughout his lifetime, giving credit to his community work and passion for life. These awards included the Silver Jubilee medal; the British Empire medal; the Polish Gold Cross of Merit, which he was awarded twice; and the Commanders Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland. In 1999, he was awarded Freeman of the City of Maitland during the 50th anniversary of the Polish arrival in Australia.
Feliks Dangel's work in the community and work for the Polish community will always be respected and appreciated. To travel to a faraway country and start a new life must be one of the most difficult endeavours to undertake, but to do it with such honour, pride and appreciation of his new home and to give back to Australia in such a tremendous way are signs of a remarkable man. He was proud of heritage and his background. He was also proud to call Australia home. He called himself a Polish Australian and a dinky-di Aussie. To Feliks's wife, Aleksandra Dangel; their children, Danuta, Feliks, Rosemary and Louise; and to the grandchildren I offer my condolences. You can be proud of the life that Feliks Dangel had and the work he did for the Polish and the Maitland communities. He will long be remembered for the community leadership that he displayed throughout his lifetime.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,"<title>Dangel, Mr Feliks</title>",Adjournment,39,1
