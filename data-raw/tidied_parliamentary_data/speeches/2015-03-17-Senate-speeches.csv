The PRESIDENT
 (12:31):  Honourable senators, I seek concurrence, as I did last year, in relation to a request from the press gallery. The press gallery has requested that photographs may be taken not in agreement with the current practices concerning the division for the Higher Education and Research Reform Bill 2014, which will be debated shortly. I would seek concurrence on the same terms that I granted the press gallery last time with the concurrence of the Senate, and those were that photographs be broad shots of the chamber only; that individual senators or groups of senators not be the focus of any particular shot; and that media rules be otherwise complied with at all times. Unless I have any objection, do I have the concurrence of the Senate for that to take place for the higher education bill? There being no objection, it is so ordered.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (12:33):  I rise to speak on the Higher Education and Research Reform Bill 2014. For 10 months the Abbott government has pursued an unfair, unnecessary and ideologically driven agenda to restructure higher education in this country. The agenda is unfair, because allowing universities to charge whatever fees they want will drive up the cost of degrees. It will impose crippling debt on students and deny to many of them the opportunity in life that a university education can offer.


The agenda is unnecessary, because the so-called funding crisis that has been used to justify fee deregulation does not exist. The only crisis was the one that the government contrived by its threatened 20 per cent cut to the funding of student places. The minister announced yesterday that the cut will be the subject of separate legislation, by which he means in effect that there will have to be an amendment to the current legislation. The minister announced yesterday, that is to say, that the government was going to pursue this, and pursue it if this matter were defeated in the Senate, having said previously that the matter would be put to rest by the end of March. The government has contrived the funding crisis, but now the minister has moved away from that proposition because he thought it was suddenly, to use his word, a 'distraction'. Yet the government still insists that fee deregulation is necessary


This is because the government's real agenda is an ideological one, as has been apparent from the very beginning. This bill and its failed predecessor were never intended to build world-class universities in Australia, as the Minister for Education and Training continues to pretend. Australia already has world-class universities, as anyone familiar with the global university ranking systems will know, and Australia's university system—and I want to emphasise the word 'system'—is routinely ranked amongst the very best. As the vice-chancellor of the University of Canberra, Professor Stephen Parker, has said:


More Australian universities appear in world rankings than a decade ago, courtesy of the current funding system … there is … nothing in the world-rankings of Australian universities to suggest a problem, let alone a crisis. 


The Government's real motive is the withdrawal of public provision in higher education. The Pyne plan, if it becomes law, would usher in the creeping privatisation of the system. The minister wants an Americanised system, with very few already wealthy universities charging high fees for an elite education while the rest become less and less able to compete on equal terms. It would be a world of $100,000 degrees and of constant degradation of the system, and a world in which debt on student loans and fee inflation become major social and economic problems. In the United States, fee levels have been rising at twice the inflation rate for the past decade, and student debt is spiralling out of control. Total debt on student loans exceeds credit card debts.


The Abbott government has failed to deceive the Australian people about its intentions. Australians know we already have a strong and competitive university system. They know what an Americanised system would mean. From the beginning, they have seen the Pyne plan for what it is. They know that it is an attack on the Australian dream—an attack on the fair go that every generation of Australians rightly deserves. They know that opportunity and access to education go hand in hand. They know the doubling and tripling of the cost of degrees can only mean that there will be fewer and fewer opportunities for those who do not have private wealth.


The Australian people are not fools and have consistently and overwhelmingly rejected the perfidious Pyne plan. Even the attempt to spend $15 million of taxpayers' money on a slick but misleading ad campaign did absolutely nothing to help Minister Pyne win public support for his trashing of the Australian fair go. Unable to con the voters, the minister has increasingly resorted to desperate measures to try to bully the Senate into passing this bill. He tried to link continued funding of the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy to passing the bill. NCRIS was never part of this bill, but the minister, who could not win the argument over deregulation, decided to make Australia's research facilities hostage to the bill's success. He put at risk the jobs of 1,700 scientists and technicians in 27 facilities, 35,000 research projects and Australia's future as a nation committed to the advancement of knowledge through pure and applied research. As the Nobel laureate Professor Brian Schmidt said, it was not the way a grown-up country behaves. And he should know; this is a man who came to Australia from the US because our facilities and universities offered the opportunity to do excellent research.


Even those who would normally be regarded as the allies of the coalition were absolutely appalled by the minister's linkage of this bill to funding for NCRIS. The chair of the Business Council of Australia, Catherine Livingstone, said:


How have we come to a point where a Government feels that it can use assets publicly funded to the tune of over $2 billion over the past decade ... as a hostage in a political process?


The minister lost support all round because of his NCRIS threat—including, reportedly, from some members of his own party.


The government has lost all credibility on its higher education plans. It has lost credibility with the wider public and has done so on the very basic principle that they have defied the essential ingredient of equity in higher education. It has also lost credibility with the experts because its proposals threaten the system's financial sustainability.


Unregulated fees would drive up inflation as has happened in the US. The cost of living would increase for every Australian. The budget papers already show that total HELP debt is expected to increase from $ 25 billion today to $52 billion by 2017-18. And this estimate does not take into account the blow-out in debt if universities are given a blank cheque to set their own fees.


NATSEM modelling, using the government's own data and very conservative assumptions about fee increases, shows that doubtful debt could easily rise from 17 per cent to 30 per cent off a larger debt base. It is clear what that would mean. The taxpayer would carry the can for these inequitable policies. Universities would be funded through debt write-downs and interest subsidies rather than through manageable direct grants, and until yesterday all this was supposed to have been done in the name of resolving a make-believe funding crisis.


As the debate about the government's short-sighted policies has gone on, the minister has been well and truly hoisted on his own petard. He has attained dizzying heights of absurdity as his fiscal rationale has unravelled. It would be absolutely farcical if its consequences were not so dire.


Senators will be left in no doubt about the apprehensions within the sector over fee deregulation if they read the submissions to the Senate inquiry into the principles of the bill. Professor Louise Watson, an education policy analyst at the University of Canberra and a member of the 2011 base funding review, said this about the minister's proposals for relinquishing control of higher education fees while at the same time retaining responsibility for paying them through HECS:


University Vice-Chancellors would henceforth decide how much public money they wanted to receive. Whatever graduates cannot repay due to price increases and declining graduate earnings, will be sheeted home to the federal budget. As the ballooning HECS debt in the VET sector has demonstrated, fee deregulation would simply make Australian higher education less predictable, less affordable and less sustainable in the future.


Professor Watson illustrated the point in this way: 'It is unprecedented in public policy to invite a recipient of public money to dictate how much they want to receive. I do not give pocket money to my children on the basis of how much they want to receive; I give it to them on the basis of how much I think they need and how much I can afford. I think that those principles generally govern government financing and they should be applied in the case of higher education.'


The architect of HECS, Professor Bruce Chapman, agreed that the ability of students to defer payment of fees through income-contingent loans would increase pressure on the federal budget. Professor Chapman made a point that Labor has also argued many times since the government unveiled its higher education proposals in the budget last year. Under a deregulated system there would be no real price competition between institutions, because of the deferred payment scheme and the peculiar nature of the education market.


Anyone who is aware of the experience of deregulation overseas knows this to be true. There is no example of fees falling after deregulation, because in the so-called education market fees are perceived to be an indicator of quality. The implications of this for smaller and regional universities are obvious: they would be in a bind. If they do not raise fees, they risk losing students who are wealthy enough to pay higher fees—or who are beneficiaries of the misleadingly named 'Commonwealth scholarships'—to the lures of sandstone universities in the capital cities. But if regional and suburban universities do raise fees, they will impose a heavy burden on the disadvantaged or mature-age students who form a disproportionately high share of their enrolments. As the vice-chancellor of the University of South Australia, Professor David Lloyd, has said:


I don't want unfettered deregulation. In many regards deregulation becomes a group of universities saying 'Trust us, we won't overcharge you.' But to be honest, the public deserves certainty about what the structure of fees would look like.


Research-intensive regional universities—universities like Newcastle, Deakin and Wollongong, which have been steadily moving up global rankings on the basis of their excellent research—would be particularly hard hit by such a regime. Compared with the Group of Eight universities, their capacity to attract the best research students and to fund new projects would go backwards.


That is how Christopher Pyne's Americanised system would take shape. But the minister has not acknowledged the looming budgetary disaster in the system he is attempting to impose upon this country. Indeed, he has failed to release any modelling on the impacts of his radical agenda—no modelling of fees, of HECS debts, or anything. He is happy to pander lies about various perceptions of Labor's models to any newspaper journalist that will take them. He has, however, implicitly conceded that deregulation would lead to massive fee hikes.


In a flurry of negotiations with crossbench senators over the last few weeks, he has floated a proposal for a great big new tax on universities and their students. The suggestion was that universities that raise fees too steeply would be forced to pay what the Minister Pyne prefers to call a fine or levy into consolidated revenue. This is not a new idea. It was also briefly considered by the Tory government in the United Kingdom, when fees were deregulated there. That government—the Minister's ideological cousins— rejected the idea because a tax or fine or levy would cause fees to spiral up; they would not go down. Universities would cover their costs by passing them on to students who would have to pay this great big new tax.


That is the reality of a deregulated system. Fees will rise, pushing the dream of a university education further and further out of reach for increasing numbers of people. And rising fees will create an unsustainable burden for the Commonwealth budget. Under the Abbott government's short-sighted and irresponsible plan, Australia would end up—like Britain—having a system that, to quote the UK Higher Education Commission, 'represents the worst of both worlds, where all parties feel that they are getting a bad deal' and under which government is effectively funding universities 'by writing off student debt rather than investing directly in teaching grants.' 


That is the disaster passing this bill would unleash on the Australian higher education system. The government continues stumbling blithely towards that disaster, regardless of what the Australian people have clearly indicated they do not want. Labor knows that people expect governments to fund universities properly—to meet their obligations and pay their bills. The oft-heard claim that there is no political will for increased public provision in the funding of higher education is simply not true. The Australian people have consistently indicated otherwise, and that is the ground on which Labor will continue to contest the government's plans for a deregulated, increasingly privatised and increasingly Americanised university system.


Regardless of what happens to this bill in the Senate, we will be taking this fight to the next election. If we can assume the minister is telling the truth for once, we know the Liberals will, too—so we will have a hell of a contest for the forthcoming election on this incredibly important issue. We shall force the government to do what it did not do with the current proposals—submit its plans for higher education to the verdict of the people. That is a contest we will relish. These proposals constitute just one of the Abbott government's many broken election promises. Before the last election, the man who is now Prime Minister promised that there would be no cuts to education and no changes to the existing funding arrangements for universities. In fact, he went down to Universities Australia and said that his policy was 'masterly inactivity'. And what do we have? The most radical changes, the most dramatic changes, being proposed since John Dawkins's day—and they are being done as secret budget measures. There has been no white paper, certainly no green paper, no proper discussion—just an ambush on budget night. 


The government has broken faith with the Australian people on its promises. In doing so, they have taken universities and the Australian people for granted. If they have their way, universities will be able to charge whatever they want—and the losers in that equation are the Australian people. Social justice will be impeded, prosperity will be impeded, and universities will suffer dramatically as we develop a two-tiered system based on a perfidy of a proposition that you can always get what you want if you have the capacity to pay. It would give aid and comfort to the coalition's fundamental belief that this is a rich man's country yet. We shall not let that proposition be forgotten, and we will fight this issue right through to the next election and beyond.

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2015-03-17,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (12:55):  The Greens oppose the Higher Education and Research Reform Bill 2014. What a saga Minister Pyne has inflicted on the people of Australia! For months, students, prospective students and their families have been living with uncertainty about their university prospects. Will they be able to afford to go? What is going to happen with the way our universities are managed? 


Minister Pyne has done nothing but create uncertainty for these people. He has done this not only through the destructive aspects of the bill itself but also through the way he has conducted the debate. Let us remember: a bill very similar to the one we are now debating was decisively defeated in December last year. Immediately the minister—not learning the lessons, not recognising it was time to have real consultation—put a similar bill back into the House of Representatives. The minister, by calling himself 'Mr Fixer' and telling us that he is out there creating solutions, is deceiving nobody but himself and maybe a few others in the Abbott bunker. So many of the tactics we have seen in recent weeks—particularly what he came up with yesterday—have been about trying to quarantine the Abbott government from another embarrassing defeat. 


There will be a number of speakers in this debate who will clearly set out how damaging this bill is. I congratulate the many concerned people—education unions, students, staff members—who are committed to building a higher education system of the highest standard. Yesterday, while Minister Pyne was doing his backflips, many students were out there taking action and being very vocal about it. I particularly wanted to congratulate Kyol Blakeney, the SRC president at the University of Sydney. With his colleagues, he was protesting, through civil disobedience, at the university. Those sorts of actions are needed because Minister Pyne and the Abbott government have gone too far with what they are trying to do in higher education. 


The defeat of the previous bill last year was a significant win for the education unions and for tens of thousands of staff and students, as well as for all those looking forward to a university education—which is their right. It was an important step because, for the moment anyway, we had safeguarded our universities from the neoliberal policies of this government. These are policies which, at the end of the day, are about heaping the cost burden of higher education onto students and their families. That is the real intent of this bill. We need to remember where the original bill came from: it was a budget measure. Purely and simply, it was about saving the government $5 billion. That is what it was about; it was about ripping $5 billion out of our public universities and shifting the cost burden to students.


The bill before us now is nothing new. It is just back to the old ways of the Liberal and National parties—another free market plan. I think it relevant to compare the old bill and the new bill. The old bill, as I said, projected savings of about $5 billion. The new bill before us has estimated savings of about $640 million. Some of the key provisions of the original bill remain. It is important to note that because it underlines the very poor tactics of the minister. He is not fooling anybody when he just brings back basically the same measures in a new bill, this time hoping he can get his way by trying to embarrass crossbenchers, by using a bit of intimidation or through a bit of blackmail. We have seen all those tactics rolled out.


Some of the key provisions that remain in this bill—




Senator O'Sullivan:
  On a point of order, Mr President: this is a repeat of yesterday—references to blackmail and intimidation. Those references are directed at the minister. The senator had to withdraw those references yesterday and I recommend that you ask her to withdraw them today.



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Rhiannon, I ask you to exercise some caution in your contribution to the debate.




Senator RHIANNON:
  I was identifying those provisions in this bill that the Senate has already debated in great detail—and rejected. This is very relevant. Those provisions include 20 per cent cuts to Commonwealth supported places. That is still in this legislation. I will come to the comments the minister has made on this issue. Other provisions which are still in this bill include the deregulation of course fees so that universities can charge students whatever fees they want; the lowering of the Higher Education Loan Program, or HELP, repayment threshold; the increase in the proportion of the loan burden carried by students; and the extension of Commonwealth supported places to sub-bachelor and bachelor courses offered by private universities and non-university higher education providers, as well as to sub-bachelor courses offered by public providers. In addition, there are real cuts to this country's research funding in this bill. As we know, the minister was highly deceptive about the $150 million that was allocated for those 1,700 scientific workers. We know that is not in the bill, but there were research cuts in the former bill and there are again in this bill. Those cuts represent a 10 per cent reduction in the Research Training Scheme. 


Also included in both bills are the misnamed Commonwealth scholarships, which are funded from increased fee income—the requirement that $1 in every $5 be put aside by universities for these scholarships. I call them 'misnamed' because they are another example of the deception that has become the trademark of this minister. Many members here would have benefited from the old Commonwealth scholarships. These were scholarships where the government provided money to assist people to go to university. With the current form of Commonwealth scholarships being proposed by Minister Pyne, no government money will go into them. The scheme is purely based on getting money from the students who are paying fees and putting it into these so-called Commonwealth scholarships. Those are the similarities between the old bill and the new bill.


In the couple of months since the first bill was introduced, we have seen support for the government's position fall away. This is where we need to consider one of those main blocs that the minister has relied on to make out that he has sector support. How many times have we heard the minister talk about how all of the vice-chancellors support him bar one? Many of us in here have heard privately from vice-chancellors who hold great disquiet about how the minister is conducting the debate and about what is in this legislation. Some of them are on the record. Peter Dawkins, the vice-chancellor of Victoria University, has said that the government should acknowledge that its deregulation plan will not pass the Senate. He has actually talked about a third way. We may not agree with that, but he is certainly not solidly there with the minister as he makes out. The University of Technology, Sydney, Vice-Chancellor Attila Brungs and Swinburne University of Technology Vice-Chancellor Linda Kristjanson have also questioned how these tactics are playing out. So it is not the solid bloc that the minister makes out.


Those vice-chancellors are representative of the senior management within their universities. They are not representative of the majority of staff and the majority of students. I do need to put on the record at this point that it has been disappointing the way many of those vice-chancellors have not represented the whole university sector that they surely lead and should be a representative voice for. I think that has done their own universities a disservice, as well as the wider sector.


Then we come to what we heard yesterday from the minister, with his latest plan to split the bill so that we deal with deregulation on the one hand and the 20 per cent cut on the other hand. What we need to note right at the beginning is that the 20 per cent cut—the $5 billion that the government was trying to save in the first place, and then a reduced amount in the bill before us now—is only a deferral. It is only a tactic for the minister to try to make out that he has listened and has changed the legislation. There is no significant change in this at all. It is another deception. It is really a tactic to save the skin of the minister and those in the Abbott bunker. I say that most definitely because the government looks set to lose one of the major pieces of the 2014 budget that still has not been passed. Five billion dollars is not a small amount. They have already watered it down but they are trying to deal with the whole issue of university funding within their neoliberal philosophy, which is based on putting the costs onto ordinary people and not ensuring that the revenue streams are there to pay for this most important part of how our society is organised.


To repeat again, Minister Pyne is not abandoning his 20 per cent cut to university funding. His proposal is nothing more than to split it off from the deregulation bill for just a six-month deferral. Fee deregulation, let's remember, will result in significant fee increases. That is what is deeply alarming. There is a wider understanding within the community now that that could mean even higher than the $100,000 price tag that has been linked with a number of degrees in some courses. That is really troubling many people. That is what is bringing the uncertainty to so many students and families. It has been such a very ugly part of the way the minister has conducted this debate.


Often, when we talk about the quantity in these fees, because the Greens have done a lot of work in this area, I acknowledge that sometimes criticism comes about our modelling. But our modelling is out there. No flaws have been identified and put on the table. But when you look at the government, they have not released their modelling. To this day, they refuse to release their modelling. If Minister Pyne's comments could be believed, the modelling would help give greater insight into how his promises and his commitments would really play out.


I repeat, this is a very important part with what we are dealing with here, because the landscape appeared to changed yesterday when the minister spoke. This 20 per cent cut for Commonwealth-supported places would have an extraordinary impact on the budget if the government was sincere. This is where their credibility, again, comes into question. If the 20 per cent cut to CSP funding did not go ahead, the minister's higher education policies, which were meant to contribute to budget repair, would now cost the budget about $1.4 billion. So we have gone from the first bill saving $5 billion to the second bill saving about $680 million. Then, if the minister was successful in carrying forward his plan, it would appear that, if you follow through the logic the minister was putting out there—not that I am saying the minister was very logical about it—you come to the conclusion that there would be a $1.4 billion cost burden on the budget. I think it would be wise for the minister to come in on this aspect of the debate in his reply to the debate on this bill and comment on that very fact. Surely, the government need to come clean with what their plans are. Otherwise, if they do not—like they would not release their modelling—you are left with the clear understanding that all those manoeuvres yesterday were nothing more than a tactic to try to muddy the waters and to present that something had changed to try to get through the bill at the eleventh hour when, clearly, the degree to which they are being discredited is just increasing.


We have also heard from the minister a great deal about how our universities rank on the international stage. Often he is quite critical in saying how he wants more universities in the top rankings. Yes, the university system at the moment could be improved; yes, it needs more funding. But it is not this massive failure that this minister makes out. And, similarly, our standing internationally is not the disaster or so poor as the minister makes out. The data shows that Australia does not have just a few world-class universities; in fact, we have a world-class system. In addition to the eight universities which make the world's top 200, there are a further 12 universities which make the 200 to 400 group. 


So, again, our universities have not failed. We can be proud of them. Yes, we need to get this debate about the future of higher education onto a proper consultative basis with the wider university sector and the community. We need to debate how higher education can be funded in a secure way—not the haphazard and destructive way the minister has conducted himself.


Just staying with these international comparisons, I also want to deal with the issue of the OECD figures, that provide very useful information on the level of tertiary funding. Public funding of tertiary education in 2011 in Australia is 0.7 per cent of GDP. This is below the OECD average, which is at 1.1 per cent. So, again, this is where we are in a very poor position. We have been below the OECD average for a long time. And that goes to failures under both the previous, Labor government and this coalition government, where public investment in higher education has not been given the priority that is needed. It is already too low in Australia and we need to remember that it is the responsibility of the government and not the students to fix this. 


Throughout this debate in the wider community, as the government has attempted to bring in legislation—the first round and this second round—there have been many groups that have come to this place to lobby us and to raise their concerns. The National Union of Students and the National Tertiary Education Union are two of those who have provided very useful information. 


The National Union of Students have submitted that the inclusion of $100 million over three years for the structural adjustment fund is simply an offset of the government's decision not to extend eligibility for Youth Allowance and Austudy. I want to touch on this issue of a structural adjustment fund, because that was something else that the government decided to introduce.  And I would argue that it really is an admission of failure, and highlights a fundamental inequity that is at the heart of this bill. The government came up with this. It is another one of Mr Pyne's attempts to win support for this legislation. He talks about pausing indexation for primary carers of children under the age of five. Clearly, that group of people often suffer considerable discrimination but, again, all we have ended up with here—it is up there in lights—is that this whole way of managing our higher education system is highly discriminatory.


The National Tertiary Education Union have also taken up this issue. They have identified that the SAF was introduced in recognition that deregulation is likely to have a severely adverse impact on regional and rural universities and those serving students that are highly sensitive to the cost of attending university. The change is intended to provide funding to assist providers in a transition to a post-deregulation environment. That, again, sets out very clearly the problems in so many aspects of this legislation that we have before us.


This is legislation that should not be before this House. By far the bulk of it has already been considered and has already been voted down. It is, again, a very poor attempt by the minister to get his way. This legislation is destructive, both in terms of the impact that it would have on individual students, who would be carrying the huge debt burden for much of their lives—many would never be able to pay it off—and also destructive of the very fabric of our society. It is no way to run a higher education system, to build an educated, innovative nation by penalising students and their families and pushing the cost burden onto those people rather than the government accepting its responsibility. If you are in government a key part of your job is to pay for the higher education system. This bill should be defeated.

"Reynolds, Sen Linda",LP,2015-03-17,"



Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (13:12):  I rise today to speak on the Higher Education and Research Reform Amendment Bill 2014. Those opposite talk about free education a lot, but education has never been free. It is expensive. And it is subsidised by hard-working Australian taxpayers. The issue for us in this place today is to find a fair and reasonable balance to ensure that our higher education system is sustainable into the future. But it is also about ensuring our graduates are able to compete with the best and the brightest in the world in the industries of the future, and not in the industries of the past. 


I want to bring the debate back to where it always should have been focused—that is, on the future. Despite what those opposite would have the public believe, these reforms are all about students, which is why the higher education sector overwhelmingly supports these reforms—because they know that a problem delayed is a problem denied. In fact, 40 out of 41 vice-chancellors in Australia support these reforms. 


It was in 1974 that the Whitlam government assumed full funding for universities and abolished student fees. It was successful in increasing higher education student numbers. But in 1989 the Hawke Labor government realised it was reasonable and necessary to ensure that those who benefited from higher education make a small contribution to the cost of their education when they were in a position to repay the loan. 


In 2015 we need to look at reforming the system to adapt to the challenges of our time—the 21st century. Those opposite continue to promulgate the old, outdated class warfare rhetoric—which again we have heard from the first two speakers—harking back to the good old days of 1974, when higher education became a cost borne exclusively by the Australian taxpayer. 


The world today looks very different from the way it looked 40 years ago. Perhaps fittingly, in 1974 the most popular song was Barbara Streisand's smash hit The Way We Were; and the Time Warp had just become a musical hit. In 1974, in my home town of Perth, the median house price was just over $18,000 and today it stands at over half a million dollars. In 1974, the science fiction writer Arthur C Clarke made a very bold claim: that one day a computer would be sitting on every desk. That year also saw the first use of the word internet. How times have changed in 40 years. In 1974, China's gross domestic product stood at around US$158 per capita. It is now nearly US$7,000 per capita.


The simple fact of the matter is that the world today is not the same as it was in 1974. Times change and we must change with them. Today higher education is one of Australia's most successful newer export industries. Education is now Australia's fourth largest export earner and higher education comprises two-thirds of all those exports. But, without change to the funding model, Australia will start falling behind. The value of our higher education commodity will decrease, and an important part of our economy will decline, instead of increasing and booming into the future as it should. Today our students are competing with graduates from all over the world for the jobs of the future, in industries we now need to transition to. We need, and our higher education system needs, to adapt if we are to keep up with the times and the changes.


At the heart of the reforms the government is proposing is the idea that universities should be free to set their own fees and to compete for students. That is the part of the equation on which those opposite wilfully mislead the public. It is not only about increasing fees; it is about competition between the universities. Competition will enhance quality and make higher education providers more responsive to the needs of students and of the labor market more widely. The fact is that, when universities and colleges compete, students are certainly the winners. The question we should ask ourselves is: what lies ahead for our students and institutions, and in fact for the future of our nation, if these reforms are defeated? What are the consequences for our children and our grandchildren who will find it increasingly difficult to compete with international graduates as the quality of Australia's higher education sector declines and becomes less and less internationally relevant?


The scare campaign currently being run by the opposition and the Greens is, I believe, an irresponsible attempt to shift the focus and derail the reforms. It is, pretty much, a very cheap political tactic. Currently our universities face a herculean, or mammoth, challenge, competing with the best universities in Europe and North America—and now also with the fast-developing and extraordinarily hungry universities across Asia. They, unlike our universities, are not shackled to the past. They are free to compete and to innovate and to make sure they meet the needs of the industries of the 21st century. Last week, the Times Higher Education World Reputation Rankings listed only five—that is: five—Australian universities in the top 100 in the world. That should set alarm bells ringing throughout not only this chamber but all of Australia. Only five of the top international universities are now Australian. In 2013 there were six—and the decline continues.


I am sure every politician, every teacher, every student and in fact every Australian would like to see more Australian universities ranked among the finest in the world. The question is how to make this a reality. As they say, hope is not a method. Doing nothing, or hoping things will improve for the sector, will simply continue to send us backwards. As Universities Australia have themselves warned us: if this bill does not pass, Australian higher education will certainly decline inevitably into mediocrity and will be overtaken by increasingly intense international competition. Without changes to the current funding model Australian universities will bleed financially. They will be forced to make cuts which will narrow the study options available for students. This will see student-to-staff ratios gradually decrease and reduce the overall quality of higher education in Australia. I do not for a second believe that the status quo is an option, and it is certainly not an option in the best interest of all Australians.


The unfortunate truth for those opposite is that Australian universities will continue to struggle to compete with the best in the world if they continue to be constrained by an outdated funding model. Those opposite, sadly, would rather see Australia stand still while the rest of the world is adapting, and adapting very rapidly, to changing circumstances. Their intransigence has consequences—and I think very dire consequences—for us all.


What alternative have those opposite put forward? Surprisingly, given all their rhetoric on this issue, Labor has yet to propose a single credible alternative to our higher education reforms. Instead, in fact, between 2011 and 2013, Labor announced cuts of over $6.5 billion to higher education and research. The facts are quite different to the rhetoric we continue to hear from the Labor Party today. On the reforms this government has proposed, Labor has rejected the advice of prominent people within its own party—in fact, advice from a conga line of eminent members of their own party including, most recently, Peter Beattie, who has quite clearly and unequivocally warned that we risk becoming a dumb country if these reforms are not passed. It is not us saying this; it is Peter Beattie saying that we risk becoming a dumb country if these reforms are not implemented. And it is not just Peter Beattie. There are many more on the Labor side who have been giving the Labor Party and the Greens advice that these reforms are necessary. They include Gareth Evans, John Dawkins and Maxine McKew, who have publicly pleaded with the Labor Party to support these reforms or, at the very least, engage in constructive discussions—pleas which have all fallen on deaf ears with those opposite.


Probably in the most extraordinary turn of events, last week Labor rejected the proposals of Professor Bruce Chapman—the father of HECS, an eminent education economist and a former Labor adviser. Labor rejected his proposals a mere 24 hours after his proposals were announced. I would have thought that any proposal put forward by Professor Chapman would be worthy of more than 24 hours consideration, particularly as we have just heard Senator Carr 30 minutes ago discussing Professor Chapman's credentials and his credibility—a mere 24 hours, not remotely credible. 


The old adage, 'Don't bring me problems; bring me solutions' is very applicable here. Labor's decision to block constructive ideas and proposals without offering credible alternatives is shameful and irresponsible. Quite frankly, I think it is playing politics at the expense of the next generation. Although Labor have refused to come to the discussion table at all on this important policy area, the government have demonstrated it is very willing to work with the crossbenches to achieve outcomes that are both fair and reasonable. What has happened with respect to those discussions? 


Proposals from Senator Day, Senator Madigan and Senator Muir have been included in the new higher education reform bill. For example, HECS indexation will be capped at CPI rather than at the bond rate; there will be a freeze on HECS indexation for primary caregivers of children under the age of five; and additional scholarships will be offered through the higher education participation program—all as a result of the government working successfully with the crossbench to get the best possible outcome for Australian students. Just imagine if the Labor Party or the Greens had come to the negotiation table at any point in this discussion what we could have achieved together for Australian students.


If this bill does not pass, an estimated 80,000 students will miss out on Commonwealth support each year by 2018—utterly shameful. Many of these students, often from the most disadvantaged families, will need to pay full fees to complete their studies and others will simply miss out on higher education altogether. Those who are forced to abandon their studies will be severely disadvantaged in their working lives and that is an extraordinarily shameful legacy for those opposite and a burden for them to carry. 


The Commonwealth scholarship scheme proposed under this legislation is in fact the biggest scholarship scheme in Australia's history and, despite what those opposite have claimed, it is aimed squarely at helping disadvantaged students and is one of the most important and valuable elements of this reform package. Under the scheme, institutions will be able to provide tailored, individualised support to help disadvantaged students to meet their own personal needs, including costs of attending, participating in or succeeding in higher education. Without the passage of the bill, thousands more potential recipients will miss out on this vital support.


In politics it is often the case that a scare campaign beats good policy debate and I think this is a classic example of that with what we are seeing here today. However, the future of our higher education institutions, our students and our economy is far more deserving than what we are currently getting from those opposite. Labor and the Greens continue to make wildly exaggerated and quite frankly untrue claims, and again today in this chamber, of the cost of tuition if these reforms are passed. Really, $100,000 degrees! They know and we know that that is simply not true. There is not a shred of evidence to demonstrate that that is true. It demonstrates that they have no concept of what competition can bring. Competition in this case is good. It brings out better reforms. There is no suggestion of $100,000 degrees anywhere. That is simply untrue.


Another myth, one of the many perpetuated by those opposite, is that disadvantaged students will be negatively impacted by these reforms. That could not be further from the truth and, again, those opposite know that. In fact, on deregulated fees, the shadow Assistant Treasurer Andrew Leigh has said, 'There is no reason to think that it will adversely affect poor students.' That is not us saying it; that is their own shadow Assistant Treasurer Andrew Leigh saying that, and their shadow Assistant Treasurer is absolutely correct.


Let us take a minute to have a look at the United Kingdom. In 2005, the Blair government lifted the cap on university fees. In 2011, the coalition government led by David Cameron almost tripled the cap. Due to the additional bursaries and scholarships that were then available, university participants from lower socioeconomic groups were not adversely affected and in fact increased significantly. The data shows that 18-year-olds from the most disadvantaged areas in England were 12 per cent more likely to enter university in 2013 than they were before the reforms.


Another myth, again perpetuated by those opposite today, is that students will have to pay up-front. The reality has been since the introduction of HECS that no student pays a cent up-front and that no graduate will have to pay anything until they are earning over $50,000 a year. Again, here is another complete untruth put out by those opposite to scare students and parents alike.


The reforms tabled in this place today will require all universities and other higher education providers to spend one dollar in every five of additional revenue on scholarships and for disadvantaged students. In fact, recent announcements from some of Australia's top universities have indicated that there will be more support for disadvantaged students than ever before. For example, the University of Sydney alone has pledged to extend financial support to one-third of its 27,000 undergraduates. The University of Western Australia has also made a similar announcement.


I would like to finish by speaking about the positive impacts these reforms will have on students in regional areas. In my home state of Western Australia, higher education participation rates among 15- to 24-year-olds sit at 5.3 per cent, much lower than metropolitan participation rates, which are at nearly 12 per cent. Over 30 per cent of regional students relocate to study, with over 75 percent of this group relocating to Perth. Given the sheer size of Western Australia, this can result in regional students having to pay up to $20,000 a year to live in Perth away from home and away from family support in their home towns.


Under this legislation, regional education providers will have the opportunity to offer more courses and will be able to compete to attract more students in their home locations. In practice this means that a student living in the Pilbara may not have to uproot their life 1,500 kilometres away to Perth to study. Regional education providers, such as the Pilbara Institute, will be able to expand the number of courses they offer, giving regional Australians more choice in higher education where they live. Additionally, universities operating regional campuses in Western Australia—such as UWA, the University of Notre Dame, Curtin University and Edith Cowan University—will receive a regional loading in recognition of the higher cost of operating regional campuses. The government will be investing $274 million for this purpose. That is an overwhelmingly good thing for those students and families who live in regional Western Australia and other parts of regional Australia.


Let's make no mistake here: these changes are vital to Australia's higher education sector, to our students and to the future of our economy. There are simply no viable alternatives to these reforms. Certainly we have heard not a single one from those opposite. Without reform, our higher education sector will stall in an increasingly competitive international market. That is a fact. Universities may not close their doors but, as the university vice-chancellors themselves have said, the quality of higher education in Australia will decrease significantly. They will become less competitive, leaving our students to bear the consequences of not being prepared for future industries and the competitive international environment. In the end, the casualties of this bill being defeated will be our students and that is in no way acceptable and is a complete abrogation of our responsibility in this place. As I said, a problem delayed is a problem denied. In this case, it would have devastating consequences. I commend this bill to the Senate. (Time expired)

"Lines, Sen Susan",ALP,2015-03-17,"



Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (13:32):  As we would expect, we have heard nothing but myths and great legends from those opposite. Let me put on the record where Labor's reforms are. Labor's reforms are currently being well received in the higher ed sector. The reforms that we implemented in government are working. They have been well received. There is no evidence at all before the Senate or, indeed, anywhere in Australia that those reforms which Labor implemented are not working.


Let's have a look at all these thought bubbles we saw from the Abbott government just last week. Was it a tax? Was it a fine? What was it? It was a tax. There was a thought bubble put to the government that it entertain taxing universities that charge fees above a certain limit. They would be taxed at 20 per cent and then 60 per cent and then 80 per cent, depending on how high the fees went. So badly thought out was that thought bubble that in a speech in this place last week I pointed out that the University of Western Australia in my state of Western Australia would actually be paying more to the government in taxes than it would be receiving in subsidies. What a ridiculous notion. Of course, Labor and a number of scholars and academics were very quick to point out to the government that the tax was just an absolute nonsense.


The other thing is that, if this is such a wonderful package, if it is going to so advance the lives of students and make sure that disadvantaged students get to university—I have to say that under Labor's reforms that are currently in place we had record numbers of students from disadvantaged backgrounds attending universities, but of course you will never hear that from the Abbott government—students would be welcoming it. But in all of the evidence I have heard—and I have sat on all of the Senate inquiries, unlike most of those opposite—I have not heard any student organisation say that this is a good package and that somehow it is going to be an advantage for them. Not one single student organisation—not the National Union of Students, not the postgraduate students and not the medical students—have said that this is a package that is going to be of advantage to them.


Let's not forget for one minute where this whole package started from. Just a little over 18 months ago, we started with a Prime Minister who said there would be no cuts to education. That was the basis for this most radical reform that we are now seeing in our higher education sector. It is based on the premise of the Prime Minister, who said days before the September election there would be no cuts to education. All of Australia knows now that that was not true. This promise of no cuts to education just goes on a very long list of broken promises from this chaotic Abbott government.


Nothing illustrates the chaos of the Abbott government more than these higher education bills. We have had so many that it is a bit hard to keep up with what is happening. The reform in higher ed is the most radical in the history of our universities. What serious analysis was there in the construction of these bills? It seems just any thought bubbles which escape from Minister Pyne's office or, in fact, the last best idea from a conversation he has seems to emerge as another higher education bill. Quite frankly, you cannot build quality reform in a six-month time frame. You cannot build quality reform post the budget. You certainly cannot build quality reform when you do not speak to anyone about your intentions.


We started with that cast-iron guarantee that there would be no cuts to education from now on, but it would seem that the Prime Minister has not thought that out—certainly it is questionable whether there was any debate. It appears there was no consultation with the sector, economists, or academics. It is very clear from our questions at Senate estimates that, prior to the budget, there was no consultation with universities. Post the budget there has been consultation. That is because there has been such an outcry about these radical proposals. The government somehow thought that the community would embrace them. This is radical reform. Let us not kid ourselves: this is the most radical reform we have seen in the higher education sector; yet, it would seem there was no input from anyone before the idea was announced.


Absent from this bill is any notion of independent advice, and there is no evidence of a considered process involving consultation, evaluation and analysis. Indeed, fee deregulation has been presented as the one and only quick-fix solution to a sustainable higher education sector in Australia. What nonsense! Like most of the rhetoric from the Abbott government, their rhetoric is that, somehow, universities are at some kind of tipping point and for Australian universities to remain high quality this radical reform is needed. But where is the proof? Where is the considered analysis? When you start from the premise of just 18 months ago of 'no cuts to education', it surely means that there wasn't considered consultation before the budget. There has been no green paper and there has been no white paper. In evidence, the universities told us that they were not given much of an opportunity to have input. That is typical of this government. We know that in most areas where the government are pursuing conservative Tea Party ideologies that have failed in other countries there is no evidence of consultation with the sectors involved.


Labor has asked over and over: 'Give us some indication of the consultation.' The very best we got from the Department of Education and Training in evidence is that it had consulted post budget. I think that was a matter of damage control because there was such an outcry. Once the government's radical reform was out, and there were huge protests and a massive outcry, that is when they consulted. We have seen that over and over again—for example, the thought bubble on the GP tax, which was put out there: 'Yep, we're going to do this. Suck it up. Too bad. It is happening.' Suddenly, there was an outcry and a huge backlash from the medical profession. Now, the Abbott government are trying to hoodwink Australians that it is out there consulting. That is their modus operandi. That is how they operate. They throw it out there and see how it lands. If there is a hue and cry they will go out and pretend to do a consultation. It is not as if the GP tax is off the table. It is just put away until they can work out a time to get it through. It is the same with this higher education reform. I heard Minister Pyne on the radio this morning trying to get a medal for presenting the bill over and over. How many times do you have to present the higher ed bill before you give up? How many times do you have to be told by the Australian public 'We don't like your reforms' before you give up? Mr Pyne does not deserve a medal. He should take his reforms off the table and think about where to go next. He should talk to people and consult. But, no, he thinks he deserves a medal for keeping on keeping on. What a ridiculous notion that is. Again, like the GP tax, there has been no consultation, and that will resurface again too.


There is no evidence of any consultation on the development of their $100,000 university degrees or their 20 per cent cuts, which are off the table. But Minister Pyne has told us that they are coming back, just like the GP tax, at some later date. Labor argues that the Abbott government, with its combined budget cuts and the provision of this higher education package, are creating their own tipping point. The tipping point is the threat of this higher education package. The package threatens participation, attainment and the quality of our own current successful system. In the words of Professor Stephen Parker, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Canberra:


… we should not be taking risks with this. In the absence of evidence, modelling and time for consultation, we should be taking this carefully. The stakes are very high.


This Abbott government package was completely unexpected. It was lobbed on the Australian higher education sector off the back of the promise of 'no cuts to education'. As the Australia Institute, in its submission to the Senate inquiry, asserted, there has been no properly, well-informed debate and there are no clearly articulated goals of how this radical reform will serve the public interest. Moreover, it is imperative that all Australians have a clear understanding of arguments for and against any proposed changes to the higher education system and the mechanisms by which such changes will be achieved.


Then of course there was the false and misleading advertising, a significant waste of taxpayers' dollars from a government supposedly so concerned about taxpayers' dollars. On 7 December 2014, the Abbott government launched a taxpayer funded advertising campaign designed to address supposed misunderstandings about higher education funding and the changes contained in the HERR bill at that time, which has now been defeated. The $14.6 million campaign spanned television, radio, newspapers, digital media, social media and bus shelters. The purpose-built campaign website featured video, infographics and a true-or-false quiz. If we applied a true-or-false quiz to the Abbott government false would come up most of the time.


The short-term interim guidelines on information and advertising campaigns by Australian government departments and agencies, which were in effect when the Secretary of the Department of Education and Training certified the campaign as compliant, stipulate that all campaign materials should be presented in an objective, fair and accessible manner. The guidelines specifically state:


Where information is presented as a fact, it should be accurate and verifiable. When making a factual comparison, the material should not attempt to mislead the recipient about the situation with which the comparison is made and it should state explicitly the basis for the comparison.


The government's advertising campaign presents misleading, unverifiable figures as fact and offers no information about the basis of its calculations. Policy experts have questioned the accuracy of the government's claims, with Andrew Norton noting that, regardless of their veracity, the figures used are 'not particularly meaningful in the first place'. It is so typical of the Abbott government: it seems to think that, if it says it over and over really loudly and it insults everyone else, somehow it makes the campaign believable. Well, it does not. Truth and facts are what the Australian people want.


The guidelines require that advertising campaigns be instigated on the basis of a demonstrated need. While there has been some attempt to use unverifiable anecdotes and third-party market research to justify the campaign, there is no demonstrated need for a wide-scale, multimillion dollar advertising campaign, using taxpayers' dollars, to promote a bill that has not yet passed the parliament. On Minister Pyne's own reflections on the radio interview I heard this morning, the legislation is unlikely to pass this place once again.


The campaign does not address the bill's core policy objectives, instead offering misleading and meaningless assurances to prospective students and the broader public. It is clear the campaign has been developed not to address demonstrated need but rather in response to the negative reaction to the government's proposed changes  from students, education providers and the Australian public. Let us be clear: it is students who will carry the $100,000 debt. And not one student organisation has yet to tick off and sign up to the government's reforms. The reforms are universally rejected by students right across this country.


The campaign's clear political purpose breaches the guidelines, which require that 'Campaign materials must not try to foster a positive impression of a particular political party or promote party political interests.' The current system works. The Senate inquiry received overwhelming evidence that the current higher education system is sustainable and high quality. For example, Mr Ben Phillips and Professor Parker argued: 


… at the moment student contributions are already quite high in Australia from an OECD perspective. The Australian university system appears to be working very well: we have 19 universities in the top 500 and on a per capita basis we are ranked fourth in the world. We are very attractive for international students, and the international market is very healthy here in Australia. I guess we are not quite sure what the problem is. That is something that needs to be explained.


When we heard evidence on the first bill, all of the universities that gave evidence—and many of them, or their representative umbrella groups, did—said that international students are a very lucrative market for Australia's higher education sector. They all want to continue to be able to encourage international students to come to Australia to study. The Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations also said that the current system is workable and would ultimately produce better future outcomes for the Australian higher education sector. Australia Needs a Brighter Future agreed with the notion that the current arrangements for the funding of the higher education sector are preferable to those proposed in the reform package.


Labor believes that fee deregulation is unnecessary. Education policy analyst Professor Louise Watson argued that evidence obtained in the Higher Education Base Funding Review, chaired by Jane Lomax-Smith, which reported in October 2011, led to the conclusion that Australian universities were doing very well. In discussing the fee deregulation proposal, Professor Watson argued that it was a further impost on the Commonwealth budget and that it would be more unpredictable than the removal of caps on funded places, stating:


I have always been puzzled as to why fee deregulation was necessary or deemed necessary. I have never understood the problem it was meant to fix. From where I stand, it seems like fee deregulation will simply compound the problems currently facing the government in terms of university financing, not solve them. 


This is what happens when we put Minister Pyne's thought bubble into a higher education reform package. If there had been some consultation, and if indeed the Australian public had been put on notice that there were going to be cuts and changes to education, we would have been able to have a for-and-against debate. We would have been able to have experts providing input. But no: the Abbott government, in its usual way of pushing through, denied everyone that opportunity. Expert after expert is saying that this is not the way to go. What is it that we are trying to fix? Nobody quite understands that. 


The National Union of Students contended that fee deregulation would result in decreased opportunities, accessibility and equity for students and provided evidence before the committee that deregulation, as proposed, will be unpredictable and unsustainable. All of the student organisations reject fee deregulation out of hand. The National Tertiary Education Union noted that 'nobody, including the government, seems clear as to the rationale or underlying principles of the proposed policy framework'. 


Those are the reasons that Labor will not be supporting the Higher Education and Research Reform Bill. We do not see the need for it. There is no clear evidence being put forward. Therefore, we will continue our opposition to it.

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (13:52):  I am really pleased to follow Senator Lines and to respond to the absurd arguments that have been put by Senator Lines and others. It is a telling reflection of the quality of debate in this place at times when we hear an argument like the one we have just heard from Senator Lines. It was absurd and ridiculous. I want to go to some of the most ridiculous parts of it, because it encapsulates what is going on here. We have Senator Lines saying, 'There is no-one supporting this reform.' Her evidence is to trot out the views of the National Union of Students. The NUS is against it and therefore it must be a bad idea.


Let's go through some of the supporters of this reform, who, I think, have a fair degree more credibility than the National Union of Students—on which the Labor Party is basing their opposition. On the one hand, on the 'no' side, we have the National Union of Students and on the 'yes' side we have Universities Australia, the Innovative Research Universities, the Regional Universities Network, the Australian Technology Network, the Group of Eight, the TAFE Directors Association, the Council of Private Higher Education, various university leaders and 40 out of 41 vice chancellors. 




Senator Cameron:
  The students still come out on top!




Senator SESELJA:
  You say the students, Senator Cameron, but the National Union of Students—the far left union organisation—does not represent most students. I do not know when you last went to university, but when I was at the ANU—




Senator Cameron:
  I was too busy to go to university.



The PRESIDENT:  Order on my left!




Senator SESELJA:
  its left-wing student union refused for years to join the NUS because it was so far left. You can rely on the National Union of Students, but we will listen to expert after expert who is saying—



Senator Rhiannon interjecting—




Senator SESELJA:
  Senator Rhiannon, who takes her advice from the National Union of Students and the Green Left Weekly, is shouting across the chamber and saying that there are some other voices. I have not heard the views of the Green Left Weekly. I suspect the Green Left Weeklyis against the reform. I do not know, Senator Payne, whether you are aware of the Green Left Weekly's views, but Senator Milne is speaking next and so we can look forward to hearing them.


The Business Council, ACCI, the list goes on and on. There is a good reason that you have the NUS on the one side and all these experts on the other and that is: all these experts have considered the issue. What is even more concerning about the contribution of Senator Lines in this debate is that she was saying: 'There really isn't any problem. We don't have to fix anything, because we have a perfect system and we don't need to reform it.' That is absolute rubbish, and Senator Lines knows that it is rubbish; the Labor Party knows that it is rubbish; 40 out of 41 vice chancellors know that it is rubbish; every peak body knows that it is rubbish. There is a simple reason that it is absolute rubbish. We have seen a deregulation of student numbers, so the numbers are no longer capped and we are going to see a significant growth in student numbers. That is something we can celebrate; we are going to see more people have access to higher education. Yet the former government, as well as this government, recognised that there is no blank cheque; there is not an unlimited amount of public money that can go in, as those student numbers rise. 


Unless you acknowledge and unless you are going to take the Kim Carr approach and look to cap student numbers, you need to acknowledge that there will be a significant rise in people accessing our universities and that there is a limit to the amount that taxpayers can subsidise those students, and then you have to reform. You have to ask for a greater private contribution, and that is at the heart of this reform. If you deny it, as Senator Lines just did, you are putting your head in the sand and pretending that there is not a problem, when blind Freddie could see that there is. To go further than that, the likes of Senator Lines and the Labor Party are effectively calling all of these people liars. When they talk about the $100,000 degrees, they are calling the university vice chancellors liars. They are saying that the whole sector cannot be trusted, even when they announce what their fee structure is going to be. Some universities have already put out their fee structures, which makes a lie of the Labor Party's scare campaign, yet those opposite pretend either that they did not hear or that the whole sector is simply telling lies. This is a serious debate, and it deserves better contributions than what we have heard to date.—




Senator Kim Carr:
  You will have to sit down, then!




Senator SESELJA:
  It does not deserve contributions from the likes of Senator Carr who now wants to cap student numbers. That is the Senator Carr policy—the new Labor Party policy is to put a cap on student numbers—




Senator Kim Carr:
  We will put a cap on you. Put your D cap on!



The PRESIDENT:  On my left!




Senator SESELJA:
  If you are not going put a cap on student numbers, Senator Carr, then you are not going to be able to afford it. What we will see is an ever-declining university sector. The modern Labor Party, with its head in the sand and ignoring all of the experts, is now saying that they stand for a cap on student numbers or a decline in the quality of higher education in this country. We happen to take a different view, and that is why this legislation is important—




Senator Cameron:
  Why did the Liberals lie before the election? Just answer the question.




Senator SESELJA:
  Senator Cameron, NUS might be very important to you, but we believe that 40 out 41 vice chancellors, all the peak bodies that represent higher education, the Business Council of Australia, the Regional Universities Network—all of these groups we take more seriously than the National Union of Students. Senator Lines informed the chamber today that there is nothing to see here—there is no problem to fix in our university sector. We can all walk away; not worry about it; leave it as it is; she'll be right. Well, Mr President, we happen to have a very different view. The facts happen to support a very different case. We certainly will not be taking the advice that Senator Lines and the Labor Party do from the National Union of Students.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Higher Education and Research Reform Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2015-03-17,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (12:33):  I rise to speak on the Higher Education and Research Reform Bill 2014. For 10 months the Abbott government has pursued an unfair, unnecessary and ideologically driven agenda to restructure higher education in this country. The agenda is unfair, because allowing universities to charge whatever fees they want will drive up the cost of degrees. It will impose crippling debt on students and deny to many of them the opportunity in life that a university education can offer.


The agenda is unnecessary, because the so-called funding crisis that has been used to justify fee deregulation does not exist. The only crisis was the one that the government contrived by its threatened 20 per cent cut to the funding of student places. The minister announced yesterday that the cut will be the subject of separate legislation, by which he means in effect that there will have to be an amendment to the current legislation. The minister announced yesterday, that is to say, that the government was going to pursue this, and pursue it if this matter were defeated in the Senate, having said previously that the matter would be put to rest by the end of March. The government has contrived the funding crisis, but now the minister has moved away from that proposition because he thought it was suddenly, to use his word, a 'distraction'. Yet the government still insists that fee deregulation is necessary


This is because the government's real agenda is an ideological one, as has been apparent from the very beginning. This bill and its failed predecessor were never intended to build world-class universities in Australia, as the Minister for Education and Training continues to pretend. Australia already has world-class universities, as anyone familiar with the global university ranking systems will know, and Australia's university system—and I want to emphasise the word 'system'—is routinely ranked amongst the very best. As the vice-chancellor of the University of Canberra, Professor Stephen Parker, has said:


More Australian universities appear in world rankings than a decade ago, courtesy of the current funding system … there is … nothing in the world-rankings of Australian universities to suggest a problem, let alone a crisis. 


The Government's real motive is the withdrawal of public provision in higher education. The Pyne plan, if it becomes law, would usher in the creeping privatisation of the system. The minister wants an Americanised system, with very few already wealthy universities charging high fees for an elite education while the rest become less and less able to compete on equal terms. It would be a world of $100,000 degrees and of constant degradation of the system, and a world in which debt on student loans and fee inflation become major social and economic problems. In the United States, fee levels have been rising at twice the inflation rate for the past decade, and student debt is spiralling out of control. Total debt on student loans exceeds credit card debts.


The Abbott government has failed to deceive the Australian people about its intentions. Australians know we already have a strong and competitive university system. They know what an Americanised system would mean. From the beginning, they have seen the Pyne plan for what it is. They know that it is an attack on the Australian dream—an attack on the fair go that every generation of Australians rightly deserves. They know that opportunity and access to education go hand in hand. They know the doubling and tripling of the cost of degrees can only mean that there will be fewer and fewer opportunities for those who do not have private wealth.


The Australian people are not fools and have consistently and overwhelmingly rejected the perfidious Pyne plan. Even the attempt to spend $15 million of taxpayers' money on a slick but misleading ad campaign did absolutely nothing to help Minister Pyne win public support for his trashing of the Australian fair go. Unable to con the voters, the minister has increasingly resorted to desperate measures to try to bully the Senate into passing this bill. He tried to link continued funding of the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy to passing the bill. NCRIS was never part of this bill, but the minister, who could not win the argument over deregulation, decided to make Australia's research facilities hostage to the bill's success. He put at risk the jobs of 1,700 scientists and technicians in 27 facilities, 35,000 research projects and Australia's future as a nation committed to the advancement of knowledge through pure and applied research. As the Nobel laureate Professor Brian Schmidt said, it was not the way a grown-up country behaves. And he should know; this is a man who came to Australia from the US because our facilities and universities offered the opportunity to do excellent research.


Even those who would normally be regarded as the allies of the coalition were absolutely appalled by the minister's linkage of this bill to funding for NCRIS. The chair of the Business Council of Australia, Catherine Livingstone, said:


How have we come to a point where a Government feels that it can use assets publicly funded to the tune of over $2 billion over the past decade ... as a hostage in a political process?


The minister lost support all round because of his NCRIS threat—including, reportedly, from some members of his own party.


The government has lost all credibility on its higher education plans. It has lost credibility with the wider public and has done so on the very basic principle that they have defied the essential ingredient of equity in higher education. It has also lost credibility with the experts because its proposals threaten the system's financial sustainability.


Unregulated fees would drive up inflation as has happened in the US. The cost of living would increase for every Australian. The budget papers already show that total HELP debt is expected to increase from $ 25 billion today to $52 billion by 2017-18. And this estimate does not take into account the blow-out in debt if universities are given a blank cheque to set their own fees.


NATSEM modelling, using the government's own data and very conservative assumptions about fee increases, shows that doubtful debt could easily rise from 17 per cent to 30 per cent off a larger debt base. It is clear what that would mean. The taxpayer would carry the can for these inequitable policies. Universities would be funded through debt write-downs and interest subsidies rather than through manageable direct grants, and until yesterday all this was supposed to have been done in the name of resolving a make-believe funding crisis.


As the debate about the government's short-sighted policies has gone on, the minister has been well and truly hoisted on his own petard. He has attained dizzying heights of absurdity as his fiscal rationale has unravelled. It would be absolutely farcical if its consequences were not so dire.


Senators will be left in no doubt about the apprehensions within the sector over fee deregulation if they read the submissions to the Senate inquiry into the principles of the bill. Professor Louise Watson, an education policy analyst at the University of Canberra and a member of the 2011 base funding review, said this about the minister's proposals for relinquishing control of higher education fees while at the same time retaining responsibility for paying them through HECS:


University Vice-Chancellors would henceforth decide how much public money they wanted to receive. Whatever graduates cannot repay due to price increases and declining graduate earnings, will be sheeted home to the federal budget. As the ballooning HECS debt in the VET sector has demonstrated, fee deregulation would simply make Australian higher education less predictable, less affordable and less sustainable in the future.


Professor Watson illustrated the point in this way: 'It is unprecedented in public policy to invite a recipient of public money to dictate how much they want to receive. I do not give pocket money to my children on the basis of how much they want to receive; I give it to them on the basis of how much I think they need and how much I can afford. I think that those principles generally govern government financing and they should be applied in the case of higher education.'


The architect of HECS, Professor Bruce Chapman, agreed that the ability of students to defer payment of fees through income-contingent loans would increase pressure on the federal budget. Professor Chapman made a point that Labor has also argued many times since the government unveiled its higher education proposals in the budget last year. Under a deregulated system there would be no real price competition between institutions, because of the deferred payment scheme and the peculiar nature of the education market.


Anyone who is aware of the experience of deregulation overseas knows this to be true. There is no example of fees falling after deregulation, because in the so-called education market fees are perceived to be an indicator of quality. The implications of this for smaller and regional universities are obvious: they would be in a bind. If they do not raise fees, they risk losing students who are wealthy enough to pay higher fees—or who are beneficiaries of the misleadingly named 'Commonwealth scholarships'—to the lures of sandstone universities in the capital cities. But if regional and suburban universities do raise fees, they will impose a heavy burden on the disadvantaged or mature-age students who form a disproportionately high share of their enrolments. As the vice-chancellor of the University of South Australia, Professor David Lloyd, has said:


I don't want unfettered deregulation. In many regards deregulation becomes a group of universities saying 'Trust us, we won't overcharge you.' But to be honest, the public deserves certainty about what the structure of fees would look like.


Research-intensive regional universities—universities like Newcastle, Deakin and Wollongong, which have been steadily moving up global rankings on the basis of their excellent research—would be particularly hard hit by such a regime. Compared with the Group of Eight universities, their capacity to attract the best research students and to fund new projects would go backwards.


That is how Christopher Pyne's Americanised system would take shape. But the minister has not acknowledged the looming budgetary disaster in the system he is attempting to impose upon this country. Indeed, he has failed to release any modelling on the impacts of his radical agenda—no modelling of fees, of HECS debts, or anything. He is happy to pander lies about various perceptions of Labor's models to any newspaper journalist that will take them. He has, however, implicitly conceded that deregulation would lead to massive fee hikes.


In a flurry of negotiations with crossbench senators over the last few weeks, he has floated a proposal for a great big new tax on universities and their students. The suggestion was that universities that raise fees too steeply would be forced to pay what the Minister Pyne prefers to call a fine or levy into consolidated revenue. This is not a new idea. It was also briefly considered by the Tory government in the United Kingdom, when fees were deregulated there. That government—the Minister's ideological cousins— rejected the idea because a tax or fine or levy would cause fees to spiral up; they would not go down. Universities would cover their costs by passing them on to students who would have to pay this great big new tax.


That is the reality of a deregulated system. Fees will rise, pushing the dream of a university education further and further out of reach for increasing numbers of people. And rising fees will create an unsustainable burden for the Commonwealth budget. Under the Abbott government's short-sighted and irresponsible plan, Australia would end up—like Britain—having a system that, to quote the UK Higher Education Commission, 'represents the worst of both worlds, where all parties feel that they are getting a bad deal' and under which government is effectively funding universities 'by writing off student debt rather than investing directly in teaching grants.' 


That is the disaster passing this bill would unleash on the Australian higher education system. The government continues stumbling blithely towards that disaster, regardless of what the Australian people have clearly indicated they do not want. Labor knows that people expect governments to fund universities properly—to meet their obligations and pay their bills. The oft-heard claim that there is no political will for increased public provision in the funding of higher education is simply not true. The Australian people have consistently indicated otherwise, and that is the ground on which Labor will continue to contest the government's plans for a deregulated, increasingly privatised and increasingly Americanised university system.


Regardless of what happens to this bill in the Senate, we will be taking this fight to the next election. If we can assume the minister is telling the truth for once, we know the Liberals will, too—so we will have a hell of a contest for the forthcoming election on this incredibly important issue. We shall force the government to do what it did not do with the current proposals—submit its plans for higher education to the verdict of the people. That is a contest we will relish. These proposals constitute just one of the Abbott government's many broken election promises. Before the last election, the man who is now Prime Minister promised that there would be no cuts to education and no changes to the existing funding arrangements for universities. In fact, he went down to Universities Australia and said that his policy was 'masterly inactivity'. And what do we have? The most radical changes, the most dramatic changes, being proposed since John Dawkins's day—and they are being done as secret budget measures. There has been no white paper, certainly no green paper, no proper discussion—just an ambush on budget night. 


The government has broken faith with the Australian people on its promises. In doing so, they have taken universities and the Australian people for granted. If they have their way, universities will be able to charge whatever they want—and the losers in that equation are the Australian people. Social justice will be impeded, prosperity will be impeded, and universities will suffer dramatically as we develop a two-tiered system based on a perfidy of a proposition that you can always get what you want if you have the capacity to pay. It would give aid and comfort to the coalition's fundamental belief that this is a rich man's country yet. We shall not let that proposition be forgotten, and we will fight this issue right through to the next election and beyond.

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2015-03-17,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (12:55):  The Greens oppose the Higher Education and Research Reform Bill 2014. What a saga Minister Pyne has inflicted on the people of Australia! For months, students, prospective students and their families have been living with uncertainty about their university prospects. Will they be able to afford to go? What is going to happen with the way our universities are managed? 


Minister Pyne has done nothing but create uncertainty for these people. He has done this not only through the destructive aspects of the bill itself but also through the way he has conducted the debate. Let us remember: a bill very similar to the one we are now debating was decisively defeated in December last year. Immediately the minister—not learning the lessons, not recognising it was time to have real consultation—put a similar bill back into the House of Representatives. The minister, by calling himself 'Mr Fixer' and telling us that he is out there creating solutions, is deceiving nobody but himself and maybe a few others in the Abbott bunker. So many of the tactics we have seen in recent weeks—particularly what he came up with yesterday—have been about trying to quarantine the Abbott government from another embarrassing defeat. 


There will be a number of speakers in this debate who will clearly set out how damaging this bill is. I congratulate the many concerned people—education unions, students, staff members—who are committed to building a higher education system of the highest standard. Yesterday, while Minister Pyne was doing his backflips, many students were out there taking action and being very vocal about it. I particularly wanted to congratulate Kyol Blakeney, the SRC president at the University of Sydney. With his colleagues, he was protesting, through civil disobedience, at the university. Those sorts of actions are needed because Minister Pyne and the Abbott government have gone too far with what they are trying to do in higher education. 


The defeat of the previous bill last year was a significant win for the education unions and for tens of thousands of staff and students, as well as for all those looking forward to a university education—which is their right. It was an important step because, for the moment anyway, we had safeguarded our universities from the neoliberal policies of this government. These are policies which, at the end of the day, are about heaping the cost burden of higher education onto students and their families. That is the real intent of this bill. We need to remember where the original bill came from: it was a budget measure. Purely and simply, it was about saving the government $5 billion. That is what it was about; it was about ripping $5 billion out of our public universities and shifting the cost burden to students.


The bill before us now is nothing new. It is just back to the old ways of the Liberal and National parties—another free market plan. I think it relevant to compare the old bill and the new bill. The old bill, as I said, projected savings of about $5 billion. The new bill before us has estimated savings of about $640 million. Some of the key provisions of the original bill remain. It is important to note that because it underlines the very poor tactics of the minister. He is not fooling anybody when he just brings back basically the same measures in a new bill, this time hoping he can get his way by trying to embarrass crossbenchers, by using a bit of intimidation or through a bit of blackmail. We have seen all those tactics rolled out.


Some of the key provisions that remain in this bill—




Senator O'Sullivan:
  On a point of order, Mr President: this is a repeat of yesterday—references to blackmail and intimidation. Those references are directed at the minister. The senator had to withdraw those references yesterday and I recommend that you ask her to withdraw them today.



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Rhiannon, I ask you to exercise some caution in your contribution to the debate.




Senator RHIANNON:
  I was identifying those provisions in this bill that the Senate has already debated in great detail—and rejected. This is very relevant. Those provisions include 20 per cent cuts to Commonwealth supported places. That is still in this legislation. I will come to the comments the minister has made on this issue. Other provisions which are still in this bill include the deregulation of course fees so that universities can charge students whatever fees they want; the lowering of the Higher Education Loan Program, or HELP, repayment threshold; the increase in the proportion of the loan burden carried by students; and the extension of Commonwealth supported places to sub-bachelor and bachelor courses offered by private universities and non-university higher education providers, as well as to sub-bachelor courses offered by public providers. In addition, there are real cuts to this country's research funding in this bill. As we know, the minister was highly deceptive about the $150 million that was allocated for those 1,700 scientific workers. We know that is not in the bill, but there were research cuts in the former bill and there are again in this bill. Those cuts represent a 10 per cent reduction in the Research Training Scheme. 


Also included in both bills are the misnamed Commonwealth scholarships, which are funded from increased fee income—the requirement that $1 in every $5 be put aside by universities for these scholarships. I call them 'misnamed' because they are another example of the deception that has become the trademark of this minister. Many members here would have benefited from the old Commonwealth scholarships. These were scholarships where the government provided money to assist people to go to university. With the current form of Commonwealth scholarships being proposed by Minister Pyne, no government money will go into them. The scheme is purely based on getting money from the students who are paying fees and putting it into these so-called Commonwealth scholarships. Those are the similarities between the old bill and the new bill.


In the couple of months since the first bill was introduced, we have seen support for the government's position fall away. This is where we need to consider one of those main blocs that the minister has relied on to make out that he has sector support. How many times have we heard the minister talk about how all of the vice-chancellors support him bar one? Many of us in here have heard privately from vice-chancellors who hold great disquiet about how the minister is conducting the debate and about what is in this legislation. Some of them are on the record. Peter Dawkins, the vice-chancellor of Victoria University, has said that the government should acknowledge that its deregulation plan will not pass the Senate. He has actually talked about a third way. We may not agree with that, but he is certainly not solidly there with the minister as he makes out. The University of Technology, Sydney, Vice-Chancellor Attila Brungs and Swinburne University of Technology Vice-Chancellor Linda Kristjanson have also questioned how these tactics are playing out. So it is not the solid bloc that the minister makes out.


Those vice-chancellors are representative of the senior management within their universities. They are not representative of the majority of staff and the majority of students. I do need to put on the record at this point that it has been disappointing the way many of those vice-chancellors have not represented the whole university sector that they surely lead and should be a representative voice for. I think that has done their own universities a disservice, as well as the wider sector.


Then we come to what we heard yesterday from the minister, with his latest plan to split the bill so that we deal with deregulation on the one hand and the 20 per cent cut on the other hand. What we need to note right at the beginning is that the 20 per cent cut—the $5 billion that the government was trying to save in the first place, and then a reduced amount in the bill before us now—is only a deferral. It is only a tactic for the minister to try to make out that he has listened and has changed the legislation. There is no significant change in this at all. It is another deception. It is really a tactic to save the skin of the minister and those in the Abbott bunker. I say that most definitely because the government looks set to lose one of the major pieces of the 2014 budget that still has not been passed. Five billion dollars is not a small amount. They have already watered it down but they are trying to deal with the whole issue of university funding within their neoliberal philosophy, which is based on putting the costs onto ordinary people and not ensuring that the revenue streams are there to pay for this most important part of how our society is organised.


To repeat again, Minister Pyne is not abandoning his 20 per cent cut to university funding. His proposal is nothing more than to split it off from the deregulation bill for just a six-month deferral. Fee deregulation, let's remember, will result in significant fee increases. That is what is deeply alarming. There is a wider understanding within the community now that that could mean even higher than the $100,000 price tag that has been linked with a number of degrees in some courses. That is really troubling many people. That is what is bringing the uncertainty to so many students and families. It has been such a very ugly part of the way the minister has conducted this debate.


Often, when we talk about the quantity in these fees, because the Greens have done a lot of work in this area, I acknowledge that sometimes criticism comes about our modelling. But our modelling is out there. No flaws have been identified and put on the table. But when you look at the government, they have not released their modelling. To this day, they refuse to release their modelling. If Minister Pyne's comments could be believed, the modelling would help give greater insight into how his promises and his commitments would really play out.


I repeat, this is a very important part with what we are dealing with here, because the landscape appeared to changed yesterday when the minister spoke. This 20 per cent cut for Commonwealth-supported places would have an extraordinary impact on the budget if the government was sincere. This is where their credibility, again, comes into question. If the 20 per cent cut to CSP funding did not go ahead, the minister's higher education policies, which were meant to contribute to budget repair, would now cost the budget about $1.4 billion. So we have gone from the first bill saving $5 billion to the second bill saving about $680 million. Then, if the minister was successful in carrying forward his plan, it would appear that, if you follow through the logic the minister was putting out there—not that I am saying the minister was very logical about it—you come to the conclusion that there would be a $1.4 billion cost burden on the budget. I think it would be wise for the minister to come in on this aspect of the debate in his reply to the debate on this bill and comment on that very fact. Surely, the government need to come clean with what their plans are. Otherwise, if they do not—like they would not release their modelling—you are left with the clear understanding that all those manoeuvres yesterday were nothing more than a tactic to try to muddy the waters and to present that something had changed to try to get through the bill at the eleventh hour when, clearly, the degree to which they are being discredited is just increasing.


We have also heard from the minister a great deal about how our universities rank on the international stage. Often he is quite critical in saying how he wants more universities in the top rankings. Yes, the university system at the moment could be improved; yes, it needs more funding. But it is not this massive failure that this minister makes out. And, similarly, our standing internationally is not the disaster or so poor as the minister makes out. The data shows that Australia does not have just a few world-class universities; in fact, we have a world-class system. In addition to the eight universities which make the world's top 200, there are a further 12 universities which make the 200 to 400 group. 


So, again, our universities have not failed. We can be proud of them. Yes, we need to get this debate about the future of higher education onto a proper consultative basis with the wider university sector and the community. We need to debate how higher education can be funded in a secure way—not the haphazard and destructive way the minister has conducted himself.


Just staying with these international comparisons, I also want to deal with the issue of the OECD figures, that provide very useful information on the level of tertiary funding. Public funding of tertiary education in 2011 in Australia is 0.7 per cent of GDP. This is below the OECD average, which is at 1.1 per cent. So, again, this is where we are in a very poor position. We have been below the OECD average for a long time. And that goes to failures under both the previous, Labor government and this coalition government, where public investment in higher education has not been given the priority that is needed. It is already too low in Australia and we need to remember that it is the responsibility of the government and not the students to fix this. 


Throughout this debate in the wider community, as the government has attempted to bring in legislation—the first round and this second round—there have been many groups that have come to this place to lobby us and to raise their concerns. The National Union of Students and the National Tertiary Education Union are two of those who have provided very useful information. 


The National Union of Students have submitted that the inclusion of $100 million over three years for the structural adjustment fund is simply an offset of the government's decision not to extend eligibility for Youth Allowance and Austudy. I want to touch on this issue of a structural adjustment fund, because that was something else that the government decided to introduce.  And I would argue that it really is an admission of failure, and highlights a fundamental inequity that is at the heart of this bill. The government came up with this. It is another one of Mr Pyne's attempts to win support for this legislation. He talks about pausing indexation for primary carers of children under the age of five. Clearly, that group of people often suffer considerable discrimination but, again, all we have ended up with here—it is up there in lights—is that this whole way of managing our higher education system is highly discriminatory.


The National Tertiary Education Union have also taken up this issue. They have identified that the SAF was introduced in recognition that deregulation is likely to have a severely adverse impact on regional and rural universities and those serving students that are highly sensitive to the cost of attending university. The change is intended to provide funding to assist providers in a transition to a post-deregulation environment. That, again, sets out very clearly the problems in so many aspects of this legislation that we have before us.


This is legislation that should not be before this House. By far the bulk of it has already been considered and has already been voted down. It is, again, a very poor attempt by the minister to get his way. This legislation is destructive, both in terms of the impact that it would have on individual students, who would be carrying the huge debt burden for much of their lives—many would never be able to pay it off—and also destructive of the very fabric of our society. It is no way to run a higher education system, to build an educated, innovative nation by penalising students and their families and pushing the cost burden onto those people rather than the government accepting its responsibility. If you are in government a key part of your job is to pay for the higher education system. This bill should be defeated.

"Reynolds, Sen Linda",LP,2015-03-17,"



Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (13:12):  I rise today to speak on the Higher Education and Research Reform Amendment Bill 2014. Those opposite talk about free education a lot, but education has never been free. It is expensive. And it is subsidised by hard-working Australian taxpayers. The issue for us in this place today is to find a fair and reasonable balance to ensure that our higher education system is sustainable into the future. But it is also about ensuring our graduates are able to compete with the best and the brightest in the world in the industries of the future, and not in the industries of the past. 


I want to bring the debate back to where it always should have been focused—that is, on the future. Despite what those opposite would have the public believe, these reforms are all about students, which is why the higher education sector overwhelmingly supports these reforms—because they know that a problem delayed is a problem denied. In fact, 40 out of 41 vice-chancellors in Australia support these reforms. 


It was in 1974 that the Whitlam government assumed full funding for universities and abolished student fees. It was successful in increasing higher education student numbers. But in 1989 the Hawke Labor government realised it was reasonable and necessary to ensure that those who benefited from higher education make a small contribution to the cost of their education when they were in a position to repay the loan. 


In 2015 we need to look at reforming the system to adapt to the challenges of our time—the 21st century. Those opposite continue to promulgate the old, outdated class warfare rhetoric—which again we have heard from the first two speakers—harking back to the good old days of 1974, when higher education became a cost borne exclusively by the Australian taxpayer. 


The world today looks very different from the way it looked 40 years ago. Perhaps fittingly, in 1974 the most popular song was Barbara Streisand's smash hit The Way We Were; and the Time Warp had just become a musical hit. In 1974, in my home town of Perth, the median house price was just over $18,000 and today it stands at over half a million dollars. In 1974, the science fiction writer Arthur C Clarke made a very bold claim: that one day a computer would be sitting on every desk. That year also saw the first use of the word internet. How times have changed in 40 years. In 1974, China's gross domestic product stood at around US$158 per capita. It is now nearly US$7,000 per capita.


The simple fact of the matter is that the world today is not the same as it was in 1974. Times change and we must change with them. Today higher education is one of Australia's most successful newer export industries. Education is now Australia's fourth largest export earner and higher education comprises two-thirds of all those exports. But, without change to the funding model, Australia will start falling behind. The value of our higher education commodity will decrease, and an important part of our economy will decline, instead of increasing and booming into the future as it should. Today our students are competing with graduates from all over the world for the jobs of the future, in industries we now need to transition to. We need, and our higher education system needs, to adapt if we are to keep up with the times and the changes.


At the heart of the reforms the government is proposing is the idea that universities should be free to set their own fees and to compete for students. That is the part of the equation on which those opposite wilfully mislead the public. It is not only about increasing fees; it is about competition between the universities. Competition will enhance quality and make higher education providers more responsive to the needs of students and of the labor market more widely. The fact is that, when universities and colleges compete, students are certainly the winners. The question we should ask ourselves is: what lies ahead for our students and institutions, and in fact for the future of our nation, if these reforms are defeated? What are the consequences for our children and our grandchildren who will find it increasingly difficult to compete with international graduates as the quality of Australia's higher education sector declines and becomes less and less internationally relevant?


The scare campaign currently being run by the opposition and the Greens is, I believe, an irresponsible attempt to shift the focus and derail the reforms. It is, pretty much, a very cheap political tactic. Currently our universities face a herculean, or mammoth, challenge, competing with the best universities in Europe and North America—and now also with the fast-developing and extraordinarily hungry universities across Asia. They, unlike our universities, are not shackled to the past. They are free to compete and to innovate and to make sure they meet the needs of the industries of the 21st century. Last week, the Times Higher Education World Reputation Rankings listed only five—that is: five—Australian universities in the top 100 in the world. That should set alarm bells ringing throughout not only this chamber but all of Australia. Only five of the top international universities are now Australian. In 2013 there were six—and the decline continues.


I am sure every politician, every teacher, every student and in fact every Australian would like to see more Australian universities ranked among the finest in the world. The question is how to make this a reality. As they say, hope is not a method. Doing nothing, or hoping things will improve for the sector, will simply continue to send us backwards. As Universities Australia have themselves warned us: if this bill does not pass, Australian higher education will certainly decline inevitably into mediocrity and will be overtaken by increasingly intense international competition. Without changes to the current funding model Australian universities will bleed financially. They will be forced to make cuts which will narrow the study options available for students. This will see student-to-staff ratios gradually decrease and reduce the overall quality of higher education in Australia. I do not for a second believe that the status quo is an option, and it is certainly not an option in the best interest of all Australians.


The unfortunate truth for those opposite is that Australian universities will continue to struggle to compete with the best in the world if they continue to be constrained by an outdated funding model. Those opposite, sadly, would rather see Australia stand still while the rest of the world is adapting, and adapting very rapidly, to changing circumstances. Their intransigence has consequences—and I think very dire consequences—for us all.


What alternative have those opposite put forward? Surprisingly, given all their rhetoric on this issue, Labor has yet to propose a single credible alternative to our higher education reforms. Instead, in fact, between 2011 and 2013, Labor announced cuts of over $6.5 billion to higher education and research. The facts are quite different to the rhetoric we continue to hear from the Labor Party today. On the reforms this government has proposed, Labor has rejected the advice of prominent people within its own party—in fact, advice from a conga line of eminent members of their own party including, most recently, Peter Beattie, who has quite clearly and unequivocally warned that we risk becoming a dumb country if these reforms are not passed. It is not us saying this; it is Peter Beattie saying that we risk becoming a dumb country if these reforms are not implemented. And it is not just Peter Beattie. There are many more on the Labor side who have been giving the Labor Party and the Greens advice that these reforms are necessary. They include Gareth Evans, John Dawkins and Maxine McKew, who have publicly pleaded with the Labor Party to support these reforms or, at the very least, engage in constructive discussions—pleas which have all fallen on deaf ears with those opposite.


Probably in the most extraordinary turn of events, last week Labor rejected the proposals of Professor Bruce Chapman—the father of HECS, an eminent education economist and a former Labor adviser. Labor rejected his proposals a mere 24 hours after his proposals were announced. I would have thought that any proposal put forward by Professor Chapman would be worthy of more than 24 hours consideration, particularly as we have just heard Senator Carr 30 minutes ago discussing Professor Chapman's credentials and his credibility—a mere 24 hours, not remotely credible. 


The old adage, 'Don't bring me problems; bring me solutions' is very applicable here. Labor's decision to block constructive ideas and proposals without offering credible alternatives is shameful and irresponsible. Quite frankly, I think it is playing politics at the expense of the next generation. Although Labor have refused to come to the discussion table at all on this important policy area, the government have demonstrated it is very willing to work with the crossbenches to achieve outcomes that are both fair and reasonable. What has happened with respect to those discussions? 


Proposals from Senator Day, Senator Madigan and Senator Muir have been included in the new higher education reform bill. For example, HECS indexation will be capped at CPI rather than at the bond rate; there will be a freeze on HECS indexation for primary caregivers of children under the age of five; and additional scholarships will be offered through the higher education participation program—all as a result of the government working successfully with the crossbench to get the best possible outcome for Australian students. Just imagine if the Labor Party or the Greens had come to the negotiation table at any point in this discussion what we could have achieved together for Australian students.


If this bill does not pass, an estimated 80,000 students will miss out on Commonwealth support each year by 2018—utterly shameful. Many of these students, often from the most disadvantaged families, will need to pay full fees to complete their studies and others will simply miss out on higher education altogether. Those who are forced to abandon their studies will be severely disadvantaged in their working lives and that is an extraordinarily shameful legacy for those opposite and a burden for them to carry. 


The Commonwealth scholarship scheme proposed under this legislation is in fact the biggest scholarship scheme in Australia's history and, despite what those opposite have claimed, it is aimed squarely at helping disadvantaged students and is one of the most important and valuable elements of this reform package. Under the scheme, institutions will be able to provide tailored, individualised support to help disadvantaged students to meet their own personal needs, including costs of attending, participating in or succeeding in higher education. Without the passage of the bill, thousands more potential recipients will miss out on this vital support.


In politics it is often the case that a scare campaign beats good policy debate and I think this is a classic example of that with what we are seeing here today. However, the future of our higher education institutions, our students and our economy is far more deserving than what we are currently getting from those opposite. Labor and the Greens continue to make wildly exaggerated and quite frankly untrue claims, and again today in this chamber, of the cost of tuition if these reforms are passed. Really, $100,000 degrees! They know and we know that that is simply not true. There is not a shred of evidence to demonstrate that that is true. It demonstrates that they have no concept of what competition can bring. Competition in this case is good. It brings out better reforms. There is no suggestion of $100,000 degrees anywhere. That is simply untrue.


Another myth, one of the many perpetuated by those opposite, is that disadvantaged students will be negatively impacted by these reforms. That could not be further from the truth and, again, those opposite know that. In fact, on deregulated fees, the shadow Assistant Treasurer Andrew Leigh has said, 'There is no reason to think that it will adversely affect poor students.' That is not us saying it; that is their own shadow Assistant Treasurer Andrew Leigh saying that, and their shadow Assistant Treasurer is absolutely correct.


Let us take a minute to have a look at the United Kingdom. In 2005, the Blair government lifted the cap on university fees. In 2011, the coalition government led by David Cameron almost tripled the cap. Due to the additional bursaries and scholarships that were then available, university participants from lower socioeconomic groups were not adversely affected and in fact increased significantly. The data shows that 18-year-olds from the most disadvantaged areas in England were 12 per cent more likely to enter university in 2013 than they were before the reforms.


Another myth, again perpetuated by those opposite today, is that students will have to pay up-front. The reality has been since the introduction of HECS that no student pays a cent up-front and that no graduate will have to pay anything until they are earning over $50,000 a year. Again, here is another complete untruth put out by those opposite to scare students and parents alike.


The reforms tabled in this place today will require all universities and other higher education providers to spend one dollar in every five of additional revenue on scholarships and for disadvantaged students. In fact, recent announcements from some of Australia's top universities have indicated that there will be more support for disadvantaged students than ever before. For example, the University of Sydney alone has pledged to extend financial support to one-third of its 27,000 undergraduates. The University of Western Australia has also made a similar announcement.


I would like to finish by speaking about the positive impacts these reforms will have on students in regional areas. In my home state of Western Australia, higher education participation rates among 15- to 24-year-olds sit at 5.3 per cent, much lower than metropolitan participation rates, which are at nearly 12 per cent. Over 30 per cent of regional students relocate to study, with over 75 percent of this group relocating to Perth. Given the sheer size of Western Australia, this can result in regional students having to pay up to $20,000 a year to live in Perth away from home and away from family support in their home towns.


Under this legislation, regional education providers will have the opportunity to offer more courses and will be able to compete to attract more students in their home locations. In practice this means that a student living in the Pilbara may not have to uproot their life 1,500 kilometres away to Perth to study. Regional education providers, such as the Pilbara Institute, will be able to expand the number of courses they offer, giving regional Australians more choice in higher education where they live. Additionally, universities operating regional campuses in Western Australia—such as UWA, the University of Notre Dame, Curtin University and Edith Cowan University—will receive a regional loading in recognition of the higher cost of operating regional campuses. The government will be investing $274 million for this purpose. That is an overwhelmingly good thing for those students and families who live in regional Western Australia and other parts of regional Australia.


Let's make no mistake here: these changes are vital to Australia's higher education sector, to our students and to the future of our economy. There are simply no viable alternatives to these reforms. Certainly we have heard not a single one from those opposite. Without reform, our higher education sector will stall in an increasingly competitive international market. That is a fact. Universities may not close their doors but, as the university vice-chancellors themselves have said, the quality of higher education in Australia will decrease significantly. They will become less competitive, leaving our students to bear the consequences of not being prepared for future industries and the competitive international environment. In the end, the casualties of this bill being defeated will be our students and that is in no way acceptable and is a complete abrogation of our responsibility in this place. As I said, a problem delayed is a problem denied. In this case, it would have devastating consequences. I commend this bill to the Senate. (Time expired)

"Lines, Sen Susan",ALP,2015-03-17,"



Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (13:32):  As we would expect, we have heard nothing but myths and great legends from those opposite. Let me put on the record where Labor's reforms are. Labor's reforms are currently being well received in the higher ed sector. The reforms that we implemented in government are working. They have been well received. There is no evidence at all before the Senate or, indeed, anywhere in Australia that those reforms which Labor implemented are not working.


Let's have a look at all these thought bubbles we saw from the Abbott government just last week. Was it a tax? Was it a fine? What was it? It was a tax. There was a thought bubble put to the government that it entertain taxing universities that charge fees above a certain limit. They would be taxed at 20 per cent and then 60 per cent and then 80 per cent, depending on how high the fees went. So badly thought out was that thought bubble that in a speech in this place last week I pointed out that the University of Western Australia in my state of Western Australia would actually be paying more to the government in taxes than it would be receiving in subsidies. What a ridiculous notion. Of course, Labor and a number of scholars and academics were very quick to point out to the government that the tax was just an absolute nonsense.


The other thing is that, if this is such a wonderful package, if it is going to so advance the lives of students and make sure that disadvantaged students get to university—I have to say that under Labor's reforms that are currently in place we had record numbers of students from disadvantaged backgrounds attending universities, but of course you will never hear that from the Abbott government—students would be welcoming it. But in all of the evidence I have heard—and I have sat on all of the Senate inquiries, unlike most of those opposite—I have not heard any student organisation say that this is a good package and that somehow it is going to be an advantage for them. Not one single student organisation—not the National Union of Students, not the postgraduate students and not the medical students—have said that this is a package that is going to be of advantage to them.


Let's not forget for one minute where this whole package started from. Just a little over 18 months ago, we started with a Prime Minister who said there would be no cuts to education. That was the basis for this most radical reform that we are now seeing in our higher education sector. It is based on the premise of the Prime Minister, who said days before the September election there would be no cuts to education. All of Australia knows now that that was not true. This promise of no cuts to education just goes on a very long list of broken promises from this chaotic Abbott government.


Nothing illustrates the chaos of the Abbott government more than these higher education bills. We have had so many that it is a bit hard to keep up with what is happening. The reform in higher ed is the most radical in the history of our universities. What serious analysis was there in the construction of these bills? It seems just any thought bubbles which escape from Minister Pyne's office or, in fact, the last best idea from a conversation he has seems to emerge as another higher education bill. Quite frankly, you cannot build quality reform in a six-month time frame. You cannot build quality reform post the budget. You certainly cannot build quality reform when you do not speak to anyone about your intentions.


We started with that cast-iron guarantee that there would be no cuts to education from now on, but it would seem that the Prime Minister has not thought that out—certainly it is questionable whether there was any debate. It appears there was no consultation with the sector, economists, or academics. It is very clear from our questions at Senate estimates that, prior to the budget, there was no consultation with universities. Post the budget there has been consultation. That is because there has been such an outcry about these radical proposals. The government somehow thought that the community would embrace them. This is radical reform. Let us not kid ourselves: this is the most radical reform we have seen in the higher education sector; yet, it would seem there was no input from anyone before the idea was announced.


Absent from this bill is any notion of independent advice, and there is no evidence of a considered process involving consultation, evaluation and analysis. Indeed, fee deregulation has been presented as the one and only quick-fix solution to a sustainable higher education sector in Australia. What nonsense! Like most of the rhetoric from the Abbott government, their rhetoric is that, somehow, universities are at some kind of tipping point and for Australian universities to remain high quality this radical reform is needed. But where is the proof? Where is the considered analysis? When you start from the premise of just 18 months ago of 'no cuts to education', it surely means that there wasn't considered consultation before the budget. There has been no green paper and there has been no white paper. In evidence, the universities told us that they were not given much of an opportunity to have input. That is typical of this government. We know that in most areas where the government are pursuing conservative Tea Party ideologies that have failed in other countries there is no evidence of consultation with the sectors involved.


Labor has asked over and over: 'Give us some indication of the consultation.' The very best we got from the Department of Education and Training in evidence is that it had consulted post budget. I think that was a matter of damage control because there was such an outcry. Once the government's radical reform was out, and there were huge protests and a massive outcry, that is when they consulted. We have seen that over and over again—for example, the thought bubble on the GP tax, which was put out there: 'Yep, we're going to do this. Suck it up. Too bad. It is happening.' Suddenly, there was an outcry and a huge backlash from the medical profession. Now, the Abbott government are trying to hoodwink Australians that it is out there consulting. That is their modus operandi. That is how they operate. They throw it out there and see how it lands. If there is a hue and cry they will go out and pretend to do a consultation. It is not as if the GP tax is off the table. It is just put away until they can work out a time to get it through. It is the same with this higher education reform. I heard Minister Pyne on the radio this morning trying to get a medal for presenting the bill over and over. How many times do you have to present the higher ed bill before you give up? How many times do you have to be told by the Australian public 'We don't like your reforms' before you give up? Mr Pyne does not deserve a medal. He should take his reforms off the table and think about where to go next. He should talk to people and consult. But, no, he thinks he deserves a medal for keeping on keeping on. What a ridiculous notion that is. Again, like the GP tax, there has been no consultation, and that will resurface again too.


There is no evidence of any consultation on the development of their $100,000 university degrees or their 20 per cent cuts, which are off the table. But Minister Pyne has told us that they are coming back, just like the GP tax, at some later date. Labor argues that the Abbott government, with its combined budget cuts and the provision of this higher education package, are creating their own tipping point. The tipping point is the threat of this higher education package. The package threatens participation, attainment and the quality of our own current successful system. In the words of Professor Stephen Parker, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Canberra:


… we should not be taking risks with this. In the absence of evidence, modelling and time for consultation, we should be taking this carefully. The stakes are very high.


This Abbott government package was completely unexpected. It was lobbed on the Australian higher education sector off the back of the promise of 'no cuts to education'. As the Australia Institute, in its submission to the Senate inquiry, asserted, there has been no properly, well-informed debate and there are no clearly articulated goals of how this radical reform will serve the public interest. Moreover, it is imperative that all Australians have a clear understanding of arguments for and against any proposed changes to the higher education system and the mechanisms by which such changes will be achieved.


Then of course there was the false and misleading advertising, a significant waste of taxpayers' dollars from a government supposedly so concerned about taxpayers' dollars. On 7 December 2014, the Abbott government launched a taxpayer funded advertising campaign designed to address supposed misunderstandings about higher education funding and the changes contained in the HERR bill at that time, which has now been defeated. The $14.6 million campaign spanned television, radio, newspapers, digital media, social media and bus shelters. The purpose-built campaign website featured video, infographics and a true-or-false quiz. If we applied a true-or-false quiz to the Abbott government false would come up most of the time.


The short-term interim guidelines on information and advertising campaigns by Australian government departments and agencies, which were in effect when the Secretary of the Department of Education and Training certified the campaign as compliant, stipulate that all campaign materials should be presented in an objective, fair and accessible manner. The guidelines specifically state:


Where information is presented as a fact, it should be accurate and verifiable. When making a factual comparison, the material should not attempt to mislead the recipient about the situation with which the comparison is made and it should state explicitly the basis for the comparison.


The government's advertising campaign presents misleading, unverifiable figures as fact and offers no information about the basis of its calculations. Policy experts have questioned the accuracy of the government's claims, with Andrew Norton noting that, regardless of their veracity, the figures used are 'not particularly meaningful in the first place'. It is so typical of the Abbott government: it seems to think that, if it says it over and over really loudly and it insults everyone else, somehow it makes the campaign believable. Well, it does not. Truth and facts are what the Australian people want.


The guidelines require that advertising campaigns be instigated on the basis of a demonstrated need. While there has been some attempt to use unverifiable anecdotes and third-party market research to justify the campaign, there is no demonstrated need for a wide-scale, multimillion dollar advertising campaign, using taxpayers' dollars, to promote a bill that has not yet passed the parliament. On Minister Pyne's own reflections on the radio interview I heard this morning, the legislation is unlikely to pass this place once again.


The campaign does not address the bill's core policy objectives, instead offering misleading and meaningless assurances to prospective students and the broader public. It is clear the campaign has been developed not to address demonstrated need but rather in response to the negative reaction to the government's proposed changes  from students, education providers and the Australian public. Let us be clear: it is students who will carry the $100,000 debt. And not one student organisation has yet to tick off and sign up to the government's reforms. The reforms are universally rejected by students right across this country.


The campaign's clear political purpose breaches the guidelines, which require that 'Campaign materials must not try to foster a positive impression of a particular political party or promote party political interests.' The current system works. The Senate inquiry received overwhelming evidence that the current higher education system is sustainable and high quality. For example, Mr Ben Phillips and Professor Parker argued: 


… at the moment student contributions are already quite high in Australia from an OECD perspective. The Australian university system appears to be working very well: we have 19 universities in the top 500 and on a per capita basis we are ranked fourth in the world. We are very attractive for international students, and the international market is very healthy here in Australia. I guess we are not quite sure what the problem is. That is something that needs to be explained.


When we heard evidence on the first bill, all of the universities that gave evidence—and many of them, or their representative umbrella groups, did—said that international students are a very lucrative market for Australia's higher education sector. They all want to continue to be able to encourage international students to come to Australia to study. The Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations also said that the current system is workable and would ultimately produce better future outcomes for the Australian higher education sector. Australia Needs a Brighter Future agreed with the notion that the current arrangements for the funding of the higher education sector are preferable to those proposed in the reform package.


Labor believes that fee deregulation is unnecessary. Education policy analyst Professor Louise Watson argued that evidence obtained in the Higher Education Base Funding Review, chaired by Jane Lomax-Smith, which reported in October 2011, led to the conclusion that Australian universities were doing very well. In discussing the fee deregulation proposal, Professor Watson argued that it was a further impost on the Commonwealth budget and that it would be more unpredictable than the removal of caps on funded places, stating:


I have always been puzzled as to why fee deregulation was necessary or deemed necessary. I have never understood the problem it was meant to fix. From where I stand, it seems like fee deregulation will simply compound the problems currently facing the government in terms of university financing, not solve them. 


This is what happens when we put Minister Pyne's thought bubble into a higher education reform package. If there had been some consultation, and if indeed the Australian public had been put on notice that there were going to be cuts and changes to education, we would have been able to have a for-and-against debate. We would have been able to have experts providing input. But no: the Abbott government, in its usual way of pushing through, denied everyone that opportunity. Expert after expert is saying that this is not the way to go. What is it that we are trying to fix? Nobody quite understands that. 


The National Union of Students contended that fee deregulation would result in decreased opportunities, accessibility and equity for students and provided evidence before the committee that deregulation, as proposed, will be unpredictable and unsustainable. All of the student organisations reject fee deregulation out of hand. The National Tertiary Education Union noted that 'nobody, including the government, seems clear as to the rationale or underlying principles of the proposed policy framework'. 


Those are the reasons that Labor will not be supporting the Higher Education and Research Reform Bill. We do not see the need for it. There is no clear evidence being put forward. Therefore, we will continue our opposition to it.

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (13:52):  I am really pleased to follow Senator Lines and to respond to the absurd arguments that have been put by Senator Lines and others. It is a telling reflection of the quality of debate in this place at times when we hear an argument like the one we have just heard from Senator Lines. It was absurd and ridiculous. I want to go to some of the most ridiculous parts of it, because it encapsulates what is going on here. We have Senator Lines saying, 'There is no-one supporting this reform.' Her evidence is to trot out the views of the National Union of Students. The NUS is against it and therefore it must be a bad idea.


Let's go through some of the supporters of this reform, who, I think, have a fair degree more credibility than the National Union of Students—on which the Labor Party is basing their opposition. On the one hand, on the 'no' side, we have the National Union of Students and on the 'yes' side we have Universities Australia, the Innovative Research Universities, the Regional Universities Network, the Australian Technology Network, the Group of Eight, the TAFE Directors Association, the Council of Private Higher Education, various university leaders and 40 out of 41 vice chancellors. 




Senator Cameron:
  The students still come out on top!




Senator SESELJA:
  You say the students, Senator Cameron, but the National Union of Students—the far left union organisation—does not represent most students. I do not know when you last went to university, but when I was at the ANU—




Senator Cameron:
  I was too busy to go to university.



The PRESIDENT:  Order on my left!




Senator SESELJA:
  its left-wing student union refused for years to join the NUS because it was so far left. You can rely on the National Union of Students, but we will listen to expert after expert who is saying—



Senator Rhiannon interjecting—




Senator SESELJA:
  Senator Rhiannon, who takes her advice from the National Union of Students and the Green Left Weekly, is shouting across the chamber and saying that there are some other voices. I have not heard the views of the Green Left Weekly. I suspect the Green Left Weeklyis against the reform. I do not know, Senator Payne, whether you are aware of the Green Left Weekly's views, but Senator Milne is speaking next and so we can look forward to hearing them.


The Business Council, ACCI, the list goes on and on. There is a good reason that you have the NUS on the one side and all these experts on the other and that is: all these experts have considered the issue. What is even more concerning about the contribution of Senator Lines in this debate is that she was saying: 'There really isn't any problem. We don't have to fix anything, because we have a perfect system and we don't need to reform it.' That is absolute rubbish, and Senator Lines knows that it is rubbish; the Labor Party knows that it is rubbish; 40 out of 41 vice chancellors know that it is rubbish; every peak body knows that it is rubbish. There is a simple reason that it is absolute rubbish. We have seen a deregulation of student numbers, so the numbers are no longer capped and we are going to see a significant growth in student numbers. That is something we can celebrate; we are going to see more people have access to higher education. Yet the former government, as well as this government, recognised that there is no blank cheque; there is not an unlimited amount of public money that can go in, as those student numbers rise. 


Unless you acknowledge and unless you are going to take the Kim Carr approach and look to cap student numbers, you need to acknowledge that there will be a significant rise in people accessing our universities and that there is a limit to the amount that taxpayers can subsidise those students, and then you have to reform. You have to ask for a greater private contribution, and that is at the heart of this reform. If you deny it, as Senator Lines just did, you are putting your head in the sand and pretending that there is not a problem, when blind Freddie could see that there is. To go further than that, the likes of Senator Lines and the Labor Party are effectively calling all of these people liars. When they talk about the $100,000 degrees, they are calling the university vice chancellors liars. They are saying that the whole sector cannot be trusted, even when they announce what their fee structure is going to be. Some universities have already put out their fee structures, which makes a lie of the Labor Party's scare campaign, yet those opposite pretend either that they did not hear or that the whole sector is simply telling lies. This is a serious debate, and it deserves better contributions than what we have heard to date.—




Senator Kim Carr:
  You will have to sit down, then!




Senator SESELJA:
  It does not deserve contributions from the likes of Senator Carr who now wants to cap student numbers. That is the Senator Carr policy—the new Labor Party policy is to put a cap on student numbers—




Senator Kim Carr:
  We will put a cap on you. Put your D cap on!



The PRESIDENT:  On my left!




Senator SESELJA:
  If you are not going put a cap on student numbers, Senator Carr, then you are not going to be able to afford it. What we will see is an ever-declining university sector. The modern Labor Party, with its head in the sand and ignoring all of the experts, is now saying that they stand for a cap on student numbers or a decline in the quality of higher education in this country. We happen to take a different view, and that is why this legislation is important—




Senator Cameron:
  Why did the Liberals lie before the election? Just answer the question.




Senator SESELJA:
  Senator Cameron, NUS might be very important to you, but we believe that 40 out 41 vice chancellors, all the peak bodies that represent higher education, the Business Council of Australia, the Regional Universities Network—all of these groups we take more seriously than the National Union of Students. Senator Lines informed the chamber today that there is nothing to see here—there is no problem to fix in our university sector. We can all walk away; not worry about it; leave it as it is; she'll be right. Well, Mr President, we happen to have a very different view. The facts happen to support a very different case. We certainly will not be taking the advice that Senator Lines and the Labor Party do from the National Union of Students.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (15:04):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Employment (Senator Abetz) and the Minister for Finance (Senator Cormann) to questions without notice asked by Senators Carr and Polley today relating to higher education reforms.


This is a government in terminal decline; a government that is rotting from the head down; a government that has a Prime Minister that 40 per cent of the back bench do not want to be Prime Minister of this country. The budget was the worst budget ever presented to parliament in this country—a budget that is not accepted by parliament, is not accepted by the public and is not accepted by at least 40 per cent of coalition members. They know it is a dirty, rotten budget. They know it is a budget that cuts at education, that cuts at health and that cuts pensioners' payments—this is a budget that has no capacity to look after those most in need.


If Minister Pyne was not around, you would have to invent him. He is now a figure of fun; a figure of ridicule. It is said that he is the fixer. It is like some parliamentary equivalent of the Joker, where you get made up and you go out and do things to people. The things Minister Pyne is doing include forcing an Americanised system of education onto this country—$100,000 fees, and people will be in debt for evermore. They will never be able to pay their debt from going to university. This government does not care about education. Prior to the election this government said there would be no cuts to the education budget. Minister Pyne said in a media release on 26 August:


While we welcome debate over the quality and standards in our universities, we have no plans to increase fees or cap places.


This is another Liberal lie. The Liberal Party put out a booklet, Our plan—real solutions for all Australians, which purported to be setting out what the Liberals were going to do in government. It said:


We will ensure the continuation of the current arrangements of university funding.


Yet another Liberal lie! Then Prime Minister Abbott, on Insiders on 1 September 2013—before the election—said:


I want to give people this absolute assurance: no cuts to education.


How many lies can you put out there? How many statements can you put out to try to convince the public that education will not be cut—and then go ahead and cut it? 


Today Minister Pyne said that he would never give up on getting his cuts to the university system—because, he says, 'I am very committed to these higher education reforms, as is the government.' I am always interested to hear the coalition use the word 'reform'. I went to the dictionary to look up what the word meant. 'Reform' means 'to make things better'. That is certainly not what this rotting government are doing. They do not care about pensioners, about the health system or about the education system. They cut and cut because their ideology is all about cutting back on support to the most needy. Access to education is critically important in helping people from low-socioeconomic backgrounds fight their way out of their situation, but $100,000 fees will mean that education will be put beyond the reach of many of them. This is dishonesty in government.


Coalition members are not even prepared to stand up for their own communities. The South Australian senators were not prepared to stand up against the budget cuts to submarines, education or health. They are an absolute disgrace. (Time expired)

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2015-03-17,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:10):  Our higher education reforms are to the advantage of Australia's education sector. Not only do they help the tertiary education sector, the universities, but they also provide opportunities for students to get FEE-HELP in other areas—particularly trade areas and vocational education—where it is not currently available. In contrast to Labor's claims, our reforms mean that there will be more pathway courses available to low-SES and first generation university students, enabling them to break into university training. 


Labor are talking about $100,000 degrees, but I refer senators to an article written by Geoff Sharrock, program director of the LH Martin Institute at the University of Melbourne. He says that Labor's $100,000 degree projections are misleading. He runs through, in some detail, how courses will be priced in a deregulated environment. He demonstrates that, with the three tiers of funding available for courses ranging from arts, nursing and education through to commerce, law and medicine, the cost of degrees comes nowhere near $100,000—while still providing significant funding increases for universities.


The claims by the Labor Party that the coalition is bad for education are hollow, especially when seen in the context of what they did while in government. Here is a coalition government providing pathways for people from low-SES backgrounds; providing FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP loans for people not currently entitled to them; and, importantly, providing funding for things like the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy, which employees some 1,500 Australians. We heard Senator Carr decry the government's management of NCRIS, but this rings hollow when, as Senator Wong, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, admitted today, NCRIS funding under Labor was a lapsing program. As of June this year, all the funding for that program which Senator Carr was getting so hysterical about was going to lapse—because his government, under his watch, set it up that way. What did he do when he was the minister, when Labor were in government, to prevent the program from lapsing? The lapsing of the program would have meant there would have been no funding for the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy. This government, as the Minister for Finance highlighted today, made it very clear in Budget Paper No.2—page 88, I believe it was—that money had been allocated to provide certainty to this program going forward.


Let us compare the words—the hollow rhetoric—of the ALP today with their actions when in government. In the 2011-12 budget, they reduced the HECS-HELP discount for voluntary repayments, a saving of nearly $608 million to the government. They reinstated band 2 student contributions for mathematics, statistics and science students—over $1 billion ripped out of the system. This was in an environment where are looking to encourage young men and women to take up maths and science, the very things we need to grow the engineering capacity of this nation, to develop a sustainable, innovative and smart future for Australian and our young people. The Labor government ripped a billion dollars out of higher education from the very areas that are critical to achieving that future. All up, the previous government took some $6½ billion out of higher education. This government is looking to put in place reform measures that will make higher education more affordable, sustainable and, importantly, accessible to people who need it, but the best the ALP can do is come here and criticise it—while completely ignoring the fact that, when they were in government, they disadvantaged the very people they now claim to support and represent. The government stands by these measures. (Time expired)

From what I can see and what the public is hearing in relation to higher education, there is nothing that is fundamentally more wrong for the nation and for students than this piece of legislation. This whole debate has gone one step further, because the federal member for Bass, in Tasmania, has yet again come out swinging in relation to this particular bill. What he is now doing—and we know this because I have spoken about it before—is attacking a professor at the University of Tasmania for daring to question the government's agenda. But he has gone one step further. He is now engaged with none other than a veteran of journalism, Paul Bongiorno, today questioning his right to comment with Mr Nikolic.



Government senators interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator POLLEY:
  Paul has gone that one step further because he has said, 'Meaningless? Really, Andrew? And don't lobby my employer.' That is what this debate has come down to. Now, I have been advised—



Government senators interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! There are too many Tasmanians in the room, I think—




Senator POLLEY:
  that not only is Mr Nikolic attacking a professor at the university but he is now threatening to sue Jenna Price from The Canberra Times, because they published an article that outlined the need for freedom of speech and for the university and staff to be able to participate in the debate around issues of great importance to the community. So Andrew Nikolic attacks not only people like myself and Michael Powell, but anyone who dares to criticise this government. If this policy was such good policy he would not have to threaten people. He would not have to write letters emailed to the University of Tasmania at a very critical time, I may add, when negotiations are going on with the university through this government—



Government senators interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Polley, just resume your seat for a moment. I will call the Senate to order. There are too many interjections.




Senator POLLEY:
  If those on the other side want to cast aspersions, at least put it on the record. I would never ring up and threaten somebody's employment. And in saying, 'I am not trying to stifle a debate,' why else would he email the vice-chancellor of the university? But nothing surprises me. This is a desperate government that has no vision and no policies for the future. What they are trying to do is have a system where only those who can afford to go to university will be able to go to university.



Senator Bushby interjecting—




Senator POLLEY:
  You might take everything out of The Examiner, Senator Bushby, but I do not. At least learn the facts before you make those sorts of assertions. But I—



Government senators interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Polley, just resume your seat for a moment. I would ask senators to cease interjecting. And I would remind you, Senator Polley, to address your remarks through the chair. But I want to make it clear: I have called the Senate to order on a number of occasions now. I would ask senators to remain silent for the rest of this contribution.




Senator POLLEY:
  We, as elected members of either this place or the other place, should be encouraging debate around very important policy issues like higher education. So why would the government and a government member try to stifle that debate? Simply because they do not agree with this government's views, or that individual members' articulation of the government's policy. What we need in this country is debate about the issue of higher education going forward to ensure that all Australians, not just those whose families credit card is large enough to pay for them, can go to university. Once again, what we have seen from this government is another backflip—yet another one. They are in chaos; they really are in chaos. They are out there trying to govern to protect the Prime Minister's job. That is what they are doing. Anyone who does not support the likes of the 'enforcer' of the government, who has been referred to in this article as Mr Nikolic—




Senator Conroy:
  We have the 'fixer'—




Senator POLLEY:
  Yes,  the 'fixer' and the 'enforcer' in the government's caucus. That is what we have. So who next? I suggest to those opposite to at least engage with the community. If you are engaging with your constituency, you will see that the Australian people do not buy your policy. They do not want an American-style education system in this country because they know the failings of what happens in the US. We should be ensuring that every Australian, based on their ability, has the opportunity to go to university. Threats to people's employment to stop them debating the issue will not cloud the judgement of the Australia community.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2015-03-17,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (15:20):  It is extraordinary how Senator Polley and Senator Cameron open their remarks about the poor policy and how it is affecting universities and, yet, they do not then go on to address the substance of what the government is proposing. Instead, the troglodytes on the other side attack and launch into some sort of class warfare as if the university sector in this country is perfect as it is and just needs a bit more central planning before it can be perfected. The second thing I will point out is that Senator Polley, rather than play the issue, goes in and pursues and continues this sort of obsession—it really is not decent—with the member for Bass, who is a great man. I think he is an excellent member and representative—




Senator Abetz:
  He served his country in Afghanistan, unlike you.




Senator BERNARDI:
  He served his country with distinction and is now serving the nation through the national parliament. And, yet, Senator Polley just harangues and harasses him for daring to stick up for what he believes in. I am disappointed with that. Senator Polley has the audacity to claim that he is somehow bullying someone because he writes to another adult saying, 'I disagree with what you're doing and I think it's wrong.'


We know that those on the other side do not take kindly to being told they are wrong but in this case I am pointing out that the troglodytes are wrong. The university sector in this country needs reform. The university sector in this country needs the opportunity to advance the interests of Australian students while also providing additional opportunities for those students who want to get to universities. 


To those on the other side who say, 'We don't want to Americanise the university system in this country,' I say that no-one wants to see a broader range of opportunities for Australians to pursue their academic scholarship in this country than I. But I also want to see Australian universities reach the pinnacle of achievement. I want to see more Australian universities in the top 50 globally. The fact is that we often see American universities there. We will pursue and reach into that limit. 


We will also see many Australian students choose to attend some of these finer schools anywhere in the world. I want those international students to choose to come to Australia to get outstanding degrees. The thing that holds those on the other side back is that they are not interested in ensuring that there is reform in order to modernise our university system. There is a whole range of things, quite frankly, that could be tapped into it. One of those things is fee reform, which would see fees lowered in some instances and go up in other instances. We would see more private colleges perhaps emerge out of this to provide opportunities. Universities would be able to choose to specialise to provide, perhaps, a tighter curriculum opportunity for students who come in and say, 'I want to go to the pre-eminent university for languages'—or for science, medicine, veterinary studies or for anything else. This would be good for Australia. 


I want to address the other reforms that I think the university sector needs to consider. We have to consider some of the bureaucracy within the university movement. We have to consider other services being provided to students as being important. I would like to see reform of the student amenities levy, which is compulsory. It is basically a student union fee that they have to pay, even though some do not benefit from it. We have to ask ourselves: is it important that we provide as many facilities on campus as making the campus education available—either through distance learning or through tele-learning—to those who cannot attend on campus? Should we be looking at a more rigorous tutorial model? There are a whole range of things that could happen within university sectors. But in order for them to have that flexibility the primary thing they need to do is to be able to set and establish their own priorities for their students. The market will assist in that. 


I have researched the American university system with respect to the $100,000 degrees. In the United States you will find that an overwhelming number of people graduate with student debts that are less than $30,000 or $40,000. In fact, only about 10 per cent of students have student debts in excess of $40,000. So that bells the cat that we are going to have everyone graduating with these massive debts. It is not necessarily the case. It is about how it is managed. We need to get the troglodytes into the 21st century.

"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2015-03-17,"



Senator McEWEN
 (South Australia—Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:25):  Recently we have seen this government execute some pretty impressive backflips. We saw the Prime Minister's paid parental leave disappear. We saw the backflip on the GP tax. We saw the backflip, last week, on the automotive transformation scheme. All of these backflips are designed to keep the Prime Minister in his job.


But this week the award for the most impressive backflip goes to the education minister the member for Sturt, Mr Christopher Pyne. His backflip yesterday would have impressed even the most agile of gymnasts. After claiming on Sunday that the jobs of 1,700 scientists and researchers were inextricably linked to the passage of the higher education legislation, the minister then went and executed a perfect 10 when he made a humiliating retreat from that claim yesterday afternoon. Suddenly, what was inextricably linked to his higher education reforms was now no longer on the table. But no matter how many backflips, hoops or hurdles the minister tries to tackle in his attempt to pass the bill, the fact is that deregulation of Australian universities and the cutting of funding to Australian universities is a very, very bad plan. It is bad for students, it is bad for taxpayers and it is bad for the future of Australia. 


The education minister this morning said that he will never ever give up. He will never give up on his plans to introduce $100,000 fees for university degrees for students. When will the members of the coalition opposite realise that these education reforms are not accepted by the people of Australia? And when will they realise that the Australian people are absolutely sick and tired of all the backflips by this government and all the game-playing with such an important piece of Australian policy as our higher education policy.


Minister Pyne's humiliating back down on his threat to take $150 million from the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy unless this place passed their higher education deregulation legislation was, for a minister of education, incredibly juvenile and incredibly irresponsible. It was indicative of a minister who is completely out of his depth. And it did not work. The crossbenchers who he was trying to appeal to saw right through it, as did the Australian people. 


Then there were the nervous nellies in his own coalition party room, who knew that if he persisted with this ridiculous threat that their jobs would also be at threat at the next election. Presumably, they or the Prime Minister told Mr Pyne to back down. Mr Pyne then went on SkyNews in one of the most embarrassing but, I have to say, entertaining interviews I have every seen. There he was wearing his best Stepford-wife smile and trying to explain the government's backflip on national television. But he quickly became, of course, the laughing stock of the nation. He claimed he was a fixer and that, in dividing the legislation, he had dealt with the issue. But of course what would not divulge in that interview, and has still not divulged, is how. How will the minister fund NCRIS? Where is the $150 million going to come from? Where will the funding for Australia's 27 research facilities come from? According to Mr Pyne, the Minister for Education, in this interview: it is a surprise. It is a surprise, and we will just have to wait and see.


Australia does not need surprises. The university sector does not need surprises. What they need is certainty and a higher education system that is well funded. What the people of Australia need is a higher education system that guarantees affordable, accessible and quality education for all those Australians—particularly our young people who want to go to university and who we need to go to university—who do not need to exit the university system with degrees that have left them with a debt of $100,000 or more.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (15:57):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to table an explanatory memorandum relating to the bill and to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



The purpose of the Charter of Budget Honesty Amendment (Intergenerational Report) Bill 2015 (the Bill), is torequire that the intergenerational reports are prepared by the independent Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO), as part of its statutory obligation, instead of Treasury, every five years.


The Bill will also enable the Parliamentary Budget Office to request a Commonwealth body (who must then comply) to provide information that is relevant to the preparation of the intergenerational report, such as access to information regarding the contingency reserve fund, which they currently do not have access to. 



As an independent, fiscal research and analysis institution based within the Parliament, the PBO is an extremely positive development for Australia's democracy. It reinforces the often overlooked constitutional principle that the Parliament, not the executive is responsible for the provision of finance for public purposes.


Their periodic and independent reports on the state of the nation's finances and the public work they do for committees of the Parliament has allowed another respected public institution to sit alongside the Departments of Treasury and Finance in offering views that may deviate from, or even contradict the views of these Departments or the Government of the day.


The establishment of the PBO has strengthened the transparency of our democracy, and provided greater integrity to the policy development process, which is why tasking them with drafting the intergenerational report every five years ensures that political interference with the content of the report does not happen again.



The 2015 Intergenerational Report, handed down by the Treasurer on the 5th of March proves just how partisan this important document has become. Credible and rigorous intergenerational reporting would examine, for example, inequality of wealth and incomes, and global warming and pollution from fossil fuels as global trends. It must be rewritten by the independent Parliamentary Budget Office in order to restore credibility to the Intergenerational Report process.


While the report acknowledged the huge pressures that will be placed on our younger generations as they support a burgeoning population entering retirement, there was no effort in the government's report to propose how these challenges might be met. For example, Australia's superannuation system is no longer achieving what it was intended to do as the next two years will see the concessions for super flowing overwhelmingly to the wealthiest are beginning to cost the government more than the aged pension. Significant reform is required. 



Silence on these challenges is counterproductive, because it compounds the repair required for future governments.



Nowhere is this more paramount than for global warming. The more we delay action and ignore it, the greater the overhaul of our economy must be. Ironically enough, this means that those resisting these necessary changes in order to keep things the same are actually the ones doing the most to undermine the stability of our economy, and opportunities for future generations.


It is impossible to plan for the future without preparing for a warming planet and extreme weather events which will affect everything from public health and well-being, agricultural profitability, infrastructure degradation, housing, aged-care, immigration from our low-lying island neighbours, insurance costs, labour productivity and our mix of exports. 


Governments cannot ignore our greatest threat. That is why the intergenerational report must become the responsibility of the independent Parliamentary Budget Office and not subject to political priorities divorced from reality.


I commend this Bill to the Senate.

  I table the explanatory memorandum and I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

  Thank you. Today this motion celebrates the power of ordinary Australians to secure a safe climate future.

Already, nine international banks have ruled out financing the Abbot Point coal port and Australians are waiting for the big four Australian banks to start listening and join them. The Australian Youth Climate Coalition's 'Dump Your Bank' campaign helps ordinary customers break up with their bank by moving their money. They are making sure that savings are not used to fund the destruction of the Great Barrier Reef and our climate. Where our government has failed to act, ordinary Australians are stepping up and taking control of their own future. They are telling the big four banks it is not a good investment if it is wrecking the planet and in this age of climate change Australia cannot afford to open up the coal megamines in the Galilee Basin.

  The government opposes this motion. The Australian government is banning, through law, capital dredge disposal in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park now and for ever.

The ban demonstrates our commitment to the Great Barrier Reef and the significant progress we are making to reduce cumulative pressures on this precious ecosystem. Climate change is a challenge for all reefs around the world—that is why we are focusing on addressing water quality to make the reef more resilient; that is why we have a $2.55 billion domestic climate change policy, with the Emissions Reduction Fund, and it is why we are looking to a good international agreement in Paris at the end of this year.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the motion moved by Senator Waters be agreed to.

The PRESIDENT
 (16:09):  I now inform the Senate that, at 8.30 am today, Senators Moore and Siewert each submitted a letter in accordance with standing order 75, proposing a matter of public importance. The question of which proposal would be submitted to the Senate was determined by lot, and as a result I inform the Senate that the following letter has been received from Senator Moore:


Pursuant to standing order 75, I propose that the following matter of public importance be submitted to the Senate for discussion:


""The impact of the Abbott Government's decision to cut half a billion dollars from indigenous programs in its first Budget.""


Is the proposal supported?




More than the number of senators required by the standing orders having risen in their places—




The PRESIDENT:  The proposal is supported. I understand that informal arrangements have been made to allocate specific times to each of the speakers in today's debate. With the concurrence of the Senate, I shall ask the clerks to set the clock accordingly.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2015-03-17,"



Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland) (16:09):  I am indeed happy to stand to speak in support of this matter of public importance today:


The impact of the Abbott Government's decision to cut half a billion dollars from indigenous programs in its first Budget.


This has been the most appalling doublespeak, in my view, of the Abbott government, the government which said that Indigenous people would be at the heart of a government. That was from the now Prime Minister, prior to the election. He said that he would be the minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. But, in the first opportunity, the very first chance, to show that those words were ringing true, what did they do? They cut half a billion dollars out of the budget that provides services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples right across this country. This is a hollow promise. We said that then, but it is now becoming absolutely clear that that is the fact right across the country.


Let us go to some of the detail. This government ripped $534.4 million from Indigenous programs. That is half a billion dollars. One hundred and sixty-five million dollars was cut from Indigenous health programs, including a really important program, the Tackling Smoking and Promoting Healthy Lifestyles program. Given that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are smoking at much, much higher rates than other Australians, this was an important program to improve health outcomes. Three point six million dollars was cut from the family violence prevention legal service, which helps Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women and their children escape family violence. And then there was a raft of cuts to community legal services, including $15.6 million from community legal centres, $13.4 million from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legal services and $21 million from legal aid, and there is no funding certainty for legal centres past 30 June this year.


Nine and a half million dollars was cut from the Indigenous Languages Support program, and they axed the Indigenous tutorial assistance program. That was the cut in education.


And, in health, the government did not renew the National Partnership Agreement on Indigenous Early Childhood Development, which has left 38 children-and-family centres, built by the Labor government, facing the real risk of closure. They did not renew the National Partnership Agreement on Closing the Gap in Indigenous Health Outcomes. That leaves the Closing the Gap health targets without a nationally coordinated approach to achieve them. Labor had committed $777 million to renew that national partnership agreement.


They have forced all Indigenous organisations across the country, in a shambolic debacle, to apply for funding in an open—so-called—competitive tender. It has been chaos out there. Every Aboriginal organisation that I have spoken to over the last six months has only spoken of chaos. The expectations that particularly Minister Scullion raised in the community about how wonderful these programs were going to be and how everyone was going to get great services have come to nothing. We know that 41 per cent of organisations that applied for funding were successful. More than 1,300 organisations applied for funding and have missed out on that funding.


But the thing that really sticks in the craw of Aboriginal organisations and the people who are talking to me in Far North Queensland is the way it was promulgated. In the north, press releases were put out by all coalition members of parliament and a coalition senator, and they talked about the boost in funding for Indigenous health services. That is frankly offensive. There is no boost in funding for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander services in the north, particularly in the Aboriginal community controlled health services. This is 'business as usual' funding. This is no boost; this is in fact a cut.


We know and we can expect that, as a result of these cuts, we will see diminished outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. You have to fund health services if you are going to get health outcomes. You have to support Indigenous children in schools to improve their educational outcomes. But to call these vicious cuts to Indigenous health services a 'boost' really got the goat of people who have been coming through my office to tell me about the cuts that have happened. The Torres Strait Regional Authority has lost $3½ million in funding by 2017-18, and we have heard nothing from the local member. These cuts will have ramifications. There will be an impact that flows from cutting half a billion dollars out of Aboriginal services and programs into the future, and that will be measurable. We also know that the Closing the gap report that came down last fortnight was not good news for anyone in Australia. But I am fearful that, the next time we see a Closing the gap report, we will see more.


There are many good Indigenous-run organisations that have worked hard to improve the lives of their people. There are many Indigenous organisations who spent hours and hours putting in applications for the Indigenous advancement program, simply to receive a letter last Friday to say that they were unsuccessful. Programs which range from tackling youth suicide and addressing drug and alcohol abuse to those that support community night patrols and early childcare programs will cease to exist in communities that need them the most.


Sadly, it seems to stand true that Mr Abbott sees Indigenous disadvantage as a lifestyle choice. If this is Mr Abbott's commitment to closing the gap, it is an utter disgrace.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2015-03-17,"



Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (16:16):  I rise to generally correct the record. I have to say it is pretty nauseating to be lectured by those on the other side about the achievements in Indigenous affairs. I know that my colleague Senator Peris was not here during that time, so perhaps you can just deflect any remarks, because you were not here, Senator Peris. The facts of the matter are that there was not half a billion dollars slashed off Indigenous affairs; in fact, nothing could be further from the truth. It is simply disingenuous to say to our first people that $500 million was slashed, because it is simply incorrect. If I can just refer you—




Senator McLucas:
  Five hundred and thirty-four million.




Senator SCULLION:
  I listened in respectful silence, Senator. I would like you do the same. Budget Paper No. 2 says that over five years there was a total of $534.4 million. If that had been spread across, as in a normal budget paper, it would have been easy to understand. Of this amount, $121.8 million is in the Health portfolio, and I will speak about that in a moment. If you use your calculator there, Senator, that leaves you with $412 million. The $412 million includes a saving from TSRA of $3.5 million, which leaves $409 million. The $409 million includes $355.2 million in administrative funding and $60 million which was departmental funding. The $355.2 million is the total save, which we are choosing to reinvest—of course, this is the question that this is just terrible—into new priorities.




Senator McLucas:
  But where is that money?




Senator SCULLION:
  Well, I can just tell you if you will do me the courtesy there, Senator McLucas. We already operate at what I think is the real cutting edge. We have had a real go at fixing the school attendance: we have invested $46.5 million over two years. We invested $54.1 million for a permanent police presence in communities—that is right, safe communities—and $2.5 million for community engagement police officers, because that was actually what was needed in the communities. There is $3.8 million for a child abuse task force, $13.4 million for Indigenous education through the Sporting Chance Program, and $10.6 million for outback power—that was the old remote renewable energy repair and maintenance program. So overall the funding levels for Indigenous health are going to continue to grow over the next four years.


It is amazing they did not talk about this to our First Australians. They did not share the complete story, which shows just how completely disingenuous the story from that side is. From 2014-15 to 2017-18, we will invest $3.1 billion in Indigenous-specific health programs and activity, an increase of over $500 million compared with the figure from 2009-10 to 2012-13. This does not include funding provided through Medicare and the PBS, as one would expect. So, as part of this budget, we expanded our programs that demonstrated their effectiveness in improving health outcomes. That is right: we backed what was working, and we stopped backing what was not working.


We will invest $94 million through 2015-16 to expand efforts to improve child and maternal health through Better Start to Life. That includes $54 million to expand New Directions: Mothers and Babies—I thought we all supported that, a little like motherhood—and $40 million to expand the Australian Nurse-Family Partnership Program. It is funny you did not mention all of those figures. What about the $36.2 million from 2015-16 to expand the Healthy for Life program into a further 32 Aboriginal community controlled health organisations? It goes on and on.


Since the budget, two very significant measures—I know they are well known—were announced in December as part of MYEFO. We are providing an additional $94.9 million and redirecting existing funding of $1.5 billion over four years from 2014-15 to reform the Remote Jobs and Communities Program, implementing Work for the Dole in remote communities. You are not going to do that cheaply, because it has to be decent jobs and proper engagement, and it is going to cost that money. The measure will assist in providing real work-like activities. We have also provided $46.3 million in transitional funding in 2014-15 to allow the Commonwealth to support the delivery of municipal services in remote communities whilst we are negotiating the transition of responsibility to the state government.


Those are the facts of the matter. To say to Australians that we have cut without saying what we have reinvested in, which is far greater, is completely disingenuous. I was three years in opposition in this portfolio. Let me tell you: for whoever is standing here, there are plenty of real things to knock us about without making it up. There is a reason we are here. Do you think there needed to be any cuts at all? Do you think we needed to put four per cent back? Do you think we needed to have the fights with Joe Hockey? Right at the moment, this nation is paying $1,000 million dollars a month plus every month. Imagine what we could do with that, Senator Peris. Imagine what we could do with the investment. I know where you would invest it. You would invest it wisely, as I would.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Whish-Wilson
):  Senator Scullion, I remind you to direct your comments through the chair please.




Senator SCULLION:
  Sorry, Mr Acting Deputy President. I will put my remarks through you.


But this is why we are in this particular parlous situation. It just beggars belief. We have had Senator McLucas come up and say, 'I've only had people coming into my office and complaining.' I guess that is the nature of those people who missed out, but let me tell you I commend the people who missed out for having a go. But, unlike Senator McLucas, I am not giving money out depending on how many hours you spent with the preparation. It will all be new money and new ideas, and I have those in a repository. There are some fantastic ideas but, because we do not have the funds to fund them all, we have to prioritise. So we have prioritised it, but we are still keeping many of those ideas aside. Perhaps when we do have the funds, when you, hopefully, have the funds in government or when whoever does, we can invest in those ideas.


But through this ground that she knocks she did not say that 964 organisations are going to deliver nearly 1,300 programs. Most importantly, instead of just saying we are helping Aboriginal organisations or non-Aboriginal organisations, whilst I care deeply about them all, the people I actually care about are the people on the ground receiving services. That should be the focus of parliament. That should be your focus.


Part of the challenge in this particular portfolio is we cannot close the gap if we have services that are being delivered substandard with low expectations. The same people have been doing it year after year after year. That is going to change on 30 June because those who are dong the services are going to be in a contract that basically focuses on outcomes. They will be paid to provide an outcome. It is quite a reasonable thing to do. In the past that has not been the case. For those Indigenous organisations that say are they doing it or aren't they doing it I have said, 'We want to work with you the first year; we want to intensively work with you to ensure that the services to our shared constituency are delivered in the very best possible way.'


So, as I have said, it is completely disingenuous to stand up in this place as a matter of public importance and suggest that somehow we have slashed $500 million off the budget, end of story, leaving people with the perception, of course, that that is what happened. That is not what happened; and, if you care about this portfolio, you will start thinking about stopping the politicisation of it. If you are fair dinkum about closing the gap and you are all fair dinkum about engaging with our first Australians properly, you will start taking your hat off. I in this place try day after day to depoliticise this, and those who know me on the other side will acknowledge that, so I do not think it is helpful. I know this was jointly sponsored by Senator Siewert, and I have a great deal of time for the joint sponsors. I do not think this is helpful, because this sends a signal to Indigenous Australians. It might be mischievous and it might be politically the right thing to do in this place, but I really wish you would start to switch on. If we can work together on this, it is going to be far better than the normal adversarial rubbish that we carry on with in this place. That is why I am a bit nauseated for those on the other side to lecture me.


Perhaps I should touch on a couple of things in the record of those on the other side. We are going to get kids into school, we are going to get people employed and we are going to provide for safer communities. During your period of office, 87 per cent of people did not get an education. I have arrived and am trying to fix that in a way that really makes a difference. Unemployment during your watch increased by 4.3 per cent, more than five times what is happening in mainstream Australia. Intoxication rates went from 5.7 to 12.1 times the mainstream level. This all happened on your watch. I am not saying there is any mischief or any particular incompetence; it is a tough area.


So, once again, this is a matter of public importance, and the importance of this matter is to come into this place and tell the whole truth. Don't just pick up what you like and say, 'Isn't this going to impress people on the front page,' because I can tell you they are not impressed. Our first Australians of this parliament—not this government, this parliament—deserve the whole truth about exactly what is going on, and this so-called matter of public importance serves no justice whatsoever.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2015-03-17,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (16:27):  I rise to contribute to this debate. If you listened to Senator Scullion, you would think everything is okay in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs and that he has the answers to everything. He has not. If he did, perhaps you would get some more agreement across this chamber to the policies that he is proposing. When a government goes to a billionaire and lets them write the policy on how we should address Aboriginal unemployment and Aboriginal issues, you know they are lacking in policy outcomes. This is the government that is currently preparing to do Australia over once again with the health and welfare card because the billionaire had a thought bubble that it might be a good way to address Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander disadvantage. While they are doing policies like that, they will not be getting cross-party support for those policies.


Let's look at the funding that has been cut from services in Central Australia, which points to the chaotic nature of what has just gone down with the Indigenous Advancement Strategy. We know that many groups have missed out on funding, because they are ringing us. As yet we do not have an overall picture, because that information is not available. We are at the moment having unfortunately to operate on anecdotal evidence. There is some list circulating around Australia for the Northern Territory and Western Australia. They do not tell us what projects have not been funded. They do tell us the projects that have been funded—and by electorate, by the way—but they do not tell us how much they are funding. They do not tell us which organisations have replaced other organisations. So we cannot get a picture about how the so-called brilliant strategy for Indigenous advancement has in fact been funded.


What the overall strategy is seems to have been a bit of a collection of what people feel should be funded, but they actually do not have an idea of what has been funded. That is clear from the picture from Central Australia, where the youth services for both MacDonnell Shire and Barkly Shire have not been funded. The sport and rec program in Barkly Shire which I am told employs about 30 Aboriginal people has not been funded. For the MacDonnell Shire past funding programs funded youth services for important areas that have been affected by both petrol sniffing and other substance abuse The Barkly Shire has apparently been offered eight per cent more in funding to fund a whole lot more areas—in other words, things that the MacDonnell Shire will not be able to do, with just an eight per cent increase in funding.


We do not know what has or has not been funded under the Indigenous Advancement Strategy. We do know that some organisations did not put in funding bids because they did not think they would be able to meet the guidelines in time. We also know that some organisations, because of the rapidity with which they had to put in applications, were not able to complete their applications to a satisfactory standard and they seem to have been assisted in improving those applications. Again, it makes a farce of the process. In estimates a couple of cycles ago the minister and the department admitted that the funding cut had not been made as a result of a strategic approach—it was an efficiency drive. There have been funding cuts to this program, and instead of the minister addressing the issues around the Indigenous Advancement Strategy, he goes to the same boring views and trite remarks about debt. Whenever a government minister does not want to answer a question in this place they make that point—and that is what he has just done. I expected him to be better than that and to address the issues. I understand that the department probably did not want to make a mistake about not funding those youth services that are absolutely critical in Central Australia in addressing substance abuse, but that is what happened—those applications were put in and they have fallen through the gap in terms of being addressed by government. Again, it makes a mockery of their claims that they have been through a strategic approach with this Indigenous Advancement Strategy. They have not. I resent the minister coming in here and lecturing us about what we should be doing and asking us to support them blindly.

"Peris, Sen Nova",ALP,2015-03-17,"



Senator PERIS
 (Northern Territory) (16:32):  I am going to make a few initial observations about the current context of this MPI before turning to the direct effects of the government cutting $500 million from the Indigenous affairs budget. Recently, following an inexcusably bad set of decisions, Prime Minister Tony Abbott faced extreme criticism from his backbench and a spill motion was moved in the party room. After what he called a near-death experience, the Prime Minister pressed the reset button and promised to become more consultative. He asked for clear air and a chance to begin his government again. 'Good government starts today', he hailed on 8 February this year. He was given another go by his colleagues and a chance to make amends—he said he recognised he had made mistakes. The question I now pose is: should Aboriginal Australians now attempt to appeal to this side of the Prime Minister, to his willingness to reconsider past transgressions? I feel if we cannot push the reset button; his effort to become the Prime Minister for Indigenous Australians and to achieve constitutional recognition will fail miserably. He will have failed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. He will have failed all Australians.


In the Northern Territory, my back yard, the Prime Minister is referred to as 'the gammon man'. In the Territory you are gammon if you say one thing but do the exact opposite. If you say you will not cut health and education spending and then you announce that you will cut spending, you are gammon. Once again, the Abbott government deceived Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people when they said they would not cut frontline services. This is exactly what he has said, and we have heard about that here from Senator Siewert and Senator McLucas. It is right throughout the chamber. The Prime Minister is gammon and he has done this in his very first budget as Prime Minister. It is a national disgrace.


The Abbott government cut half a billion dollars from Aboriginal expenditure in the 2013-14 budget, then rushed the process under its flawed new grants system, the Indigenous Advancement Strategy, which Senator Siewert described earlier. It is not working. They have slashed funding to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations right across the country—I know, because I speak to people every single day—to such an extent that many services will be forced to close. This government talks about closing the gap on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander disadvantage on the one hand but withdraws crucial funding to frontline services with the other. The Indigenous Advancement Strategy is neither an advancement nor strategic. That is the truth of this. It is ridiculous. It is confusing and it is mean-spirited. I will tell you what the mob across the country are calling the IAS—they are calling it the Indigenous annihilation strategy! That is the truth of the matter. 


On top of all of this, the Prime Minister chooses to create more confusion and anxiety by supporting the WA government's proposal to forcibly move Aboriginal people living in the remote and regional areas in that state because he considers their living there to be a 'lifestyle choice'. There are important questions that need to be answered by Senator Scullion and the Prime Minister, who agree that Aboriginal people will be forced off their land, displaced and forced to live—where exactly? Where are these people going to be moved to? How will people be forced off their country? Will the Army be used again? What communities will be shut down? What services will you provide for these displaced human citizens of this country? What accountability have you asked for from the WA government in subsidising this latest land grab, as we call it—because it is. It is about land.


The Minister for Indigenous Affairs, Senator Scullion, and the Prime Minister are directly responsible for the disastrous Indigenous annihilation strategy. Under the IAS, only 964 of the 2,345 organisations that applied for funding have been successful. The Liberals have announced just $860 million in grant funding for Indigenous programs and frontline services, having received more than $14 billion in applications. Many organisations have received just a fraction of their current budget to deliver vital frontline services in their communities. Is the minister seriously saying that Aboriginal people across the country losing jobs is going to help close the gap or help Aboriginal people to participate fully in this nation's economy? Across my electorate these disastrous cuts have caused extremely high levels of anxiety, anger and confusion—arising out of the uncertainty. 


I have already mentioned the Katherine Women's Legal Service, which provides vital front-line services to victims of family violence. Fifty per cent of their funding has been cut. The YMCA in Katherine will struggle to deliver youth programs that are widely acknowledged for keeping kids off the streets at night, because their funding has been cut. The Prime Minister's foray into Indigenous affairs included the proposal that the MacDonnell Regional Council should expand its youth development services from nine to 12 remote communities, but that it should do so at a cost of only eight per cent of its current budget. If the PM wants to help Aboriginal people, why has he just cut 51 jobs in the MacDonnell shire? Senator Siewert spoke about the Barkly shire, so I will not go into that again, but 30 jobs have been cut and there are no youth programs delivered there anymore. The small town of Elliott on the Stuart Highway—halfway between Darwin and Alice Springs —will lose two part-time childcare positions. So much for supporting parents and helping them to get their kids engaged in education! Jobs will be lost from the closure of the drug and alcohol program run by Amity Community Services in Darwin. These are all front-line services. In Alice Springs, the Institute for Aboriginal Development is one of Central Australia's oldest Aboriginal community controlled organisations. It is facing closure because of cuts to its funding. The IAD runs literacy, numeracy and job-ready programs. 


Let me talk now about understanding Aboriginal people living on country and their traditional homelands. The homelands movement has a history going back decades. Aboriginal people started returning to their traditional country so they could continue their cultural practices and so they could live in peace—away from the fringe camps of the regional service delivery towns where their lives were characterised by marginalisation, overcrowding, conflict, continued social and cultural breakdown, deep personal distress, and alcohol and substance abuse. 


Ms Laurie Baymarrwangga, otherwise known as 'Big Boss', passed away in August 2014 at 98 years of age—an Aboriginal woman! She gave approval before her passing for her name to be used in helping to carry on all her hard work. Over her 98 years, Big Boss witnessed the arrival of the first missionaries and the World War II bombing of Milingimbi. She established an island homeland, a school, a ranger program and a turtle sanctuary—and she saved her language. She created language nests and still did not give up. In 2012, Big Boss was the Senior Australian of the Year.


The Crocodile Islands Ranger Program, formally launched in 2010, won the Minister's Award for Outstanding Team Achievement in the 2012 NT Ranger Awards. The rangers now protect more than 10,000 square kilometres of sea country, with 250 square kilometres of registered sacred sites, and have created a turtle sanctuary of 1,000 square kilometres. These programs are set to manage, conserve and enhance natural marine resources and the traditional ecological knowledge that lives in the local languages. This conservation effort has national significance. Big Boss said:


Homelands are at the heart of our country. 


Knowing country depends upon understanding the complex cultural relationships linked to living on homelands. This protects a vital part of Australia's biodiversity and its cultural and environmental heritage. Homelands are where people transfer the world's oldest living traditions, deep cultural knowledge and globally rare Indigenous languages. All of these are under threat. 


It is deeply concerning that the Prime Minister supports the eviction of hundreds of Aboriginal people from their traditional lands. This is a Prime Minister who clearly does not understand the value or the importance of Aboriginal peoples' connection to land—completely disregarding more than 200 years of Indigenous dispossession. We all know that the Prime Minister, as I referred to before, is commonly known in the Territory as 'the gammon man' when it comes to Indigenous Affairs. The self-appointed Prime Minister for Indigenous affairs is just trying to save his own job. He does not care about the people and his comments threaten to undo the this country's progress towards reconciliation and closing the gap in Indigenous disadvantage.


I will repeat what my uncle, senior Yawuru man Pat Dodson, said earlier this week:


Does Australia want to have a relationship with Aboriginal people, or does it not? Or does it simply want to improve the management and control systems over the lives of Aboriginal people? That is the seminal issue.


This Thursday is National Close the Gap Day. I pose this question to the minister and to the Prime Minister: which gap will you be closing?

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (16:42):  I am somewhat saddened in rising to speak on this MPI. Listening to Senator Peris highlighted for me exactly why we have to work so much harder to close the gap. It particularly saddens me that this MPI reads:


The impact of the Abbott Government's decision to cut half a billion dollars from Indigenous programs in its first Budget.


It saddens me because this is the second time today I have risen to speak about the blatant untruths being told in policy areas of such social importance. The first time was on the higher education system and the blatant untruths that were being told to scare students and those on the crossbenches. 


This time it is in relation to the problems and the issues that Senator Peris has just so eloquently discussed.



Senator Lines interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Whish-Wilson
):  Order! 




Senator REYNOLDS:
  I ask those opposite to afford me the same respect I showed them in listening to their contributions on this serious issue. The reason I am saddened about speaking in this debate is that Labor is clearly using our most vulnerable people—people for whom we really do need to close the gap—for yet another cheap political scare campaign. It saddens not only me but, I know, a great many other people on this side. 


Senator Siewert, in her contribution, said that this country's debt was irrelevant to this debate. I almost did a double-take—how, possibly, can our nation's enormous debt be irrelevant to this debate? Labor's mismanagement of the country's finances and the legacy of debt and deficit they have left us mean that all programs have to be reviewed. The budget savings made in the Indigenous Affairs portfolio have been explained many times—and they were explained again very eloquently just then by the minister. They do not, as Labor keeps wrongly claiming, impact on the delivery of services. As the minister said, the savings made in this area amount to $60 million a year. That is against a total spend of $4.9 billion a year. That is less than five per cent. The minister has said time and time again very clearly and has provided the evidence that these savings go into efficiencies and behind-the-scene administration. They are not $500 million and they do not go against the delivery of the services that were being discussed by those opposite. So not $1 of these savings—which are far less than those opposite are claiming—impacts on the delivery of services to Indigenous services. However, the government did, as part of its pre-election promise to cut the burden of red tape, remove what can only be described as a bewildering array of bureaucratic processes in the Indigenous Advancements Strategy. This is now allowing public servants to spend their time where it is most needed in the regional networks working with Indigenous groups at the local level.


We are in the process of transforming Indigenous affairs to a very different and far more streamlined model to make more effective use of the resources available. As we have just heard from Senator Peris, what we have done in the past, over many governments and over many decades, is clearly not working. Just mindlessly continuing to fund resources and services that are not closing the gap enough is not good enough. Labor's budget blow-out and economic mismanagement at the Indigenous portfolio level has resulted in more unsafe neighbourhoods and the number of adults and children in education and the workplace actually declining. Again, that is not good enough. More of the same is simply not an option for this government.


We intend to turn it around and we intend to do it much better. This government, in fact, has signed off on over $860 million worth of investments in the Indigenous Advancement Strategy funding round to ensure that the government continues to deliver our key priorities: to get children to school and adults to work, and to make communities safer. This funding will assist 964 Indigenous organisations to deliver nearly 1,300 projects to Indigenous communities right across Australia. That is far from the story peddled by those opposite in this MPI. What they do not tell the Australian people is that not only is the amount of the cuts and where it is coming from not true but under competitive funding processes not everybody will be happy. They were not happy under your government when you had to make choices about funding arrangements, and they will not be happy under new competitive funding arrangements. Tough decisions have always to be made, and we need to ensure these decisions are followed through. But I will remind this place that over $860 million worth of new investments are being made by this government and funding will assist 964 organisations to deliver nearly 1,300 projects right across this country—a very different story from what we are hearing from those opposite.


This government truly does believe that Indigenous Australians deserve a much better future and that we have to do everything we can to close the gap. But more job opportunities are required. We need to empower individuals and communities. We need to promote and encourage, so as to result in higher standards of living. The initiatives we are taking in this area are a genuine attempt to ensure that we move closer to making these goals a reality. I believe that, rather than moving motions such as this MPI today, which is clearly designed for a political purpose and is untrue, it would be far more productive if those in this place worked together genuinely to close the gap—not for cheap political stunts of the day but to work together to get better outcomes for all Indigenous Australians. They need outcomes. They need a better life. We need to close the gap, and they do not need political stunts.

Senator LAZARUS
 (Queensland) (16:49):  The Abbott government promised to take care of our First Australians but, unfortunately, like so many other promises made they have broken this one, as well. Today, I am specifically speaking in relation to Aboriginal legal services. The Abbott government is cutting funding to Aboriginal legal services across the country by $13.4 million over two years, effective from 1 July this year. Aboriginal legal services play a vital role in providing First Australians with relevant and meaningful legal support. Services are based across the country and provide criminal, civil and family law services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and their families, among other educational preventative and support services. These services are already provided under the restricted funding arrangements, and service providers have managed to deliver significant value far beyond their budgetary means.


Given the nature of Aboriginal legal services, 80 per cent of operating costs are expended in staff salary costs. The majority of services are legal services provided by practitioners who spend time working one-on-one with First Australians and travelling around the countryside to undertake their role. This means the only way Aboriginal legal services across the country can work within the funding cuts from 1 July is to cut front-line staff, close offices and reduce services. Forty-five per cent of staff across Aboriginal legal services are First Australians. The service is an important employer of First Australians and provides a key role in supporting professional development, career advancement and financial security among the First Australian community.


The Abbott government is not only cutting services to First Australians but it is also taking jobs away from First Australians. It will be First Australians who suffer in every way as a result of these harsh and unnecessary cuts. I have consulted with the community, and the overwhelming feedback is that the cuts to Aboriginal legal services will be severe and will have far reaching and negative consequences. Already, staff around the country employed by Aboriginal legal services are scared and worried about losing their jobs. Staff with experience and understanding of the sector are leaving in search of other employment, morale is low and people have no idea whether they will have a job come 1 July this year. Staff are worried sick about how they are going to pay their mortgages, feed their kids and pay their bills.


Cuts to legal services will involve direct cuts to front-line services, including legal officers who travel to remote communities. This will affect the most disadvantaged in our country. My home state of Queensland covers a large area, including many remote areas. First Australians located in remote areas will be hurt the most as the Aboriginal legal services are the only form of legal support they are able to access. As a result, First Australians in remote communities will be left with no legal support.


First Australians already suffer high incarceration rates. Cutting front-line services means First Australians will no longer be able to access legal help. Courts will clog up and grind to a halt. People will be left to wait in jail cells longer until their cases are heard due to a lack of legal representation. Incarceration rates will skyrocket. Incredibly, at present, Aboriginal legal services across the country still have no idea what their budgets are going to be for the next financial year. While cuts have been announced by the Abbott government, state offices have not yet been formally advised of their forward budgets. Managers are unable to plan or make commitments to staff.


I call on the Abbott government to reverse budget cuts to Aboriginal legal services. Our First Australians deserve better. Living in a remote community is not a lifestyle choice, it is life for Indigenous communities. The Abbott government should respect this and show greater empathy and cooperation towards First Australians and immediately reinstate funding to Australia's Aboriginal legal services.

"Lines, Sen Susan",ALP,2015-03-17,"



Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (16:53):  I rise to speak on the matter of public importance—the impact of the Abbott government's decision to cut half a billion dollars from Indigenous programs in its first budget. I have to say that on the Labor side we were absolutely insulted to hear government members claim that this is some cheap political trick. The truth speaks for itself.


I want to start first with that insulting comment made by the Prime Minister last week in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, where disadvantage should have been visible on every street corner for the Prime Minister to see. When he claimed it was a lifestyle choice he was simply repeating that time-worn assertion that Aboriginal people represent little else but a drain on the public purse. And that is what we are hearing today in this place from government senators opposite.


I want to move now to some comments that Senator Nash made the other day when she was extolling the virtues of NACCHO. She was saying how she had met with them, how she had regular dialogue with them and what a wonderful organisation they were. I cannot believe that NACCHO would not have raised their concerns about the cuts to frontline services brought on by the Abbott government's harsh and cruel budget. I just cannot believe that, but obviously Senator Nash is either deaf to that or chooses not to mention it.


I want to quote Matthew Cooke, who is the chair of NACCHO. Speaking about the lack of information around funding and the cuts to organisations, he said that 'the result has caused confusion' among his members. He said:


Their concerns are being raised with me every hour of the day since the announcement was made by Minister Scullion.


I cannot believe that, if Senator Nash has this wonderfully close, respectful relationship with NACCHO that they have not raised the cuts with her. Perhaps we need to explore that some more at question time. The chair of NACCHO is saying, well and truly, that there have been cuts to frontline services. So it is not Labor senators saying it; one of the well-respected umbrella groups in Aboriginal health in this country is saying that every hour of the day they are hearing about the cuts.


This decision by the Abbott government to cut half a billion dollars from Aboriginal programs in the government's very first budget is disgraceful. Labor is not raising this here as a political trick or for some political advantage. I want to look at some of the comments that the Prime Minister made when in opposition. He said on 15 March 2013, at one of his favourite institutes, the Sydney Institute:


In any event, ""Canberra knows best"" will not be an incoming Coalition government's approach.


I think Aboriginal Australians would say, 'Actually, that is all we have heard. All we have heard is that Canberra knows best.' Again, in that speech at the Sydney Institute on 15 March 2013, Mr Abbott said:


Should the Coalition win the election, Aboriginal people will be at the heart of a new government, in word and in deed.


To cut half a billion dollars from programs is not putting Aboriginal people at the heart of any government. To make the insulting—at one deep level—and ridiculous comment he made about lifestyle choices is not putting Aboriginal people at the heart of government; it is just repeating that time-worn statement that Aboriginal people are somehow a drain on the purse of the nation. 


And it does not stop there. Senator Scullion said in the Northern Territory that only those providers who are 'completely hopeless'—his words, not mine—at delivering services would miss out on funding. Because we have had Senate estimates we know what has happened. There were 2,472 applications for the Indigenous Advancement Strategy funding. There were 4,948 projects and there were 2,345 organisations of which 1,233 were deemed non-compliant. That could simply mean that they were not incorporated; we do not have the detail of that. That left just 964 successful organisations—40 per cent of those that applied got the funding. 


I invite Senator Reynolds to visit some of the organisations in Western Australia that have been defunded. Last week I was in Geraldton. I get angry even thinking about it. The federal government, through its budget cuts—whether it is to the council, the local legal service or the education support services—have cut millions of dollars out of that town. That will have repercussions right up to the Pilbara. That is what the Abbott government has done. There is service after service that has simply lost money; $534 million has been ripped from programs and front-line services. I witnessed that firsthand in Geraldton. I did not even have to go very far. I would challenge Senator Reynolds to get out of Perth and go and visit some of those front-line services that have lost funding.


I do not know what Minister Scullion proposes to do with the rest of the money that is apparently in his $2 billion kitty—there is a lot of it left. But, in the meantime, perhaps he could fund some of the services that have been lost. Fancy taking funding from smoking programs! Why would you do that when we have very poor health outcomes and the measure for that is closing the gap? We have very poor health outcomes—but $165 million has been taken from healthy lifestyle programs and tackling smoking.


We have heard a lot in this Senate recently—and, indeed, in this parliament—about family violence and partner violence. Yet what we have seen is $3.6 million cut from family violence prevention and legal services. Again, the West Australian service is a fine service that has been around for a very long time; they are not sure what is going to happen in their future. We have had child-care services in the north-west of Western Australia lose their funding and we have had cuts to community legal services. I witnessed that firsthand, again, in Geraldton last week. They have taken $15.6 million from community legal services.


It does not matter how you put it, they have been cut. Not only that—they have also been gagged. Part of their new contract says that they cannot come out and criticise the government. Even if the government chooses to gag those services, Labor will continue to criticise the government for gagging those services and cutting their funding. We will not see improvements in Closing the Gap targets if we have to continue to witness this disgraceful attack on front-line services which is cutting their budgets, cutting their voices and leaving them without any funding at all.

"O'Sullivan, Sen Barry",Nats,2015-03-17,"



Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (17:02):  I have listened to this debate carefully during the course of the afternoon. I want to attach myself to one of the remarks made by the minister in his contribution: this issue is simply far too important to be politicised by the Senate, when having regard to the facts. If you had listened to the contributions made by the Greens and those opposite you would wonder where their research has taken them. Statements made by them cannot be supported by the empirical evidence that is available in relation to this important subject.


I have been in this chamber for months now, listening to any number of answers provided, not just by the Minister for Indigenous Affairs, but by other ministers who have exposure in this portfolio area; and, clearly, those who have made a contribution today from the other side have not listened once to the explanations provided over that time. The minister articulated quite clearly today the adjustments with respect to the funding; and the previous speaker, on two occasions, made comments about funding cuts of one billion dollars, only to correct that in the last part of her presentation. I ask: how can you get that figure so wrong?


We know that the impact of the reduction in funding, spread over a period of time, is less than 0.01 per cent of the money that this government is spending in the area of Indigenous affairs. Mind you, when it comes to a contribution from the Greens, I expect nothing less. They have devoted 90 per cent of their time to talking about kangaroos, possums, coral and closing down the resource sector; there are hours and hours of contributions about the merits of the introduction of wind turbines. The only time—and I spend a lot of time in this chamber in the whip's position, a lot more than anybody else—




Senator Bilyk:
  Oh, I do not know about that!




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  I will defer only to you, Senator. I have never heard them raise these subjects or these concerns before. But we do not expect them to support anything the government does. In the 387 divisions that have occurred in this Senate during the term of this government, the Greens have voted with the government on 13 occasions. Let me say that one more time: out of almost 400 divisions, they have voted with the government on 13 occasions. I was present on one of those occasions, when it was accidental—they simply were not quick enough to get up and get across the chamber. So when their contribution attacks the government it is expected, because everything—every contribution they make to every single debate in this place—is antigovernment. They should go home and crawl into bed with Senator Lambie because, between them, they are determined never to support an initiative of the government. They do not allow any of the facts—facts on the public record—to intimidate them with respect to their presentations. It is a shame—an absolute shame.


When we come to those opposite, who have been critical of some of the outcomes in this space, it is a matter of public record that when they are referring to Closing the Gap outcomes that have been published, they refer to those from their term of government. They refer back to their own failures. This government is determined, and this has been expressed many, many times, to produce outcomes in the areas of getting people to work in our Indigenous communities; producing a safer environment, where acts of violence are not multiples of 10 times more likely to occur, particularly to women and children in those communities, than they are in mainstream Australia; providing access to education; and providing a safe environment where people have access to meaningful work.

  You may disagree with it, Senator, but you should—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Williams
):  Order!




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President Williams—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  That is better.




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  the good senator should sit and listen until I finish the statement before she starts to resist it. It is through providing people the opportunity to have meaningful work, providing them with access to education—where 87 per cent of them did not have proper access to education under a government that you supported—and producing safer environments and safer communities. It is through that pathway that we will get the success in Indigenous affairs that it deserves.


I have to tell you your weakness. Your weakness in your attack is Senator Nigel Scullion. That is where your weakness is to the core. For the first time in generations, we have a minister in this space—



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  I know it is inconvenient. For the first time in generations, we have a minister in this space who not only understands the task; this man did not stand in a conga line waiting to get whatever the next portfolio was. He was handpicked by a Prime Minister who is determined to close the gap and provide the very best circumstances for Indigenous Australia. Governments of all persuasions have failed, decade after decade. 


The weakness in your argument is the man. The man who is determined to provide these outcomes is not going to stand by and allow impractical programs to go ahead. He will see that every dollar of this Commonwealth is invested in a way that will produce outcomes and he will do something you did not do: he will measure them. I tell you what: you taught the minister a lesson.




Senator Siewert:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator O'Sullivan made a statement about the Greens earlier that we have never raised this issue. He is either deliberately misleading the chamber or he is mistaken. Either way, could he please use his last 30 seconds to correct the record. I have been in here for nearly 10 years repeatedly raising these issues, so he should apologise.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Do you have a point of order, Senator Siewert? This is a debating point of order.




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  I will take the interjection. What I said was that in the time that I have been in the chamber, I heard you talk about possums, kangaroos, coral reefs and all sorts of other things but never on these important matters of Indigenous affairs. Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President—




Senator Siewert:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, a further point of order. He has repeated his mistake or he is deliberately misleading this chamber. He should withdraw and correct the record.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Siewert, this is a debating point not a point of order.




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  Let me close by saying that I invite those opposite, particularly the Greens, to not politicise what is a significantly important issue to this nation.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! The time for the discussion has expired.

APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (NO. 2) 2013-2014


The purpose of Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2013-2014 is to provide additional funding for the operations of the Department of Parliamentary Services. It is the third and final of the additional estimates appropriation bills being introduced today.


This bill, if passed, would provide the Department of Parliamentary Services with additional funding of $5.4 million to assist in meeting operating expenditure and to maintain the provision of core services to support the operation of parliament. The department's operating expenditure includes responses to recent reviews of its operations, including in relation to the management of capital works and the provision of information, communications and technology services.


Details of the proposed expenditure are set out in the schedule to the bill and the portfolio additional estimates statements for the Department of Parliamentary Services.


 


APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 3) 2013-2014


Today, the government introduces the additional estimates appropriations bills. These bills are:



Appropriation Bill (No.


3) 2013-2014;



Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2013-2014; and



Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2013
-
2014.


These bills underpin the government's expenditure decisions, including pre-election commitments, and decisions made in the Mid‑Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook.



Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2013-2014 seeks approval for additional appropriations from the Consolidated Revenue Fund of just under $11.6 billion.


I now outline four major items sought in the bill.


First, the bill includes funding to enable the Department of the Treasury to make an $8.8 billion one-off grant to the Reserve Bank of Australia. The grant will strengthen the Reserve Bank's financial position to the level considered appropriate by the board of the Reserve Bank. This will ensure that the Reserve Bank is adequately resourced to conduct its monetary policy and foreign exchange operations in an environment of financial market volatility.


Second, this bill would provide the Department of Immigration and Border Protection almost $750 million. This includes over $400 million for offshore processing of illegal maritime arrivals, and $220 million to address the backlog of illegal maritime arrivals.


Third, this bill would provide the Department of Defence with just over $660 million reflecting four matters. Those are the increased funding for Defence's overseas operations, supplementation for foreign exchange movements, expenditure brought forward into 2013‑2014 from the forward estimates, and the re-appropriation between appropriation acts of amounts to better align with Defence's current work programs.


Fourth, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade would receive almost $335 million. The majority of this amount is to administer official development assistance programs from the former AusAID, the functions of which were moved to the department on 1 November 2013.


On more general matters, this bill reflects the current names of government departments, consistent with the Administrative Arrangements Order of 18 September 2013. For example, the bill proposes appropriations for the Department of Industry, instead of the former Department of Industry, Innovation, Climate Change, Science, Research and Tertiary Education.


Details of the proposed expenditure are set out in the schedule to the bill and the portfolio additional estimates statements tabled in the parliament.


APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 4) 2013-2014


Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2013-2014, along with Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2013-2014 which I introduced earlier, and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments Bill (No. 2) 2013 2014, are the additional estimates appropriation bills for this financial year.


This bill seeks further approval for appropriations from the Consolidated Revenue Fund of just over $3.2 billion.


I now outline the major items provided for in this bill.


First, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade would receive just under $2.2 billion once this bill commences as an act. This is primarily to administer official development assistance programmes which moved to the department from AusAID, which was abolished on 1 November 2013.


Second, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection would be provided with almost $400 million for offshore asylum seeker management, including $180 million in capital funding announced in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. This implements the government's policy commitment to process illegal maritime arrivals offshore.


Third, this bill would provide the Department of Defence with just over $235 million, reflecting three matters. Those are the supplementation for foreign exchange movements, expenditure brought forward into 2013 2014 from the forward estimates, and the re appropriation of amounts between appropriation acts to better align with Defence's current work programmes.


Fourth, the bill provides just over $3.3 million for payments to local government for the Liveable Cities program that is administered by the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development. Whilst this programme has been terminated, these payments represent the final amounts due. As outlined in Schedule 1 of the bill, the Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development is responsible for determining the relevant conditions and payments.


Details of the proposed expenditure are set out in the schedules to the bill and the portfolio additional estimates statements tabled in the parliament.

Senator MADIGAN
 (Victoria) (17:17):  I rise to speak today on the Higher Education and Research Reform Bill 2014 for the second time.


Due to the complexities of this bill, I have seen two main responses. One is highly-uninformed debate within the community about the current situation and the government's proposals. And the second is a lack of courage by senators of all political persuasions to engage with the government to evolve the higher education model to something more sustainable. I am more than happy to excuse the first point. The Australian community always has good reason to have a heightened level of cynicism when announcements are made by any Australian government. However, the second point is a little more disturbing.


We, as senators, are paid to do a job. Because of the makeup of the current Senate, we on the crossbench are expected to be more responsible and accountable than the opposition. Australians expect the opposition of the day to be obstructionist, but they expect minor party and Independent senators to be impartial. The Australian people have charged the crossbench with a great privilege and a great responsibility.


This bill is before us today because the government believes it is a priority. The government was elected to pursue matters which they believe are priorities. Now, the Senate by no means should act as a rubber stamp, and the Senate should provide scrutiny. But voting down a bill at the second reading before senators have even had a chance to amend a serious bill such as this is absolutely abdicating one's responsibility. Nearly every party involved in this debate agrees that the current system is unsustainable and that change is going to come. It is not a matter of 'if' but 'when'.


Today we, as the crossbench, are in the unique position to review, amend and improve this legislation. We owe it to the Australian people to do just that. In five years' time there may not be a crossbench to scrutinise potential reforms. It is on this day, in this chamber, that we have the opportunity to make positive change. If this bill is taken to an election, like some in this place have called for, then we will lose our ability to have a positive influence. The major parties will have it all their own way. No matter which party wins the next election with their policy, the Australian people and our tertiary education system will lose. I urge my fellow senators to put aside political interest and populism and to do the jobs they were elected to do.


I understand that there is little political benefit in the crossbench working with the government, but this should not be about votes. This should be about doing what is right by our students and our country. Again, I am not asking senators ultimately to support a bill they may disagree with. I am simply calling on them to give this bill a chance to be amended and improved. If, at the end of the day, my fellow crossbench senators still oppose the amended bill then I absolutely respect their right to vote it down. But at least we can say that we have tried to work with the government rather than simply being obstructionist for the sake of it. I believe that, if the Senate put politics and opportunism aside for a minute, we might actually create a fair sustainable and equitable system which would benefit all Australians, but most importantly our students.


We have an opportunity here today to make universities more equitable with the right amendments. This is particularly the case for students from low socioeconomic backgrounds and those from rural and regional Australia. With the right amendments the Senate can leave a positive mark on Australia's higher education landscape. With the right amendments the Senate could create a scholarship system worth hundreds of millions of dollars. This money could be used to pay for accommodation and living expenses, or it could be used to pay for books for disadvantaged university students. 


This bill may have the potential to make more seats available in university libraries right across the country at exam time. It may have the potential to fund universities to such an extent that they can purchase sufficient copies of books that are considered recommended reading for students. With the right amendments this bill might have the potential to create a better university system for all of our students. The fact of the matter is we are suffocating universities. We have spent such an enormous portion of this debate thinking about the glory days that we have not taken notice of the impact of budget cuts of successive governments, of all persuasions, to the sector. 


In summary, I would like to finish off where I began. Senators have been charged with a great privilege, but with it comes great responsibility. I have serious concerns with the bill in its current form, but I also fear the consequences of doing nothing. Thank you.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2015-03-17,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (17:24):  I rise today to oppose the government's legislation to deregulate higher education. 


A great public purpose requires adequate public funding. That is the matter at hand here today. I reject the remarks from Senator Madigan that people 'do not have the courage of their convictions' in here and that people are 'not doing the right thing' by the university sector. Let me tell you: the Greens have consistently opposed cuts to university funding and cuts to research funding. We have done so always. We have also put forward propositions to raise the revenue in order to fund public education, public universities and research and development. 


As recently as a week ago, I put forward a proposal that we stop the flat rate of 15 per cent tax on contributions to superannuation and that we do it in a progressive way, similar to income tax. That would raise $10 billion over the forward estimates. The vice-chancellors a few years ago ran a very strong campaign trying to argue to the Australian community that we needed to raise more revenue to spend on universities. I agree. The Greens were out there supporting the campaign to raise revenue to put more public money into universities. 


But I have to say to you that Senator Madigan was correct in saying that over recent years—over decades actually—the level of funding to universities has been cut back. When the former Labor government in their MYEFO statement in 2012-13 announced cuts to research, we objected to that. When Labor announced, in April 2013 going into the election, cuts to university funding, we opposed it. And we went into the election opposing it. We said that after the election Labor in opposition would change its mind. It did, and I am very pleased about that, because the fundamental principle here is: if you want to change from a 'dig it up, cut it down, ship it away' economy to a 21st century economy where imagination is the key resource—not coal, not iron ore, not cutting down native forests, but actually investing in the brains base of this nation—then you have to fund public education and universities. 


Where the last government went wrong was the announcement that they would cut the funding to universities in order to spend it on the Gonski reforms. I totally support the Gonski reforms—they should have gone ahead and we should be funding that—but you do not take money out of universities to fund public schools; you need to fund education at every level, from early childhood right through the school system through to universities and TAFEs. That is the way of the future in Australia. 


I am one of those people who was at university before Gough Whitlam brought in free education in Australia. I come from a relatively poor farming family in the north-west of Tasmania. My parents were dairy farmers. My mother was a teacher. In order for me to get through school I got scholarships, and I had to get scholarships to get to university. I had the choice between a Commonwealth scholarship and a teacher studentship, and I took the teacher studentship because it paid more than a Commonwealth scholarship at that time. 


So I can tell you that I know what it is like to be fronting the fact that you may not be able to go to university because you cannot afford it. That is precisely the case for so many people and that is why deregulation is so wrong. It is wrong to say to young people: 'The parliament of Australia refuses to raise the revenue to put into schools and public education'. The result is that we are going to cut public funding to universities and we are going to tell the universities they have to raise fees in order to cover the gap. And raising those fees of course means hurting a lot of people and making people think twice about the course they go into. They will not have the same choices that they otherwise would. 


In a speech he made on this very issue, Professor Glyn Davies said:


Australia spends proportionally less public money on universities than most OECD countries, yet few outside the sector argue for international standards of investment.


He said that he was one of the people who supported more public funding to universities so that we would not be in this bind of raising fees to make up the difference.


The real issue here is: how are we going to fund our universities? Do we agree, first and foremost, that education is the most important investment we can make in the country in order not only to survive in the face of global warming but to reduce to gap between the rich and the poor—that inequality in wealth that we have in this country? I would argue that it is the most important thing we can do. That is why we should be raising the money from those who can afford to pay it and investing it in 21st century national infrastructure—and by infrastructure I mean brains, in the human capacity base of this country. Of course, we also need to invest in other infrastructure, but that is where we need to be fundamentally going.


I am concerned that, with this deregulation proposal, a teacher would graduate with a HECS debt of around $90,000, and it would take them decades—up to 40 years and more—to pay it off. Women are going to be disadvantaged in this context, because they are the ones who often end up taking time out in part-time work or no work, ultimately resuming full-time work once the children go to school. They would then spend years paying this debt back.


The University of Tasmania is in a unique position because we have only one university for the whole state. That does not apply anywhere else. The University of Tasmania is the key to improving educational opportunities for all Tasmanians. The university has a campus in Launceston and opened a campus on the north-west coast. The north-west coast is an area of Tasmania with one of the poorest retention rates to senior secondary education, let alone university. The provision of the north-west campus has enabled people who left school at an early age to go back and finish their education. It has been a great contribution to Tasmania, but with the cuts that were being proposed we could have seen the University of Tasmania lose out by $113 million. Not only that, but we could have seen many students not being given the opportunity to go on to further education. Since we have only one university, fee competition would not work in Tasmania. You would be saying to students: 'You can go to the mainland to try to get cheaper fees,' but the reality is that you have to pay to get there, you have to pay the rents when you get there, and you have to pay the costs of accommodation and living expenses. It just would not work out to be any cheaper. So the reality is that you are condemning Tasmanians to no competition in the scheme of things, and to having to pay whatever the fees actually result in.


We need to have a situation where we have full-time, permanent teaching staff and research staff in universities. I do not want to go down the path of seeing some universities declared universities but having no research capacity. A public university has to have teaching and research, it has to have permanent staff, it has to have opportunities for young people to achieve to their highest potential. And it has to assist this country to get where it needs to be in a world that is moving rapidly to a low carbon economy and in having to be part of developing a service sector and a global economy that is not based on the consumption of the natural resources of the planet. This week we had the International Energy Agency saying that for the first time we have global emissions flatlining from the energy sector, we have economic growth globally at three per cent and no economic downturn. That demonstrates that decoupling global greenhouse gas emissions from growth is possible, but it means that in Australia we have to have a rapid shift in the way we live, in the way that we earn, and in the way society operates. That means massive opportunity, but only if you invest in that opportunity.


I wanted to make a remark about the cutback that was proposed—the blackmail, effectively. In order for the government to try to get deregulation over the line, there was the proposal to cut research funding. That would have had a mega-negative impact on the Integrated Marine Observing System, in Tasmania, which was going to run out of funding by June. It is essential to a whole range of research not only in Tasmania but right around the world. It would have been a disaster if the government had pursued that, and for Minister Pyne to try to blackmail the parliament by saying: 'Either you pass my deregulation—




Senator O'Sullivan:
  I rise on a point of order. The reference suggesting that Minister Pyne has committed the act of blackmail has been raised here three times. Three chairs have made the people withdraw those references and I ask that you ask the senator to withdraw this assertion.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Williams
):  I will ask you, Senator Milne, to reflect on what you have said and, if you think it is appropriate, you can withdraw.




Senator MILNE:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I will rephrase what I have said and say that Minister Pyne made it very clear that unless the Senate passed his deregulation he would de-fund research institutions. I think it is pretty clear to the community what sort of standover tactic that was for the Senate, and people—absolutely correctly—have rejected it. But it demonstrates no real understanding of just how important it is that research be funded, and just how important it is that universities be funded.


I think we have got to the point in Australia—and this is where I do agree with Senator Madigan's remarks—where this parliament has to decide whether it is prepared to raise the money to fund universities. I can understand why vice-chancellors are worried about this. How are they going to cope? How are they going to run a university, have permanent staff, have the variety of courses they want to offer and be able to afford it with funding cutbacks?


That is why the Greens stand here to say we want more public funding for education from early childhood, through schools and right through universities and TAFE, and we are prepared to raise the money to pay for it by securing that money from those who can afford to pay. We could remove, for example, the fossil fuel subsidy to the big miners, $2 billion a year—$2 billion, just like that. If the government decided not to give Gina Rinehart et al that $2 billion, we would have it there to put into universities. We could do the progressive taxation on contributions to superannuation. We could restore the carbon price. What about that? That would be $13 billion over the forward estimates to bring down pollution and drive the change we need in Australia. It would bring down emissions at the same time. There are so many ways of raising money.


Yet this parliament sat here last sitting week, and Labor and the Liberals got together and gave $200 million to another subsidy to the mining industry for small miners for exploration—$200 million, just like that. 'Yes,' they said to the small mining industry, 'just go off and do that.' They removed the penalty for people who supposedly inadvertently breach the cap of superannuation contributions, yet, if those people were at Centrelink, they would be down into the criminal justice system as quick as you could say Jack Robinson. I think there are many ways of raising money, but you have to get serious about raising it from the big end of town, raising it from the tax avoiders, raising it from people who are taking their money offshore to tax havens, and actually getting stuck into the trusts in Australia that hide the level of income they get.


Let us actually fund our public universities. Wouldn't that be a great contribution to the future of this country? Let us actually make sure that those people who benefited from a free education are the people who deliver to the next generation a publicly funded education. I can tell you that, whenever I go out, people say to me how annoyed they are that the very people who benefited from Gough Whitlam's free education are the ones who have gone and cut back on that free education and have insisted on the cuts, and it is wrong. That is why the Greens will be absolutely opposing this government's legislation.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Higher Education and Research Reform Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,23,1
"Lambie, Sen Jacqui",Ind.,2015-03-17,"



Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (17:39):  For the second time since I have been elected to this place, I rise to speak to the Liberal and National parties' Higher Education and Research Reform Bill 2014. Even with the government's latest policy backflip, for the second time I inform this Senate that I will strongly oppose this legislation. The Abbott government have deliberately and slyly ambushed the Australian people with their proposed changes to university funding and proposed increases to university fees. It is a cowardly and callous pattern of political behaviour that has been repeated in other policy areas, including cuts to health funding which are designed to burn down Medicare; cuts to pensions by linking pension increases to the CPI; increasing the pension age to 70 from 2035; effective cuts to ADF members' pay entitlements; effective cuts to the Australian war veterans' pensions; and effective cuts to their entitlements.


Following Education Minister Pyne's recent announcement that he would not slash funding to our universities by 20 per cent—just yet—and he would not destroy the jobs of 1,700 researchers—any time in the next month or two—the Group of Eight universities chief executive Vicki Thomson is reported by the media to have said it would be 'unthinkable' for the government's reforms to fail. Ms Thomson is also reported to have said:


The present funding model is broken. University funding is an investment in Australia's future. The Go8 implores the Senate to this week make the right decision for every student and for Australia.


My reply to Ms Thomson and her supporters is: yes, the present funding model is broken because Labor and in particular this Liberal government have chosen to deliberately break the higher education funding model.


Labor broke the public funding model because they forgot who they were. They forgot their values and who they represented. The Liberals broke the higher education public funding model because they want us to become more like America. They want to create a society in Australia where the rich become richer and the poor know their position in life. The Liberals want a divided Australia, one run by a new blue blood, a blue-tie aristocracy where title, position, privilege and bank balance mean more than ability, hard work and perseverance. Yes, university funding is an investment in Australia's future. And, yes, both Labor and the Liberal government are guilty of failing to invest in Australia's future and Australia's young people.


How do we fix our broken model of funding for higher education? The solution is very easy. Firstly, we honestly acknowledge that successive Australian federal governments have deliberately chosen to cut back funding to our universities, while other countries' governments—a lot of the Nordic countries—chose to make higher education a priority. Generations of Australian leaders from both Labor and the Liberal Party chose not to make university funding a priority, while Finland and Norway chose to deliver the best higher education system in the world, and free of charge, to their young people.


Parliamentary Library research I commissioned says:


The Labor Government's 2013-14 Budget higher education savings measures amounted to $2.3 billion. Labor never implemented these savings. The Coalition Government adopted Labor's proposals but the legislation to implement these savings failed to pass.


The Coalition Government's 2014-15 Budget higher education savings measures amounted to $5.0 billion. The Coalition Government's first Bill to implement $3.9 billion of these savings failed to pass. The Coalition has now introduced a new Bill to implement its higher education reforms. The Coalition Government has therefore not yet implemented any of its proposed 'cuts' to higher education.


Other Parliamentary Library research I commissioned shows that, as a percentage of GDP, our university funding has decreased over the last 10 years from 0.9 per cent to 0.6 per cent. The worst years for university funding were between 2000 and 2007, where it was stuck at 0.5 per cent of the GDP. University funding dipped again in 2010-11 from 0.6 per cent to 0.5 per cent of GDP.


The Nordic countries are now absolutely reaping the social and economic benefits of the investment in higher education which they sowed, while here in Australia in 2015 we have a manufacturing industry going down the drain and workers are struggling to keep jobs and this Senate is engaged in this dumb, stupid, ridiculous debate about university funding. Should Australia invest one per cent of our GDP in higher education? Yes, you be it should. Who in their right mind could argue against the principle of one per cent of our GDP being invested in the higher education system? Australia is a First World country. We should be able to almost double our spend on higher education from around $9 billion to $18 billion. The money is there. It is just a matter of priorities. In a time of austerity, should we spend $25 billion in foreign aid over the forward estimates or should invest in Australia's poor? In a time of austerity, should we spend $5 billion in order to try to bribe our states to sell off publicly owned assets or should we help our young people further their education?


I now turn to higher education delivery in Tasmania. If this legislation passes this Senate, the so-called Liberal reforms contained in this government bill will significantly harm the best interests of Tasmania, Tasmania's current and future higher education students, and the staff in the institution of the University of Tasmania. Unlike any other state in Australia, Tasmania has only one higher education provider. We are proud of that. That is the University of Tasmania. So the danger this legislation poses is greater in my home state than in any other state.


This legislation is proof that the Liberals hate the fact that Tasmania has only one higher education provider. I do not think that it is a bad thing. This legislation will undermine the University of Tasmania's delivery of higher education and allow competition into the market. The Liberals will tell you that competition will produce better economic, academic and social outcomes, but that is another Liberal lie. That is not how it works in the real world when you provide First World essential services to places with small populations. Everyone knows that the Liberal's deregulation contained in this legislation will harm the University of Tasmania and Tasmania's reputation as a quality higher education provider.


The real reason the Liberals want to open up the higher education market is that it will allow their big business mates to make lots of money. I have met these big business people, these friends of the Liberals, their mates. They have come to my office and tried to influence me to vote for legislation that will help make them lots of money. These people boast about their power and have a hard time not licking their lips as they talk about the profits they stand to make from the taxpayers once this legislation is passed. Put simply, this legislation will allow the Liberals' mates to move in and cash in on my state's reputation as a quality higher education provider.


This Liberal legislation will allow the Liberals' mates to shamelessly cherry-pick courses and undercut the University of Tasmania because, unlike the University of Tasmania, the new providers who give the Liberal Party lots of money in political donations will not have any legislated obligations to give back to the community by investing in research. A new higher education provider, under the Liberals' rules, will be able to come into my community and set up a shop front and, without research obligations, provide a degree or associate degree with 30 per cent to 40 per cent less operating overheads than the University of Tasmania. That is not a fair system.


The owners of the new higher education providers will not have the same love for Tasmania that the current owners, the people of Tasmania, have. The new higher education owners and managers that the Liberals want to set up shop in Tasmania, unlike Professor Peter Rathjen and his team at the University of Tasmania, will not love, care for and sit at the heart of the social, intellectual and cultural life in Tasmania. The new higher education owners will be ruthless business people, motivated by performance bonuses and with one focus—profit. That will not work in Tasmania. These profits will be taken from students who will, for the first time in Australia's higher education history, receive a government subsidy that will flow to private providers who will have no real connection to the community they service.


A higher education monopoly for Tasmania has been a wonderful thing. It has provided protection while the University of Tasmania has grown and gained a critical mass and produced exceptional academic results. It has produced world-acclaimed results for the people of a state which has a total population of only a little over half a million people, less than a suburb of the capital of China. As the Vice Chancellor of the University of Tasmania Professor Peter Rathjen says in the 2014 impact study:


The University of Tasmania's 10-year  strategic plan, Open to Talent, is unequivocal about the fact that we … must continue to ""sit at the heart of social, intellectual and cultural life in Tasmania"".


If these sneaky, deceitful, harmful Liberal changes to Australia's higher education system are allowed to pass through this Senate then the Liberals will take the political gun that they have shamefully and slyly held to the head of the University of Tasmania and every other Australian university during the lead-up to this bill's consideration and place it on the chest of every Tasmanian and pull the damn trigger.


I will not allow that to happen because if you hurt the University of Tasmania you hurt every Tasmanian. Firstly, the University of Tasmania's contribution to Tasmania's economy is $1.7 billion. Secondly, one in four Tasmanians have a direct connection to the University of Tasmania. Thirdly, 5,900 people are employed by our university. Fourthly, more than 30,000 students are enrolled at the University of Tasmania. We are very proud of that. Fifthly, the University of Tasmania is ranked in the top two per cent of universities worldwide according to the Academic Ranking of World Universities 2013. I can tell you that we are very bloody proud of that. Sixthly, with a budget of $96 million, the University of Tasmania is in the nation's top 10 for research income. Seventhly, as indicated in the 2014 impact statement, the University of Tasmania is a key economic driver as well as a place of knowledge and learning, with campuses and facilities in Burnie, Launceston, Bisdee Tier in the Midlands and Hobart.


The Liberals have deliberately and carefully created a sense of panic and desperation in the minds of the people who run our universities and in the minds of our community leaders. Christopher Pyne and the PM have achieved their goals by using tactics a third-world tyrant would be proud of. Firstly, the Liberals have threatened to slash university funding by 20 per cent. secondly, they have threatened the jobs of 1,700 researchers. Thirdly, in Tasmania, they have dangled the carrot, which I am absolutely disgusted by, of $400 million worth of new university buildings. They have never put pen to paper and guaranteed funds for this much-needed and essential investment in a capital upgrade yet we have $50 billion sitting in infrastructure funding. Fourthly, the Liberals, along with the previous federal Labor government, have also deliberately cut the number of associate degrees that the University of Tasmania can teach and deliver to students. So much for Joe Hockey's 'earn or learn'. I tell you, you are not looking pretty.


The fact that both sides of parliament have cut the number of associate degrees is a significant point which has not received due consideration and has caused the University of Tasmania great harm. Associate degrees, or subdegrees, of approximately two years in length are the higher education product now in great demand, especially in Tasmania. Associate degrees have been described to me as a practical learning experience where you will gain knowledge, qualifications and a job. The University of Tasmania has identified a great demand for associate degrees and is planning on providing 10,000 associate degrees in the future to students in Tasmania. I sincerely hope they do and I support them in their plans. The only thing stopping them from going ahead with their plans is this government, which has placed an artificial and arbitrary cap on the number of associate degrees granted to our universities.


It should not come as a shock for the Senate to learn that successive governments have dramatically cut back on the availability of associate degrees. The Liberals in particular, as part of Pynes's nasty political softening up process in order—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Williams
):  Senator Lambie, excuse me. Please just pause for a minute. When you refer to those in the other place, you must refer to them by their correct title. It is either Mr Pyne or Minister Pyne, not just Pyne.




Senator LAMBIE:
  The Liberals, in particular, as part of Mr Pyne's nasty political softening up process in order to blackmail the University of Tasmania into accepting the Liberal's outrageous changes have dramatically reduced the number of associate degrees.


During a recent briefing my staff undertook with Minister Pyne's senior education officials, it was admitted that this year the University of Tasmania while asking the government for 360 associate degrees was granted only 60 associate degrees. Once again, here we go, 'earn or learn.' Parliamentary Library research I subsequently commissioned shows that in 2009 the University of Tasmanian was granted 1,095 associate degrees ; in 2010, that number was reduced to 1,023 associate degrees; in 2011, that number was reduced again to 850 associate degrees; in 2012, that number was slashed to 630; and the latest figure for 2015, which has been confirmed by Mr Pyne, is that it has been ripped down to 60. Sixty! In the space of six years, an in-demand higher education course which provides a lifeline for the state of Tasmania though UTAS has been cut from 1,095 to 60 associate degrees. That is a cut of 1,800 per cent. My question to this Liberal government and to the previous Labor government is: was this a deliberate attempt to undermine our state's economy and drive a stake through the heart of the social, intellectual and cultural life of Tasmania, or was the restriction of the availability of associate degrees just sheer incompetence?


While Tasmania has been granted only 60 associate degrees for 2015, Parliamentary Library research shows that in 2013 New South Wales had 1,091 and Victoria had 1,859. I tell you what, they are not in the same economic and social situation we are in. I am calling on the federal government to come clean on the number of associate degrees they issue and explain how they decide to issue those degrees. The Liberals must explain why they refuse to support the University of Tasmania's plan to expand this worthy program. And from the Labor party I want a guarantee that in government they will reverse the cutback in investment in our universities and set up a national goal to take our investment in university funding to one per cent of GDP. I am looking for that undertaking from the Labor Party. Answer this simple question honestly and do not ignore it: if the Nordic countries can deliver the best higher education system in the world to their young people for free, why can't we? I also want a guarantee that Labor in government will invest and allow the University of Tasmania to implement its plans to expand by delivering up to 10,000 associate degrees on the Burnie and Launceston campuses while continuing their magnificent research in Hobart.


I believe that Australia has the means and resources to deliver free higher education to our young people. However, this debate has shown that we do not have the politicians with the vision and courage to deliver free higher education to our young people. So, today, I am putting out a call to those people who want to create a better, smarter Tasmania and Australia to contact my office. I will support candidates at the next election who are prepared to work for a future where Australia has the best higher education system in the world and our government will deliver our children's first degree for free. A free first university degree for all Australian children who want and earn the opportunity will only become a wild, unachievable goal if the Senate and the parliament are populated by people who think it is a wild, unachievable goal.


For Australia to prosper and thrive, we must look to the lessons of Finland and Denmark. We must not look to America, as the Liberals want us to with their legislation. The American higher education system, according to the Economist magazine, is contributing to America's new aristocracy, a hereditary meritocracy. An Economist article examining America's higher education system states:


""MY BIG fear,"" says Paul Ryan, an influential Republican congressman from Wisconsin, is that America is losing sight of the notion that ""the condition of your birth does not determine the outcome of your life.""


We do not want that future for Tasmanian or Australia. 


In closing: if Minister Pyne and Prime Minister Tony Abbott have so much faith in the higher education reforms contained in this bill, why did they not tell the people of Tasmania and of the other states about their reforms before the last election? If the Liberal's higher education policies were any good there would not be a need for a cover-up followed by a disgraceful political ambush and now these desperate threats. I oppose this legislation with every fibre of my being. I will always do so.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-03-17,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (17:59):  I compliment Senator Lambie for a very well-researched speech outlining her concerns. The reference to The Economist magazine in relation to the US system reminds me of the documentary film Ivory Tower by filmmaker Andrew Rossi. That documentary, which I think is a couple of years old, makes the point that skyrocketing tuition prices, private and public; rapidly evolving social attitudes towards the value of a college degree; and the inevitable changes wrought by technological growth and economic disaster have had a huge impact on that sector. I am referring there to a review of the film in Variety magazine. Ivory Tower relates directly to the matters raised in The Economist magazine. Republican congressman Paul Ryan also spoke about this issue. The Variety film review states: 


One of the documentary's key points is that most colleges are no longer selling an education but an experience, happily spending millions of dollars on plush housing complexes and state-of-the-art recreational facilities in a bid to entice as many applicants as possible. It's the students who pay for these campus expansions, and not just financially: Too many schools, in the film's somewhat over-generalized estimation, have allowed academic rigor to fall by the wayside, a problem that can be attributed in part to an excess of administrators and a dearth of dedicated teaching faculty. One particularly alarming statistic — that 68% of students at public universities fail to graduate in four years — is introduced by way of a visit to Arizona State U., whose party-school rep is reinforced here by footage of a massive swimming-pool bacchanal that resembles an outtake from ""Spring Breakers.""


Clearly we do not want to go down that path. 


Senator Lambie made reference to Scandinavian countries. There is a book that I am hoping to plough through soon called Northern Lights: The Positive Policy Example of Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Norway by Andrew Scott, an Australian academic. I think we need to look at it. I think the temperament of Australians is closer to that of the Scandinavians than to that of the Americans. But, even so, it seems that what the government is proposing in this deregulated model is more radical than anything that has been tried in any OECD nation, apart from New Zealand, which went down this path of total deregulation a few years ago but then had to retreat from it because it did not work. It was a public policy mess.


At the outset I believe it is incredibly important to acknowledge that the current system of funding to universities is unsustainable. Having a demand-driven, uncapped system means that something has to change. We either go down the path that Senator Lambie has indicated, where we have to find a lot more public money for our public education, or we need to take a different approach. This requires a nuanced and sophisticated approach in terms of looking at alternatives. 


I do not believe that anyone in this debate disputes the fact that our current system of funding is unsustainable. However, I do not believe that deregulation is necessarily the best option for solving this problem. The government seems to be shifting on its proposed measures. If nothing else, I think that Minister Pyne is incredibly flexible—more flexible than a yoga instructor sometimes. There has been a lack of preparation and consultation before such a quantum leap in higher education policy. The government went to the election with a promise of 'masterful inaction'. That is what the Prime Minister, as opposition leader, said two years ago in respect of higher education. This is not masterful inaction; this is the biggest, most radical shake-up this country has ever seen in higher education. The government have not gone about this in a proper way in their approach to policy formulation. I am a bit old-fashioned: I think the old days of having white papers and green papers in order to have a proper process of policy formulation has much to commend itself. That is what the Hawke-Keating government did and that is what the Howard-Costello government did, and they did it very well, by and large, in getting it right in dealing with these issues. 


What happened on the weekend is that Minister Pyne threatened to shut down NCRIS, the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy, the very backbone of research in this country involving the 1,700 scientists funded by it—some of our best and brightest minds—and providing a backbone for research infrastructure not just for universities but for businesses, for absolutely groundbreaking innovation that can make a difference, whether in the wine industry in my home state, whether in medicine, whether in a whole range of telecommunications. That is all about the clever country. What the minister said on Sunday was extraordinarily foolish on his part. I bear some responsibility. The minister was a student of mine some 27 years ago at what is now the University of South Australia, so I guess I have taught him everything that he does not know. I think the minister's interview with David Speers yesterday, if not already a cult classic, will become a cult classic. The last 24 to 48 hours have been a very unfortunate exercise. I give the minister full marks for being indefatigable in relation to this issue, but I cannot accept what the government is doing. I cannot support it.


In the budget last year—it seems so long ago, but in some respects it only seems like yesterday—the government wanted to bring about these reforms with significant savings, with cuts to the sector that would have saved billions of dollars over the forward estimates. We now have a situation where the government is looking at spending another $1 billion to $1½ billion a year. Perhaps Senator Carr can help me out on that. It seems there has been a complete reversal of fortune in terms of what the government is proposing. It is now going to cost a lot more money.


Deregulation is not something that can be easily undone. Once you have the deregulation genie out of the bottle, you cannot put it back in. We have to be very careful about this. We need to have a full understanding of the implications, particularly those in the longer term, before we make such significant changes. My argument has always been that this is not an ordinary market that we are dealing with. This is not an ordinary case of supply and demand. 


Ross Gittins, the economics editor for The Sydney Morning Herald, in his opinion piece entitled 'Why ""competition"" means university fees will rise', published on 31 May 2014, makes a very good point. Even according to one of the authors of the Kempt-Norton report, Andrew Norton, 'the initial increase will be no more than $6000 a year' in fees. But that is still an increase—a very appreciable increase. Mr Gittins makes the point that:


The simple model of how markets work taught in introductory economics courses leaves many people with excessive faith in the ability of market competition to foster increased efficiency, constrain price increases and ensure customers get high quality.


This is not an ordinary market it does not work like that. This is different by virtue of HECS: the HECS Support fee allows students get support to fund their higher education. Gittins makes the point:


There's no profit motive. And, as any academic will tell you, unis are highly inefficient, bureaucratic organisations dominated by administrators. The safest prediction is that giving unis greater revenue-raising ability will lead to them employing more administrators.


How can uni fees be regarded as a ''price'' in the textbook sense when people are lent the money to pay the price under a concessional loan they won't have to repay for years?


In effect, universities have a government-regulated monopoly over a product that gives young people access to the country's highly paid jobs. What will they do when the price jumps - abandon all ambition? Demand seems highly ''price inelastic'' - unresponsive to price changes.


The one point that Gittins makes that, I think, proves that is: back in 2004, as I understand it, the Howard government, through Brendan Nelson as education minister, allowed universities to increase their fees by a maximum of 25 per cent. Invariably, all universities increased their fees by 25 per cent, bar one. That university thought that there was a competitive advantage: 'We'll charge a little bit less and more students will come flocking to us.' Guess what? That university saw a collapse in its enrolments and had to increase its fees up by the full 25 per cent the following year. 


This is not an ordinary market; this is why deregulation needs to be treated very carefully in the context of this debate. I want to consider the issue of how to cut the Gordian knot of university funding in a way that is equitable, fair and will work in the long term so that we do not end up with a US situation, as described in the documentary, Ivory Tower. I wrote to Minister Pyne on 20 January 2015—it seems much longer ago—and I am very happy to provide my colleagues with a copy of this letter, which was sent publicly to the media, unions and university administrators, which, as a courtesy, I let the minister know that. I suggested to the minister, respectfully, that there ought to be a useful way forward to establish an independent panel to undertake a root-and-branch review of Australia's higher education sector. A review that took into account the role the sector plays in Australian society, both in economic and social terms. It should be a review that looks at where we want to go and how best to get there, both in a local and global context. I suggested it could take up to 18 months, but it could take much less than that, if it were done with some alacrity, if it were done properly and if there were a panel of experts and terms of reference with cross party support—government, opposition and crossbenchers in this place and in the other place. There needs to be consensus on the terms of reference and on the panel of experts, where there can be a robust debate and robust analysis about where sector is going. I suggested that, as an interim measure, universities should be allowed to increase their fees to a cap to allow them to recoup any government cuts. Well, those are now off the table. I understand the funding pressures of universities and there ought to be—as unpalatable as it may be for some—some modest increase in university fees, if such a funding crisis emerges in the higher education sector. That is something that would give us some breathing space, so we may try to get the policy settings right once and for all.


The findings of the panel would presumably be a template for government reforms and, hopefully, have cross party support. The government should implement any measures necessary to allow universities to increase their fees in accordance with the funding. I think the terms of reference should look at the current role of the higher education sector in Australia, the higher education experience of students studying in Australia and how Australia measures up in terms of the world's best practice. We need to avoid the pitfalls of other countries which have gone down difficult paths that have not worked in terms of student outcomes and have cost the budget's bottom line and cost students themselves. I suggested that this review could be comprehensive in much the same way as the Murray report, which in 1957 provided a detailed study of universities in post-war Australia for Prime Minister Menzies. I hasten to add that the Murray report was not written by David Murray—it has not been around that long. The 1957 review was written by another Mr Murray, but it is a very useful report and it is worth reading to see the sorts of challenges which they faced then and which are echoed in some of the problems we face now.


The minister has not taken up my suggestion, and more is the pity. Maybe he needs to look at that; maybe we need to have some bipartisan, cross party way of dealing with this very serious issues in the sector. If the government will not do that, then the government needs to look at the usual green-and-white-paper process to ensure that a proposal has been appropriately and thoroughly discussed, debated and modelled. This may seem cumbersome to the government, but so far the policy formulation in this area has not worked, despite the best endeavours of the minister's office and there are some very capable people in his office. 


We have recently seen proposals by Professor Bruce Chapman that would implement a progressive taxation on universities to reduce the Commonwealth subsidies by a certain amount if their fees rose above a certain level. There are various gradations and variations that. Unfortunately, I was not able to meet Prof Chapman today, but I hope to be able to speak to him in the next day or so. The concern is: what effect will it have for the so-called sandstone universities—the Group of Eight universities—when compared to other universities? Will we see a significant inflationary effect in respect of that? We need to have some modelling. I understand that perhaps the department has done that modelling, but that needs to be out in the open. I have not seen the modelling. We need some transparency in this process. 


An article in The Sydney Morning Herald on 17 February by the enigmatic Matthew Knott, under the headline 'Fee deregulation will drive up deficit', says that NATSEM, the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, the same people that the coalition used when in opposition for the modelling of their policy formulations—so I reject any suggestion that they are anything other than a pretty robust organisation in terms of their modelling—have suggested:


The Abbott government's plan to deregulate university fees would likely drive up inflation and drain billions of dollars from the budget over the long term rather than saving taxpayers money as originally intended …


In other words, this would be not a zero-sum game but a negative game in the sense that it would actually cost taxpayers more money because it would also have an inflationary effect.


I also think that the debate has lacked a nuanced approach in terms of some of the other issues that need to be tackled, and the best way of summarising that is in a new book that was dropped off to my office yesterday—and I should disclose I will make sure I pay for it, Mr Deputy President!—called Universities and Innovation Economies: The Creative Wasteland of Post-Industrial Society, by Professor Peter Murphy of James Cook University. I am trying to get in touch with Professor Murphy and I am looking forward to discussing this with him. But even just a summary of the book resonates with me in terms of some of the issues we face in this sector. This is what it says:


Students drop out of universities in large numbers, many graduate to jobs that do not require a degree and a large number learn little at university, whilst graduate salaries have shrunk over time and student loan debt and default have grown. University research achievements have declined while university administration has expanded massively. The contemporary university is mired in auditing, regulation, waste and aimlessness and its contribution to serious social innovation has deteriorated markedly. The miserable state of the universities reflects a larger social reality, as bureaucratic capitalism has replaced creative capitalism.


I am not necessarily endorsing what Professor Murphy is saying. What I am saying is that this debate has not looked at the issue of university dropout rates, which are very significant in terms of what they cost taxpayers but, more importantly, what they cost students in the months and sometimes years of their lives spent doing a course that they drop out of, where maybe a bit of counselling and guidance could have made a difference.


My concern is that allowing universities to set their own fees means that, in theory, they would no longer need to rely on government funding. That may be a very attractive proposition to future governments, which may start to see Commonwealth contributions as a place to make easy savings. The minister made the point to me yesterday that it would still need to get through the parliament; but who knows what may happen in years to come? There may even be bipartisan consensus on that—dare I say, not while Senator Carr is in this parliament!




Senator Kim Carr:
  Absolutely!




Senator XENOPHON:
  But who knows what might happen if you set up a framework in years to come, when Senator Carr is not here—in 2045; or maybe he will be here in 2045! It may be problematic. 


It is also important to consider the impact of HECS, which was alluded to by Ross Gittins. I do not want to criticise this scheme—far from it. It is a terrific scheme. It is an outstanding measure that sets our higher education system apart. But that has to be taken into account in the context of deregulation and issues of market failure. 


I think that what we need to do now is pause. We need to actually reflect on what needs to be done. Reform is needed in this sector. We want to have the best university and higher education sector in the world. 


We also need to acknowledge, in the brief time I have available in this debate, the issue put forward by the Council of Private Higher Education. I spoke today to Reverend Dr Don Owers AM, who runs Tabor, a college in Adelaide. I have enormous regard for him. He is concerned that these reforms proposed by the government could have been fairer if they had removed some of the equity barriers facing private higher education providers. I think that needs to be on the agenda as well. 


But what we have right now is a mess. We need to step back from this and look at some comprehensive reform to get this right, because what has happened to date is less than satisfactory. We need to get this right. We owe it to the students of Australia and we owe it to the taxpayers of Australia to get this right. I cannot support the second reading of this bill but I hazard a guess that this will not be the end of it. We still have much work to do to do the right thing by this sector.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Higher Education and Research Reform Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,23,1
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2015-03-17,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Education and Training) (18:19):  In closing the second reading debate on the Higher Education and Research Reform Bill 2014, I thank all senators for their contributions to this debate, much as I may not agree with all that has been said. In closing this debate, I also seek to argue the case for greater autonomy and greater freedom for Australian universities to give Australian universities to lift themselves, to lift the outcomes for students and to lift the economic contribution they make to Australia to the types of heights and levels that we know they are capable of doing, have done for years and can do again in the future—if we give them the capacity and the freedom and the autonomy to do so. 


… it is … clear that government alone cannot provide all the additional funding necessary for our universities to become top notch.


…   …   …


… we propose that Australian universities be free to set student fees according to the market value of their degrees. A deregulated or market-based HECS will make the student contribution system fairer, because the fees students pay will more closely approximate the value they receive through future earnings. Market-based HECS will also help to improve our higher education system by making universities even more responsive to student needs and educational outcomes. 


They are not my words; they are the words of Andrew Leigh, the shadow Assistant Treasurer, a member of the Labor Party's shadow executive today. 


It is time to change our one-size-fits-all funding system and let diversity develop.


Again, they are not my words. They are the words of Gareth Evans, former Labor Party foreign minister of long standing.


I want Labor to be a positive player, not just a blocker.


They are not my words but the words of former federal Labor MP Maxine McKew, speaking about higher education reform. 


… the ALP ought to engage with the government to negotiate the further reform of higher education …


…   …   …


It's a great pity that Labor is sitting on its hands this time.


Again, they are not my words but the words of John Dawkins, former Labor Party Treasurer in the Keating government, education minister in the Hawke government and architect of the modern HECS. Peter Beattie commented: 


Make no mistake, without funding reform, Australia's universities will inevitably slip towards mediocrity and the quality of Australian graduates will decline in relation to our international competitors, both in business and education.


Once again, these are not my words. They are the words of Peter Beattie, a former long-serving Queensland Labor Party premier. 


Through much of the debate, we have heard from those opposite that this is some type of great partisan divide. But, with Peter Beattie, Gareth Evans, John Dawkins, Maxine McKew and Andrew Leigh all having argued the case for reform, it is crystal clear that it is not a partisan divide in terms of good, sound policy; it is simply the case that those opposite want to play politics and run a scare campaign, when what they should be doing is embracing reform that is good and worthwhile for Australia's future.


They need not, though, listen to Labor members past and present—those who have led their party through great reform. They could instead heed the advice of, and listen to, the education sector, who have equally argued passionately and strongly for the adoption—if not of this exact model that is before the chamber—at least for reform of the type and nature of reform that is before the chamber. And they have argued for that reform to be made as quickly as possible. 


Universities Australia have embraced the need for reform and called for reform, and 40 of the nation's 41 vice-chancellors have stood behind Universities Australia in their call. The Innovative Research Universities have embraced the call for action. The Regional Universities Network have done so. In their most recent statement, they say:


It is essential for regional universities and their students to retain the demand driven student system for bachelor places and to expand this to sub-bachelor degrees to provide more pathways for less well prepared students. The higher education system must be adequately funded to ensure quality and sustainability, and the deregulation of fees provides the most realistic way to do this.


…   …   …


RUN urges the Senate to end the uncertainty for students and universities and to pass the package.


The Group of Eight universities have been equally—if not even more—emphatic in their support. The Australian Council for Private Education and Training have supported the reforms. TAFE Directors Australia have supported these reforms. This reform package has brought together a level of support across Australia's education sector in ways, frankly, never seen before for a major reform package. To have all elements, essentially, of the education sector backing this reform is a demonstration that the government has listened and acted and developed a policy that should be supported by those opposite. The sector supports this, because they recognise that current funding arrangements based on the uncapped demand driven system for university places is unsustainable. They recognise that the current arrangement is hurting quality. The current arrangement reduces the incentive for innovation by Australia's universities. It reduces the incentive for excellence in Australia's universities. It reduces the incentive for specialisation among Australia's universities. 


The package that we have brought to this parliament will provide the capacity for universities to be set free to be able to choose how they will differentiate themselves from each other; how they can specialise; in what fields to develop excellence; and, yes, to differentiate that, in part, by cost. This is also a proposal that dramatically increases access for Australians. I singled out the Regional Universities Network to quote before, because, of course they are representing the universities who most frequently are providing opportunities for students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, for students who may not historically or traditionally have made it into university. The Regional Universities Network is passionately supporting the passage of this legislation, just as is the rest of the sector.


Before I get to some of the specifics in the bill, I will address some of the contributions that have been made. I listened to Senator Lamble's contribution and I acknowledge the passion in her contribution and the passionate defence that she made for the University of Tasmania. But I note that the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Tasmania is one of the 40 of the 41 vice-chancellors from Universities Australia who are supporting this reform. 


Senator Lambie made an equally passionate call for more diplomas and more associate degree places to be available in Tasmania through the University of Tasmania. That is exactly what this package, if passed, would do. It would remove the cap and enable the University of Tasmania—indeed, all of the Regional Universities Network and all of the universities of Australia—to offer Commonwealth subsidised places for diplomas and associate degrees without that cap in place. It would uncap those sub-bachelor levels and allow them to provide greater pathways to students who may not have the skills, capacity or ATAR score to get into a degree level course.


I also noted that Senator Lambie, and I think Senator Xenophon did similarly, argued the case for—and highlighted international examples of—so-called free education. Again, I will quote Andrew Leigh, the shadow Assistant Treasurer: 'If university fees were abolished, as dewy-eyed Whitlamites often demand, this would effectively redistribute scarce government funds from those who do not go to university to those who do. Given that those who attend university tend to be richer than those who do not and are likely to be richer as a result of their education, this would simply widen the already large income gap between the tertiary educated and the non-tertiary educated. Australia should be in the business of reducing not increasing inequality. For these reasons, it is appropriate for students themselves to meet some of the costs of their education.' The argument against that notion of free education is a real one because, if you say that education will be funded by all taxpayers, of course you are putting a greater and more disproportionate load on the taxpayers who never go to university. What our reforms are doing and what governments since the introduction of HECS have done is seek to create a system whereby those who benefit from the university education make a fair contribution to it.


But equally appreciate that under our model every bachelor degree course, every sub-bachelor degree course and every diploma course offered through this model would still be attracting Commonwealth subsidies. Students would not be paying the full fees. There is a Commonwealth subsidy attached, and beyond that there is, of course, the opportunity to access HECS, meaning nobody need pay a single cent up-front.


Senator Xenophon, in his contribution, spoke about consultation. Well, Senator Xenophon, there has been a world of consultation. There has, of course, been the Kemp-Norton review, which was the latest of 33 reviews into Australia's higher education system since 1950—not counting, of course, the countless Senate inquiries or parliamentary inquiries that could be added on top of that. The issue of deregulation has been discussed and looked at by many. Of course, the consultation has been such that we have built the body of support across the nation's educational institutions that I outlined before. He argued—and we have heard it from Senator Carr as well at times—that this would create a US-style system. Again I emphasise, though, that we have HECS. It means nobody need pay a single cent up-front. That is not a US-style system; it is far, far from it. He did acknowledge—and I know a number on the crossbenches have acknowledged—that there is a level of unsustainability and a pressure in the Australian university system at present that cannot be sustained. Senator Xenophon said he may be willing to support some fee increase at present—a lifting of the cap. But I equally note that he acknowledged that, when that was last done, all we saw was that everybody moved up to the new cap and that you did not effectively get any sense of competition in the sector or any sense of specialisation or innovation.


Senator Carr argues that this is a contrived funding crisis. That does not seem to be the view held by the universities, and of course we know that the reality is that the Labor Party announced cuts to higher education and research of $6.6 billion from 2011 to 2013. Every six months, in every budget and every MYEFO, there were cuts from the Labor party. He too argues that we wish to create an Americanised system. I made the point before that HECS makes this a vastly different system, and HECS remains fundamental to it, so that nobody need pay one cent up-front.


They argue that university will only be for the wealthy. All of this has been part of a terrible, vicious scare campaign to suggest somehow that people will be shut out of universities. Thankfully, the students are smarter than that. Of course, that has been the trend ever since HECS was introduced. University enrolments have continued to increase since the Hawke government introduced HECS. They went up and have gone up at every increase in fees that has occurred under HECS. The access to university has continued to grow, because students and their families see the opportunity of university education and realise the equity in the fact that nobody in Australia need pay up-front, because of HECS, but know that there is sufficient private gain and personal benefit for them to take on that student debt and that it will be worthwhile to pay it off through their career, through the generous arrangements that successive Australian governments have supported, because they will gain a higher income and greater opportunity as a result of it. This year, we have continued to see increased enrolments despite the Labor Party's fear campaign and their attempts to drive people out.


Of course, that fear campaign has not just been about arguing that there would be up-front fees somehow; it has also involved the Labor Party throwing around this notion of the $100,000 degree. I am indebted to the Group of Eight universities for highlighting that the $100,000 degree is simply impossible under the reforms being proposed, because the reforms being proposed require that fees be no higher than what is currently charged for international students, minus the level of Commonwealth subsidy being paid. In no circumstance does that get you to over $100,000. It is, as has been the case time and time again through this debate, another instance of Senator Carr, Mr Shorten and the Labor Party misleading.


This legislation creates great new opportunities—new opportunities to expand access to education for Australians, and new opportunities for Australia's universities to position themselves to excel on the world stage and deliver greater benefits to our economy into the future. It will allow our universities to specialise and provide the best possible education for their students. We are guaranteeing that domestic undergraduate fees will always be lower than international fees. It will create a major new Commonwealth scholarship program to help students with living and other expenses. It will spread opportunity for students who need pathways to qualify for university or sub-degree qualifications to prepare them for their jobs. It will create an incentive for universities to invest more in those pathway and sub-bachelor degree courses, rather than the model at present, which creates maximum incentive for universities to stuff as many bachelor degree students into the lecture room as they possibly can. It will create a fairer spread of HECS to students who choose to study with non-university higher education providers, such as private colleges or TAFEs. And it will eliminate the differential in loan fees that those students outside the university system face. It, of course, maintains the CPI as the determinant for increase in HECS over time but adds a new interest rate pause for new parents, as proposed by Senator Madigan and others on the crossbench. It is estimated to create opportunities for an extra 80,000 people to access higher education as a result of the package proposed here.


The alternative is, of course, to look at what the Labor Party is proposing, which would tear up the reforms of the Gillard government in uncapping university places and would put at risk 120,000 places at university in the future. It is a stark contrast between those opposite, who would seek to asphyxiate innovation in the university sector, and those on this side, who seek to provide a chance for universities to chart their own destiny and provide real opportunities for the future.


We have listened through this debate—through the successive debates—around higher education. When this matter was considered last year we adopted a number of amendments to the package from those on the crossbench. We have listened this time around and sought to unclutter the debate and ensure we can simply have a positive debate about the merits of providing freedom and autonomy to Australia's universities rather than regulating them ultimately to a poorer future. I urge those in the chamber—those on the crossbenches—to engage in this debate sufficiently that we can proceed beyond the second reading, to give consideration to the amendments the government has circulated in our attempt to facilitate a focused debate around the future of universities and how they fund themselves.


I particularly urge those opposite as we move beyond this debate, noting that it is likely to be unsuccessful today, to take a long, hard look at themselves and their position in relation to the history of higher education and where they stand today, because they are turning their back on their legacy of creating HECS. They are turning their back on Julia Gillard's legacy of uncapping places. We want to create that autonomy and that freedom and unshackle Australia's universities, and that is exactly what this bill does.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the bill be now read a second time.

"Madigan, Sen John",Ind.,2015-03-17,"



Senator MADIGAN
 (Victoria) (17:17):  I rise to speak today on the Higher Education and Research Reform Bill 2014 for the second time.


Due to the complexities of this bill, I have seen two main responses. One is highly-uninformed debate within the community about the current situation and the government's proposals. And the second is a lack of courage by senators of all political persuasions to engage with the government to evolve the higher education model to something more sustainable. I am more than happy to excuse the first point. The Australian community always has good reason to have a heightened level of cynicism when announcements are made by any Australian government. However, the second point is a little more disturbing.


We, as senators, are paid to do a job. Because of the makeup of the current Senate, we on the crossbench are expected to be more responsible and accountable than the opposition. Australians expect the opposition of the day to be obstructionist, but they expect minor party and Independent senators to be impartial. The Australian people have charged the crossbench with a great privilege and a great responsibility.


This bill is before us today because the government believes it is a priority. The government was elected to pursue matters which they believe are priorities. Now, the Senate by no means should act as a rubber stamp, and the Senate should provide scrutiny. But voting down a bill at the second reading before senators have even had a chance to amend a serious bill such as this is absolutely abdicating one's responsibility. Nearly every party involved in this debate agrees that the current system is unsustainable and that change is going to come. It is not a matter of 'if' but 'when'.


Today we, as the crossbench, are in the unique position to review, amend and improve this legislation. We owe it to the Australian people to do just that. In five years' time there may not be a crossbench to scrutinise potential reforms. It is on this day, in this chamber, that we have the opportunity to make positive change. If this bill is taken to an election, like some in this place have called for, then we will lose our ability to have a positive influence. The major parties will have it all their own way. No matter which party wins the next election with their policy, the Australian people and our tertiary education system will lose. I urge my fellow senators to put aside political interest and populism and to do the jobs they were elected to do.


I understand that there is little political benefit in the crossbench working with the government, but this should not be about votes. This should be about doing what is right by our students and our country. Again, I am not asking senators ultimately to support a bill they may disagree with. I am simply calling on them to give this bill a chance to be amended and improved. If, at the end of the day, my fellow crossbench senators still oppose the amended bill then I absolutely respect their right to vote it down. But at least we can say that we have tried to work with the government rather than simply being obstructionist for the sake of it. I believe that, if the Senate put politics and opportunism aside for a minute, we might actually create a fair sustainable and equitable system which would benefit all Australians, but most importantly our students.


We have an opportunity here today to make universities more equitable with the right amendments. This is particularly the case for students from low socioeconomic backgrounds and those from rural and regional Australia. With the right amendments the Senate can leave a positive mark on Australia's higher education landscape. With the right amendments the Senate could create a scholarship system worth hundreds of millions of dollars. This money could be used to pay for accommodation and living expenses, or it could be used to pay for books for disadvantaged university students. 


This bill may have the potential to make more seats available in university libraries right across the country at exam time. It may have the potential to fund universities to such an extent that they can purchase sufficient copies of books that are considered recommended reading for students. With the right amendments this bill might have the potential to create a better university system for all of our students. The fact of the matter is we are suffocating universities. We have spent such an enormous portion of this debate thinking about the glory days that we have not taken notice of the impact of budget cuts of successive governments, of all persuasions, to the sector. 


In summary, I would like to finish off where I began. Senators have been charged with a great privilege, but with it comes great responsibility. I have serious concerns with the bill in its current form, but I also fear the consequences of doing nothing. Thank you.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2015-03-17,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (17:24):  I rise today to oppose the government's legislation to deregulate higher education. 


A great public purpose requires adequate public funding. That is the matter at hand here today. I reject the remarks from Senator Madigan that people 'do not have the courage of their convictions' in here and that people are 'not doing the right thing' by the university sector. Let me tell you: the Greens have consistently opposed cuts to university funding and cuts to research funding. We have done so always. We have also put forward propositions to raise the revenue in order to fund public education, public universities and research and development. 


As recently as a week ago, I put forward a proposal that we stop the flat rate of 15 per cent tax on contributions to superannuation and that we do it in a progressive way, similar to income tax. That would raise $10 billion over the forward estimates. The vice-chancellors a few years ago ran a very strong campaign trying to argue to the Australian community that we needed to raise more revenue to spend on universities. I agree. The Greens were out there supporting the campaign to raise revenue to put more public money into universities. 


But I have to say to you that Senator Madigan was correct in saying that over recent years—over decades actually—the level of funding to universities has been cut back. When the former Labor government in their MYEFO statement in 2012-13 announced cuts to research, we objected to that. When Labor announced, in April 2013 going into the election, cuts to university funding, we opposed it. And we went into the election opposing it. We said that after the election Labor in opposition would change its mind. It did, and I am very pleased about that, because the fundamental principle here is: if you want to change from a 'dig it up, cut it down, ship it away' economy to a 21st century economy where imagination is the key resource—not coal, not iron ore, not cutting down native forests, but actually investing in the brains base of this nation—then you have to fund public education and universities. 


Where the last government went wrong was the announcement that they would cut the funding to universities in order to spend it on the Gonski reforms. I totally support the Gonski reforms—they should have gone ahead and we should be funding that—but you do not take money out of universities to fund public schools; you need to fund education at every level, from early childhood right through the school system through to universities and TAFEs. That is the way of the future in Australia. 


I am one of those people who was at university before Gough Whitlam brought in free education in Australia. I come from a relatively poor farming family in the north-west of Tasmania. My parents were dairy farmers. My mother was a teacher. In order for me to get through school I got scholarships, and I had to get scholarships to get to university. I had the choice between a Commonwealth scholarship and a teacher studentship, and I took the teacher studentship because it paid more than a Commonwealth scholarship at that time. 


So I can tell you that I know what it is like to be fronting the fact that you may not be able to go to university because you cannot afford it. That is precisely the case for so many people and that is why deregulation is so wrong. It is wrong to say to young people: 'The parliament of Australia refuses to raise the revenue to put into schools and public education'. The result is that we are going to cut public funding to universities and we are going to tell the universities they have to raise fees in order to cover the gap. And raising those fees of course means hurting a lot of people and making people think twice about the course they go into. They will not have the same choices that they otherwise would. 


In a speech he made on this very issue, Professor Glyn Davies said:


Australia spends proportionally less public money on universities than most OECD countries, yet few outside the sector argue for international standards of investment.


He said that he was one of the people who supported more public funding to universities so that we would not be in this bind of raising fees to make up the difference.


The real issue here is: how are we going to fund our universities? Do we agree, first and foremost, that education is the most important investment we can make in the country in order not only to survive in the face of global warming but to reduce to gap between the rich and the poor—that inequality in wealth that we have in this country? I would argue that it is the most important thing we can do. That is why we should be raising the money from those who can afford to pay it and investing it in 21st century national infrastructure—and by infrastructure I mean brains, in the human capacity base of this country. Of course, we also need to invest in other infrastructure, but that is where we need to be fundamentally going.


I am concerned that, with this deregulation proposal, a teacher would graduate with a HECS debt of around $90,000, and it would take them decades—up to 40 years and more—to pay it off. Women are going to be disadvantaged in this context, because they are the ones who often end up taking time out in part-time work or no work, ultimately resuming full-time work once the children go to school. They would then spend years paying this debt back.


The University of Tasmania is in a unique position because we have only one university for the whole state. That does not apply anywhere else. The University of Tasmania is the key to improving educational opportunities for all Tasmanians. The university has a campus in Launceston and opened a campus on the north-west coast. The north-west coast is an area of Tasmania with one of the poorest retention rates to senior secondary education, let alone university. The provision of the north-west campus has enabled people who left school at an early age to go back and finish their education. It has been a great contribution to Tasmania, but with the cuts that were being proposed we could have seen the University of Tasmania lose out by $113 million. Not only that, but we could have seen many students not being given the opportunity to go on to further education. Since we have only one university, fee competition would not work in Tasmania. You would be saying to students: 'You can go to the mainland to try to get cheaper fees,' but the reality is that you have to pay to get there, you have to pay the rents when you get there, and you have to pay the costs of accommodation and living expenses. It just would not work out to be any cheaper. So the reality is that you are condemning Tasmanians to no competition in the scheme of things, and to having to pay whatever the fees actually result in.


We need to have a situation where we have full-time, permanent teaching staff and research staff in universities. I do not want to go down the path of seeing some universities declared universities but having no research capacity. A public university has to have teaching and research, it has to have permanent staff, it has to have opportunities for young people to achieve to their highest potential. And it has to assist this country to get where it needs to be in a world that is moving rapidly to a low carbon economy and in having to be part of developing a service sector and a global economy that is not based on the consumption of the natural resources of the planet. This week we had the International Energy Agency saying that for the first time we have global emissions flatlining from the energy sector, we have economic growth globally at three per cent and no economic downturn. That demonstrates that decoupling global greenhouse gas emissions from growth is possible, but it means that in Australia we have to have a rapid shift in the way we live, in the way that we earn, and in the way society operates. That means massive opportunity, but only if you invest in that opportunity.


I wanted to make a remark about the cutback that was proposed—the blackmail, effectively. In order for the government to try to get deregulation over the line, there was the proposal to cut research funding. That would have had a mega-negative impact on the Integrated Marine Observing System, in Tasmania, which was going to run out of funding by June. It is essential to a whole range of research not only in Tasmania but right around the world. It would have been a disaster if the government had pursued that, and for Minister Pyne to try to blackmail the parliament by saying: 'Either you pass my deregulation—




Senator O'Sullivan:
  I rise on a point of order. The reference suggesting that Minister Pyne has committed the act of blackmail has been raised here three times. Three chairs have made the people withdraw those references and I ask that you ask the senator to withdraw this assertion.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Williams
):  I will ask you, Senator Milne, to reflect on what you have said and, if you think it is appropriate, you can withdraw.




Senator MILNE:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I will rephrase what I have said and say that Minister Pyne made it very clear that unless the Senate passed his deregulation he would de-fund research institutions. I think it is pretty clear to the community what sort of standover tactic that was for the Senate, and people—absolutely correctly—have rejected it. But it demonstrates no real understanding of just how important it is that research be funded, and just how important it is that universities be funded.


I think we have got to the point in Australia—and this is where I do agree with Senator Madigan's remarks—where this parliament has to decide whether it is prepared to raise the money to fund universities. I can understand why vice-chancellors are worried about this. How are they going to cope? How are they going to run a university, have permanent staff, have the variety of courses they want to offer and be able to afford it with funding cutbacks?


That is why the Greens stand here to say we want more public funding for education from early childhood, through schools and right through universities and TAFE, and we are prepared to raise the money to pay for it by securing that money from those who can afford to pay. We could remove, for example, the fossil fuel subsidy to the big miners, $2 billion a year—$2 billion, just like that. If the government decided not to give Gina Rinehart et al that $2 billion, we would have it there to put into universities. We could do the progressive taxation on contributions to superannuation. We could restore the carbon price. What about that? That would be $13 billion over the forward estimates to bring down pollution and drive the change we need in Australia. It would bring down emissions at the same time. There are so many ways of raising money.


Yet this parliament sat here last sitting week, and Labor and the Liberals got together and gave $200 million to another subsidy to the mining industry for small miners for exploration—$200 million, just like that. 'Yes,' they said to the small mining industry, 'just go off and do that.' They removed the penalty for people who supposedly inadvertently breach the cap of superannuation contributions, yet, if those people were at Centrelink, they would be down into the criminal justice system as quick as you could say Jack Robinson. I think there are many ways of raising money, but you have to get serious about raising it from the big end of town, raising it from the tax avoiders, raising it from people who are taking their money offshore to tax havens, and actually getting stuck into the trusts in Australia that hide the level of income they get.


Let us actually fund our public universities. Wouldn't that be a great contribution to the future of this country? Let us actually make sure that those people who benefited from a free education are the people who deliver to the next generation a publicly funded education. I can tell you that, whenever I go out, people say to me how annoyed they are that the very people who benefited from Gough Whitlam's free education are the ones who have gone and cut back on that free education and have insisted on the cuts, and it is wrong. That is why the Greens will be absolutely opposing this government's legislation.

"Lambie, Sen Jacqui",Ind.,2015-03-17,"



Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (17:39):  For the second time since I have been elected to this place, I rise to speak to the Liberal and National parties' Higher Education and Research Reform Bill 2014. Even with the government's latest policy backflip, for the second time I inform this Senate that I will strongly oppose this legislation. The Abbott government have deliberately and slyly ambushed the Australian people with their proposed changes to university funding and proposed increases to university fees. It is a cowardly and callous pattern of political behaviour that has been repeated in other policy areas, including cuts to health funding which are designed to burn down Medicare; cuts to pensions by linking pension increases to the CPI; increasing the pension age to 70 from 2035; effective cuts to ADF members' pay entitlements; effective cuts to the Australian war veterans' pensions; and effective cuts to their entitlements.


Following Education Minister Pyne's recent announcement that he would not slash funding to our universities by 20 per cent—just yet—and he would not destroy the jobs of 1,700 researchers—any time in the next month or two—the Group of Eight universities chief executive Vicki Thomson is reported by the media to have said it would be 'unthinkable' for the government's reforms to fail. Ms Thomson is also reported to have said:


The present funding model is broken. University funding is an investment in Australia's future. The Go8 implores the Senate to this week make the right decision for every student and for Australia.


My reply to Ms Thomson and her supporters is: yes, the present funding model is broken because Labor and in particular this Liberal government have chosen to deliberately break the higher education funding model.


Labor broke the public funding model because they forgot who they were. They forgot their values and who they represented. The Liberals broke the higher education public funding model because they want us to become more like America. They want to create a society in Australia where the rich become richer and the poor know their position in life. The Liberals want a divided Australia, one run by a new blue blood, a blue-tie aristocracy where title, position, privilege and bank balance mean more than ability, hard work and perseverance. Yes, university funding is an investment in Australia's future. And, yes, both Labor and the Liberal government are guilty of failing to invest in Australia's future and Australia's young people.


How do we fix our broken model of funding for higher education? The solution is very easy. Firstly, we honestly acknowledge that successive Australian federal governments have deliberately chosen to cut back funding to our universities, while other countries' governments—a lot of the Nordic countries—chose to make higher education a priority. Generations of Australian leaders from both Labor and the Liberal Party chose not to make university funding a priority, while Finland and Norway chose to deliver the best higher education system in the world, and free of charge, to their young people.


Parliamentary Library research I commissioned says:


The Labor Government's 2013-14 Budget higher education savings measures amounted to $2.3 billion. Labor never implemented these savings. The Coalition Government adopted Labor's proposals but the legislation to implement these savings failed to pass.


The Coalition Government's 2014-15 Budget higher education savings measures amounted to $5.0 billion. The Coalition Government's first Bill to implement $3.9 billion of these savings failed to pass. The Coalition has now introduced a new Bill to implement its higher education reforms. The Coalition Government has therefore not yet implemented any of its proposed 'cuts' to higher education.


Other Parliamentary Library research I commissioned shows that, as a percentage of GDP, our university funding has decreased over the last 10 years from 0.9 per cent to 0.6 per cent. The worst years for university funding were between 2000 and 2007, where it was stuck at 0.5 per cent of the GDP. University funding dipped again in 2010-11 from 0.6 per cent to 0.5 per cent of GDP.


The Nordic countries are now absolutely reaping the social and economic benefits of the investment in higher education which they sowed, while here in Australia in 2015 we have a manufacturing industry going down the drain and workers are struggling to keep jobs and this Senate is engaged in this dumb, stupid, ridiculous debate about university funding. Should Australia invest one per cent of our GDP in higher education? Yes, you be it should. Who in their right mind could argue against the principle of one per cent of our GDP being invested in the higher education system? Australia is a First World country. We should be able to almost double our spend on higher education from around $9 billion to $18 billion. The money is there. It is just a matter of priorities. In a time of austerity, should we spend $25 billion in foreign aid over the forward estimates or should invest in Australia's poor? In a time of austerity, should we spend $5 billion in order to try to bribe our states to sell off publicly owned assets or should we help our young people further their education?


I now turn to higher education delivery in Tasmania. If this legislation passes this Senate, the so-called Liberal reforms contained in this government bill will significantly harm the best interests of Tasmania, Tasmania's current and future higher education students, and the staff in the institution of the University of Tasmania. Unlike any other state in Australia, Tasmania has only one higher education provider. We are proud of that. That is the University of Tasmania. So the danger this legislation poses is greater in my home state than in any other state.


This legislation is proof that the Liberals hate the fact that Tasmania has only one higher education provider. I do not think that it is a bad thing. This legislation will undermine the University of Tasmania's delivery of higher education and allow competition into the market. The Liberals will tell you that competition will produce better economic, academic and social outcomes, but that is another Liberal lie. That is not how it works in the real world when you provide First World essential services to places with small populations. Everyone knows that the Liberal's deregulation contained in this legislation will harm the University of Tasmania and Tasmania's reputation as a quality higher education provider.


The real reason the Liberals want to open up the higher education market is that it will allow their big business mates to make lots of money. I have met these big business people, these friends of the Liberals, their mates. They have come to my office and tried to influence me to vote for legislation that will help make them lots of money. These people boast about their power and have a hard time not licking their lips as they talk about the profits they stand to make from the taxpayers once this legislation is passed. Put simply, this legislation will allow the Liberals' mates to move in and cash in on my state's reputation as a quality higher education provider.


This Liberal legislation will allow the Liberals' mates to shamelessly cherry-pick courses and undercut the University of Tasmania because, unlike the University of Tasmania, the new providers who give the Liberal Party lots of money in political donations will not have any legislated obligations to give back to the community by investing in research. A new higher education provider, under the Liberals' rules, will be able to come into my community and set up a shop front and, without research obligations, provide a degree or associate degree with 30 per cent to 40 per cent less operating overheads than the University of Tasmania. That is not a fair system.


The owners of the new higher education providers will not have the same love for Tasmania that the current owners, the people of Tasmania, have. The new higher education owners and managers that the Liberals want to set up shop in Tasmania, unlike Professor Peter Rathjen and his team at the University of Tasmania, will not love, care for and sit at the heart of the social, intellectual and cultural life in Tasmania. The new higher education owners will be ruthless business people, motivated by performance bonuses and with one focus—profit. That will not work in Tasmania. These profits will be taken from students who will, for the first time in Australia's higher education history, receive a government subsidy that will flow to private providers who will have no real connection to the community they service.


A higher education monopoly for Tasmania has been a wonderful thing. It has provided protection while the University of Tasmania has grown and gained a critical mass and produced exceptional academic results. It has produced world-acclaimed results for the people of a state which has a total population of only a little over half a million people, less than a suburb of the capital of China. As the Vice Chancellor of the University of Tasmania Professor Peter Rathjen says in the 2014 impact study:


The University of Tasmania's 10-year  strategic plan, Open to Talent, is unequivocal about the fact that we … must continue to ""sit at the heart of social, intellectual and cultural life in Tasmania"".


If these sneaky, deceitful, harmful Liberal changes to Australia's higher education system are allowed to pass through this Senate then the Liberals will take the political gun that they have shamefully and slyly held to the head of the University of Tasmania and every other Australian university during the lead-up to this bill's consideration and place it on the chest of every Tasmanian and pull the damn trigger.


I will not allow that to happen because if you hurt the University of Tasmania you hurt every Tasmanian. Firstly, the University of Tasmania's contribution to Tasmania's economy is $1.7 billion. Secondly, one in four Tasmanians have a direct connection to the University of Tasmania. Thirdly, 5,900 people are employed by our university. Fourthly, more than 30,000 students are enrolled at the University of Tasmania. We are very proud of that. Fifthly, the University of Tasmania is ranked in the top two per cent of universities worldwide according to the Academic Ranking of World Universities 2013. I can tell you that we are very bloody proud of that. Sixthly, with a budget of $96 million, the University of Tasmania is in the nation's top 10 for research income. Seventhly, as indicated in the 2014 impact statement, the University of Tasmania is a key economic driver as well as a place of knowledge and learning, with campuses and facilities in Burnie, Launceston, Bisdee Tier in the Midlands and Hobart.


The Liberals have deliberately and carefully created a sense of panic and desperation in the minds of the people who run our universities and in the minds of our community leaders. Christopher Pyne and the PM have achieved their goals by using tactics a third-world tyrant would be proud of. Firstly, the Liberals have threatened to slash university funding by 20 per cent. secondly, they have threatened the jobs of 1,700 researchers. Thirdly, in Tasmania, they have dangled the carrot, which I am absolutely disgusted by, of $400 million worth of new university buildings. They have never put pen to paper and guaranteed funds for this much-needed and essential investment in a capital upgrade yet we have $50 billion sitting in infrastructure funding. Fourthly, the Liberals, along with the previous federal Labor government, have also deliberately cut the number of associate degrees that the University of Tasmania can teach and deliver to students. So much for Joe Hockey's 'earn or learn'. I tell you, you are not looking pretty.


The fact that both sides of parliament have cut the number of associate degrees is a significant point which has not received due consideration and has caused the University of Tasmania great harm. Associate degrees, or subdegrees, of approximately two years in length are the higher education product now in great demand, especially in Tasmania. Associate degrees have been described to me as a practical learning experience where you will gain knowledge, qualifications and a job. The University of Tasmania has identified a great demand for associate degrees and is planning on providing 10,000 associate degrees in the future to students in Tasmania. I sincerely hope they do and I support them in their plans. The only thing stopping them from going ahead with their plans is this government, which has placed an artificial and arbitrary cap on the number of associate degrees granted to our universities.


It should not come as a shock for the Senate to learn that successive governments have dramatically cut back on the availability of associate degrees. The Liberals in particular, as part of Pynes's nasty political softening up process in order—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Williams
):  Senator Lambie, excuse me. Please just pause for a minute. When you refer to those in the other place, you must refer to them by their correct title. It is either Mr Pyne or Minister Pyne, not just Pyne.




Senator LAMBIE:
  The Liberals, in particular, as part of Mr Pyne's nasty political softening up process in order to blackmail the University of Tasmania into accepting the Liberal's outrageous changes have dramatically reduced the number of associate degrees.


During a recent briefing my staff undertook with Minister Pyne's senior education officials, it was admitted that this year the University of Tasmania while asking the government for 360 associate degrees was granted only 60 associate degrees. Once again, here we go, 'earn or learn.' Parliamentary Library research I subsequently commissioned shows that in 2009 the University of Tasmanian was granted 1,095 associate degrees ; in 2010, that number was reduced to 1,023 associate degrees; in 2011, that number was reduced again to 850 associate degrees; in 2012, that number was slashed to 630; and the latest figure for 2015, which has been confirmed by Mr Pyne, is that it has been ripped down to 60. Sixty! In the space of six years, an in-demand higher education course which provides a lifeline for the state of Tasmania though UTAS has been cut from 1,095 to 60 associate degrees. That is a cut of 1,800 per cent. My question to this Liberal government and to the previous Labor government is: was this a deliberate attempt to undermine our state's economy and drive a stake through the heart of the social, intellectual and cultural life of Tasmania, or was the restriction of the availability of associate degrees just sheer incompetence?


While Tasmania has been granted only 60 associate degrees for 2015, Parliamentary Library research shows that in 2013 New South Wales had 1,091 and Victoria had 1,859. I tell you what, they are not in the same economic and social situation we are in. I am calling on the federal government to come clean on the number of associate degrees they issue and explain how they decide to issue those degrees. The Liberals must explain why they refuse to support the University of Tasmania's plan to expand this worthy program. And from the Labor party I want a guarantee that in government they will reverse the cutback in investment in our universities and set up a national goal to take our investment in university funding to one per cent of GDP. I am looking for that undertaking from the Labor Party. Answer this simple question honestly and do not ignore it: if the Nordic countries can deliver the best higher education system in the world to their young people for free, why can't we? I also want a guarantee that Labor in government will invest and allow the University of Tasmania to implement its plans to expand by delivering up to 10,000 associate degrees on the Burnie and Launceston campuses while continuing their magnificent research in Hobart.


I believe that Australia has the means and resources to deliver free higher education to our young people. However, this debate has shown that we do not have the politicians with the vision and courage to deliver free higher education to our young people. So, today, I am putting out a call to those people who want to create a better, smarter Tasmania and Australia to contact my office. I will support candidates at the next election who are prepared to work for a future where Australia has the best higher education system in the world and our government will deliver our children's first degree for free. A free first university degree for all Australian children who want and earn the opportunity will only become a wild, unachievable goal if the Senate and the parliament are populated by people who think it is a wild, unachievable goal.


For Australia to prosper and thrive, we must look to the lessons of Finland and Denmark. We must not look to America, as the Liberals want us to with their legislation. The American higher education system, according to the Economist magazine, is contributing to America's new aristocracy, a hereditary meritocracy. An Economist article examining America's higher education system states:


""MY BIG fear,"" says Paul Ryan, an influential Republican congressman from Wisconsin, is that America is losing sight of the notion that ""the condition of your birth does not determine the outcome of your life.""


We do not want that future for Tasmanian or Australia. 


In closing: if Minister Pyne and Prime Minister Tony Abbott have so much faith in the higher education reforms contained in this bill, why did they not tell the people of Tasmania and of the other states about their reforms before the last election? If the Liberal's higher education policies were any good there would not be a need for a cover-up followed by a disgraceful political ambush and now these desperate threats. I oppose this legislation with every fibre of my being. I will always do so.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-03-17,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (17:59):  I compliment Senator Lambie for a very well-researched speech outlining her concerns. The reference to The Economist magazine in relation to the US system reminds me of the documentary film Ivory Tower by filmmaker Andrew Rossi. That documentary, which I think is a couple of years old, makes the point that skyrocketing tuition prices, private and public; rapidly evolving social attitudes towards the value of a college degree; and the inevitable changes wrought by technological growth and economic disaster have had a huge impact on that sector. I am referring there to a review of the film in Variety magazine. Ivory Tower relates directly to the matters raised in The Economist magazine. Republican congressman Paul Ryan also spoke about this issue. The Variety film review states: 


One of the documentary's key points is that most colleges are no longer selling an education but an experience, happily spending millions of dollars on plush housing complexes and state-of-the-art recreational facilities in a bid to entice as many applicants as possible. It's the students who pay for these campus expansions, and not just financially: Too many schools, in the film's somewhat over-generalized estimation, have allowed academic rigor to fall by the wayside, a problem that can be attributed in part to an excess of administrators and a dearth of dedicated teaching faculty. One particularly alarming statistic — that 68% of students at public universities fail to graduate in four years — is introduced by way of a visit to Arizona State U., whose party-school rep is reinforced here by footage of a massive swimming-pool bacchanal that resembles an outtake from ""Spring Breakers.""


Clearly we do not want to go down that path. 


Senator Lambie made reference to Scandinavian countries. There is a book that I am hoping to plough through soon called Northern Lights: The Positive Policy Example of Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Norway by Andrew Scott, an Australian academic. I think we need to look at it. I think the temperament of Australians is closer to that of the Scandinavians than to that of the Americans. But, even so, it seems that what the government is proposing in this deregulated model is more radical than anything that has been tried in any OECD nation, apart from New Zealand, which went down this path of total deregulation a few years ago but then had to retreat from it because it did not work. It was a public policy mess.


At the outset I believe it is incredibly important to acknowledge that the current system of funding to universities is unsustainable. Having a demand-driven, uncapped system means that something has to change. We either go down the path that Senator Lambie has indicated, where we have to find a lot more public money for our public education, or we need to take a different approach. This requires a nuanced and sophisticated approach in terms of looking at alternatives. 


I do not believe that anyone in this debate disputes the fact that our current system of funding is unsustainable. However, I do not believe that deregulation is necessarily the best option for solving this problem. The government seems to be shifting on its proposed measures. If nothing else, I think that Minister Pyne is incredibly flexible—more flexible than a yoga instructor sometimes. There has been a lack of preparation and consultation before such a quantum leap in higher education policy. The government went to the election with a promise of 'masterful inaction'. That is what the Prime Minister, as opposition leader, said two years ago in respect of higher education. This is not masterful inaction; this is the biggest, most radical shake-up this country has ever seen in higher education. The government have not gone about this in a proper way in their approach to policy formulation. I am a bit old-fashioned: I think the old days of having white papers and green papers in order to have a proper process of policy formulation has much to commend itself. That is what the Hawke-Keating government did and that is what the Howard-Costello government did, and they did it very well, by and large, in getting it right in dealing with these issues. 


What happened on the weekend is that Minister Pyne threatened to shut down NCRIS, the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy, the very backbone of research in this country involving the 1,700 scientists funded by it—some of our best and brightest minds—and providing a backbone for research infrastructure not just for universities but for businesses, for absolutely groundbreaking innovation that can make a difference, whether in the wine industry in my home state, whether in medicine, whether in a whole range of telecommunications. That is all about the clever country. What the minister said on Sunday was extraordinarily foolish on his part. I bear some responsibility. The minister was a student of mine some 27 years ago at what is now the University of South Australia, so I guess I have taught him everything that he does not know. I think the minister's interview with David Speers yesterday, if not already a cult classic, will become a cult classic. The last 24 to 48 hours have been a very unfortunate exercise. I give the minister full marks for being indefatigable in relation to this issue, but I cannot accept what the government is doing. I cannot support it.


In the budget last year—it seems so long ago, but in some respects it only seems like yesterday—the government wanted to bring about these reforms with significant savings, with cuts to the sector that would have saved billions of dollars over the forward estimates. We now have a situation where the government is looking at spending another $1 billion to $1½ billion a year. Perhaps Senator Carr can help me out on that. It seems there has been a complete reversal of fortune in terms of what the government is proposing. It is now going to cost a lot more money.


Deregulation is not something that can be easily undone. Once you have the deregulation genie out of the bottle, you cannot put it back in. We have to be very careful about this. We need to have a full understanding of the implications, particularly those in the longer term, before we make such significant changes. My argument has always been that this is not an ordinary market that we are dealing with. This is not an ordinary case of supply and demand. 


Ross Gittins, the economics editor for The Sydney Morning Herald, in his opinion piece entitled 'Why ""competition"" means university fees will rise', published on 31 May 2014, makes a very good point. Even according to one of the authors of the Kempt-Norton report, Andrew Norton, 'the initial increase will be no more than $6000 a year' in fees. But that is still an increase—a very appreciable increase. Mr Gittins makes the point that:


The simple model of how markets work taught in introductory economics courses leaves many people with excessive faith in the ability of market competition to foster increased efficiency, constrain price increases and ensure customers get high quality.


This is not an ordinary market it does not work like that. This is different by virtue of HECS: the HECS Support fee allows students get support to fund their higher education. Gittins makes the point:


There's no profit motive. And, as any academic will tell you, unis are highly inefficient, bureaucratic organisations dominated by administrators. The safest prediction is that giving unis greater revenue-raising ability will lead to them employing more administrators.


How can uni fees be regarded as a ''price'' in the textbook sense when people are lent the money to pay the price under a concessional loan they won't have to repay for years?


In effect, universities have a government-regulated monopoly over a product that gives young people access to the country's highly paid jobs. What will they do when the price jumps - abandon all ambition? Demand seems highly ''price inelastic'' - unresponsive to price changes.


The one point that Gittins makes that, I think, proves that is: back in 2004, as I understand it, the Howard government, through Brendan Nelson as education minister, allowed universities to increase their fees by a maximum of 25 per cent. Invariably, all universities increased their fees by 25 per cent, bar one. That university thought that there was a competitive advantage: 'We'll charge a little bit less and more students will come flocking to us.' Guess what? That university saw a collapse in its enrolments and had to increase its fees up by the full 25 per cent the following year. 


This is not an ordinary market; this is why deregulation needs to be treated very carefully in the context of this debate. I want to consider the issue of how to cut the Gordian knot of university funding in a way that is equitable, fair and will work in the long term so that we do not end up with a US situation, as described in the documentary, Ivory Tower. I wrote to Minister Pyne on 20 January 2015—it seems much longer ago—and I am very happy to provide my colleagues with a copy of this letter, which was sent publicly to the media, unions and university administrators, which, as a courtesy, I let the minister know that. I suggested to the minister, respectfully, that there ought to be a useful way forward to establish an independent panel to undertake a root-and-branch review of Australia's higher education sector. A review that took into account the role the sector plays in Australian society, both in economic and social terms. It should be a review that looks at where we want to go and how best to get there, both in a local and global context. I suggested it could take up to 18 months, but it could take much less than that, if it were done with some alacrity, if it were done properly and if there were a panel of experts and terms of reference with cross party support—government, opposition and crossbenchers in this place and in the other place. There needs to be consensus on the terms of reference and on the panel of experts, where there can be a robust debate and robust analysis about where sector is going. I suggested that, as an interim measure, universities should be allowed to increase their fees to a cap to allow them to recoup any government cuts. Well, those are now off the table. I understand the funding pressures of universities and there ought to be—as unpalatable as it may be for some—some modest increase in university fees, if such a funding crisis emerges in the higher education sector. That is something that would give us some breathing space, so we may try to get the policy settings right once and for all.


The findings of the panel would presumably be a template for government reforms and, hopefully, have cross party support. The government should implement any measures necessary to allow universities to increase their fees in accordance with the funding. I think the terms of reference should look at the current role of the higher education sector in Australia, the higher education experience of students studying in Australia and how Australia measures up in terms of the world's best practice. We need to avoid the pitfalls of other countries which have gone down difficult paths that have not worked in terms of student outcomes and have cost the budget's bottom line and cost students themselves. I suggested that this review could be comprehensive in much the same way as the Murray report, which in 1957 provided a detailed study of universities in post-war Australia for Prime Minister Menzies. I hasten to add that the Murray report was not written by David Murray—it has not been around that long. The 1957 review was written by another Mr Murray, but it is a very useful report and it is worth reading to see the sorts of challenges which they faced then and which are echoed in some of the problems we face now.


The minister has not taken up my suggestion, and more is the pity. Maybe he needs to look at that; maybe we need to have some bipartisan, cross party way of dealing with this very serious issues in the sector. If the government will not do that, then the government needs to look at the usual green-and-white-paper process to ensure that a proposal has been appropriately and thoroughly discussed, debated and modelled. This may seem cumbersome to the government, but so far the policy formulation in this area has not worked, despite the best endeavours of the minister's office and there are some very capable people in his office. 


We have recently seen proposals by Professor Bruce Chapman that would implement a progressive taxation on universities to reduce the Commonwealth subsidies by a certain amount if their fees rose above a certain level. There are various gradations and variations that. Unfortunately, I was not able to meet Prof Chapman today, but I hope to be able to speak to him in the next day or so. The concern is: what effect will it have for the so-called sandstone universities—the Group of Eight universities—when compared to other universities? Will we see a significant inflationary effect in respect of that? We need to have some modelling. I understand that perhaps the department has done that modelling, but that needs to be out in the open. I have not seen the modelling. We need some transparency in this process. 


An article in The Sydney Morning Herald on 17 February by the enigmatic Matthew Knott, under the headline 'Fee deregulation will drive up deficit', says that NATSEM, the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, the same people that the coalition used when in opposition for the modelling of their policy formulations—so I reject any suggestion that they are anything other than a pretty robust organisation in terms of their modelling—have suggested:


The Abbott government's plan to deregulate university fees would likely drive up inflation and drain billions of dollars from the budget over the long term rather than saving taxpayers money as originally intended …


In other words, this would be not a zero-sum game but a negative game in the sense that it would actually cost taxpayers more money because it would also have an inflationary effect.


I also think that the debate has lacked a nuanced approach in terms of some of the other issues that need to be tackled, and the best way of summarising that is in a new book that was dropped off to my office yesterday—and I should disclose I will make sure I pay for it, Mr Deputy President!—called Universities and Innovation Economies: The Creative Wasteland of Post-Industrial Society, by Professor Peter Murphy of James Cook University. I am trying to get in touch with Professor Murphy and I am looking forward to discussing this with him. But even just a summary of the book resonates with me in terms of some of the issues we face in this sector. This is what it says:


Students drop out of universities in large numbers, many graduate to jobs that do not require a degree and a large number learn little at university, whilst graduate salaries have shrunk over time and student loan debt and default have grown. University research achievements have declined while university administration has expanded massively. The contemporary university is mired in auditing, regulation, waste and aimlessness and its contribution to serious social innovation has deteriorated markedly. The miserable state of the universities reflects a larger social reality, as bureaucratic capitalism has replaced creative capitalism.


I am not necessarily endorsing what Professor Murphy is saying. What I am saying is that this debate has not looked at the issue of university dropout rates, which are very significant in terms of what they cost taxpayers but, more importantly, what they cost students in the months and sometimes years of their lives spent doing a course that they drop out of, where maybe a bit of counselling and guidance could have made a difference.


My concern is that allowing universities to set their own fees means that, in theory, they would no longer need to rely on government funding. That may be a very attractive proposition to future governments, which may start to see Commonwealth contributions as a place to make easy savings. The minister made the point to me yesterday that it would still need to get through the parliament; but who knows what may happen in years to come? There may even be bipartisan consensus on that—dare I say, not while Senator Carr is in this parliament!




Senator Kim Carr:
  Absolutely!




Senator XENOPHON:
  But who knows what might happen if you set up a framework in years to come, when Senator Carr is not here—in 2045; or maybe he will be here in 2045! It may be problematic. 


It is also important to consider the impact of HECS, which was alluded to by Ross Gittins. I do not want to criticise this scheme—far from it. It is a terrific scheme. It is an outstanding measure that sets our higher education system apart. But that has to be taken into account in the context of deregulation and issues of market failure. 


I think that what we need to do now is pause. We need to actually reflect on what needs to be done. Reform is needed in this sector. We want to have the best university and higher education sector in the world. 


We also need to acknowledge, in the brief time I have available in this debate, the issue put forward by the Council of Private Higher Education. I spoke today to Reverend Dr Don Owers AM, who runs Tabor, a college in Adelaide. I have enormous regard for him. He is concerned that these reforms proposed by the government could have been fairer if they had removed some of the equity barriers facing private higher education providers. I think that needs to be on the agenda as well. 


But what we have right now is a mess. We need to step back from this and look at some comprehensive reform to get this right, because what has happened to date is less than satisfactory. We need to get this right. We owe it to the students of Australia and we owe it to the taxpayers of Australia to get this right. I cannot support the second reading of this bill but I hazard a guess that this will not be the end of it. We still have much work to do to do the right thing by this sector.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2015-03-17,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Education and Training) (18:19):  In closing the second reading debate on the Higher Education and Research Reform Bill 2014, I thank all senators for their contributions to this debate, much as I may not agree with all that has been said. In closing this debate, I also seek to argue the case for greater autonomy and greater freedom for Australian universities to give Australian universities to lift themselves, to lift the outcomes for students and to lift the economic contribution they make to Australia to the types of heights and levels that we know they are capable of doing, have done for years and can do again in the future—if we give them the capacity and the freedom and the autonomy to do so. 


… it is … clear that government alone cannot provide all the additional funding necessary for our universities to become top notch.


…   …   …


… we propose that Australian universities be free to set student fees according to the market value of their degrees. A deregulated or market-based HECS will make the student contribution system fairer, because the fees students pay will more closely approximate the value they receive through future earnings. Market-based HECS will also help to improve our higher education system by making universities even more responsive to student needs and educational outcomes. 


They are not my words; they are the words of Andrew Leigh, the shadow Assistant Treasurer, a member of the Labor Party's shadow executive today. 


It is time to change our one-size-fits-all funding system and let diversity develop.


Again, they are not my words. They are the words of Gareth Evans, former Labor Party foreign minister of long standing.


I want Labor to be a positive player, not just a blocker.


They are not my words but the words of former federal Labor MP Maxine McKew, speaking about higher education reform. 


… the ALP ought to engage with the government to negotiate the further reform of higher education …


…   …   …


It's a great pity that Labor is sitting on its hands this time.


Again, they are not my words but the words of John Dawkins, former Labor Party Treasurer in the Keating government, education minister in the Hawke government and architect of the modern HECS. Peter Beattie commented: 


Make no mistake, without funding reform, Australia's universities will inevitably slip towards mediocrity and the quality of Australian graduates will decline in relation to our international competitors, both in business and education.


Once again, these are not my words. They are the words of Peter Beattie, a former long-serving Queensland Labor Party premier. 


Through much of the debate, we have heard from those opposite that this is some type of great partisan divide. But, with Peter Beattie, Gareth Evans, John Dawkins, Maxine McKew and Andrew Leigh all having argued the case for reform, it is crystal clear that it is not a partisan divide in terms of good, sound policy; it is simply the case that those opposite want to play politics and run a scare campaign, when what they should be doing is embracing reform that is good and worthwhile for Australia's future.


They need not, though, listen to Labor members past and present—those who have led their party through great reform. They could instead heed the advice of, and listen to, the education sector, who have equally argued passionately and strongly for the adoption—if not of this exact model that is before the chamber—at least for reform of the type and nature of reform that is before the chamber. And they have argued for that reform to be made as quickly as possible. 


Universities Australia have embraced the need for reform and called for reform, and 40 of the nation's 41 vice-chancellors have stood behind Universities Australia in their call. The Innovative Research Universities have embraced the call for action. The Regional Universities Network have done so. In their most recent statement, they say:


It is essential for regional universities and their students to retain the demand driven student system for bachelor places and to expand this to sub-bachelor degrees to provide more pathways for less well prepared students. The higher education system must be adequately funded to ensure quality and sustainability, and the deregulation of fees provides the most realistic way to do this.


…   …   …


RUN urges the Senate to end the uncertainty for students and universities and to pass the package.


The Group of Eight universities have been equally—if not even more—emphatic in their support. The Australian Council for Private Education and Training have supported the reforms. TAFE Directors Australia have supported these reforms. This reform package has brought together a level of support across Australia's education sector in ways, frankly, never seen before for a major reform package. To have all elements, essentially, of the education sector backing this reform is a demonstration that the government has listened and acted and developed a policy that should be supported by those opposite. The sector supports this, because they recognise that current funding arrangements based on the uncapped demand driven system for university places is unsustainable. They recognise that the current arrangement is hurting quality. The current arrangement reduces the incentive for innovation by Australia's universities. It reduces the incentive for excellence in Australia's universities. It reduces the incentive for specialisation among Australia's universities. 


The package that we have brought to this parliament will provide the capacity for universities to be set free to be able to choose how they will differentiate themselves from each other; how they can specialise; in what fields to develop excellence; and, yes, to differentiate that, in part, by cost. This is also a proposal that dramatically increases access for Australians. I singled out the Regional Universities Network to quote before, because, of course they are representing the universities who most frequently are providing opportunities for students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, for students who may not historically or traditionally have made it into university. The Regional Universities Network is passionately supporting the passage of this legislation, just as is the rest of the sector.


Before I get to some of the specifics in the bill, I will address some of the contributions that have been made. I listened to Senator Lamble's contribution and I acknowledge the passion in her contribution and the passionate defence that she made for the University of Tasmania. But I note that the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Tasmania is one of the 40 of the 41 vice-chancellors from Universities Australia who are supporting this reform. 


Senator Lambie made an equally passionate call for more diplomas and more associate degree places to be available in Tasmania through the University of Tasmania. That is exactly what this package, if passed, would do. It would remove the cap and enable the University of Tasmania—indeed, all of the Regional Universities Network and all of the universities of Australia—to offer Commonwealth subsidised places for diplomas and associate degrees without that cap in place. It would uncap those sub-bachelor levels and allow them to provide greater pathways to students who may not have the skills, capacity or ATAR score to get into a degree level course.


I also noted that Senator Lambie, and I think Senator Xenophon did similarly, argued the case for—and highlighted international examples of—so-called free education. Again, I will quote Andrew Leigh, the shadow Assistant Treasurer: 'If university fees were abolished, as dewy-eyed Whitlamites often demand, this would effectively redistribute scarce government funds from those who do not go to university to those who do. Given that those who attend university tend to be richer than those who do not and are likely to be richer as a result of their education, this would simply widen the already large income gap between the tertiary educated and the non-tertiary educated. Australia should be in the business of reducing not increasing inequality. For these reasons, it is appropriate for students themselves to meet some of the costs of their education.' The argument against that notion of free education is a real one because, if you say that education will be funded by all taxpayers, of course you are putting a greater and more disproportionate load on the taxpayers who never go to university. What our reforms are doing and what governments since the introduction of HECS have done is seek to create a system whereby those who benefit from the university education make a fair contribution to it.


But equally appreciate that under our model every bachelor degree course, every sub-bachelor degree course and every diploma course offered through this model would still be attracting Commonwealth subsidies. Students would not be paying the full fees. There is a Commonwealth subsidy attached, and beyond that there is, of course, the opportunity to access HECS, meaning nobody need pay a single cent up-front.


Senator Xenophon, in his contribution, spoke about consultation. Well, Senator Xenophon, there has been a world of consultation. There has, of course, been the Kemp-Norton review, which was the latest of 33 reviews into Australia's higher education system since 1950—not counting, of course, the countless Senate inquiries or parliamentary inquiries that could be added on top of that. The issue of deregulation has been discussed and looked at by many. Of course, the consultation has been such that we have built the body of support across the nation's educational institutions that I outlined before. He argued—and we have heard it from Senator Carr as well at times—that this would create a US-style system. Again I emphasise, though, that we have HECS. It means nobody need pay a single cent up-front. That is not a US-style system; it is far, far from it. He did acknowledge—and I know a number on the crossbenches have acknowledged—that there is a level of unsustainability and a pressure in the Australian university system at present that cannot be sustained. Senator Xenophon said he may be willing to support some fee increase at present—a lifting of the cap. But I equally note that he acknowledged that, when that was last done, all we saw was that everybody moved up to the new cap and that you did not effectively get any sense of competition in the sector or any sense of specialisation or innovation.


Senator Carr argues that this is a contrived funding crisis. That does not seem to be the view held by the universities, and of course we know that the reality is that the Labor Party announced cuts to higher education and research of $6.6 billion from 2011 to 2013. Every six months, in every budget and every MYEFO, there were cuts from the Labor party. He too argues that we wish to create an Americanised system. I made the point before that HECS makes this a vastly different system, and HECS remains fundamental to it, so that nobody need pay one cent up-front.


They argue that university will only be for the wealthy. All of this has been part of a terrible, vicious scare campaign to suggest somehow that people will be shut out of universities. Thankfully, the students are smarter than that. Of course, that has been the trend ever since HECS was introduced. University enrolments have continued to increase since the Hawke government introduced HECS. They went up and have gone up at every increase in fees that has occurred under HECS. The access to university has continued to grow, because students and their families see the opportunity of university education and realise the equity in the fact that nobody in Australia need pay up-front, because of HECS, but know that there is sufficient private gain and personal benefit for them to take on that student debt and that it will be worthwhile to pay it off through their career, through the generous arrangements that successive Australian governments have supported, because they will gain a higher income and greater opportunity as a result of it. This year, we have continued to see increased enrolments despite the Labor Party's fear campaign and their attempts to drive people out.


Of course, that fear campaign has not just been about arguing that there would be up-front fees somehow; it has also involved the Labor Party throwing around this notion of the $100,000 degree. I am indebted to the Group of Eight universities for highlighting that the $100,000 degree is simply impossible under the reforms being proposed, because the reforms being proposed require that fees be no higher than what is currently charged for international students, minus the level of Commonwealth subsidy being paid. In no circumstance does that get you to over $100,000. It is, as has been the case time and time again through this debate, another instance of Senator Carr, Mr Shorten and the Labor Party misleading.


This legislation creates great new opportunities—new opportunities to expand access to education for Australians, and new opportunities for Australia's universities to position themselves to excel on the world stage and deliver greater benefits to our economy into the future. It will allow our universities to specialise and provide the best possible education for their students. We are guaranteeing that domestic undergraduate fees will always be lower than international fees. It will create a major new Commonwealth scholarship program to help students with living and other expenses. It will spread opportunity for students who need pathways to qualify for university or sub-degree qualifications to prepare them for their jobs. It will create an incentive for universities to invest more in those pathway and sub-bachelor degree courses, rather than the model at present, which creates maximum incentive for universities to stuff as many bachelor degree students into the lecture room as they possibly can. It will create a fairer spread of HECS to students who choose to study with non-university higher education providers, such as private colleges or TAFEs. And it will eliminate the differential in loan fees that those students outside the university system face. It, of course, maintains the CPI as the determinant for increase in HECS over time but adds a new interest rate pause for new parents, as proposed by Senator Madigan and others on the crossbench. It is estimated to create opportunities for an extra 80,000 people to access higher education as a result of the package proposed here.


The alternative is, of course, to look at what the Labor Party is proposing, which would tear up the reforms of the Gillard government in uncapping university places and would put at risk 120,000 places at university in the future. It is a stark contrast between those opposite, who would seek to asphyxiate innovation in the university sector, and those on this side, who seek to provide a chance for universities to chart their own destiny and provide real opportunities for the future.


We have listened through this debate—through the successive debates—around higher education. When this matter was considered last year we adopted a number of amendments to the package from those on the crossbench. We have listened this time around and sought to unclutter the debate and ensure we can simply have a positive debate about the merits of providing freedom and autonomy to Australia's universities rather than regulating them ultimately to a poorer future. I urge those in the chamber—those on the crossbenches—to engage in this debate sufficiently that we can proceed beyond the second reading, to give consideration to the amendments the government has circulated in our attempt to facilitate a focused debate around the future of universities and how they fund themselves.


I particularly urge those opposite as we move beyond this debate, noting that it is likely to be unsuccessful today, to take a long, hard look at themselves and their position in relation to the history of higher education and where they stand today, because they are turning their back on their legacy of creating HECS. They are turning their back on Julia Gillard's legacy of uncapping places. We want to create that autonomy and that freedom and unshackle Australia's universities, and that is exactly what this bill does.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the bill be now read a second time.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2015-03-17,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (18:46):  I rise to speak on the three appropriation bills forming the additional estimates for 2014-15—appropriation bills Nos 3 and 4 and of course the parliamentary departments bill. In total, these bills seeks to appropriate additional funds in the order of $1.7 billion for the 2014-15 year. They reflect changes in expenditure as a result of the 2014-15 MYEFO decisions as well as as a result of the machinery of government changes that were announced as part of the ministry reshuffle prior to Christmas of last year. Some of the measures that are the subject of the appropriations in the three bills include additional funding for defence overseas operations, additional funding for a number of agencies in the Attorney-General's portfolio and the immigration portfolio, funding for DPS and the AFP, funding for the Department of Employment in relation to job seeker compliance framework measures, funding for the Department of Health in relation to various upgrades and one matter which I did note, which is funding for the Department of Finance in relation to the Kenbi land claim on the Cox Peninsula. That caught my attention as I recently visited there with Senator Nova Peris.


The appropriation bills do give me an opportunity to speak a bit about the economic circumstances the nation faces and the damage that this government is doing to Australia's economy. Since the election we have seen a government that, by its actions and its words, is continuing to risk economic growth and economic prosperity and that is continuing by its actions and its words to damage economic confidence. This government has since its election done little but talk down the Australian economy. It is as if ministers on the other side have failed to make the transition from opposition to government and recognise that what they say as ministers in government carries much more weight than the irresponsible rhetoric they engaged in in opposition. We had an example of that in the Senate chamber during a dorothy dixer in question time one day when the Leader of the Government in the Senate said that the country was bankrupt. This was completely untrue, completely false, but that is what was said by the Leader of the Government in the Senate. There are plenty of examples of this rhetoric, of the Treasurer suggesting that the country was on its knees to the bankers of the world, of Senator Joyce suggesting that we were like Greece. None of these statements were based on facts, all of them were nothing more than fearmongering, but, worse, it was completely irresponsible from ministers of the Crown. 


On top of this, what has the government done? It has brought down a budget which has slashed benefits for low- and middle-income families and slashed investment in education and health. It has slashed many of those investments which are important for the future of the nation. The reality is that these budget cuts are hurting people, they are damaging confidence and they are hurting the economy. We know that growth remains weak, and outside the resources sector the economy is contracting. According to many economists, we are officially in an income recession.


Let us look at some of the figures since the budget was handed down in May last year. Economic growth has slowed. The annual growth rate has declined from three per cent in the year to March 2014 to 2.5 per cent in the year to December 2014. GDP grew one per cent in the March quarter 2014, half a per cent in the June quarter, 0.3 per cent in the September quarter and 0.5 per cent in the December quarter. This is what has happened to economic growth under this government—economic growth has slowed. Business confidence is down. We remember the Treasurer spouting forth about how there could be a jolt in confidence, an adrenaline surge in confidence. Since he has been Treasurer, since those opposite have occupied the treasury bench, business confidence has gone down. The NAB monthly survey shows that business confidence has collapsed from positive eight points at the time of the budget to zero in February 2015—well below the long-run average for business confidence. Consumer confidence has taken a battering. Unemployment is up, from 5.7 per cent to 6.3 per cent, hovering at its highest level for more than a decade; youth unemployment has risen to just under 20 per cent—19.9 per cent—and is hovering at its highest level in 16 years. Nearly 50,000 more people are unemployed, and there are now over 750,000 people unemployed—777,000, the highest number in 16 years. Of course the Reserve Bank has had to cut interest rates to support the economy.


We hear all the rhetoric from Minister Cormann and others on the other side about what great economic managers they are, yet they are presiding over slowing growth, a decline in business confidence, consumer confidence taking a battering, an increase in unemployment, an increase in youth employment and more people in the unemployment queues. What a fantastic record to date. The reality is that Mr Hockey and Mr Abbott have mismanaged the budget and have mismanaged the economy. Slower growth means we are not creating enough new jobs to keep up with the number of people entering the labour force—hence the rise in unemployment. Let us recall that those on this side of the chamber kept the economy growing through the largest global financial crisis the world has seen since the Great Depression and that we created over 900,000 new jobs during our time in government. 


Let us turn now to the budget. A lot of chest beating goes on over the other side about how well they are managing the budget. The truth is the opposite. Not only are they presiding over higher unemployment and lower growth; they are presiding over an increase in the budget deficit and an increase in debt. The budget deficit has blown out under the Abbott government. Under them, we have seen a deterioration in the projected deficit over the four years to 2016-17—that is compared with what they inherited, as set out in Treasury's Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook, from the Labor government. In the seven months between Mr Hockey's first budget and his midyear update, the projected deficit for the four years to 2017-18 deteriorated by $44 billion—a blow-out of more than $200 million for every day between Joe Hockey's first budget and his midyear update in December 2014.


Senator Cormann, who, I am sure, will turn up at some point in this debate, often tells me what a great finance minister he is. Let us compare how things were prior to him becoming finance minister—when we were in government and I was finance minister—with how things are now. Whilst I held the portfolio, we had lower federal government spending as a share of GDP than under the Abbott government, we had lower taxes as a share of GDP than under the Abbott government, and we left Australia with one of the lowest levels of government debt of any advanced economy. Since Senator Cormann has become finance minister, he is now budgeting over the next four years to increase spending by $70 billion, increase taxes by $80 billion and increase net debt. That is quite an achievement! 


Over the four years to 2013-14, federal government spending averaged 24.75 per cent of GDP. Under the government's budget, spending will average 25.5 per cent of GDP over the four years to 2017-18. Tax receipts under the Labor government averaged 21.1 per cent of GDP over the four years to 2013-14; the Abbott government is budgeting for tax receipts averaging 22.6 per cent of GDP over the four years to 2017-18. So under this government we see higher spending as a share of GDP and higher taxes as a share of GDP—at the same time as they are presiding over lower growth and higher unemployment. Australia's net government debt stood at just under 13 per cent of GDP in 2013-14. According to the IMF Fiscal Monitor in 2014, that was the sixth lowest of the 26 advanced economies. Under the Abbott government, net debt is projected to rise by over $100 billion by 2017-18 and gross debt is also projected to increase to $484 billion by 2017-18. This is again an increase of in excess of $100 billion—some $165 billion.


So, for all the rhetoric, let us remember what this government is presiding over: higher unemployment, lower growth, lower business confidence, higher debt, higher deficits, higher spending and higher taxes. That is the record of this finance minister and this Treasurer thus far. 


I now want to make a few comments about measures which are reflected, but not necessarily given effect, in the appropriation bills. This budget has been roundly condemned by the Australian community, by this parliament and, frankly, privately—and sometimes publicly—by members of the Liberal Party and even members of their own cabinet. We have seen a budget predicated on broken promises, on a breach of faith with the Australian people, and measures which are fundamentally unfair. This government seems to think that people who oppose them do so because we somehow do not understand the issues, because we are blinkered and ideological or because we are irresponsible—or whatever other insult they can throw at people who are opposed to their propositions. The reality is: this government's budget is unfair and has been roundly condemned because it targets those who can least afford it and because it is predicated on broken promises.


The reason this government cannot gain support for so many of its key budget measures—and let us remember that a number have been passed; I will come to that shortly—either from the community or in this parliament is that they have lost the argument. They have lost the numbers because they have lost the argument. They cannot sustain an argument that says, 'We told you there would be no cuts to health and education', whilst putting forward a GP tax which is nothing less than an imposition on families and other Australians going to the doctor. They cannot sustain a proposition that supports increasing university fees and cutting Commonwealth funding per place at university by 20 per cent after going to the election promising no change to the way universities would be funded. They cannot sustain a proposition that says indexation of the pension should be changed such that the real value of the pension declines over time—condemning more Australian pensioners to poverty—after going to the election saying 'There will be no changes to the pension.' I could go on.


The proposed changes to pension indexation have been estimated by ACOSS to be an $80 per week cut to pensions—a cut that is allowed for in the budget papers. We also know that the impact over the decade will be even more significant. The budget also included cuts to various family payments—for example, the restriction of access to family tax benefit part B to families with children under six, the reduction in the supplements and the freezing of the payment rates for two years. Those changes led to NATSEM estimates that $6,000 per year was being cut from a typical Australian family's budget.


Perhaps one of the most shameful measures in the budget is the government's proposal to leave young job seekers with nothing to live on for six months—a measure we were told recently was, in fact, one of the Prime Minister's so-called captain's picks. Despite the 'no new taxes' rhetoric that taxes would always be lower under this government—another lie—we have also seen an increase in the petrol tax, which was implemented through regulation, thus getting around the parliament, despite there being legislation on the increase in the excise sitting in the Senate. We have also seen cuts to the ABC and SBS, despite the Prime Minister saying 'no cuts to the ABC or SBS'. And, despite Ms Julie Bishop opposing it, we have seen continued cuts to foreign aid—some $11.3 billion over the 2014-15 MYEFO and the 2014-15 budget.


For all of these reasons, we condemn many of the measures in the government budget. I would make the point that Labor has in fact supported a number of savings—some $20 billion worth of savings in this budget—and we have also proposed a range of alternative savings, which include ensuring multinational companies pay their fair share of tax and a reduction in the superannuation tax concessions for high-income earners. We have also proposed—and we are pleased that the Prime Minister recognised this—scrapping his paid parental leave scheme, which was costed at over $5 billion a year.


With a number of the measures I have outlined, whilst reflected in the budget figures that ground these appropriation bills, obviously Labor will continue to oppose legislation giving effect to them. However, Labor is a party of government. We have made it clear that we would not be so irresponsible as to block supply. So we intend to support the passage of the appropriation bills through the parliament.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (19:02):  I believe that all political parties seeking votes in an upper house election, like elections for the Senate at the Commonwealth level and for the legislative councils in various states, should let potential voters know of their approach to appropriations bills and the blocking of supply. Today, I rise to set out the approach of the Liberal Democrats. I also speak for the Outdoor Recreation Party—our sister party in the New South Wales election. We reserve the right to block supply. This announcement is of little consequence right now. After all, I have only one vote. But voters should know that if they want members or senators who will always wave through government spending, regardless of its size or composition, they should not vote for us.


Appropriation bills come in various forms. The central appropriation bills are those that appropriate money for the ordinary annual services of the government. These bills effectively authorise spending on the continuing and settled operations of government. While the Liberal Democrats and the Outdoor Recreation Party oppose many of the continuing and settled operations of governments, it would be rare for us to attempt to block such bills. Even if we had the numbers in the upper house, we accept that government is formed in the lower house. We would seek to block these central appropriation bills only if they were used to significantly increase the size of government, contrary to any mandate or if a government was so dangerously bad that forcing an early election was the responsible thing to do. Accordingly, I will support the central appropriation bill before us today—the No. 3 bill.


However, our approach is different for other, more peripheral, appropriation bills. The Liberal Democrats and, obviously, the Outdoor Recreation Party will freely oppose or amend these peripheral appropriation bills. These are bills that usher in new policies that are not already authorised by special legislation.These are bills that authorise capital spending.And these are bills that authorise grants to the states.



The Liberal Democrats and the Out
door Recreation Party are small-
government parties.
 We
 want the government out of your hair
, off your back
 and out of your pocket. As such, we will represent our constituents by opposing the incessan
t proliferation of new policies


that 
seem to meddle 
in 
every imaginable aspect of our lives.


The Liberal Democrats and the Outdoor Recreation Party believe that government is
 not good at running businesses
 and that a lot of infrastructure can be built and maintained by the private sector. For instance, the Outdoor Recreation Party provides a unique option for voters in the N
ew 
S
outh 
W
ales
 election because
, while we 
support the rights of shooters and fishers, 
w
e also think it is eminently sensible to privatise
 government-owned electricity assets. Given this support for the role of the 
private sector, we reserve the right to oppose appropriations for capital spending by government.





The Liberal Democrats and the Outdoor Recreation Party also think that centralising power
 in Canberra is a terrible idea
 and that governments that spend money should raise the required taxes themselves. As such, I will represent my constit
uents by opposing Commonwealth government transfers to s
tate and local governments, particularly those grants that come with strings attached.


Given this, I will be moving an amendment to App
ropriation Bill (No. 4) 2014-2015


before us today, and
 I will seek to remove the authorisation for 
$
250,000 
of tied grants to state, t
erritory and local governments
 in that bill
. The state
d purpose of these grants is to strengthen:




… the sustainability, capacity and diversity of regional economies including through facilitating local partnerships between all levels of government and local communities.



This is otherwise known as pork-barrelling.

Blocking $250,000-worth of grants will not balance the budget, but it is better than nothing. It should be supported and there should be more like it.

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Health) (19:07):  Firstly, I would like to thank those senators who have contributed to this debate. These additional estimates appropriation bills seek authority from the parliament for the additional expenditure of money from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. 


I would like to highlight five areas relating to the delivery of the government's commitments that are supported by these bills. First, these bills would provide the Department of Defence with just under $558 million reflecting, in the main, additional funding for Defence's overseas operations, the reappropriation of amounts between appropriation acts to better align funding with Defence's work programs, and supplementation for foreign exchange movements.


Second, the Department of Employment would receive just over $115 million, primarily for increased payments to providers following an increase in the number of successful job placements and to implement the new employment services 2015 contracts. Third, the Department of Agriculture would receive $90 million for concessional loans under the Drought Recovery Concessional Loans Scheme. These funds will be used to provide support to eligible primary production businesses in Queensland and New South Wales who are experiencing financial difficulties resulting from the impacts of severe and prolonged drought conditions, or as a result of the combined effects of drought and the mid-2011 disruption to live cattle exports to Indonesia.


Fourth, the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service would be provided with just under $35 million for additional counterterrorism activities and to repurpose the Australian Defence Vessel Ocean Shield, for transition of its ownership from the Department of Defence to the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. Finally, the Department of Parliamentary Services would receive additional appropriations to enable it to enhance the security of the Australian Parliament House, including the enhancement and upgrade of closed-circuit television equipment and access systems. It will also cover additional parliamentary protective service staff.


In responding to the amendment to be put by Senator Leyonhjelm, the government is not in the practice of accepting amendments to appropriation bills, known as supply bills. Entertaining such amendments will put us in the terrain where supply could be put at risk. We will not entertain line item amendments. The total of the appropriations being sought through these three appropriation bills is just over $1.7 billion, and I commend this bill to the Senate.


Question agreed to.

I oppose clause 14 and schedule 1 in the following terms:


(1) Clause 14, page 8 (line 8) to page 9 (line 7), to be opposed.


(2) Schedule 1, page 10, to be opposed.


The purpose of these amendments is to implement what I talked about before—the tied grants. I am philosophically opposed to tied grants. They are bad practice. They amount to pork-barrelling. These amendments are the removal of those costs. It is $250,000. It is a symbolic amount, as I said, but the principle on which it is based is wrong. I commend the amendments.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (18:46):  I rise to speak on the three appropriation bills forming the additional estimates for 2014-15—appropriation bills Nos 3 and 4 and of course the parliamentary departments bill. In total, these bills seeks to appropriate additional funds in the order of $1.7 billion for the 2014-15 year. They reflect changes in expenditure as a result of the 2014-15 MYEFO decisions as well as as a result of the machinery of government changes that were announced as part of the ministry reshuffle prior to Christmas of last year. Some of the measures that are the subject of the appropriations in the three bills include additional funding for defence overseas operations, additional funding for a number of agencies in the Attorney-General's portfolio and the immigration portfolio, funding for DPS and the AFP, funding for the Department of Employment in relation to job seeker compliance framework measures, funding for the Department of Health in relation to various upgrades and one matter which I did note, which is funding for the Department of Finance in relation to the Kenbi land claim on the Cox Peninsula. That caught my attention as I recently visited there with Senator Nova Peris.


The appropriation bills do give me an opportunity to speak a bit about the economic circumstances the nation faces and the damage that this government is doing to Australia's economy. Since the election we have seen a government that, by its actions and its words, is continuing to risk economic growth and economic prosperity and that is continuing by its actions and its words to damage economic confidence. This government has since its election done little but talk down the Australian economy. It is as if ministers on the other side have failed to make the transition from opposition to government and recognise that what they say as ministers in government carries much more weight than the irresponsible rhetoric they engaged in in opposition. We had an example of that in the Senate chamber during a dorothy dixer in question time one day when the Leader of the Government in the Senate said that the country was bankrupt. This was completely untrue, completely false, but that is what was said by the Leader of the Government in the Senate. There are plenty of examples of this rhetoric, of the Treasurer suggesting that the country was on its knees to the bankers of the world, of Senator Joyce suggesting that we were like Greece. None of these statements were based on facts, all of them were nothing more than fearmongering, but, worse, it was completely irresponsible from ministers of the Crown. 


On top of this, what has the government done? It has brought down a budget which has slashed benefits for low- and middle-income families and slashed investment in education and health. It has slashed many of those investments which are important for the future of the nation. The reality is that these budget cuts are hurting people, they are damaging confidence and they are hurting the economy. We know that growth remains weak, and outside the resources sector the economy is contracting. According to many economists, we are officially in an income recession.


Let us look at some of the figures since the budget was handed down in May last year. Economic growth has slowed. The annual growth rate has declined from three per cent in the year to March 2014 to 2.5 per cent in the year to December 2014. GDP grew one per cent in the March quarter 2014, half a per cent in the June quarter, 0.3 per cent in the September quarter and 0.5 per cent in the December quarter. This is what has happened to economic growth under this government—economic growth has slowed. Business confidence is down. We remember the Treasurer spouting forth about how there could be a jolt in confidence, an adrenaline surge in confidence. Since he has been Treasurer, since those opposite have occupied the treasury bench, business confidence has gone down. The NAB monthly survey shows that business confidence has collapsed from positive eight points at the time of the budget to zero in February 2015—well below the long-run average for business confidence. Consumer confidence has taken a battering. Unemployment is up, from 5.7 per cent to 6.3 per cent, hovering at its highest level for more than a decade; youth unemployment has risen to just under 20 per cent—19.9 per cent—and is hovering at its highest level in 16 years. Nearly 50,000 more people are unemployed, and there are now over 750,000 people unemployed—777,000, the highest number in 16 years. Of course the Reserve Bank has had to cut interest rates to support the economy.


We hear all the rhetoric from Minister Cormann and others on the other side about what great economic managers they are, yet they are presiding over slowing growth, a decline in business confidence, consumer confidence taking a battering, an increase in unemployment, an increase in youth employment and more people in the unemployment queues. What a fantastic record to date. The reality is that Mr Hockey and Mr Abbott have mismanaged the budget and have mismanaged the economy. Slower growth means we are not creating enough new jobs to keep up with the number of people entering the labour force—hence the rise in unemployment. Let us recall that those on this side of the chamber kept the economy growing through the largest global financial crisis the world has seen since the Great Depression and that we created over 900,000 new jobs during our time in government. 


Let us turn now to the budget. A lot of chest beating goes on over the other side about how well they are managing the budget. The truth is the opposite. Not only are they presiding over higher unemployment and lower growth; they are presiding over an increase in the budget deficit and an increase in debt. The budget deficit has blown out under the Abbott government. Under them, we have seen a deterioration in the projected deficit over the four years to 2016-17—that is compared with what they inherited, as set out in Treasury's Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook, from the Labor government. In the seven months between Mr Hockey's first budget and his midyear update, the projected deficit for the four years to 2017-18 deteriorated by $44 billion—a blow-out of more than $200 million for every day between Joe Hockey's first budget and his midyear update in December 2014.


Senator Cormann, who, I am sure, will turn up at some point in this debate, often tells me what a great finance minister he is. Let us compare how things were prior to him becoming finance minister—when we were in government and I was finance minister—with how things are now. Whilst I held the portfolio, we had lower federal government spending as a share of GDP than under the Abbott government, we had lower taxes as a share of GDP than under the Abbott government, and we left Australia with one of the lowest levels of government debt of any advanced economy. Since Senator Cormann has become finance minister, he is now budgeting over the next four years to increase spending by $70 billion, increase taxes by $80 billion and increase net debt. That is quite an achievement! 


Over the four years to 2013-14, federal government spending averaged 24.75 per cent of GDP. Under the government's budget, spending will average 25.5 per cent of GDP over the four years to 2017-18. Tax receipts under the Labor government averaged 21.1 per cent of GDP over the four years to 2013-14; the Abbott government is budgeting for tax receipts averaging 22.6 per cent of GDP over the four years to 2017-18. So under this government we see higher spending as a share of GDP and higher taxes as a share of GDP—at the same time as they are presiding over lower growth and higher unemployment. Australia's net government debt stood at just under 13 per cent of GDP in 2013-14. According to the IMF Fiscal Monitor in 2014, that was the sixth lowest of the 26 advanced economies. Under the Abbott government, net debt is projected to rise by over $100 billion by 2017-18 and gross debt is also projected to increase to $484 billion by 2017-18. This is again an increase of in excess of $100 billion—some $165 billion.


So, for all the rhetoric, let us remember what this government is presiding over: higher unemployment, lower growth, lower business confidence, higher debt, higher deficits, higher spending and higher taxes. That is the record of this finance minister and this Treasurer thus far. 


I now want to make a few comments about measures which are reflected, but not necessarily given effect, in the appropriation bills. This budget has been roundly condemned by the Australian community, by this parliament and, frankly, privately—and sometimes publicly—by members of the Liberal Party and even members of their own cabinet. We have seen a budget predicated on broken promises, on a breach of faith with the Australian people, and measures which are fundamentally unfair. This government seems to think that people who oppose them do so because we somehow do not understand the issues, because we are blinkered and ideological or because we are irresponsible—or whatever other insult they can throw at people who are opposed to their propositions. The reality is: this government's budget is unfair and has been roundly condemned because it targets those who can least afford it and because it is predicated on broken promises.


The reason this government cannot gain support for so many of its key budget measures—and let us remember that a number have been passed; I will come to that shortly—either from the community or in this parliament is that they have lost the argument. They have lost the numbers because they have lost the argument. They cannot sustain an argument that says, 'We told you there would be no cuts to health and education', whilst putting forward a GP tax which is nothing less than an imposition on families and other Australians going to the doctor. They cannot sustain a proposition that supports increasing university fees and cutting Commonwealth funding per place at university by 20 per cent after going to the election promising no change to the way universities would be funded. They cannot sustain a proposition that says indexation of the pension should be changed such that the real value of the pension declines over time—condemning more Australian pensioners to poverty—after going to the election saying 'There will be no changes to the pension.' I could go on.


The proposed changes to pension indexation have been estimated by ACOSS to be an $80 per week cut to pensions—a cut that is allowed for in the budget papers. We also know that the impact over the decade will be even more significant. The budget also included cuts to various family payments—for example, the restriction of access to family tax benefit part B to families with children under six, the reduction in the supplements and the freezing of the payment rates for two years. Those changes led to NATSEM estimates that $6,000 per year was being cut from a typical Australian family's budget.


Perhaps one of the most shameful measures in the budget is the government's proposal to leave young job seekers with nothing to live on for six months—a measure we were told recently was, in fact, one of the Prime Minister's so-called captain's picks. Despite the 'no new taxes' rhetoric that taxes would always be lower under this government—another lie—we have also seen an increase in the petrol tax, which was implemented through regulation, thus getting around the parliament, despite there being legislation on the increase in the excise sitting in the Senate. We have also seen cuts to the ABC and SBS, despite the Prime Minister saying 'no cuts to the ABC or SBS'. And, despite Ms Julie Bishop opposing it, we have seen continued cuts to foreign aid—some $11.3 billion over the 2014-15 MYEFO and the 2014-15 budget.


For all of these reasons, we condemn many of the measures in the government budget. I would make the point that Labor has in fact supported a number of savings—some $20 billion worth of savings in this budget—and we have also proposed a range of alternative savings, which include ensuring multinational companies pay their fair share of tax and a reduction in the superannuation tax concessions for high-income earners. We have also proposed—and we are pleased that the Prime Minister recognised this—scrapping his paid parental leave scheme, which was costed at over $5 billion a year.


With a number of the measures I have outlined, whilst reflected in the budget figures that ground these appropriation bills, obviously Labor will continue to oppose legislation giving effect to them. However, Labor is a party of government. We have made it clear that we would not be so irresponsible as to block supply. So we intend to support the passage of the appropriation bills through the parliament.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2015-03-17,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (19:02):  I believe that all political parties seeking votes in an upper house election, like elections for the Senate at the Commonwealth level and for the legislative councils in various states, should let potential voters know of their approach to appropriations bills and the blocking of supply. Today, I rise to set out the approach of the Liberal Democrats. I also speak for the Outdoor Recreation Party—our sister party in the New South Wales election. We reserve the right to block supply. This announcement is of little consequence right now. After all, I have only one vote. But voters should know that if they want members or senators who will always wave through government spending, regardless of its size or composition, they should not vote for us.


Appropriation bills come in various forms. The central appropriation bills are those that appropriate money for the ordinary annual services of the government. These bills effectively authorise spending on the continuing and settled operations of government. While the Liberal Democrats and the Outdoor Recreation Party oppose many of the continuing and settled operations of governments, it would be rare for us to attempt to block such bills. Even if we had the numbers in the upper house, we accept that government is formed in the lower house. We would seek to block these central appropriation bills only if they were used to significantly increase the size of government, contrary to any mandate or if a government was so dangerously bad that forcing an early election was the responsible thing to do. Accordingly, I will support the central appropriation bill before us today—the No. 3 bill.


However, our approach is different for other, more peripheral, appropriation bills. The Liberal Democrats and, obviously, the Outdoor Recreation Party will freely oppose or amend these peripheral appropriation bills. These are bills that usher in new policies that are not already authorised by special legislation.These are bills that authorise capital spending.And these are bills that authorise grants to the states.



The Liberal Democrats and the Out
door Recreation Party are small-
government parties.
 We
 want the government out of your hair
, off your back
 and out of your pocket. As such, we will represent our constituents by opposing the incessan
t proliferation of new policies


that 
seem to meddle

The Liberal Democrats and the Outdoor Recreation Party believe that government is
 not good at running businesses
 and that a lot of infrastructure can be built and maintained by the private sector. For instance, the Outdoor Recreation Party provides a unique option for voters in the N

, while we 
support the rights of shooters and fishers, 
w
e also think it is eminently sensible to privatise
 government-owned electricity assets. Given this support for the role of the 
private sector, we reserve the right to oppose appropriations for capital spending by government.





The Liberal Democrats and the Outdoor Recreation Party also think that centralising power
 in Canberra is a terrible idea
 and that governments that spend money should raise the required taxes themselves. As such, I will represent my constit
uents by opposing Commonwealth government transfers to s
tate and local governments, particularly those grants that come with strings attached.


Given this, I will be moving an amendment to App
ropriation Bill (No. 4) 2014-2015


before us today, and
 I will seek to remove the authorisation for 
$
250,000 
of tied grants to state, t
erritory and local governments
 in that bill
. The state
d purpose of these grants is to strengthen:




… the sustainability, capacity and diversity of regional economies including through facilitating local partnerships between all levels of government and local communities.



This is otherwise known as pork-barrelling.

Blocking $250,000-worth of grants will not balance the budget, but it is better than nothing. It should be supported and there should be more like it.

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Health) (19:07):  Firstly, I would like to thank those senators who have contributed to this debate. These additional estimates appropriation bills seek authority from the parliament for the additional expenditure of money from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. 


I would like to highlight five areas relating to the delivery of the government's commitments that are supported by these bills. First, these bills would provide the Department of Defence with just under $558 million reflecting, in the main, additional funding for Defence's overseas operations, the reappropriation of amounts between appropriation acts to better align funding with Defence's work programs, and supplementation for foreign exchange movements.


Second, the Department of Employment would receive just over $115 million, primarily for increased payments to providers following an increase in the number of successful job placements and to implement the new employment services 2015 contracts. Third, the Department of Agriculture would receive $90 million for concessional loans under the Drought Recovery Concessional Loans Scheme. These funds will be used to provide support to eligible primary production businesses in Queensland and New South Wales who are experiencing financial difficulties resulting from the impacts of severe and prolonged drought conditions, or as a result of the combined effects of drought and the mid-2011 disruption to live cattle exports to Indonesia.


Fourth, the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service would be provided with just under $35 million for additional counterterrorism activities and to repurpose the Australian Defence Vessel Ocean Shield, for transition of its ownership from the Department of Defence to the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. Finally, the Department of Parliamentary Services would receive additional appropriations to enable it to enhance the security of the Australian Parliament House, including the enhancement and upgrade of closed-circuit television equipment and access systems. It will also cover additional parliamentary protective service staff.


In responding to the amendment to be put by Senator Leyonhjelm, the government is not in the practice of accepting amendments to appropriation bills, known as supply bills. Entertaining such amendments will put us in the terrain where supply could be put at risk. We will not entertain line item amendments. The total of the appropriations being sought through these three appropriation bills is just over $1.7 billion, and I commend this bill to the Senate.


Question agreed to.

Senator PERIS
 (Northern Territory) (19:14):  It is with great sadness that I acknowledge the passing of Mr John Baylis, who passed away on 5 March in Darwin after a long battle with motor neurone disease. He was 83 years old.


John Baylis loved his life. He had 10 kids from two marriages. Originally from Manchester in the United Kingdom, he became a merchant seaman while in a boys' home and, when he qualified, he got on a boat and sailed the seas—eventually landing in Sydney when he was about 20 years old. He jumped ship and effectively became an illegal alien or noncitizen.


He took a job with Qantas which eventually landed him in Darwin and he fell in love with the Top End lifestyle. In Darwin, he had many jobs before he finally settled in as a tug master for 30 years before he succumbed to motor neurone disease, commonly known as MND, which pushed him into retirement. Mr Baylis's job included being a union delegate for the Northern Territory Maritime Union, which became affiliated with the Queensland federation under his watch. He was a salvage diver after World War II, recovering ships from the bottom of Darwin Harbour and sending them back to Japan. He loved cleaning Darwin Harbour; he loved walking on the ocean bottom in the old-fashioned, hard-helmet pearl diver's suit. He was also a land surveyor for the Department of Works. He played footy for the local Darwin Buffaloes team and he helped resurrect the Roma soccer club. Mr Baylis was a well-known and very well-respected Territorian. As a young girl growing up in Darwin, I knew him as Uncle John.


Motor neurone disease attacks the central nervous system slowly. It takes away your ability to talk, walk, swallow and breathe while leaving your mind intact. Uncle John referred to his MND as 'the monster inside' and for 15 years it progressively robbed him of his life. Sadly, there is no cure for MND. As the years went by, his disease took hold; he fought it as long as he could, until he could fight no more. Mr Baylis had a healthy and very clear mind, full of fond memories, but he used to say it was like being trapped in a useless body. He said it was like being buried alive in palliative care, and that it was barbaric torture. Eventually, he could not talk; he could not swallow, which made fluid intake difficult. MND slowly starved him. For about three months, he pointed to an alphabet chart to communicate, until he could no longer lift his arms or move his fingers.


Mr Baylis became an avid supporter of the dying with dignity legislation, and he became known as a 'euthanasia warrior' after initially being opposed to it, early in his life; he did not know that one day he would be looking for it. Uncle John was hopeful that it would again become law in the Northern Territory and across the nation so that he and others suffering could die with dignity but, sadly, this was not to be.


He supported the former Northern Territory Chief Minister Marshall Perron's euthanasia law, which passed the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly in 1995 before it was overturned by the Australian parliament, led by Mr Kevin Andrews. I know Uncle John would give his wholehearted consent for me to say how much he cursed Mr Kevin Andrews for overturning the Northern Territory's law. He once said, 'I would like to thank all of the hundreds of supporters that have lightened my load. I am past hating Kevin Andrews, but I would like him to spend time in my shoes.' His greatest pain was losing his dignity while losing his quality of life too.


Uncle John should have had the right to choose a peaceful and pain-free death. It was his wish. In our catch-ups, he urged me to continue to push for the right to die with dignity. I gave him that undertaking. He said to me, 'Just carry on fighting for the 'peaceful pill', Nova, for those that don't know they will need it later in life.'


I send my love and condolences to his family and to his wife Jan, who cared for and loved him throughout his illness. Vale, John Baylis. May you now rest in peace.
