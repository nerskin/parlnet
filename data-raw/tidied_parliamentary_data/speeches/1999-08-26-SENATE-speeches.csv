—I seek leave to make a short statement.
Leave granted.
—The Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances was reconstituted in August following the formation of the new Senate in July. The committee took the earliest opportunity to raise concerns with ministers on specific instruments and understands that replies on these concerns might be imminent. However, the period in which a motion of disallowance may be given on these instruments will lapse today, and the committee is of the view that it should protect its options in relation to its concerns with these instruments. The committee anticipates that replies to its concerns will be received shortly and, if satisfactory, the relevant notice of motion to disallow will be withdrawn. As usual, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard  a short summary of the matters raised by the committee.
Leave granted.
The summary read as follows—
Airports (Protection of Airspace) Amendment Regulations 1999 (No. 1) Statutory Rules 1999 No. 113
Item 5 of the Schedule to these Regulations substitutes a new paragraph 7(2)(c) in the Principal 
 Regulations. The former paragraph included reference to the height `above ground' of a proposed building, but the substituted paragraph refers to the height of a proposed building `above the Australian Height Datum'. There appears to be no indication, either in the Regulations or the enabling Act, of the meaning of this term, or where its meaning could be ascertained.
New subregulation 15A(3) of the Principal Regulations, to be inserted by item 11 of the Schedule, provides that if a delegate of the Secretary does not, within 21 days, give a decision on a proposal to undertake a controlled activity, the proposal shall be taken to be refused. This provision may be unfair on the proponents of such activities.
The Explanatory Statement provides only a general description of the effect of these Statutory Rules, and does not provide a detailed commentary, item by item in the Schedule, of their meaning and effect.
Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Amendment Regulations 1999 (No. 1)
Statutory Rules 1999 No. 97
The Regulations prescribe fees for an application for a source or facility licence. Neither the Statutory Rules, nor the Explanatory Statement, indicate the basis on which the fees have been set.
Financial Management and Accountability Amendment Regulations 1999 (No. 3)
Statutory Rules 1999 No. 107
Items 5, 7 and 9 of the Schedule to these Regulations substitute new subregulations 24(1), 25(1) and 26(1) in the Principal Regulations. The Explanatory Statement, however, makes no reference to these changes. Reference to the form, which these subregulations took previously, reveals that the effect of the amendments is to remove a prohibition on sub-delegation by the Finance Minister, the Finance Chief Executive and the Chief Executive of an Agency, respectively. Furthermore, items 6 and 8 of the Schedule insert new regulations 24A and 25A, which permit the Treasurer and the Treasury Chief Executive to delegate any of their powers and functions, with no prohibition on sub-delegation.
Fisheries Management Amendment Regulations 1999 (No. 2)
Statutory Rules 1999 No. 98
These Statutory Rules amend the Principal Regulations in relation to returns made by the holders of fisher receiver permits. One of these changes inserts a new paragraph 10B(3)(d) which requires returns to be received by AFMA within 10 days after the day when the fish are received by the permit holder. The Explanatory Statement advises that previously the return referred to in that paragraph had to be posted to AFMA but that the 
 requirement to post created evidential problems. The Statement does not, however, provide information on what these problems were.
The new paragraph merely requires the return to be received by the Authority. Thus it would appear that persons required to send the relevant return may not know for some time whether they have complied with the provision.
Hazardous Waste (Regulation and Exports and Imports)(Decision IV/9) Regulations 1999
Statutory Rules 1999 No. 102
The effect of these Statutory Rules is to amend the Schedule to the enabling Act. While this is permitted by subsection 62(2) of that Act, the Regulation Impact Statement notes, in paragraph 7, that it would be desirable to incorporate these changes by amendment of the Act itself `at a subsequent date'.
Migration Amendment Regulations 1999 (No. 6)
Statutory Rules 1999 No. 81
Paragraph 6(3)(a) provides that the amendments made by items [4401] to [4403] in the Schedule shall apply to applications for review by the Migration Review Tribunal, if those applications were made, but not finally determined, before 1 July 1999. Those amendments redraft parts of regulations 4005, 4006A and 4007 in the light of the decision of the Federal Court in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Seligman , which had held that another regulation, r.2.25B, was invalid. The Explanatory Statement advises that the purpose of the amendments is to maintain the intended effect of the Regulations read as a whole. Nevertheless it may be argued that by having the charges apply even to applications which had been filed and commenced some time before these Statutory Rules were made, the effect of paragraph 6(3)(a) gives retrospective operation to the amendments made by items [4401] to [4403].
The Explanatory Statement also advises that the amendment made by item [101] in Schedule 1 is to substitute a new subregulation 4.13(1) in the Principal Regulations thereby increasing the prescribed fee for an application for review by the Migration Review Tribunal from $850 to $1400. However, the Statement does not advise that the fee of $850, set by Migration Amendment Regulations 1999 (No. 4), was to take effect from 1 June 1999, and the current increase to $1400 takes effect from 31 May 1999.
Military Superannuation and Benefits Amendment Trust Deed 1999 (No. 1) made under subregulation 5(1) of the  Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991
By virtue of item 20 of the Schedule to this instrument, the Military Superannuation and Benefits Board is given a discretion in determining whether to reduce part of the benefit payable to a 
 member, and, if a reduction is to be made, the amount thereof. However, from the explanation given in the Explanatory Statement, it appears that the reduction should be made in any case, in order to ensure the payment of the surcharge deduction amount.
National Measurement Regulations 1999
Statutory Rules 1999 No. 110
Regulation 85 lists those decisions made under these Statutory Rules which may be subject to reconsideration and, if necessary, external merits review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. However, determinations made under r.52 are not included.
Although these Regulations are substantial, covering 114 pages, the Explanatory Statement is two pages long and provides nothing more than a general overview of the Regulations.
Occupational Health and Safety (Maritime Industry) Amendment Regulations 1999 (No. 1)
Statutory Rules 1999 No. 101
New subregulation 12(2) and 13(2) of the Principal Regulations impose an apparently strict obligation on an operator to give notice of, and to report, an incident, and then, in subregulation 12(3) and 13(3), grant to the operator grounds of exculpation from that strict liability. However, the Explanatory Statement gives no reason for this imposition of strict liability, nor for what is, in effect, a reversal of the onus of proof, in that it is for the operator to establish the grounds of exculpation.
New subregulation 12(2) and 13(2) also reduce the time within which the operator must give notice of, and report, a non-fatal incident from 24 hours to four hours and from 28 days to 72 hours, respectively. The only reason given by the Explanatory Statement is that the new time limits `provide some consistency' with those limits imposed under unspecified Marine Orders. In this instance, however, consistency might have been attained by an amendment to the Marine Orders themselves rather than to these Regulations.
Public Service (Parliamentary Officers) Amendment Regulations 1999 (No. 1)
Statutory Rules 1999 No. 112
The Explanatory Statement notes that subsection 9(6) of the Public Service Act 1922  provides that the Governor-General may make regulations in relation to officers and employees of the Parliament on the recommendation of the President and/or the Speaker. However, neither the Explanatory Statement, nor the Act itself, indicates whether the recommendation of the President or the Speaker is mandatory or directory. These Statutory Rules do not appear to indicate on their face that they have been made on the recommendation of either or both of the President or the Speaker. 

Telecommunications (Charges) Determination No. 1 of 1999, Amendment Determination No. 1 of 1999 made under section 53 of the Australian Communications Authority Act 1997
Although the Explanatory Statement advises that the purpose of this Determination is to delay the commencement of the Telecommunications (Charges) Determination No. 1 of 1999 from 5 May 1999 to 1 July 1999, that Determination, despite being gazetted on 5 May 1999, was expressed to commence on 10 May 1999. Indeed, 5 May 1999 was prior not only to the date of commencement of the earlier Determination, but also to the date of making of the current Determination.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Presentation</title>,Notices,0,1,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-08-26,"—There are two matters that I want to raise in relation to this motion. The first is that we would oppose No. 10 being on the list for today. That was something that was unclear from the whips meeting last night. I apologise, as I did not have the opportunity to talk to you this morning. I am not able to say that we could treat that item of legislation as non-controversial. Secondly, I do not have item No. 13 in front of me, and I would seek some assistance as to what it is.
—I am advised that No. 13 is the Social Security (Family Allowance and Related Matters) Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 . I have been advised that the minister and the opposition spokesperson have indicated that that is okay. I will actually be taking those bills through. When we come to lunchtime, we will not bring those bills on if there is a concern with respect to government business order of the day No. 10 expressed by the appropriate person on the opposition side.
—I am happy for the matter to proceed on that basis; that is, that if the opposition has a concern about either or both of those pieces of legislation, they will not be dealt with. I also understand that there is a possibility that the government might seek to introduce another piece of legislation which is urgent, as I understand it. That may or may not be the case. I can indicate that the opposition would consider that matter positively. I think the government knows which piece of legislation we are talking about.
—Noting the undertakings given by the government with respect to items Nos 10 and 13, the question is that the motion moved by Senator Patterson be agreed to.
Question resolved in the affirmative.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Government Business</title>,Business,1,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,1999-08-26,"—I indicate to the Senate that those bills which have just been announced by the President are being introduced together. After debate on the motion for the second reading has been adjourned, I will be moving a motion to have the bills listed separately on the Notice Paper . I move:
That these bills may proceed without formalities, may be taken together and be now read a first time.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-08-26,"—Madam President, I seek leave to give a notice of motion that I failed to give this morning at the appropriate time.
—Leave is granted.
—I give notice that, 10 sitting days after today, I shall move:
That item 101 to schedule 1 of the Migration Amendment Regulations 1999 (No. 6), as contained in Statutory Rules 1999 No. 81 and made under the Migration Act 1958 , be disallowed.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-26,"—Thank you, Madam Chair. You will remember that at the end of yesterday's proceedings I drew to the parliamentary secretary's attention the important matter of imminent logging on Quamby Bluff in north-central Tasmania and the request that I had from the Deloraine Aboriginal community to state, first of all, their alarm that they had not been notified about this and, secondly, to see what I could do to find out about it. With the parliamentary secretary having the benefit of overnight consultation, I wonder if I could have the parliamentary secretary tell the committee what in fact she has been able to ascertain about the logging that is about to occur on Quamby Bluff without consultation with the indigenous people.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Quirke, Sen John",ALP,1999-08-26,"—Was the parliamentary secretary about to answer that? No? Rather than call a quorum and disturb every office in the building, I think it is appropriate that I should make a few remarks  which will last for about a minute or so about the particular measure that is before the chamber.
Indeed, as I understand it, Senator Forshaw will have a lot more to say in a few moments when he returns here. He is much more up to date with the particular measure before the chamber than, indeed, I am but I just thought I would make a couple of remarks on this. I would like the parliamentary secretary to tell us, if she could, in a few words—this will probably, I trust and am told, only require about another minute of explanation—whether or not the particular proposal that has been put up is competent or not.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-26,"—Mr Temporary Chairman, I wonder if you would investigate whether there was glue left on the parliamentary secretary's seat 
 overnight. She seems to be unable to get up to answer this question. She has certainly had all night to investigate the matter I have put before her, which I assure her is important for regional communities, the very people she says that she has consulted on the matter.
I think it is very important that we get an answer to that if we are going to proceed in an informed way in this session. There were pretty strong words yesterday about the secretary not being informed and about her withholding information. I am dealing here with a specific community on a specific issue that she was specifically asked about yesterday. I wonder, Mr Temporary Chairman, if you could facilitate the parliamentary secretary responding to that question.
—Senator Brown, you have requested something of me that I cannot do. I cannot force the parliamentary secretary to do anything. The question is that amendment No. 1 moved by Senator Brown be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-26,"—Could the parliamentary secretary tell the committee if, under the CAR reserve system, there have been new reserves created in the most recent Victorian regional forest agreement area. If so, could she tell us what the extent of those reserves are and whether, for example, at least 90 per cent of wilderness forest would be protected under the provisions of this regional forest agreement idea.
—The question is that amendment No. 1 on sheet 1265 moved by Senator Brown be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-26,"—Mr Temporary Chairman, through you I ask the parliamentary secretary to tell the committee whether she or her advisers did make any effort overnight to contact their departments or their opposite numbers in Tasmania to find out what was happening at Quamby Bluff.
—The question is that amendment No. 1 on sheet 1265 moved by Senator Brown be agreed to. Senator Brown, are you seeking the call again?
—I am.
—Under standing order 189(3), as you have spoken twice in a row in this debate, you are not entitled to the call unless someone else rises.
—Yes. I was just going to draw to your attention that I would not be able to speak again unless somebody else on this side rises and allows me the opportunity to get up again. Obviously, the government is using this as a means of stifling debate.

	 (7)	 In this section:
 RFA  includes an amended RFA.
Moving these amendments together, I think, will facilitate the accelerated passage of this legislation, which the parliamentary secretary, by her sheer silence, obviously wants. I recommend these amendments to the chamber because we are here to ensure that, where millions of dollars of taxpayers' money are involved and where the national heritage is involved, the parliament must always itself be involved. For us not to ensure that is to abrogate our responsibilities as senators.
Under the government's legislation, regional forest agreements, as you will know, Mr Temporary Chairman Hogg, are signed between a prime minister and a premier but are not brought before this parliament. I reiterate that hundreds of millions of dollars have gone into this process, and money will continue to flow. It is derelict for the parliament not to ensure that it has scrutiny of the regional forest agreements. You will also be aware that there are opposition amendments to have just some regional forest agreements brought before the parliament for scrutiny. I am proposing here that all of them be brought before the parliament for scrutiny. Let us not have any difference between Tasmania and East Gippsland, which under the Labor amendments will not have their RFAs scruti 
 nised, and Western Australia, New South Wales and parts of Victoria, which will have regional forest agreements scrutinised.
I expect, of course, that the opposition will give an explanation as to why there is this double standard. But I can assure you that in Tasmania, where the majority of people do not want woodchipping of our wild forests to continue—and that includes woodchipping of world heritage value forests, the largest temperate rainforests in Australia—there will be a sense of the national parliament treating Tasmanians as second-class citizens if we are not to have the opportunity for parliamentary scrutiny of the Regional Forest Agreement, which impacts more on our state per head of population and per hectare than on any other state in the Commonwealth.
So the Labor Party is coming only halfway on this, and, let us be frank, that is because of the influence of Labor senators from Tasmania to have it cut out. The Tasmanian Labor Party has an abhorrent record of putting itself at the service of the big out-of-state woodchip corporations, leading to the regional forest agreements. We are seeing the most rapid rate of destruction of wild forests in Tasmanian history with the export of jobs—the big woodchip piles, and indeed the piles of logs on Burnie wharf, attest to the export of jobs going on down there—and the export of profits by companies like North and Boral, which have their shareholders not in Tasmania but elsewhere in the country and around the world.
The parliamentary secretary talks about regional consultation and that it is her business to make sure that regional communities are taken into account. How come the whole of Tasmania is being dumped by the government in this situation, where there is an agreement signed outside of parliament and the government saying, `We won't allow parliamentary scrutiny.' Is that looking after the interests of regional Australia? Of course it is not. It is dumping the interests of regional Australia and handing them across to the boardrooms in St Kilda Road and/or in Tokyo—the breakfast room at the Imperial Hotel in downtown Tokyo, where the representatives of the woodchip corporations go 
 each year to be told how much or how little they are going to get for woodchips out of Tasmania's native forests. They go, tugging their forelocks, and come home with their new price, without the Tasmanian government, the Labor Party in Tasmania, even being involved in that process. What the Greens are doing here is pushing to ensure that at least the democratic process is brought into play for an important public resource of enormous public concern in Tasmania.
I cannot understand why the government believes it can get away with the idea of caring for regional and rural Australia but dumping it in favour of the woodchip corporations in this way. I have explained the dynamics, but I cannot understand—and I will be interested to hear from Senator Forshaw or any of the other Labor senators—why Tasmania and why East Gippsland should be dumped out of this process. Their regional forest agreements are not for parliamentary scrutiny but there is parliamentary scrutiny for the rest. Why this double standard?",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-08-26,"—Firstly, let me indicate that amendment No. 3 of Senator Brown's amendments is identical to the ALP's amendment No. 3. Obviously we will support our own amendment, but we will not be supporting the other two amendments of Senator Brown's. Consequently, they should not be grouped in the way that has been proposed, for a single vote.
—On that basis, the chair will put the items separately.
—Thank you. I will deal with the Labor Party's position with respect to Senator Brown's amendments. I have to say at the outset that we sat here for a lengthy period of time yesterday—and it appears that we will again today and maybe into next week—to listen to the rhetoric of Senator Brown. Frankly, it does not assist his cause to continually try to tip buckets upon the Labor Party or other political parties with the spurious and outrageous allegations that he makes. We believe that our position on this legislation reflects the intentions of the original national forest policy statement and 
 the RFA process—that is, to develop a viable timber industry into the future that relies less upon the use of native forests; to ensure that, hand in hand with that process, communities can survive and jobs can be preserved and, indeed, promoted; and, that the heritage and conservation values of our forest estates are also protected and enhanced.
We all know that Senator Brown has a different and strongly held view from the Labor Party on these issues. His attitude is that doomsday is approaching, if not already upon us, and that, unless we effectively destroy the industry overnight, calamity will arise. We do not accept that, Senator Brown, and we will not. Therefore, we cannot support the amendments you are putting forward. They are too extreme; they are too inflexible. We particularly point out that what we are putting to this Senate, and we will be advancing later on, is a process of public and parliamentary scrutiny for the remaining RFAs.
You raised the question: what about the Tasmanian RFA and the Victorian RFAs? It is our position that they have been subject to substantial public scrutiny. You have not been sitting around silent for the last 12 months or so, and neither have the other interests in this debate. Indeed, the Senate committee that looked at this legislation was able to hear evidence about the existing RFAs that have already been negotiated, as well as about the likely future ones. Our proposal substantially enhances the government's legislation in accordance with the national forest policy principles. We frankly do not support your amendments Nos 2 and 7, and we will press our proposals for parliamentary scrutiny when that time arises in the debate. In particular, we submit that your proposed amendment No. 7 for parliamentary scrutiny of RFAs, whilst it is largely covered by our amendment, leaves out one important process—that rejected draft RFAs should be able to be resubmitted or submitted again in an amended form.
We want to establish a system under which an RFA that the parliament does not believe meets the criteria that have been established should be able to be taken away and renegotiated or redrafted or amended to enable it to 
 be ultimately approved for that particular region. Your proposal would not allow that subsequent process of a disallowed regional forest agreement to be remedied. I venture to say that that is precisely what you would desire to happen—to kill off any RFA that might come before this parliament, whether it meets the criteria or whether it does not meet the criteria.
We are about a system whereby regional forest agreements will be negotiated, put in place and backed up by Commonwealth legislation on the basis that those RFAs are consistent with the guidelines and the principles laid down in the national forest policy statement and other relevant criteria. Therefore, we will not support Greens amendments Nos 2 and 7. As I said, your amendment No. 3 is identical to our No. 3. Therefore, we would obviously be supporting that.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-08-26,"—I will be making some comments on this amendment, which the government will not be supporting. But before I do that I would like to make some comments specifically on the Tasmanian RFA, which was the subject of some discussion yesterday.
I wish to point out to Senator Brown that the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement clearly states that Tasmania's forest management systems provide for ecologically sustainable forest management, sustainable yield, a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system and industry development through the intensive forest management strategy. This is the context in which the statement on sustainable forest management in Tasmania was signed in January 1998. It will be important in promoting the products of Tasmania's sustainably managed forests both here and overseas.
Both the Commonwealth and the Tasmanian governments are committed to the full implementation of the RFA, and both governments are continuing to monitor implementation of the Tasmanian RFA. Long-term monitoring of the RFA outcomes will be through the use of agreed sustainability indicators and through monitoring against agreed milestones. The 
 sustainability indicators will be based on criteria and indicators developed by the Montreal Indicators Group, comprising representatives from state and Commonwealth governments. Work on that is ongoing.
In Tasmania, the reporting arrangements for implementing those commitments include a five-yearly review which will be open for public comment. It will use sustainability indicators, and will satisfy requirements for a state of the forest report and produce a public report. The RFA also calls for annual reports on implementation of the RFAs for the first five years of the agreements, with reports every five years thereafter. The first annual report has been prepared for the Tasmanian RFA and is publicly available. The next report is due at the end of 1999. Under the Tasmanian RFA the state has also agreed to publish and make publicly available its annual compliance audits of the implementation of the Forest Practices Act, the Forest Practices Code and the five-yearly independent expert reviews of the operation of that code.
With regard to the endangered species about which Senator Brown was anxious to learn more, it should be recognised, as I stated yesterday, that regional forest agreements provide for conservation of biodiversity at three scales of management: regional management scale, subregional or catchment management scale and local scale. Yesterday Senator Brown asked questions in relation to two specific Tasmanian species. I am advised that there are some 450 species listed as rare, endangered or vulnerable under Tasmanian legislation, of which more than 200 are specifically listed in the Tasmanian RFA. Obviously, it is unreasonable to expect me to have on hand details of the specific status of all these species. However, I have followed up Senator Brown's queries with the responsible minister and, as I said yesterday, I will pass the information to Senator Brown as it comes to hand.
It is also worth noting that, on the regional management scale in RFA regions, up to 48 per cent of forests are permanently protected through dedicated reserves. On the subregional or catchment scale, forests outside dedicated reserves are protected from logging 
 through the establishment of informal reserves and special protection zones. So up to 40 per cent of these forests are completely excluded from harvesting. On the local management scale, forests available to industry for logging are protected by a combination of special management zones, management prescriptions and codes of forest practice, which either exclude or limit the extent of logging according to the biodiversity and other significant environmental values in the area. Out of a total of 13.3 million hectares of Australia's multiple use native forests available for harvesting, approximately 110,000 hectares—or less than one per cent—are harvested in any one year.
The government is confident that those provisions provide a comprehensive network and system for the conservation and protection of biodiversity at all scales of management. This is a strong approach by government on conservation and protection of that. These RFAs are truly historic agreements, and we would hope they would be supported by all parties and Independents.
With regard to this particular amendment, the advice that I have from the Office of General Counsel, dated 10 August 1999, concludes in relation to the proposed parliamentary scrutiny process that, when a house of the parliament is debating and voting on a resolution for disapproval of a proposed RFA or when a member of either house is deciding whether to move a motion that may lead to the RFA being deemed to have been disapproved, there will not be and cannot be any restriction on the matters which the members will take into account in deciding whether or not the minister may enter into the RFA. The process in the parliament will be a purely political one. If an RFA is disapproved under clause 4(b), the Commonwealth will have acted on a discriminatory basis in refusing to enter into the RFA.
If there are any potential exporters of woodchips from the region, the Commonwealth will have given preference contrary to section 99 of the Constitution. Moreover, the bill, if amended as proposed, will probably itself infringe section 99. The bill expressly sets up a legislative scheme under which it is 
 possible that woodchips sourced from one region will be able to be exported, while woodchips sourced from another region will not. The bill, if amended as proposed, would then confer on the houses of parliament an unlimited discretion whether to permit the minister to enter into any particular RFA. The bill, if enacted in that form, would then be invalid.
Therefore, the government cannot support these amendments on those grounds alone and, even without this insurmountable constitutional barrier, the proposed amendments would undermine and politicise the RFA process to the extent that it would be difficult to sign RFAs at all.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-26,"—What codswallop! The minister says this is an insurmountable constitutional problem. It is of the government's own making. The government has set out to discriminate between the states by giving each of the states the power to essentially dictate its own RFA. So, they are different between different places, or they can have an RFA or not. All this is overcome by this government taking its proper responsibilities for Australia's forests and dealing with them in a responsible manner right across the country.
Any constitutional concerns that come out of this are the responsibility of one Prime Minister John Howard. He is there to look after the interests of all of us. Not here he is not; he is discriminating between states. Yesterday the parliamentary secretary told us that it was necessary to have a different definition of what a reserve was to protect the environmental amenity in each of the states. The government is dictating this discriminatory process between states. She gets up here and says that somehow or other we therefore cannot allow the ultimate outcome here, which is parliamentary scrutiny. Either you set up a situation where there may be some constitutional question or you deny parliament its right, responsibility and obligation to vet agreements which deal not only with the national heritage but hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money. What an absurd situation and what a silly argument from the minister. 
The fact is that the government is being discriminatory because the woodchip corporations want to be discriminatory. On top of that, the Labor Party is entering into the discrimination as of 1 March this year and saying that agreements before that do not get brought before parliament, but agreements after that do. Senator Forshaw says that that means there has been more scrutiny of the regional forest agreements before this magic date of 1 March. Really? Has any regional forest agreement had more scrutiny than the Western Australian one, or more public attention?
—Yes.
—Yes, Tasmania, for 15 years.
—That is quite ludicrous. The senators interjecting know full well, if they are honest, that it is the intervention of the Tasmanian Labor Party that is denying Tasmanians their right to have a regional forest agreement scrutinised. It is their anti-public attitude that is at the core of this.
—That's not true.
—I have no doubt Senator Sherry is going to get to his feet and say why it is that he thinks parliament should scrutinise the Western Australian agreement but he would deny that same right to Tasmania and make Tasmanians second class. That is his position on this.
The question to the Labor Party has to be: why has 1 March become the date for the cut-off? There has been no explanation from Senator Forshaw. The question to the parliamentary secretary is: are you not simply using a potential constitutional showdown of your own making to deny parliament its responsibility to be vetting these very important regional forest agreements?
Finally, I have a couple of comments on the parliamentary secretary's asseveration that some one per cent will be harvested per annum. Forests live more than 100 years; the great trees of the forests live for many centuries. You do not have to have fifth grade mathematics and an envelope to work out that this one per cent cut a year means the overcutting of forests and denying these 
 forests the ability to grow to the stage where they have nesting sites for owls, bats and possums. It is cutting down the ecological component of those forests.
In the same paragraph the parliamentary secretary talks about ecologically sustainable management, having agreed yesterday she did not know what that meant. She could not defend the term. She was in a totally hapless position because the advice backing she has had could not come to the rescue either. Because it is a lie; the whole concept of ecological sustainability used in the way it is put in the regional forest agreements is a lie. That is at the heart of this matter, and the Australian people know that. When you move in, firebomb, poison and cut down forests and call that ecological sustainability, you are engaged in a lie.
What sort of parliament are we to be not only promulgating such a lie and taking it from the regional forest agreements but denying ourselves the ability to scrutinise it and see how it measures up to the reality of the on-the-ground destruction of our forests?",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,1999-08-26,"—I rise to express on behalf of the Australian Democrats our support for amendments Nos 2, 3 and 7 moved by Senator Brown. In particular, we feel strongly about the issue of parliamentary scrutiny. That is no more apparent than in my home state of Western Australia, where there is continued public outrage over the secrecy in which the state government has involved itself in forming, and then partly repealing, the RFA in that state.
I note that amendment No. 7 moved by Senator Brown is in conflict with amendment No. 7 moved by the Australian Labor Party. Our view on that quite simply is that we would much rather see Senator Brown's motion succeed where the mechanism is there such that, once an RFA has been disapproved of, it cannot then be re-presented by the government. We see that as being crucial to the whole notion of balance that is so desperately needed within this debate.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-26,"—I have a sense of foreboding that the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement is 
 going to be cut out, courtesy of the Labor Party as well as the government, and therefore will not get its opportunity to move into the light of parliamentary scrutiny. It would be remiss of me, therefore, not to briefly visit the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement and ask the parliamentary secretary—who has been forewarned of this by the speech of Senator Bourne, in fact—about the lock-down provisions in that regional forest agreement for satisfying community concern about the forests of Tasmania. This, of course, is a Commonwealth responsibility.
The Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement was signed in March 1998 by Prime Minister Howard and then Premier Rundle, even though the Labor Party in Tasmania disagreed and wanted more of the forests cut down than was in the agreement. Part of that regional forest agreement was that the strategic plan for implementing the comprehensive and adequate reserve system on private land was to be developed no later than three months after that date—March 1998. I ask: can the parliamentary secretary say if that was done and, if not, why not?
Tasmania was to publish a description of the methods of sustainable yield on public land, including for special species sawlogs by 31 October last year. Has that happened? If not, why not? Tasmania also was to publish and make publicly available compliance audits of the Forest Practices Act and Code and the code of reserve management annually commencing in 1998. My information is that has not happened. I ask: has it happened and, if not, why not? Tasmania was to introduce, in respect of private land, mechanisms to encourage native vegetation retention and management by this year. Has that happened? I understand it has not. Why not? The state was also to develop and implement a threatened species protection strategy—this is the ecological safeguard stuff—by 31 December last year. It did not happen. I ask the parliamentary secretary: why not? There was also to be completed and published silvicultural guidelines for the management of commercial forest types by December last year. It did not happen. Why not?
What we have here is serial breaches by the Commonwealth of its obligations under the RFA. This was written in and signed by the Prime Minister to implement measures which have important conservation and social outcomes as far as Tasmania is concerned. Through this process the Prime Minister has broken his commitment. He has dishonoured the written word here that these dates would be met and that Tasmania would be seen to be obligated. There may be some reason why the Commonwealth just simply could not get the Bacon Labor government to perform. That might not surprise people, but there is nevertheless a Commonwealth responsibility here. I ask the minister, in defence of the contention that the regional forest agreement is worth the paper it is written on, if she can tell us why this series of defaults occurred in the first 12 months of the regional forest agreement.
—I will put the questions separately, Senator Brown.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-26,"—Chair, I do not want to make your position invidious, but I will ask the rhetorical question.
—You cannot make my position invidious.
—No. Nor would I dare trespass into that territory. But I ask the rhetorical question: can anybody in the chair ever have seen such a failure to respond by a minister or a representative of the minister on such an important matter? This is an extremely important matter, and we have a hapless government representative who skirted around some forests in Tasmania on a visit or two down there but simply did not get into the matter. She has been handed the responsibility for one of the most important pieces of legislation that has come before this parliament as far as the nation's environment is concerned, and she has been put in the position of defending the indefensible.
None of the parliamentary secretary's senior colleagues have had the gumption to take the chair because, as I said earlier, the regional forest agreements themselves are built on a lie about protecting the forest environment when 
 they are not. That is why they are going to fail. That is why they will not stand up. The Senate committee heard that from many witnesses—that signing on the dotted line a death warrant for the forests of Australia is simply not going to mean that that sentence will be carried out. Sure, there will be lots of damage, but people are not accepting it in Western Australia—and they are not accepting it in Tasmania, I can tell you.
—They are accepting it in Tasmania.
—Senator Sherry just intervened and said they are accepting it.
—You do not accept it. The majority of the community accept it.
—Senator Sherry has been wrong in the past and he is going to be shown to be wrong again. He might accept non-Tasmanian entities ruling over this resource. He might accept the destruction of a job creating Tasmanian asset, but the people of Tasmania will not. If he has a constructive input—
Senator Sherry interjecting—
—I will not get into grandstanding in this place, as you want to, Senator Sherry, because that is a diversion, and you might lose that argument as well.
If Senator Sherry has a constructive component to bring to this debate, then he has the opportunity to do so. In fact what he is doing is sitting bolted to his seat, the same as the parliamentary secretary, because he has nothing worth while to add.
—Senator Brown, I cannot make the parliamentary secretary or any minister of the government, nor any member of this chamber, participate in this debate or in any other debate. I have the responsibility for the conduct of the debate and it is as simple as that. I am sure you realise that.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-08-26,"—I will be relatively brief because I did make a contribution in the second reading debate. It should be pointed out to the Senate and to those participating in the debate that Senator Brown is following the fairly well- 
 worn tactic of stringing the debate out as long as he can. Some questions he asks are legitimate; others are spurious and an attempt to waste time and grandstand. That is a well-worn path that Senator Brown has followed for the best part of 20 years in respect of forests, at least in Tasmania.
Senator Brown used the word `lie' in reference to a number of comments that have been made in the debate so far. I do not take it that he was referring to me, but I think we need to analyse Senator Brown's use of that word. For example, he refers to firebombing and poisoning of forests after logging takes place. Senator Brown well knows that that is a gross misrepresentation of why the burning of areas that have been logged takes place. Senator Brown gives the impression that people move in and wilfully chop everything down, bring in the aeroplanes and bomb the face of the planet, then throw poison around willy-nilly, and that this is the face of forestry. But that is not true.
When you log an area of eucalypt forest and you are cleaning up afterwards, as Senator Brown well knows, you have to burn the waste to ensure regeneration of the eucalypt forest. That occurs not just in areas that have been logged; it occurs regularly in nature. The very viability of a forest is threatened ecologically if fires do not occur over significant periods of time. It is part of the ecosystem of eucalypt forests. That is why burning of forests occurs after logging takes place. I have seen areas of forest in Tasmania where burning did not take place after logging. They are an absolute mess. You do not get any sort of balanced regrowth.
What we are talking about with these RFAs is the identification of those areas that were put aside in reserves—world heritage and other areas—and that will never be logged. The RFA process is about identifying the areas that will be logged and those that will not be logged. That is the point of the RFAs—making sure that we have representative forests put aside that will never be touched. That is one of the central points of the RFA process. The RFA process does not open up every area of forest in Australia, particularly in Tasmania, to logging. That is 
 simply not the case. Again, that is another gross misrepresentation by Senator Brown. He referred to 100-year-old trees. Yes, there are some 100-year-old trees that are logged in the area where logging is permitted, but there are many areas where, as Senator Brown knows, there are 100-year-old trees and 200-year-old trees that will never be touched.
In reference to the Tasmanian RFA, as Senator Brown well knows, the RFA process had its genesis in the Salamanca agreement that the environment movement signed up to close to a decade ago. Like all of the processes that you become involved in with some sections of the environment movement, when you get to the end of the day the environment movement pulls out because it will not accept the logging of any native forests in Australia. That is a fundamental philosophical position that Senator Brown and I will always disagree on. Senator Brown argues consistently that there should be no logging of any native forests anywhere.
If that were to be implemented in this country tomorrow, the consequences would be catastrophic for forest industries. At least in regard to Tasmania, of which I have some first-hand knowledge, in a state with 50 per cent of its land area forested, you can achieve a happy balance between the requirements of an ongoing sustainable forest industry and  areas that should not be logged and that are appropriately put aside for world heritage, national parks and reserves. For that reason, I refute the claim of Senator Brown that by and large the community is not happy with the outcome in Tasmania.
The community by and large is happy with the outcome in Tasmania. Senator Brown's constituency and community is not happy, but they will never be happy until we get to the position that they want—that not one tree is ever touched. That is an extreme position that Senator Brown represents.
We have debated these issues in Tasmania, as Senator Brown knows, for the best part of the last 20 years. There have been at least 21 or 22 inquiries into forestry in Tasmania during that time. My hope is that the RFA process is the last such `inquiry'. I think that by and large the Tasmanian community are 
 frankly sick to death of the ongoing debate about trees and forests and are generally satisfied with what has occurred in respect to the RFA. That is an overwhelming sentiment amongst the people that I represent. I would remind Senator Brown that at a federal level the Labor Party in Tasmania represents well over 50 per cent of the vote. It holds state government in its own right. The level of support for the Greens in Tasmania has started to decline, and I think that is a good thing. Senator Brown well knows my views about that. I just make those comments.
Senator Brown, as I said earlier, is fond of using extremely extravagant language, without explaining the true facts. He uses very emotive language, and I understand that is often done in politics. But when he starts saying people are lying and allegedly misleading this place, Senator Brown in some of his comments at least—his extravagant use of language—is grossly misleading. I would not use the word `lying'. But he is grossly misleading. As I think my colleague and the parliamentary secretary pointed out, these issues have been debated up hill and down dale—up every tree in Tasmania. There is not a square inch of ground in Tasmania that has not been studied time and time again over the last two decades. That is why, Senator Brown, there is no reason to be reconsidering the entire Tasmanian RFA process.
What is interesting about the outcome in Tasmania, at least, is that it shows that in almost every area of representative forest type well in excess of the 15 per cent criteria has been met. What would be the position if, after the RFA process, people wanted those areas that were in excess of the 15 per cent criteria reopened for logging? But no-one would suggest that. I certainly would not. In Tasmania we have 40 per cent of the state—about a third of the forest areas—in reserves, national parks and world heritage areas of various kinds. The Tasmanian community, after considerable public debate, angst and conflict, is relatively happy with that situation. Substantial areas of the remaining forest are available for logging on a sustainable basis and in an appropriate manner.
My sincere hope is that those areas will continue to be logged in a sustainable manner, because forestry represents about 15 per cent of the state's economy. At the same time, the tourist industry has continued to grow. There has been a growing interest in ecotourism, which Senator Brown is very keen on and I think is appropriate. There has been no decline in ecotourism in Tasmania as a result of forestry. You can have the best of both worlds. I am convinced of that. You can have a good outcome for the environment. You can have a good outcome for those whose interests lie in the use of the forests on a sustainable basis.
I will conclude on this point. Senator Brown continually makes the point that employment is declining in forest industries. Again, this is an example of Senator Brown's sweeping generalisations that are misleading. Yes, on the face of it, employment is going down in forest industries, with perhaps an exception in the furniture manufacturing and craft area. But that is because of technology and that is occurring in every manufacturing industry in the country. I think there would be very few exceptions. The conclusion Senator Brown then comes to is, `Well, it is not worth having any forest industry. It should end tomorrow because employment is declining in that industry.'
If we argue the logic of that, Senator Brown, we would say that tomorrow you shut down the textile industry and the car manufacturing industry and every other manufacturing industry because in all of those industries employment is continuing to decline as well. There is no logical position there from Senator Brown. I accept that employment has declined, but that does not mean that you do not continue to have an industry that makes a very worthwhile contribution to the `strength' of the Tasmanian economy. If you were to remove 15 per cent of the Tasmanian economy in one hit, as Senator Brown would want, the unemployment rates, which at the moment are the highest in the nation, would double overnight. Senator Brown's conclusions on that logic are just absurd.
I might say in passing—sorry, it is a long conclusion—that there would be significantly 
 greater employment in the forest industries in Tasmania if the green movement had not opposed the Wesley Vale pulp and paper mill. I was living in Latrobe at the time when that debate occurred. I noticed that we, the Labor Party, copped a few brickbats for our approach on that. It is a complex story but we did lose an opportunity for what would have been, in my view, a very important contribution to the value adding of the woodchips that Senator Brown continually decries and criticises because the woodchips are exported. We could have had at least 50 per cent of the woodchips that are exported from Tasmania converted into pulp and paper in Tasmania. Senator Brown well knows that his movement was in substantial part responsible for that project not going ahead.
We had been criticised for our approach when we were in government, but I also just point out for the sake of accuracy that we had a state election called by the then Liberal Premier, Robin Gray, who thought he was going to win an election on the issue. He ended up losing seats and being in opposition. So there was a whole cast of players involved in that little episode at that time, including the then state Liberal Party, the Premier, Mr Gray, and the now Senator Brown—I accept that the Labor Party bears some of the responsibility as well. I say `little episode' advisedly, because it was a tragic loss for our state. I hope that those comments shed a slightly more balanced light than Senator Brown's comments. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-26,"—Senator Sherry at least got on to Wesley Vale, which I remember Prime Minister Hawke, his then leader, disclaiming because—for reasons which Senator Sherry has forgotten—it was going to spew 13 tonnes of organochlorines a day into Bass Strait as well as spread dioxins over the vegetable growing regions of Wesley Vale—with a negative impact on jobs and Tasmania's clean green image. The use of that dirty old technology would have had fallout right through the state.
—Do you want the current operation shut down?
—Senator Sherry ought to know better than to bring that subject up. His record on the RFAs, I suggest, is going to be as good as his record on East Timor. He is going to be found to be wrong and he is going to be shown to have had an old line of thinking which is not adequate to the aspirations of people who are on the ground and are affected by what we do in this parliament.
Senator Sherry began his little homily in defence of the government on the basis that there was something wrong with calling the use of `ecologically sustainable' in RFAs a lie. Well, I stand by it. If Senator Sherry can show how clear-felling of forests with dropping of incendiaries for whatever reason—and he has a contorted view of that—and then putting in 1080 poisoning is ecologically sustainable, I would like him to get to his feet and say how. Senator Troeth ultimately ended up glued to her seat over that yesterday, because there is no way you can explain that. It is the fundamental lie behind the RFAs. But now let me make space for Senator Sherry to get up and say that that process is ecologically sustainable.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-08-26,"—I will take up the challenge only very briefly. As I have said on a number of occasions in this place, Senator Brown well knows the reason you burn forests after you have clear-felled them: you have to regenerate the eucalyptus forest and, if you do not, you end up with a massive mess. I am not going to make any further contribution. I suspect I am going to be a bit like Senator Troeth. The objective here by Senator Brown is to filibuster.
—You are exactly the same as Senator Troeth.
—No, you know my position, Senator Brown, on this issue.
—It's a woodchipper's position.
—It is not a woodchipper's position. Senator Brown is provoking me. Sorry, Chair. I just want to make this clear about the RFA process. The RFA process means that you identify the areas you log and do not log. I do not know 
 whether Senator Brown knows this or not—I am sure he does: when you log an area of forest you hope to have an outcome with the highest value adding of that timber for sawlog purposes. That is the outcome you aim at. You will always have considerable waste left over. That is the principle on which it should operate. That waste can either be burned on the ground or it can be used for woodchipping downstream for pulp and paper manufacturing. That is why you produce woodchips. I am well aware too, Senator Brown, that there are areas of eucalypt grown exclusively for woodchips, particularly plantations, but that is another debate.
This has been a lengthy debate. Senator Brown knows the tactics that can be followed in this place. I do not intend to make any further contribution. I made a couple of contributions on this matter in the second reading debate. Senator Brown and I know each other's position. I have a healthy respect for Senator Brown as a political operator and for his position. I just do not agree with his position. We have a fundamental difference of principle, and I suspect we always will. I do not intend to engage in what Senator Brown is attempting, which is going to be a filibuster. That is your tactic, Senator Brown. That is a legitimate parliamentary tactic, but do not get up and accuse the parliamentary secretary, me or my colleague Senator Forshaw of failing to answer questions, when that is your tactic. We know what your tactic is, Senator Brown. I think there has been a very reasoned debate so far. I think every attempt has been made to answer questions legitimately from both sides. I will be resisting further temptations to engage with you in that tactic.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-26,"—And so the glue applies to Senator Sherry's seat, because there is a simple incapacity to do away with the underlying lie of the regional forest agreements that they lead to ecologically sustainable logging. Senator Sherry's colleague Deputy Premier Paul Lennon uses that terminology all over the place, but it still does not get away from the fact that in the RFAs the use of the term `ecologically sustainable' is a lie, because it 
 is ecologically destructive to go into forests and to cut down, burn and poison ecosystems. If there were only some honesty in this debate from the woodchip industry right through to its supporters in parliament, we would have that term taken out because it is a lie. When you start to engage in supporting fallacious terminology like that, you undermine the whole validity of the case.
So Senator Sherry joins Senator Troeth in being totally unable to explain how you could use that terminology. Of course, he has now taken the time-honoured defence of silence—which I think should be accorded to anybody lest they self-incriminate. I accept that. A legitimate debating tactic, too, is to go silent when you know that you are caught out. I commend this motion to the house.
—The question is that amendment No. 3 moved by Senator Brown be agreed to.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-08-26,"—As opposition amendment No. 3 is identical to Greens amendment No. 3, which has previously been carried, I do not need to move that, I understand. I move opposition amendment No. 7:

	 (b)	 the RFA was deemed to  have been disapproved of.
(8)	 An RFA which is resubmitted under subsection (7) may be resubmitted in an amended form.
Let me indicate that this is a substantial amendment to the legislation and, we hope, one that will be carried by the Senate—we hope one that will be supported particularly by the Greens, the Democrats and Senator Harradine.
We have heard the outrageous comments of the minister in response to this proposal. I take this opportunity to put on the record 
 precisely what is involved so that everyone understands. What we are proposing is a system of public scrutiny and parliamentary scrutiny of draft RFAs. We see this as important because ultimately what this government is doing is giving legislative effect to regional forest agreements and all that flows from those agreements for at least the next 20 years. There is a substantial amount of Commonwealth funding and taxpayer funding underwriting the RFA process. That funding is in excess of $100 million, not counting additional structural adjustment funding. For that reason alone we would submit that it is important for parliament to have some opportunity to at least scrutinise the content of a regional forest agreement negotiated between a state government and the Commonwealth government prior to its being signed off by the relevant Commonwealth minister.
I note in passing that yesterday the Joint Public Works Committee of the parliament handed down a report in regard to another matter, the proposed new reactor at Lucas Heights. I have made my views known about that and it is not relevant to this debate, except that the reason the Public Works Committee actually came to report upon the proposal was that there is a substantial amount of taxpayer funding involved in it. It is a project that will run to a couple of hundred million dollars in construction and will operate for the next 40-odd years. Indeed, it is a requirement that any substantial government expenditure on projects of such a nature, infrastructure projects et cetera, must be considered by the Public Works Committee.
I think the principle is one that can equally be applied in this case. That is, where you have a system whereby the states and the Commonwealth will be negotiating regional forest agreements that will operate for up to 20 years and will involve a substantial allocation of Commonwealth taxpayer funds, at some point in time the parliament should get an opportunity to at least oversight those agreements. The public scrutiny stage of the process is outlined in amendment No. 7, in proposed clause 4A. That proposed clause reads as follows:
(1)	 Within 21 days of receiving agreement from a State or Territory to the text of a draft RFA, the Minister, after consulting with the Minister for the Environment, must publish in the Gazette :
(a)	 a statement as to whether the draft RFA is in accordance with this Act; and
(B)	 a notice of the Minister's intention to enter into the RFA; and
(c)	 a copy of the draft RFA.
That is straightforward. That is a requirement on the minister after a draft RFA has been prepared after that lengthy process of Commonwealth and state assessment and negotiations involving all the relevant parties. It is appropriate, we would submit, that the text of that draft RFA be published in the Gazette  so it is available for public scrutiny. The benefit of course is this: by having a requirement on the minister to make a statement as to whether the draft RFA is in accordance with the act or not, that establishes the foundations upon which the draft RFA can be scrutinised by the public and by interested stakeholders to assess the position enunciated by the minister.
The next part of the process is the parliamentary scrutiny. I will not read the entire new clause 4B because it is lengthy, but I will summarise it as follows. Firstly, the process is that, before entering into an RFA, the draft text of which of course has been previously published in the Gazette, the minister must cause a copy of that proposed RFA to be tabled in each house of parliament. Secondly, within 15 sitting days after the proposed RFA has been tabled, each house may, upon motion made with notice, pass a resolution disapproving of the proposed RFA.
So that clause sets up a scheme whereby the draft RFA is laid on the table and then there are 15 sitting days for the parliament to pass a resolution disapproving of the proposed RFA. That is a tight timetable. It is deliberately so because we do not want to see a situation where there is a delay from spurious objection to an RFA that meets all the criteria, has been the subject of ongoing public scrutiny, has been the subject of negotiation over some period of time and has been in the public arena and in the parliamentary arena. So there is a heavy onus upon the parliament, 
 if it is to disapprove of the RFA, to consider it quickly and effectively.
Of course, situations have arisen, particularly in Western Australia, where there has been a lot of public debate and parliamentary debate about whether or not an RFA appropriately meets the criteria. But if—as we hope—the RFAs do meet the criteria in the future, they would lie on the table and a motion would not necessarily have to be moved.
It is of course the intention of the whole process that the outcomes will be in accordance with the requirements of the national forest policy statement and so on. But at least, by having this, if there is a problem with the RFA—it does not meet the criteria—there is a mechanism available for a member of the House of Representatives or a senator to give notice of a disapproval motion and then have that debated. That then ensures that the issues would be raised and that the problems that would need to be identified can be identified within parliament, and parliament can have a vote on them.
Further procedures are laid out in this amendment which relate to an RFA being disapproved of by either house of parliament. The RFA may be resubmitted provided that a period of not less than 15 sitting days has elapsed since the day upon which it was disapproved. Furthermore, it may be resubmitted in an amended form.
I want to quickly make some points in respect of some of the erroneous comments that have been made about this, and no doubt I will have a further opportunity after we hear from the government. It has been suggested that the process that we are putting forward is contrary to the original national forest policy statement and the whole basis of the RFA process. That is nonsense. At no stage in that process did the Commonwealth ever abrogate its responsibility—and certainly at no stage did the parliament ever abrogate its responsibility—for the constitutional aspects that it can cover in respect of Australia's forests and forest industry.
That would indeed have been quite the wrong thing to have happened. Some argue that the RFA process really means that the Commonwealth is vacating the field because 
 it is supposedly all too difficult and too much of a hot political issue. They say that the Commonwealth has handed this issue back to the states who may happen to own the resource or have management of the resource—that is, the state forests—and that therefore the whole issue should be resolved at that level. Those who argue that are wrong.
Certainly there is still a major responsibility for the federal government and the federal parliament to ensure that the outcomes of the regional forest agreement process are proper and appropriate. We make no apology for that. If anything has demonstrated the need for such a process to be available for parliamentary scrutiny, it is the debacle that has gone on in Western Australia in recent times, where an agreement was negotiated after a lengthy period of time, signed off and then abrogated by the state government within a matter of a couple of weeks. We now have this debacle between the Commonwealth minister and the state government over just what is a legally binding agreement and what is not.
I am aware that there are other arguments and criticisms of our proposal. It has been suggested that, somehow, it will frustrate the entire RFA process. That is rubbish. Our proposal has been on the table and known to the state governments, the industry and all the players for quite some time now, ever since the Senate committee handed down its report early this year. Just in the last couple of days we have seen further RFAs negotiated and signed off in Victoria and New South Wales. Negotiations are continuing in New South Wales and Queensland to complete the process, hopefully before the end of this year. That is a vast improvement on the minister's record up until a month or so ago. It is quite clear that the process will continue and that our amendments will not frustrate that process.

"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-08-26,"—There are some comments I wish to make on this amendment, but before that I wish to place on record some answers to questions put to me by Senator Brown earlier with regard to 
 Quamby Bluff in Tasmania. In relation to forestry operations at Quamby Bluff outside the CAR reserve system, I am advised that the operations are being conducted in accordance with the forest management plan for the Mersey forest district, which was prepared by Forestry Tasmania in accordance with this normal public consultation process. I understand that 38 public submissions were received on the draft plan, of which 22 were supportive and 16 were opposed in full or in part, and that all these submissions were taken into account in the development of the final plan. I am having further inquiries made in relation to the specific matter raised by Senator Brown.
I would now like to turn to the opposition amendment we are debating and, first of all, comment on the public scrutiny element of this amendment. There does not seem to be any point to this proposed amendment, because before the Commonwealth agrees to enter into any RFA, it is required to meet all its obligations under all Commonwealth legislation. As such, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage is always closely involved in the RFA process. The requirement to consult with the minister for the environment is therefore superfluous.
While the involvement of all stakeholders is encouraged during the RFA process itself and during subsequent periodic reviews of its operation, at the end of the day the agreement is between the Commonwealth and the relevant state. Further, given the extensive public consultation that has taken place under all RFA deliberations, there is no reason to suggest that notification of the Commonwealth's intention to enter into an RFA nor the publishing of the draft RFA will serve any purpose.
Turning to the parliamentary scrutiny provisions of this amendment, the time delays inherent in this proposal would jeopardise the finalisation of the RFAs by 31 December 1999. This raises the real prospect of the prohibition of exports of hardwood woodchips sourced from native forests in non-RFA regions after that date. It must be remembered that, for any agreement to gain the benefits of the RFA bill as it now stands, the comprehen 
 sive and stringent definition of `regional forest agreement' contained in clause 3 of the bill must be met in full. This means that an RFA must have regard to assessments made of the environmental, endangered species, national estate, world heritage, indigenous heritage, economic and social values; it must provide for a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system; it must provide for the ecologically sustainable management of the region's forested areas; and it must make clear that it is a regional forest agreement for the purpose of providing long-term stability of forests and forest industries.
This comprehensive definition ensures that the parliament can be satisfied about the consistent nature and quality of regional forest agreements now and into the future. Further, if there is a concern that RFA requirements are not being complied with, it is open to parliament to amend or repeal the bill. This requires both houses to act, not just one house, as in the case of disapproval. It is also interesting that the opposition, at least, appears to be quite happy with the RFAs already signed, with the possible exception of the Western Australian RFA. However, it is these same RFAs that have been subject to the most criticism in submissions made to the Senate legislation review committee. The government obviously does not accept the bulk of such criticism, but it raises the question of how the parliament will be better able to determine whether an RFA is acceptable or not. The RFA process itself involves both comprehensive scientific assessment and comprehensive stakeholder engagement. On what basis will a house of parliament be better placed to determine whether an RFA is appropriate or not?
Even assuming that this period is 15 sitting days, as provided for in relation to consideration of disallowance motions, uncertainty about an RFA could drag on for months. Further, if the RFA is disapproved, there is no requirement under the proposed amendment for the disapproving house to specify what aspects of the RFA are not acceptable. It is either all or nothing. So one could envisage extensive rounds of submission and resubmission of a draft RFA without any positive 
 resolution. These proposed amendments are a recipe for uncertainty. All of these issues raise grave concerns about the practicality of the proposed amendments. It will produce yet another process that has no obvious merit.
Minister Tuckey has already agreed to the recommendations of the majority report that each RFA be tabled in parliament after it is signed and that the first five annual reports of the operations of RFAs be tabled in parliament. This should ensure adequate scrutiny by parliament. It must also be remembered that the Commonwealth enters into RFAs under its executive powers, not under legislation. While the  Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998  supports RFAs, it is not the source of Commonwealth powers to enter into them.
RFAs are negotiated agreements between two government parties and are not similar to other instances where instruments may be disallowable. These include regulations made under Commonwealth legislation and provision under the Native Title Act 1993 for possible disallowance of the Commonwealth minister's determination that an alternative scheme in complementary state or territory legislation complies with criteria set out in the native title act. Disallowance or disapproval would normally be applied to an instrument which is one-sided—that is, a regulation or a determination—and which is intended to have the force of law, such as a regulation, rather than to a Commonwealth-State agreement which has two or more parties, and that is what the RFA is.
While the process of developing RFAs provides for stakeholder participation, including consultation on a publicly released options or directions report, this does not mean that all major community interests will accept a particular negotiated RFA outcome. Provision for disapproval would therefore be likely to reopen and provide a national focus on a regional agreement that is already negotiated and agreed. This will remove the certainty that is the key incentive for governments to participate in the complex RFA process, and thus it will undermine it.
Provision for disapproval is likely to lead to significant differences between existing and future RFAs or denial of access to an RFA. 
 This will undermine what we believe is a nationally consistent approach to implementing the national forest policy statement agreed by the Commonwealth and all state and territory governments. Therefore, the government will not be supporting this amendment.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,1999-08-26,"—by leave—I move Democrat amendments (10) and (11) on sheet 1514:
(10)	 subclause 4A(1), omit ""consulting with"", substitute ""obtaining the agreement of"".
(11)	 subclause 4B(7), omit ""15 sitting days"", substitute ""30 days"".
These amendments seek to amend opposition amendment No. 7 on sheet 1290. Democrat amendment (10) is designed to ensure that we obtain the agreement of the environment minister before gazettal rather than just having to consult with the environment minister, which is what the ALP seeks with their amendment.
Democrat amendment (11) seeks to omit the 15-day minimum time period between re-presenting an RFA to either house after it has been rejected. We believe strongly that there should be a minimum six-month time period for government to go back and renegotiate an RFA agreement if either house of the Commonwealth parliament rejects it. We are concerned that, with such little time as 15 days, the government will keep thrusting an unchanged RFA back before the Senate and dare us to be obstructionist on it.
We have already seen how the government will behave on this, with both Senator Hill and Minister Tuckey saying that they will refuse to accept any amendments to the RFA legislation, and that is before they have even seen what is on offer. That is not good or responsible government; that is simply bare-chested arrogance, and that is what we will see from them on this if an RFA is rejected by the Senate. There should be a minimum six-month cooling off period so that government can work with state governments and stakeholders in respect of any unacceptable elements of an RFA.

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1999-08-26,"—I have some questions for the parliamentary secretary. You have said, as I under 
 stand it, that this is an agreement between two governments and that it is very much an executive function rather than a legislative function or a function of parliament. Bearing in mind the case of the New South Wales Treasurer being ejected from parliament and the High Court having some things to say about it, what matters are outside the purview of parliament if parliament wants to have a say about them?
Secondly, you say uncertainty is a problem in this area. In what area where a house has the ability to disallow a regulation would there be a lack of uncertainty? In other words, isn't any process by which you have a disallowance motion available a process that contains uncertainty? Therefore, the mere fact of uncertainty hardly seems to be an issue.

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1999-08-26,"—One of the problems in the process as it now stands is that what is contemplated by this scheme is that there will be agreements between the state and the Commonwealth which will last over a particular period of time—20 years. If an agreement is made now, the effect of it will be to stop future governments introducing aspects that they might want. As is usually the case when a government is elected, it has the majority in the House of Representatives but no majority in the Senate, yet it may want to pursue a particular policy in an agreement different to that implemented by a previous government. The effect of this legislation is to bar a future government from pursuing its particular intention at that time, which is a very serious issue. Because of that, I think there is a need for at least some parliamentary input—Senate or the House of Representatives—at the time that these agreements are made.
When the Labor Party was in power it got this going, so I am not putting this on the basis that you are doing the wrong thing. We agree with the idea of RFAs. But on an issue such as forests—their conservation, their exploitation and the export and sale of their products—parliament ought have a say at the time a particular agreement is made, given that it is going to decide policy for 20 years into the future and that, because of the realities of the Senate, it will stop future governments changing that policy.

So to say that future governments can change the policy is, I think, not to look at what the real situation is.
I would have thought the very least that a responsible parliament could do would be to examine each agreement as it goes through and say that, doing the best we can now, we think this is an agreement that ought to go forward or not.

I am wondering if the minister considers it appropriate that, under certain federal awards, people up to the age of 22 years of age are paid a fraction of the wage of their older co-workers for work of equal value merely because of their age.

So I am wondering also whether the minister considers it just—as his party did in 1992 with its Jobsback policy—that young people, such as those on the graphic arts interim award, are paid as little as $3.06 an hour. I note the minister's comments in relation to job losses, and I wonder if he is prepared to acknowledge that the 200,000 figure to which his earlier questioner referred is actually based on a flawed survey. Are you referring, Minister, to the survey by the IRA, which was not only optional—
— The IRA?
—In this case, the Retailers Association. Not only was it an optional survey; it also claimed that junior

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-08-26,"—I am not aware of the precise cut-off point in terms of age. But I think the important principle that Senator Stott Despoja seems to want to completely and consistently misunderstand is that—as all the editorial writers and commentators have pointed out today—to invoke age discrimination, despite the fact that there would be significant job losses for young Australians, is certainly not in their best interests. If you really want to re-establish yourself as a serious policy player, the sooner you face up 
 to the economic consequences of your actions the better.
The Australian Industrial Relations Commission's junior rates inquiry found that removing junior rates would have significant disemploying effects for young people. I presume Senator Stott Despoja either does not want to acknowledge that or somehow thinks there is a more important overriding principle. The report notes that this finding was not seriously challenged by the participants in the inquiry. The report indicates that, when given the opportunity to respond to this finding, the ACTU did not seek to address directly the finding or the substantial weight of economic opinion on which it is based. Furthermore, the ACTU proposal to pay adult wages to those 18 and over would still be age discriminatory and would still require an exemption from the antidiscrimination provisions of the act.
So Senator Stott Despoja is really saying that she disagrees with the Labor Party and she supports the ACTU. That is not a very comfortable position to be in, given their highly advanced state of economic illiteracy. The sooner Senator Stott Despoja acknowledges that simply having arbitrary cut-off points used to justify significant increases in wages may result in people being very likely indeed to lose their jobs, the sooner we will have a sensible discussion of the issue.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Junior Rates of Pay</title>,Questions Without Notice,18,1,answer

That is exactly what Senator Stott Despoja's question did; it contained an argument. If Senator Woodley is so upset about the minister allegedly arguing the point, why didn't he raise it in relation to Senator Stott Despoja?

"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,1999-08-26,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill), to a question without notice asked by Senator Ludwig today, relating to legal costs concerning the dismissal of the Secretary of the Department of Defence (Mr Barratt).
My colleague Senator Ludwig's question went to the issue of the costs of the whole farce that we have been subjected to with the ineptitude of this government. We heard the 
 minister say—and rightly so—that he had to see the costs taxed at this stage. But one knows that this will be at a fair expense to the Commonwealth but at an even greater expense to the Department of Defence. In this case, Minister Moore, who is in disarray himself, has left his department in disarray. It has poor morale, great uncertainty and no leadership. The minister has done very little to inspire people under him within his department. If anything, the minister has destabilised his department rather than engendered any sense of hope that the future will be there for Defence to come through a fairly rigorous program that it is undergoing under the defence reform program.
The Barratt affair—if I can call it that at the outset—was a fairly ridiculous affair that the government entered into. The government should not have gone down this path. Instead, it is faced with the question of taxing costs awarded to Mr Barratt in defence of his fundamental right, the right to remain the Secretary to the Department of Defence.
If one looks at the history of this, one sees how the whole sorry saga unfolds. In the affidavit of Mr Maxwell William Moore-Wilton, sworn 2 August in the case of Barratt versus John Winston Howard, one finds that on 16 February 1999 Mr Max Moore-Wilton notes that he drafted an aide-memoire:
for my own use on the result of my consultations relating to the performance of Secretaries of Departments as a basis for a confidential discussion with the Prime Minister.
It is interesting to note in Mr Max Moore-Wilton's affidavit what he had to say to the Prime Minister about the result of the performance testing of the various secretaries of the departments. In his affidavit he says:
The Minister of Defence has negative views about his Secretary. I have raised the Minister's criticism with Mr Barratt personally and he has advised that he has met with the Minister to discuss his performance.
That is fine. But then he goes on to say:
In view of the fact that the Minister has not been Minister of Defence for a substantial period, I consider that there are not sufficient grounds to recommend to you that action be considered in relation to Mr Barratt but the matter of his performance should be reviewed in a year's time. 

That seems quite reasonable, indeed. If the minister did have some disagreement with Mr Barratt, that is natural and understandable. But in his affidavit Mr Moore-Wilton goes clearly to the point, to say that the Minister for Defence had not been there for a substantial period of time and that anything relating to Mr Barratt's performance should be deferred for one year. But the government could not wait. Or was it the government? Who were playing in the background to get rid of Mr Barratt who, on the surface, was doing a good job in a very difficult portfolio, in trying to manage the defence reform program as well as a number of other programs and other issues that were put on his plate by this government?
According to Mr Moore-Wilton's affidavit, the aide-memoire went on to say:
The Prime Minister said: ""I want time to consider your whole report. I left with him a copy of my aide memoire which he returned to me on 4 March with the annotation on it that appears on Annexure B. It reads:
""As discussed with Mr Moore-Wilton"". In communications between the Prime Minister and myself such an annotation indicates his general agreement with the document.
So there was general agreement with the document that had been supplied by Mr Moore-Wilton. On 19 and 20 March, Mr Moore-Wilton went on tell a number of secretaries of departments at a meeting:
The outcome of the review is that the Prime Minister determined that there would be no changes at the present time, and no minister is seeking the replacement of his current secretary.
So there was vindication for the position of Mr Barratt remaining as the secretary to the department. Yet what we have are enormous costs now being accumulated and disruption to the department as a result of what this government has done.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Department of Defence: Secretary</title>,Questions Without Notice,19,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,1999-08-26,"—I think it is important for the Senate to remind itself that some of these matters are still to be determined. I think it inappropriate and inopportune for Senator Hogg and others to make some of the comments that they have.
Senator Hogg interjecting—
—Order, Senator Hogg!
—Suffice it to say that, if the Labor Party wants to come into this chamber talking about procedural fairness, it might seek to cast its mind back to when Con Sciacca was a federal minister in the previous Labor government. Because who was the first federal parliamentarian to be stung with an unfair dismissal case? It was a Labor minister, who had voted for the legislation and who had pursued the legislation and said it was good. Who was the first parliamentarian to fall foul of it but a Labor minister from the home state of Senator Hogg. I would suggest to Senator Hogg that, if he wants to undermine Mr Sciacca, he ought to be a bit more subtle about it.
Most people can see through this. He undoubtedly knew, in raising this issue, that we on this side would remind the Labor Party of their employment history of personnel whilst they were in government. Let me just remind the Labor Party that, if they want to talk about procedural fairness and other matters of that nature, they may well keep in mind their own record and the record of their previous ministers.
—This is secretaries to departments, Senator.
—Oh! Somehow it is different if it is not your own personal employee. My goodness, Senator Hogg, you would not want to tell your union mates that.
—Would you like to address the chair, please, Senator Abetz.
—Madam Deputy President, I would be delighted to address the chair on this matter. But, of course, when I am provoked by injections from Senator Hogg, I do stray from time to time from the standing orders. What Senator Hogg has also done in this motion and with the comments that he has made is tip a bucket over a former Labor Minister for Defence, Mr Bill Morrison, who appeared on TV and radio and basically said that it ought to be the right of any minister to dismiss the head of his particular department.
So it is quite interesting what this exercise seems to be about. It seems to be about 
 Senator Hogg and some of his Labor colleagues wanting to embarrass some of his colleagues and former colleagues rather than come to what is fundamentally the issue here, and that is: who runs a government; who should run a department? We are elected to do that. The minister is appointed in this particular circumstance to do that, and it is appropriate for the minister to take charge of his department and require certain standards. That was a call that the government made, and the government does not withdraw from that. However, the government will abide by any Federal Court decision that is made—indeed, that has been made. As I understand it, Mr Barrett has been given even extra time to put his response. I believe the government has behaved in a manner which is appropriate.
I simply suggest to Senator Hogg, Senator Ludwig and those who would seek to ask questions about this that it is a bit too early to start asking all these questions. Let us see what the ultimate outcome is. Surely the outcome we would all want for this nation is for Defence to be run in a manner which is appropriate.
—No-one's running it.
—I know the Labor Party is not running Defence, but I can assure you there is one very competent minister, there is one very competent assistant minister, there is one very competent CDF and others involved in running the department and in running the forces. It is business as usual in relation to matters of defence.
The Labor Party do themselves no credit in trying to remind us of the sort of unfair dismissal cases that they themselves faced when they were in government, such as that of Senator Hogg's and Senator Ludwig's colleague from Queensland, Mr Sciacca.

"Quirke, Sen John",ALP,1999-08-26,"—I have to say that the Liberal Party is an amazing machine. We were just told a minute ago that there is one competent minister—in fact, there are probably a few more than that. But Senator Abetz is much more adept on his feet than the minister that leads the government. When this question was asked today, in view of the prominence that 
 this issue has had in the media in the last couple of weeks I would have thought there would have been a briefing note there and that Senator Hill would have come in and answered the question. You have to give it to Senator Abetz. Three-quarters of an hour later he is down here with the dirt file open. You have to give it to him. He is right into it. Senator Abetz is one of those great performers in this place. He is straight down here. And what does he want to do? Does he want to take up the issue? Does he want to say that this is costing the taxpayers and probably has already cost the taxpayers a lot of money. Not a word of it. No, Senator Abetz wants to rake through the files and find out if someone has ever been sacked before.
I have to say to Senator Abetz and to the Senate that this is a government that is proving to be absolutely incompetent at sacking anyone. I remember last year when the Prime Minister was patting Mr Reith—the minister for employment or whatever he calls himself—on the back, because they had managed to sack 5,000 workers on the wharves in this country. He was patting him on the back, saying what a good job he had done. Unfortunately, he had not done as good a job as he thought he had done. He had not done a good job at all, because in fact the courts found, 10 Federal Court judges to one—and I could make some comment about that one dissenting judgment but I will not—that it was incompetently done. So I would have thought that this government would have at least learnt how to deal with one of its top bureaucrats. Not a bit of it. This government does not learn.
What happened was that Mr Barrett—and I will come to Mr Barrett's sins in the moment—was sacked. He got a phone call from Mr Max Moore-Wilton, better known around here as—and I think even the Minister for Justice from this chamber called him this—Max the axe. He told Mr Barrett that his services were no longer required but that possibly some overseas posting could be found for him, because this fellow was in fact enticed into the service, as I understand it—he was a friend of the Prime Minister, and the Prime Minister had asked him to come into 
 the service. So they wanted him to go out with second or third prize. Mr Barrett, as I understand it, made a few counter offers which were not acceptable. The United States is open now. I do not know whether that is a possibility or not. During this week, we have found out that the United States will be available early next year. It may well be that that could be done.
But I must say that one of the roasted chestnuts that I have tasted in this place was the comment by Minister Hill this afternoon that he did not know how much, if anything at all, all this legal stuff is going to cost. I reckon that a member ought to go down and consult the registry of charities in the state of New South Wales and find out if Mr Bob Ellicott and Mr Tom Hughes—both QCs—are on that register. I somehow or other doubt that. I doubt that they are registered as charities. I also doubt that all the money that is going to be paid to them is going to wind up back in taxation to the government. If it does, it is a rather unique job creation scheme.
—That is a slur on their characters.
Senator Lightfoot interjecting—
—You will get your turn, Senator, in a moment. At the end of the day, both of those QCs are doing their job and doing it for a fee. I have no argument with that, Senator. They have done a good job, a competent job and an excellent job for Mr Barratt. If you want to say anything other than that, I will not say it. But they are not going to be doing this for nothing—and neither should they. Indeed, what we were told here today—
—What about paying their taxes?
—I do not know about their tax arrangements; I have no idea, Senator. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Department of Defence: Secretary</title>,Questions Without Notice,19,1,speech
"Lightfoot, Sen Phillip",LP,1999-08-26,"—I want to respond particularly to my friend Senator Quirke and, of course, to Senator Hogg on the issue before us this afternoon. Senator Quirke seems to be preoccupied with how much the legal costs are going to be to the government and the taxpay 
 er with respect to defending the action by Mr Barratt. Whatever the federal High Court decision is—or whatever even more superior courts' decisions are—those costs will be met along the lines of what the courts direct. The government intends to abide by every aspect of the court decisions.
I look at what is perhaps part of the problem associated with Mr Barratt—and I am only speculating here, I hasten to say. When I look at costs—when my friend Senator Quirke speaks about legal costs—they are an infinitesimal part of those costs associated with the submarine project, the project designed to bring the then Labor state of South Australia out of its doldrums. We have a rule in this place and in the other place that we do not generally talk about governments' ineptitude with respect to our defence. But just in a generic way I must say that the submarine project is going to prove to be—made so by the former Labor government and by the now Leader of the Opposition in the other place—one of the costliest defence projects in the world, in terms of what we will get.
I do not think the opposition has any right, moral or otherwise, to criticise this government for doing what it can to ensure that the people of Australia have a properly functioning defence department. If the Secretary of Defence was deemed in the proper manner not to be suitable, under the guidelines he had to go.
Let me say that my friend Senator Quirke also said that he thought there would be a briefing note in here today. We did not know what every question was going to be but we just happened to have a briefing note. That procedure with respect to the dismissal of Mr Barratt was followed meticulously. It was followed as for a complex appointment. It is not a simple appointment of `Come in, have a look, see if you like it; and we will sign you on.' It is not that, and you on the other side know that it is not that.
You know that a departmental secretary is appointed by the Governor-General for a fixed term of up to five years and that the Prime Minister and the Public Service Commissioner determine those terms and conditions of appointment under the Public Service Act of 
 1922. The Remuneration Tribunal determines the salary and allowances under the Remuneration Tribunal Act of 1973. That was followed meticulously. The Governor-General, however, may direct that an appointment be terminated following advice from the Prime Minister. That was followed meticulously, based upon a report to the Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet—or, in this case, with Mr Barratt—following a report from the Public Service Commissioner. All of that was followed meticulously.
There is no suggestion in your argument this afternoon that that was not done. There is no suggestion that, with respect to severance pay, that was wrong. The tribunal has a long-standing and applicable determination that provides compensation when a fixed term appointment is prematurely terminated.
—Tell us why.
—The termination provides, Senator, for one-third of a month's salary for each full month of the balance of the fixed term not served, and it is subject to a maximum payment of 12 months salary. Were the determination to be applied to Mr Barratt's circumstances, it would result in a payout of one year's base salary—that is, $250,000—as he has served less than two years of his term, because he was appointed, as I recall, on 31 December 1997.
There is no suggestion that that was not followed meticulously. I think that, just like you have with the Federation Fund and like you have with your silly questions this afternoon, trying to draw out 16 allocations of funds that were for the betterment of Australia, you have drawn here a loser again. You are losing again. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Department of Defence: Secretary</title>,Questions Without Notice,19,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,1999-08-26,"—The government is still trying to sack Barratt after some five weeks.
—`Mr' Barratt—
—Mr Barratt, if you prefer; but from the way that you have been treating him—
Senator Carr interjecting—
Senator Lightfoot interjecting—
—Order!
—It is a matter that started when you put him on in February 1998 for five years. At the rate that you are going in trying to get rid of him, it will be another five years. If we look at what you are trying to do, you are trying dismiss him. There are procedures that you could follow. Senator Lightfoot has alluded to procedures that were followed, but the court apparently does not agree. The court found that Mr Barratt was entitled to procedural fairness. The government, on the other hand, argued—and they argued, I suspect, with all the legal finesse they were able to muster—that they could sack him at their pleasure.
—No. That was never it.
—We can take you to the briefing note. I am happy to provide that. It seems that the approach that this government wish to take in respect of dismissals is that they want to be able to dismiss people at their pleasure. A departmental head or a hard-working public servant might also fall under that. But we still find them today bungling that attempt. They have not even managed to do it. The courts have upheld fairness and justice. It does not, in our view, augur well for the effective administration of the Department of Defence. No doubt the minister is finding it difficult to find a replacement. With the record that he has got around his neck, you would expect that there would not be too many starters, unless they have got a bullet-proof vest on.
This silly fiasco, which has gone on for quite some time, needs to come to a conclusion. Mr Barratt in his previous job was head of the Business Council in Melbourne, and he was recruited to the Public Service at a much later date. Now he might be able to turn his mind to supporting Labor in ensuring fairness from the Industrial Relations Commission with respect to dismissals so that justice can prevail. Not only did you argue that you could dismiss him at your pleasure but also, when the court did not agree with you, you tried to say that the costs do not follow the event, that Mr Barratt is not entitled to costs. You tried to argue that he should mind his own costs and that you would look after 
 yours. At a time when the defence department needs careful and considered decision making, needs certainty and needs good information in its hands, there is no-one in the top job. This continuing squabbling is not providing any certainty for Defence.
What is even more surprising is that Mr Barratt got a pay rise in March of the order of $40,000, as reported in the Sun-Herald of 1 August 1999. Things must have slid downhill pretty quickly—
—You are wrong.
—You can go to the Sun-Herald  of 1 August 1999 and read it for yourself. Mr Barratt had indicated in July his view that everything was going well. There must have been a very fine line between things going very well and things going very badly. What is appalling, in truth, when you stand back and look at this sorry mess, is that the important issues are not being concentrated on, important issues on which the minister has abrogated his responsibilities. No-one is at the helm of the ship and there is plenty of work that needs to be done, like replacing destroyers and fixing the F111s.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,1999-08-26,"—Many honourable senators who have participated over recent years in inquiries into the Department of Defence or aspects involving the Department of Defence would no doubt have been, like me, very concerned that they did not perhaps get the direct answers that they were looking for. Answers have often been evasive, obscure, irrelevant, voluminous and not to the point. So it is not surprising that the minister has obviously found certain difficulty with his CEO. We acknowledge that Mr Barratt has been recruited from the private sector. Defence is such an important department of state that we had to have a man from a civilian point of view oversighting that and administering it who can get on top of the issues and run the department successfully in the best interests of this country. Quite obviously problems arose because the performance was not up to Minister Moore's high standards. We were not getting the improvements, we were not getting the responses and we were not getting 
 the action that was required, and under the circumstances termination is the only way out.
Questions have arisen as to procedural fairness. This particular gentleman is paid an exceedingly high amount of money. In that package are built-in arrangements for extra payment for issues such as—
—Performance.
—I will take that comment, because that report on performance pay is not correct. He did not receive that amount, and I think that should be put to rest. Under the Public Service Act, a secretary's appointment can be terminated at any time by the Governor-General on advice from the Prime Minister following a report from the secretary to the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. He knew that when he signed the contract and he was amply rewarded. That was a risk he took. There are a lot of CEOs who sign similar arrangements, because these fixed term contracts are very common not only in the public sector but in the private sector nowadays.
I point out to the opposition that successive governments have understood the legal position to be that natural justice does not apply to such determinations. Prima facie, you may say that that is quite unfair, but, in recognition of such limited tenure and similar issues, secretaries receive a 20 per cent loading, which is now rolled into their base pay. It is quite generous and is something that you and I do not get. There is also an entitlement to a lump sum termination equivalent to one-third of the unexpired period of their term of employment up to a maximum of 12 months pay.
For the benefit of honourable senators, I point out that these secretaries are currently employed for terms of up to five years. This is one of a number of fundamental changes to tenure arrangements for secretaries which were made by the previous government, your government, in the years 1984 to 1994. The previous government has also removed secretaries as and when that government chose. The departures of Mr Ron Brown and Mr Graham Evans were quite controversial, as was the resignation of Mr Mike Codd, a great secretary who did much to reform the public 
 sector when secretary to the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, when Mr Keating succeeded Mr Hawke. I think that is noteworthy.
As I have so few minutes left, I think I should state that the government intends to fully abide by the decision of the Federal Court. The government itself has not made its decision. The secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has actually written to Mr Barratt outlining the reasons for his dismissal. The Secretary to Prime Minister and Cabinet still awaits, I understand, Mr Barratt's response. I have every confidence that Mr Barratt will be extended complete fairness in the terms of the contract, which is not dissimilar to the contracts which you arranged. (Time expired)

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-08-26,"—Mr Acting Deputy President, I was very quick to spring to my feet. We seem to be racing through these reports and I did not want this matter to leave the Notice Paper  without having the opportunity to speak to it. Senators may recall that the motion relates to a supplementary estimates report from the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. This matter was the subject of considerable debate during the truncated debate we had on the financial bills that were dealt with at the end of the last session. As a result, senators on this side were not able to give their full attention to all of the matters that arose from those estimates.
It is rather sad to see that the chair of the committee, Senator Crane, has made recommendations arising from that estimates process 
 to the Procedure Committee which, it seems to me, would have the effect of limiting the ability of the estimates committee to inquire into the operations of departments. We pointed out in the debate that one of the suggestions was that you could not refer to any matter that was not contained within the financial year of the subject of the portfolio budget statement. As I understand Senator Crane's position, you could not ask for material which would give the Senate and therefore the community a reference point from the past against which the performance of the department, and indeed the government, could be made at that time.
There is also what I consider to be the potentially ridiculous outcome for certain questions we asked about the financial planning of the department during the financial year. The import of the answers that we received was that perhaps all of that information would not be fully known until, in effect, the end of the financial year, which would have meant that it would only really have been available to us in estimates of the financial year following. If one followed the proposal from the chairman, we would then not have been able to ask questions about the matter that the department could not answer during the current financial year because in next financial year's portfolio budget statement we would be referring to the previous financial year.
As I understand the import of Senator Crane's proposal, we would be out of time to ask the questions. I suppose that would give the department—I am not saying that they would seek to do this—the opportunity to stonewall on the provision of information and then, if the chair's proposal is accepted, a rule would be applied which would prevent us from gaining the information through the estimates process that we had been denied because the department was not able or willing to provide during the currency of the financial year the subject of the portfolio budget statement which was before the committee.
So there were issues which were sought to be canvassed during that estimates process which I and Senator Mackay dealt with in the 
 appropriations debate. I refer senators to the comments that we made then which indicated that the minister at the table, Senator Macdonald, was not prepared to provide information. Frankly, he did not do himself any service in the way he handled his role in the committee and attracted so much adverse comment.
I have been waiting for some time for Senator Macdonald to come into this chamber and in fact challenge what was said. These comments that I am referring to were made at the end of June and we are now approaching the end of August. There has been a considerable amount of time during which Senator Macdonald could have come in here and put his point of view on the matter. There have been a great many adjournment opportunities and other opportunities, but he has not taken them. The only conclusion one can reach is that he does not have anything to put which would contradict the matters which were put on the record by me and Senator Mackay.
Here we have, firstly, an estimates process which was totally unsatisfactory to the opposition because of the behaviour of the minister at the table and, secondly, a proposal by the chair of the committee, Senator Crane, to limit the opportunities of the estimates process in this area in the future. That would be an even worse outcome from the point of view of this opposition, and I suppose I should remind the government that no government remains in power forever. It would also be a matter which would impact upon their ability to scrutinise a future Labor government—and there will be one. However cocky the government are about their position, they would have to realise that governments change; governments become oppositions and oppositions become governments. So it is a very short-sighted approach by the government to try to change the rules in such a way as to limit the effectiveness of the estimates process.
There are other matters that are raised at estimates and some government senators question whether they should be raised there. They are questions which I know I have asked and which, for example, Senator Collins has asked this committee relating to perform 
 ances of government departments and statutory authorities on particular issues.
I have asked questions of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and that has been a matter of public comment recently, particularly about the appointment of a relatively highly paid officer. The questions I asked about the appointment of Mr Foley have led to an inquiry by the board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. I must say that it is an inquiry into themselves—and that is not satisfactory—but, nevertheless, it is an inquiry, and Mr Foley has stood aside from his position while that has been taking place. We have also, as I understand it, had some comments by Minister Anderson which indicate that he is viewing the circumstances of the matter very seriously.
If the estimates process were limited in the way that I understand it is suggested by Senator Crane's proposals, we would not have been able to deal with that matter. I think that would lead to a lack of accountability by the authority and a restriction of the process which demonstrably achieves accountability.
I have a constituent in Tasmania whose husband was killed arguably as a result of some inaction. I am reluctant to ascribe the word `negligence' to it because the matter is the subject of legal proceedings, but the rights of my constituent have been assisted by pursuing through the estimates process the incident which caused the death of her husband. Obtaining on the public record information which, in most likelihood, would never have been made public is a matter of accountability of a government authority, and that has been achieved through the estimates process. It is a matter of accountability which will possibly lead to a member of the public obtaining redress through the legal system—redress which would not otherwise have been able to have been pursued. I think this matter should remain on the Notice Paper, so I seek leave to continue my remarks.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-08-26,"—I would like to speak briefly to this report of the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee, a committee chaired by my Democrat colleague Senator Allison. This is quite a significant report, and I rise to speak on it mainly to try to emphasise the significance and importance of it. Many times in this chamber we are overwhelmed by paper, reports, responses, documents and all sorts of things. At this time of the week, when we are going through them all at a great rate of knots, it demonstrates how many different types of reports and documents there are around, and often some of the very significant ones can get a little lost amongst the crush. So I think it is important to single this one out as being a significant report on a significant issue.
For many years, the Democrats have called for a stronger and more coherent approach on environmental issues at the national level. In the Democrats' view, environment issues are too significant to be left to the vagaries of individual state or local government regimes. That does not mean there is no role for state or local governments—indeed there is a crucial role, particularly for local government, in my view—to ensure that there is better environmental protection. There was an example in the speech I gave in this place yesterday in relation to the Gold Coast City Council and an issue they were facing which had quite significant environmental impacts. But it does need, and we do need, in the Democrats' view, a stronger and more coherent overall set of uniform national standards, a more clearly identifiable set of powers and powers that are strong enough to be able to be used easily, clearly and effectively so that the very significant environmental obligations our 
 country has are met. This committee report, which came at the end of a fairly comprehensive and significant investigation of the issues, does go into that in a significant degree of detail and it provides some very good recommendations.
It was coincidental but nonetheless quite relevant and symbolic, if you like, that not long after this report was tabled the Senate considered and passed the Environment Protection Biodiversity and Conservation Bill, a bill of some controversy. But one of the key aspects of that bill and of the changes that were made to it—with the amendments that the Democrats achieved in getting passed—was to ensure that there was not a weakening of Commonwealth environment powers. There is some dispute about that amongst some people, but the Democrats are of a belief that we have managed to achieve that. Obviously, we will see, as the act comes into operation and starts being utilised, whether we are accurate in that belief. Certainly, we believe that is the case. It is something we paid a lot of attention to.
It is not simply a matter of saying, `The Commonwealth is good and the states are bad.' I think that is a trap and a piece of rhetoric that people often fall into. I have probably been guilty of it myself. Coming from Queensland and having endured many years of National Party government, it is probably not surprising that I have a bit of an aversion to giving too much power to state governments. Clearly, any sorts of government at state and federal levels can be good or bad, and there is nothing necessarily inherently better about either level. What is important is that there is a clear set of uniform standards and a usable set of legislative powers. That is not to cut the states out of their role. We believe that balance was achieved with the amendments made to the Environment Protection Biodiversity Conservation Bill. Most important, and where it jells with this report, is the ability, with that bill being passed, for ongoing work and improvements. The Democrats certainly do not believe that we now have the perfect act, that everything is fine; we think there is a hell of a lot of room for improvement still. But the 
 framework is now in place for more effective improvements to be built on the foundation that is there in a much easier way than using the various disconnected acts that were in place or that currently exist that will be replaced by the new act when it comes into force next year.
We have moved some way down the track. This report, in broader terms, talks about why it is important that we do move further down that track. There are recommendations about how to do that and what sorts of definitions and boundaries of Commonwealth environment powers we need to have. I think it is an area that needs specific attention. The Democrats—as all people would now be aware—have moved into a stronger position in the balance of power in this chamber than we have had for a few years. Certainly, as the party's environment spokesperson, I am very keen to ensure that we use our position in that balance of power, where we are able to—
—You don't have the balance of power; you are in coalition with the government,
—to ensure that environmental issues are put back much more at the top of the political agenda than they have been in recent years under both the coalition government and also under the previous Labor Party government whose record on environmental issues—despite the great green credentials of people such as Senator Conroy, well-known tree saver that he is—nonetheless had a lot of room for improvement. The Democrats are very keen to use our role now with the balance of power to ensure that environmental issues are put much more on centre stage. We hope that we will be able to do that. I urge people to examine this report, because it is an important one. For that reason as well, I think it appropriate that it stays on the Notice Paper , so I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later date.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-08-26,"—I would like to speak briefly to this report of the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee, a committee chaired by my Democrat colleague Senator Allison. This is quite a significant report, and I rise to speak on it mainly to try to emphasise the significance and importance of it. Many times in this chamber we are overwhelmed by paper, reports, responses, documents and all sorts of things. At this time of the week, when we are going through them all at a great rate of knots, it demonstrates how many different types of reports and documents there are around, and often some of the very significant ones can get a little lost amongst the crush. So I think it is important to single this one out as being a significant report on a significant issue.
For many years, the Democrats have called for a stronger and more coherent approach on environmental issues at the national level. In the Democrats' view, environment issues are too significant to be left to the vagaries of individual state or local government regimes. That does not mean there is no role for state or local governments—indeed there is a crucial role, particularly for local government, in my view—to ensure that there is better environmental protection. There was an example in the speech I gave in this place yesterday in relation to the Gold Coast City Council and an issue they were facing which had quite significant environmental impacts. But it does need, and we do need, in the Democrats' view, a stronger and more coherent overall set of uniform national standards, a more clearly identifiable set of powers and powers that are strong enough to be able to be used easily, clearly and effectively so that the very significant environmental obligations our 
 country has are met. This committee report, which came at the end of a fairly comprehensive and significant investigation of the issues, does go into that in a significant degree of detail and it provides some very good recommendations.

"Tchen, Sen Tsebin",LP,1999-08-26,"—On this day the Senate considered and passed a resolution affirming a wholehearted commitment on behalf of the national community to a process of reconciliation between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. This resolution was sponsored by Senator Hill on 
 behalf of the coalition parties and by Senator Ridgeway on behalf of the Australian Democrats. On this same day the House of Representatives passed the same resolution sponsored by the Prime Minister.
During the debate on the motion, a number of senators took advantage of the opportunity to express their views about it. In the interests of time, I did not seek to address the Senate at that time. However, insofar as Senator Ridgeway may be said to be a representative of the first peoples of Australia in this Senate, I may claim to have the role of a representative of the new peoples of this country. Therefore I would like, even though this matter has already passed and is established, to take this opportunity to put on record—on behalf of those Australians who became Australian by choice and those many more who will in future generations come to Australia and become Australian by choice—our support for the resolution and the process of reconciliation that it promotes.
I would also like to place on record the appropriateness and correctness, in our view, of the words and composition of the resolution, because it recognises a past history of injustice without being preoccupied by particular instances of injustice. Instead it focuses on the process of healing by which we as a nation must go forward. That this motion came at the right time is demonstrated by the senators from the various parties, representing all the people of Australia, who supported it. I note that, for example, Senator Boswell from the National Party, speaking on behalf of the bush, supported it. Of course, Senator Hill, who sponsored it, supported it. Senator Harradine supported it. Senator Harris, on behalf of One Nation, also supported it. I believe that this resolution, coming at such a time, reflects the national mood.
Having said that, I wish to place on record my immense disappointment with the way that the Australian Labor Party failed to adhere to the spirit of this proposal and sought to create further division by insisting on changes to certain wordings in the resolution. I note that Senator Ridgeway, in his speech proposing this motion, stressed that this should be a healing process and not 
 politics—reflecting a sentiment by Dr Lowitja O'Donoghue that it should be a healing process and that politics should be out of it. And yet, as I said, I was intensely disappointed that the Labor Party chose to make a political issue out of it.
I wish that the Labor Party senators had been present in the house late yesterday afternoon to listen to the speech by Senator Mason—just preceding the first speech of Senator Ridgeway—which is perhaps the best reflection there could be of the mood of the nation in seeking reconciliation. I take this opportunity to commend Senator Mason on his words. I think that is all I need to say on this issue, having put my feelings on record.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders: Reconciliation </title>,Adjournment,29,1,speech
