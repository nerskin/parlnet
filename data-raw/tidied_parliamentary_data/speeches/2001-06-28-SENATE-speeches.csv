"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-06-28,"—Pursuant to contingent notice, I move:
That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Brown moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion no. 963. 
I do that because I do not think anyone in this place could say that this is not an urgent matter. Port Moresby has been paralysed by the protests over the last six days. There has been a curfew and three students have been shot dead. We need to be aware of what is happening in the capital city of this neighbouring country which very much depends on Australia for its wellbeing and which is now racked by the imposition by international monetary authorities of a program that includes broadscale privatisation of assets in Papua New Guinea. It is quite different to the democratic system in Australia where there is redress for this sort of thing. It has to be understood that in Papua New Guinea, as in so many poorer countries, the imposition is from outside and it rolls over the top of the democratic system of that country.
You will note, Madam President, that my motion, besides expressing deep sadness and concern at the death of the students—and I understand from news reports that students will be bringing forward evidence today about the police involvement in the death of those students—and while recognising the right of Papua New Guinea to plan its future without selling its major assets, also puts forward a positive alternative. Part (c) of the motion calls on the international funding and banking agencies to aid PNG's debt repayments by requiring foreign logging, mining, fishing and tourism companies, including BHP, for example, to pay a fair and adequate royalty for their exploitation of this small, but beautiful, nation's resources. This is the classic case of a poor country having its resources extracted and the management of its affairs being taken over basically by multinational forces, including private corporations, beyond its control. 
What is happening in the logging of Papua New Guinea forests and mangroves by huge corporations, including Chevron from the United States, is totally reprehensible. The return to the Papua New Guinea people is not commensurate with the damage being done to their environment. Just two days ago we had a delegation, including an elected MP from the Fly River district, talking about the extraordinary environmental damage caused by the Ok Tedi mine which, through cyanide and taling spillage into that river system, has caused the death of that system for tens, if not hundreds, of kilometres. Because of the silting of the river, there is flooding of the riverside areas where the crops are grown by the indigenous people, the loss of those crop lands and the forced migration of those people. They did not ask for that. They are not being compensated for that. They have not become rich over that. It is deplorable behaviour by BHP and other corporations from outside. They would not be allowed to practise that sort of environmental and social dislocation in this country. But they go to a Third World country and become a law unto themselves—and this motion draws attention to that. 
The motion should be debated. Papua New Guinea is in uproar. The students are representing a different point of view. The young people of Papua New Guinea are saying, `We don't want everything going into foreign hands, out of our control, under this international capital system.' I urge the Senate to vote for this debate, seeing formality has been blocked by the Labor Party. Change the motion, if you will, but take notice of the fact that there are horrific events occurring in Papua New Guinea, and we should not ignore them.

"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2001-06-28,"—I present the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities on the provisions of the Corporate Code of Conduct Bill 2000, together with the Hansard record of the committee's proceedings and documents presented to the committee. I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
In moving the motion, I briefly state that, while the committee in no way endorses inappropriate behaviour on the part of Australian corporations, the evidence before the committee in relation to alleged inappropriate corporate behaviour invariably concerned only a couple of incidents and there was no evidence of systemic failure. Therefore, the committee concludes that there is no demonstrated need for the bill and, indeed, the bill could well do more harm than good. On that basis, we have recommended that the bill not be passed. I thank my committee staff, David Creed and his staff, for their work on this inquiry and in relation to our report on the bill, and I seek leave to incorporate my tabling statement.
Leave granted.
The tabling statement read as follows—
On 6 September 2000 Senator Vicki Bourne introduced the Corporate Code of Conduct Bill 2000 into the Senate.  On 5 October 2000 the Senate referred the provisions of the Bill to the Parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities for inquiry and report by 31 March 2001. 
The Committee resolved that the reporting date be extended so that the Committee could have additional public hearings and thus as many persons as possible would have the opportunity of testifying before the Committee.  The Senate agreed to this course of action, and therefore it is today that I am tabling the Committee's report.  
The Committee received 43 submissions in relation to the inquiry, many from major stakeholders.  Industry bodies that made submissions included the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia and the Victorian Chamber of Mines.  Individual companies, such as BHP Limited, also made submissions.  Submittors, whose primary concern was human rights, included Amnesty International Australia, the FairWear Campaign, the Minerals Policy Institute and World Vision Australia.  Submittors whose focus was primarily on the rights of employees included the Australian Council of Trade Unions.
In addition to these submissions, submissions were also received from other key organisations and individuals.  The Committee is very grateful to those who took the time and trouble to make very detailed and helpful submissions.  The Committee, without detracting from other submissions, endorses a comment made by Senator Murray during the public hearings on the Bill, to the effect that the submissions from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and Community Aid Abroad were of particular assistance to the Committee because they contained “detailed commentary” on shortcomings in the Bill.
The Committee also endorses Senator Murray's statement regarding the usefulness of the “positive” criticisms of a submitter such as Mr Sean Cooney.  Positive criticisms are always helpful in devising ways to remedy deficiencies in proposed legislation.
The Committee held three day of public hearings.  Forty individuals representing a wide variety of groups and organisations appeared before the Committee during these hearings.  The Committee is very grateful to these persons who so generously made themselves available to testify before the Committee.  These witnesses represented a wide variety of views and I therefore believe that the hearings were not only very comprehensive, but they also presented to the Committee a range of views on the Bill which the Committee found most useful in drafting its report.
The first issue on which the Report makes a conclusion is the 100 employee threshold.  The Bill would apply only to “Australian corporations or related corporations which employ more than 100 persons in a foreign country”.  Several submitters and witnesses suggested lowering this 100 employee threshold, thus increasing the number of corporate entities that would be subject to regulation by the Bill.
The Committee disagrees with those who suggested lowering the employee threshold.  Indeed the Committee found that even the 100 employee threshold would result in so many companies being subject to the provisions of the Bill that, given our scepticism about the benefits of the Bill, it would constitute an unacceptable “burden” for regulators.  The Committee therefore concludes that the regulatory regime the Bill would create would be unworkable.
With regard to the Bill's requirement that corporations “take all reasonable measures to prevent any serious threat to public health”, the Committee noted that the Bill does not apply to all Australian corporations operating overseas, but only to those with more than 100 employees.  The Committee finds it unacceptable that any legislation should imply that only certain corporations should refrain from threatening public health.
Moreover, the Committee believes that this part of the Bill is unnecessary as Common Law rights relating to negligence would already allow foreign litigants in most circumstances to sue in Australian courts for damage suffered from negligent behaviour.  The Committee considers it unwise to interfere with these Common Law rights.
The Bill, as has been said, would regulate Australian corporations with over 100 employees overseas.  It would also seek to regulate a holding company of such a corporation even though such a holding company may not be an Australian corporate entity.  The Bill would therefore seek to regulate, for example, as one witness noted, America's General Motors.  This would simply be unworkable.
The Bill would impose “environmental, employment, health and safety and human rights standards” on Australian corporations with 100 employees overseas.  The Committee notes that the Parliament has enacted legislation with extraterritorial application but the Committee also notes that such legislation was very focused while the current Bill is general and extremely broad.
The Committee concludes that the Bill is so generic as to be vague to the point of being unenforceable.  One example is the requirement that corporations provide their employees with, and I quote from subclause 8(2) of the Bill, “satisfactory sanitary conditions”. The Committee is aware that regulations may be made under clause 18 of the Bill, which may define what is meant by “satisfactory”.  Nevertheless, the Committee finds itself unable to recommend a Bill, the provisions of which are so vague as to cause considerable uncertainty to industry.
The Bill would require an Australian corporation to pay its workers a “living wage”.  The difficulties in determining what constitutes a “living wage” in all the countries in which an Australian may operate would involve that corporation in considerable expense and there would be no certainty, despite a corporation's best efforts, that, in the event of litigation, an Australian court would find that it had been paying its workers a “living wage”.  Australian corporations would therefore always operate under the threat of litigation.
The Committee therefore concludes that the Bill's requirement that a corporation determine a “living wage” in all of the jurisdictions in which it operates is unreasonable and impractical.
The Bill, at clause 10, would require Australian corporations operating overseas to avoid discriminating in its employment practices on the basis of race, colour, sex, sexuality, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin.
The Committee in no way endorses discrimination, but clearly this section of the Bill could force Australian corporations to choose between hiring persons belonging to organisations deemed illegal in the jurisdictions in which they operate, or else face litigation in Australian courts.  The Committee finds itself unable to recommend a Bill that would force such an unenviable choice on Australian companies.
Clause 11 of the Bill requires Australian corporations to obey the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate.  The Committee in no way condones tax evasion.  However, the Committee considers it inappropriate for the Australian Parliament to enact laws requiring Australian corporations to obey the laws of foreign jurisdictions.  
Clause 12 of the Bill requires Australian corporations, producing goods and services overseas, to simultaneously satisfy both Australian health and safety standards, and the health and safety standards of the jurisdiction in which they operate.  In practice, the standards of Australian and the foreign jurisdiction may be mutually exclusive and thus this section may be unworkable. 
Subclause 13 of the Bill requires that Australian corporations operating overseas refrain from “misleading or deceptive” conduct.  Considering the vast amount of litigation that a similar section in the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) has inspired in Australia, the Committee is concerned that Australian courts may be swamped by corporations bringing actions against each other.  The Committee is not convinced that such litigation would be productive.
With regard to the Bill's reporting requirements, the Committee acknowledges that reporting may be an essential part of ensuring compliance with some laws. The Committee notes advice from the Australian Institute of Corporate Citizenship that reports produced by corporations should be publicised, since publicity “encourages continuous improvement”.  The Committee concludes, however, that the reporting requirements required by the Bill would be both onerous and expensive. 
The Committee concludes that the reporting requirements of the Bill are unwieldy to the point of being impossible to implement without significant costs being incurred by both corporations and the regulator.  The Committee finds that any benefits to be derived from the reporting regime would not compensate for the loss suffered due to the imposition of associated costs.
The Bill would allow civil penalties to be imposed for non-compliance with the Bill.  These penalties differ from those specified in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth), even where the offences are similar.  The Committee is unable to discern any rationale for this and concludes that enacting the Bill would lead to unwarranted confusion in the corporate world.
Various submitters and witnesses stated that the status quo was unacceptable because it was tantamount to allowing Australian corporations overseas to degrade the environment and abuse the rights of foreign workers.  
The Committee in no way endorses inappropriate behaviour on the part on Australian corporations.  The Committee notes, however, that the evidence of inappropriate corporate behaviour that was presented to it almost invariably concerned the same couple of incidents.  No evidence was presented of systemic failure and thus the Committee concludes that there is no demonstrated need for the current Bill.  Indeed, the Committee concludes that enacting the current Bill may be seen abroad as a suggestion that the laws of other nations are deficient.  Any such suggestion may harm Australia's reputation.
The Committee therefore concludes that the Bill is not only largely superfluous from the viewpoint of protecting the environment and enhancing the conditions of foreign workers, but also has a very real potential for offending foreign nations.  The Committee therefore recommends that the Bill not be passed because it is unnecessary and unworkable.
I commend the Report to all honourable Senators.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE CODE OF CONDUCT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Report of Corporations and Securities Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-06-28,"—I have some brief remarks to make on this report. However, if the Senate so wished, I would seek to incorporate my remarks and save time.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
Evidence gathered during the Committee's inquiry into the Corporate Code of Conduct Bill 2000 indicated that there were both strong supporters and strong opponents of the Bill. 
While some rejected the Bill outright others suggested improvements to the Bill.  
This Bill was always going to be controversial because it introduces a concept that is not universally accepted as requiring legislation. In her second reading speech Senator Vicki Bourne referred to other instances of similar attempts to introduce such legislation, which while seen as inevitable by some, is still being developed. In that respect this Bill was novel and technical difficulties could be expected. 
The inquiry into the Bill allowed valuable discussion of these issues.  
The majority of the Committee concluded that the Bill was unwarranted and unworkable. I agree that amendments are needed, however I reject the notion of abandoning the Bill altogether. 
This Bill is about balancing the drive by Australian Corporations to support globalisation in other economic areas such as copyright laws, capital movements and international tax harmonisation with human rights, environmental safeguards and other measures. 
The majority of the Committee also found that this Bill may be perceived as being paternalistic or arrogant, certainly many presented that point of view in evidence, however I disagree with this judgement as a sweeping generalisation and predicating a uniform viewpoint by foreigners. 
As is the case here in Australia where opinions vary widely, foreigners have as many differing opinions, and many can be expected to view the Bill positively based on its pursuit of universal values.
Indeed evidence from PNG indicated that some Australian companies are perceived to operate with double standards. They employ techniques overseas that they would never use in Australia. 
Ms Koma from the NGO Environment Watch Group in PNG told the committee that 
“It would be very good if a corporate code of conduct was encouraged so that Australian companies working in Papua New Guinea were able to do what they practice overseas in their own country if our legislation is weaker than theirs.”
Greater clarity is required to define the scope of the Bill to ensure that only Australian companies are affected. There are some instances where changes are required to ensure consistency with existing domestic requirements. There are also some definitional problems where the effect could have unforseen impacts. 
However the overall aim of the Bill should not be lost in technical difficulties. This legislation is setting a standard of governance that all Australian companies should be expected to incorporate into their activities. The presence of drafting problems does not detract from its value. 
As my minority report sets out in detail I disagree with the conclusion of the majority of the Committee and I think there is a demonstrated need for this Bill.

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2001-06-28,"—I rise to conclude the second reading debate on a very important piece of legislation. With the Interactive Gambling Bill 2001, the government is taking a stand to prevent the escalation of the harmful effects of gambling on the Australian community. Australia is already a world leader in the problem gambling stakes and, of course, among the number of serious problem gamblers are many of the states of Australia. In 1999, the Productivity Commission found that there were some 290,000 problem gamblers in Australia with 130,000 classified as severe and the likelihood of the introduction of interactive services was regarded as constituting a quantum increase in accessibility.
Other statistics suggest that interactive gambling is the fastest growing web based business in the world. US investment firm Beare-Stern reports in March 2001 that the number of Internet gambling web sites has doubled in the past year from 600 to 700 sites operating last year, to 1,200 to 1,400 in March. This represents two new sites coming online every day. They also estimate that online gambling revenue could grow from $US1.5 billion to $US5 billion over the next two to three years. In fact, I have seen statistics that suggest that 4.5 million Americans have already gambled online and, on any day, over one million Americans already have the habit.
The government is very concerned about the potential for interactive gambling services to increase problem gambling in Australia. While it is a matter for individual countries to decide how they will approach interactive gambling, Australia's status as one of the world's leading problem gambling nations demands that we take decisive action to protect the most vulnerable in the community. It is fair to say that over recent weeks and months there has been enormous public discussion about the ramifications of the government's approach and about precisely what constitutes serious forms of gambling, to what extent they are repetitive and addictive, and to what extent they will exacerbate social misery. We already know from the Productivity Commission that, on average, problem gamblers lose about $12,000 a year. Anyone who saw the 7.30 Report would have seen the devastating tale told by two homeless men who estimated that they had both lost hundreds of thousand of dollars from gambling activities, and they had lost their families as well. There is no doubt that we are looking at not just aquantum increase in accessibility but also a quantum increase in social misery.
We have made some modifications that have recognised that there are degrees of social seriousness in what can occur through interactive technology. Certainly, sports betting or wagering comes into the category of activities in which a lot of people might kid themselves that they have more skill than is demonstrated in the real world—nonetheless, we all live in hope. Many sporting activities do not fall into the mindlessly repetitive category. Similarly, one can draw a significant distinction between products like instant scratchies and keno type activities in which there is a very high turnover and in which you are able sometimes to win but, more often, lose a lot of money in a very short time. Accordingly, the government is prepared to draw those distinctions and to focus on the serious area of social misery, where there are very few redeeming features and where people are almost certain to lose their money. They might win in the short term—I suppose that everyone has had the experience of cracking a jackpot—but, if you stay around for a bit longer, you will normally give it all back. There is no doubt at all that the billions of dollars that are lost from that sort of activity are lost because of the proliferation of mindless and repetitive activity.
That highlights the deathly silence on the part of the Labor Party. We know that Mr Beazley has been soft on drugs. We know that he has not been willing to do anything about pornography and paedophilia on the Internet. And now we have this extraordinary and callous indifference to what is a very serious social problem. In other words, we have weak leadership from the leader of the major opposition party in this country—a pusillanimous performance, one might say. It is because he is too lazy, because the IT nerds have rolled him in the caucus, because basically he does not bother, or because he is simply being opportunistic and he thinks that there might be a few votes out there from standing up for technology. But in the process he is totally ignoring the misery of ordinary Australian families.
I looked at what might be the most appropriate way of characterising Mr Beazley's behaviour, and I agonised long and hard over whether it really constituted sophistry or casuistry. `Sophistry' is the use of false arguments intended to deceive. When we hear Mr Beazley interviewed on this matter, he always avoids the central issue, which is: why on earth do you want to simply sit back and allow an electronic poker machine in every home and every lounge room in the country? He skates around all that and says, `There are inconsistencies, because you are not treating Australians the same way as you are treating the rest of the world,' or, `You are drawing distinctions between this and that.' But he always avoids the central issue: what redeeming features are there in allowing electronic gaming activities, given what we have seen from the enormous explosion of activity in poker machines in some of the states? The states are now very embarrassed by that and I hope that they start to do something about it, either through a uniform national code or through some of the proposals that they are talking about. But Mr Beazley uses these things as an excuse for not addressing the real issue.
The proper term is probably `casuistry', because that involves resolving problems of conscience or duty with clever but false reasoning. In other words, Mr Beazley pretends that he is concerned. We get a bit of hand-wringing—`Yeah, it's a big social problem, but we are concerned about this, that and the other; we think that the states should do more harm minimisation; and we would like to see this, that and the other.' We never see an alternative blueprint, let alone policy, because we do not get policy from the Labor Party. That is a classic example of dereliction of duty. People can talk about Mr Beazley being prolix, which is really just a euphemism for `waffle'. In many ways, the more appropriate term is `euphuism', which involves the use of high-flown language, in this case to disguise the policy vacuum—the simple refusal to tackle issues that are of concern to the Australian public.
Mr Beazley needs to understand that good government is about values and doing what you can to address serious social problems, not just finding cute technical, peripheral reasons why you will not address the main game. That is what the debate is about. Everyone in the chamber understands that things need to be done and that there may need to be compromises, but the central issue is: why on earth do you want to allow an explosion of social misery in the homes of ordinary Australians? That is the issue that the Labor Party has consistently ducked from the outset.
We acknowledge that the states and territories have been dragging the chain for a long time. They have not been able to produce a nationally accepted code for regulating online gambling. The AUS model promoted by the Northern Territory has not been endorsed by all states—in fact, we had great difficulty in even getting a copy of certain material—so it is necessary for the Commonwealth to provide strong leadership on the issue.
There have been a number of people on our side who have made very sensible contributions and refinements, and I pay tribute to Senator Tambling for his willingness to address this issue in a way that I think does achieve the central outcomes. We are not in the business of simply protecting people because of the pressure that is brought to bear; we are in the business of trying to identify what the social problems are and what governments can do about them. I would also say that people like Senator Boswell and Cameron Thompson, the member for Blair, have also been very active in taking a very close look at the difference between general lottery activities and things like scratch-its. Whilst there might be a benefit to some from the decision to exempt those products from the exemption, the fact remains that there is a very significant qualitative difference.
The bill will make it an offence for gambling operators to provide their services to persons located in Australia, and fines of over $1 million a day will apply to bodies corporate. The bill will also establish a complaints scheme for interactive gambling services hosted offshore. Australians will be able to make complaints to the Broadcasting Authority about offshore gambling services on the Internet and have these services added to approved Internet content filtering devices. The ban will apply to online casino gaming and similar services, and these include current and future services such as Internet casinos, Internet poker machines, ball by ball wagering on sporting events via a digital broadcast and online instant lotteries. All of these services have repetitive and potentially addictive qualities which are associated with problem gambling. Interactive betting after a sporting event has commenced will be within the prohibition. This means, for example, that customers will not be able to place bets on a football, tennis or cricket match after the match has commenced. We are all familiar with spread betting and ball by ball activities, which I think are just a manifestation of antisocial behaviour.
Senator Tambling has expressed concern that people will not be able to place bets on football matches after the season has started or on a cricket series after the series has commenced. That is not correct. People will be able to place bets on the result of a football season, tennis tournament or cricket series after the season, tournament or series has commenced. These are not individual sporting events but series of events. People can also place bets on the results of a football match after the season has started and before the match has started. This is made clear in the supplementary explanatory memorandum. Online scratch tickets and other types of rapid, repetitive online lotteries will also fall within the ban. These services provide rapid, instant returns and are very close in concept and design to poker machines and casino games.
Senator Tambling has also mentioned state and territory activities in relation to developing a national uniform set of regulatory standards. The only initiative of which I am aware in this respect is the AUS model being sponsored by the Northern Territory but, given that it does not have the support of all the states and territories, it is simply not a viable alternative to the government's bill. In any case, the regulatory approach only serves to provide a stimulus to interactive gambling. There is no reason to think the AUS model could control the growth of interactive gambling any more than the states have been able to control the growth of poker machines. In fact, it might simply provide an incentive for people to bypass those regimes altogether because they judge them to be too tight in not meeting their addictive needs, so this bill focuses on the providers of gambling services rather than the users. An approach that applies an offence to gamblers themselves may force problem gamblers underground, which would lessen the likelihood of them or their families seeking assistance.
The bill also has a low impact on third parties such as financial institutions and Internet service providers. It does not mandate any blocking by ISPs or banks to prevent access to interactive gambling services. The government considers that these measures impose too great a regulatory burden and would be very likely to be subject to circumvention. The bill applies only to the provision of interactive gambling services to people in Australia. It is designed to address the specific problem gambling issues that exist in Australia. Other countries must legislate to address problem gambling as it exists in their own jurisdictions.
I am aware of criticisms that the bill will force Australians to use offshore Internet gambling services. The government has addressed these concerns in the following manner. An amendment will be moved to ban the advertising of interactive gambling services, which will limit the access of offshore providers to the Australian market. An amendment will be moved to extend the offence in the bill to offshore operators, which will deter them from signing up Australian customers. Australian customers will be cautious about using offshore services, in any case, because these services are often unregulated and there is no guarantee of payouts being honoured. If the local industry is not allowed to develop, it is unlikely there will be a significant uptake of interactive gambling by Australians in any case. A survey on attitudes to a ban commissioned by the Department of Family and Community Services found that only one per cent of people would play a gambling site on the Internet if they knew a ban was in place.
The government does not support an approach that seeks uniform national regulation of interactive gambling. The regulatory approach provides, in effect, a stimulus to the growth of this form of activity. Efforts by states and territories to reach agreement on new national standards for regulating Internet gambling have not succeeded, despite the Prime Minister's announcement of the Commonwealth's concerns in December 1999, and there is no reason to think that the states and territories can restrict the growth of new forms of gambling any more than they have been able to do with poker machines.
I simply conclude by saying that this debate provides the last opportunity for the Labor Party—Mr Beazley, no doubt, will be hiding under a desk somewhere, but Senator Bishop has the opportunity to get up now—to explain, once and for all, why it is not prepared to do what can be done to stop the proliferation of electronic poker machines into the homes of ordinary Australians. And don't just give us all the other reasons that there are inconsistencies, there might be a few problems and technology keeps moving—we know all of those. In fact, the bill has a number of discretions contained within it which will enable us to at least keep up with new technological developments. But the central issue is: why won't you take a stand on principle? Why won't you come out and say that you do regard this as a social evil—a social issue and not an IT issue? Don't be hijacked by the Senator Lundys of this world who have been running around for years saying, `The Internet's sacrosanct. You can't touch it. Don't do anything about it.' That is not the approach adopted around the world these days. People know there are excesses from any new technology and that governments have an obligation to do what they can. We are not in the business of closing down the Internet. We are not in the business of stifling legitimate activities.
Our ban on pornography and paedophilia on the Internet, to the extent that it applies to Australian web sites, has been totally effective. Where complaints have been made, take-down notices have been issued. I have forgotten the precise number, but it is well over 100. The sites have been largely on paedophilia, not just on pornography, and we have been able to take those down. Surely that is a major social advance. Who wants to stand up and argue in favour of allowing that sort of activity to go unchecked? There is only one party that does, and that is the Labor Party. Having made that horrific mistake on Internet content regulation, why compound the felony this time around? At least get up and tell us where you stand, and why on earth you cannot support that part of the bill that attempts to do something about stopping the spread of interactive gaming activities into the homes of ordinary Australians. The answer is that it is all too hard.
This will be the major problem the Labor Party will have in the lead-up to the next election. They are not prepared to take a stance on issues because it might offend someone. They would much prefer to roll themselves up into a little ball and let the government take the flak. They might be behind the scenes, quietly cheering and saying that in their heart of hearts they agree and, when they go to church on Sunday and are told how bad this is, they say, `Don't worry; the government is going to fix it up.' But, of course, they will not say anything. They will just sit on their hands and look at all the flak the government will cop from various interest groups, whether it be the gambling proprietors, whether it be the horseracing industry or whether it be newsagents. Every time there is a bit of a break-out, they will say, `Isn't that good. This government is getting problems of its own.' And what will they do? They will just keep quiet. They do not have the gumption to stand up and say why they do not think this is a major social issue for Australians.
The Labor Party are a value-free zone. They are not in the business of trying to control activities, irrespective of whether they think they are socially deleterious and irrespective of whether they think some technological solutions can be applied. What will really concern Australians in six months time is Labor's abdication of responsibility—this leadership from the rear, and this willingness to sit on the fence whenever possible. That is why I say that Mr Beazley deserves an award for world's best practice in pusillanimous performance. I suspect that today will simply reinforce that position. But I am confident that, despite the Labor Party's craven capitulation, we will be able to achieve some real progress to protect the families of Australia.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2001-06-28,"—I move government business notice of motion No. 3:
That on Thursday, 28 June 2001:
	(a)	the hours of meeting shall be 9.30 a.m. to 6 p.m. and 7.30 p.m. to adjournment;
	(b)	consideration of general business and consideration of committee reports, government responses and Auditor-General's reports under standing order 62(1) and (2) not be proceeded with;
	(c)	the routine of business from 7.30 p.m. till the adjournment shall be government business only;
	(d)	divisions may take place after 7.30 p.m.; and
	(e)	the question for the adjournment of the Senate shall not be proposed till a motion for the adjournment is moved by a minister.
I would like to very briefly address this motion and make some undertakings in relation to it. The government has a number of bills that it wants to complete prior to the adjournment of the Senate for the winter recess. They are: the bill that is currently before the Senate in the committee of the whole—that is, the Interactive Gambling Bill 2001; the new business tax system package of bills, upon which there has been agreement among all senators that it will be dealt with at the 12.45 p.m. timeslot; the migration legislation amendment bill; the Health Legislation Amendment (Medical Practitioners' Qualifications and Other Measures) Bill 2001; the Passenger Movement Charge Amendment Bill 2001; the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2001; the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2001, which I believe is now supported by all senators as a non-controversial piece of legislation to be dealt with at 12.45 p.m; the Innovation and Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2001; the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2001; the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1999; and there are some messages from the House of Representatives in relation to child support, dairy produce, the ANZFA Amendment Bill, the environment protection bill, and superannuation contributions. We are also looking for agreement in relation to the Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Account Bill 2001. Has that one gone to a committee?
—It is going to a committee.
—Right, so we will not be seeking to deal with that today. That sounds like a long list of bills, but a number of them are non-controversial and there has been agreement, particularly in relation to some of the messages, to handle them in an expeditious fashion. For example, I have it from Senator Robert Hill, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, that the environment bill, in particular—which I understand Senator Brown has an interest in—would be brought on only if there were broad agreement that it would be dealt with in a non-controversial style. Senator Brown is indicating that that is highly unlikely which is, of course, a huge surprise.
Therefore, the situation is that the government would like to see these bills completed by no later than midnight tonight. However, government business notice of motion No. 3 standing in my name ensures that the Senate would only come to adjournment on the motion of a minister. Our undertaking to the Senate, and the commitment we have given to all honourable senators in discussions on this issue, is that if we complete the list of bills I have just read out we would adjourn at that time. If that is prior to midnight, it would make everybody in the chamber and everyone else happy, I am sure. But if, for example, we were near to the conclusion of the final piece of business as the clock neared midnight, we would seek discussions with leaders and whips of all the parties and the Independent senators to look at extending the sitting of the Senate to a reasonable hour beyond midnight. If it were clear that the program is such that it simply would not be concluded at a reasonable hour this evening, we indicate that we would suspend the sittings and resume tomorrow afternoon after the Senate has completed its role in the swearing in of Australia's new Governor-General. I indicate and commit to that being the way the government would like to proceed with its program between now and the adjournment of these sittings. I commend this motion to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Hours of Meeting and Routine of Business</title>,Business,25,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2001-06-28,"—I move:
Omit paragraph (e), substitute:
	(e)	the question for the adjournment of the Senate shall be proposed at 12 midnight.
The government has just outlined its view as to what the legislative program shall be for the day. From my reading of the government's motion, the government has effectively suggested to us that we need to consider 16 bills today. 
I suppose you could argue that this inevitably happens on the last day of a parliamentary session; that is, that we are asked to consider a very heavy workload in so far as the legislative program—in this case, 16 separate pieces of legislation to be considered in one day. But, on top of that, we have a situation where a considerable amount of the day's business is to be allocated to consideration of the government's legislation on broadcasting and the proposition that was before the Senate chamber with regard to Internet gaming. We have to ask ourselves why it is that we find ourselves in this situation. This is in the context whereby this opposition has agreed to an additional 150 hours of government business time over the course of the parliament. I again draw to your attention that, if we assume that is 15 hours a week, that it is the equivalent of 10 parliamentary sitting weeks to consider government business. That is an extraordinary amount of time in anyone's language. 
This matter comes up every time we come to this period, and it was addressed by the opposition in discussions with the government earlier this week. We actually asked how we were going with the legislative program and, in particular, what was happening to the money bills and other bills that have start-up dates at the beginning of the financial year. The opposition has been mindful of the responsibilities of an opposition and we have been particularly mindful of the responsibilities of the government to ensure that there is reasonable consideration of the legislative program in such a way that money bills with this particular starting date are not held up. I think the opposition has been extraordinarily generous in the way in which it has approached this. It has been very reasonable and very responsible. But now we are asked to agree to a proposition to essentially sit, as the government suggests, to all hours tonight. We are told that the government understands this to mean that, come 12 o`clock tonight, we will have a bit of a discussion about whether or not we extend, and it was then said that, if that does not meet the agreement of the chamber, we will sit again tomorrow and presumably next week. 
One presumes that, at some point, there has to be consideration of when we finish, but the point I am trying to raise is: is it not appropriate that the disciplines of the chamber be applied to all senators? Is it not reasonable that all senators be mindful of their responsibilities with regard to consideration of government business and opportunities being made available to express your views on pieces of legislation? I take the view that it is a principle that applies on both sides of the chamber. That is why I am suggesting that there needs to be a definite cut-off point for consideration of the legislative program, and that 12 o'clock tonight is not an unreasonable point at which to say that enough is enough. We all understand that, within that context, if a majority is available on the floor of this chamber, then of course the hours can be extended. No-one is denying that basic fact of legislative life.
What I am suggesting is that, if Senator Alston feels it necessary to attack opposition senators and, in the most provocative manner, seeks to ridicule and abuse members of the opposition, those disciplines that apply to me or any other senator should apply to Senator Alston. We have seen a quite extraordinary lack of discipline by this government when it comes to consideration of its own legislation. I think there are double standards here. We have been told that the opposition has to give and give in terms of additional hours, but the government does not seem to be able to discipline its own members as to their responsibilities in being mindful of the limited hours that are available. We in this place know that there is a capacity for the Senate to fill whatever time is available if discipline is not imposed. And year after year we see this government get worse in its capacity to manage the program—that the more time you give the government the more time it takes. 
We put to the Democrats—and I understand that they may well be committed to support the government on this issue—that there has to be consideration at some point about how much time is actually given to the government. My view is that if at 12 o'clock the government still needs more time, then it is reasonable to consider it at that stage. But there has to be a limit. I think you will find that there is a great deal more attention paid to the clock if there is a limit imposed now. The problem we have is that the government says, `Trust us'—
—What did they do last time?
—In the last parliamentary session we sat around until 4 o'clock in the morning cooling our heels because the government was wanting to get messages backwards and forwards between the chambers and did not have the wit and wisdom to organise its program in such a manner that the legislative program was dealt with in a reasonable way. My proposition to the Senate is this: the opposition has bent over backwards to facilitate a reasonable consideration of government business. What we are now saying is that there has to be a measure put on this government to enforce discipline on both sides of the chamber.

"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2001-06-28,"—The Democrats have considered the proposal put forward by the government and that put forward by the opposition. While we are in agreement that we would like to see as much of the government's program go through in the time allowed—except possibly the Innovation and Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2001, but we understand that that will not go very far—we also take the point of the opposition that Senator Alston—certainly from every comment I have heard from the Democrats sitting in the chamber—has not been particularly helpful. We would recommend to him that he becomes helpful. While we will be supporting the government, I think I am right in pointing out that contingent notice of motion No. 3 would actually allow us to consider the adjournment at any point. I would be interested in hearing whether or not that is correct. If Senator Alston takes notice of the advice that he is getting from senators around the chamber and if we start this off after lunch in a very cooperative manner, we ought to get through it an awful lot faster.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2001-06-28,"—The Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2001 amends the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 and the Radiocommunications Act 1992. The opposition does not oppose the bill, although I would like to make a few comments with respect to various parts of the bill. The bill was referred to the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee last month. The Labor senators' report to the committee noted one area of deficiency in the bill that we thought required amendment, and so recommended. It is satisfying that the minister has circulated an amendment to that effect and that it has been picked up in the House. There are four different areas that the bill amends in the Broadcasting Services Act: firstly, time shifting, high definition TV broadcasts; secondly, the content of HDTV advertising; thirdly, allocation of additional commercial television licences in underserviced remote or regional markets; and, fourthly, antisiphoning arrangements.
The bill also corrects some anomalies created by amendments made by the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Digital Television and Datacasting) Act 2000 and amends the Radiocommunications Act 1992 in relation to the issue of apparatus licences. The main area of contention that we identified in our minority report to the inquiry is the time shifting arrangements. The proposed amendments are intended to allow the broadcast of suitable demonstration HDTV content during the trading hours of HDTV retail outlets. As discussed in our minority report, these amendments do not meet the needs of their principal intended beneficiaries, the commercial free-to-air television networks.
The act presently allows the networks to engage in limited time shifted programming in relation to promotional SDTV content, but there is no similar provision for HDTV. All HDTV material is required to be simultaneously broadcast in both the SDTV and analog formats. The commercial television networks sought an amendment from the government to allow the broadcast of a 30- to 60-minute HDTV demonstration loop tape. The bill only allows the broadcast of a HDTV demo loop tape if the commercial free-to-air networks rebroadcast that tape in full in the SDTV and analog formats within seven days. The reason for requiring the rebroadcast is to prevent the commercial free-to-air stations from effectively multichannelling.
The pay television industry had no objections to the use of demonstration loop tapes in these circumstances, and they have a vested interest in preventing multichannelling. The industry, however, did express concerns about the existing provisions of the bill. In our minority report, Labor senators indicated that the opposition would support amendment of the bill to allow the free-to-air commercial networks to seek an exemption from the HDTV simulcast provisions to allow the broadcast of a 30- to 60-minute demonstration loop tape only. The government has decided to move an amendment to remedy that deficiency, and it went through the House last night with opposition support.
One final point I would like to raise is the government's failure to take the opportunity of including in this bill an amendment to the Broadcasting Services Act to remedy the datacasting regime. The government's cancellation of the datacasting spectrum auction last month was a humiliating admission that no-one wants to buy spectrum to offer the datacasting services that the government created and defined in last year's Broadcasting Services Amendment (Digital Television and Datacasting) Act. The government's regime was so restrictive that it was unworkable, and no-one in the industry wanted to offer datacasting.
I have a couple of questions for Senator Alston on this point, which my colleague Mr Smith foreshadowed in the House. Firstly, does the government still regard datacasting as being part of the 1998 digital TV framework, and is the government still committed to the 1998 parliamentary framework? Secondly, if so, what does the government propose to do in terms of amending the datacasting regime to make datacasting viable? If the government is no longer committed to the parliamentary framework then the opposition seeks the government's assurance that it will immediately undertake a public process to ascertain industry views on the future of digital television and datacasting. The implications of these questions are important. Rumours abound that the government has plans for datacasting to become a subscription based industry. The opposition says that the parliament is entitled to know what the government's plans are for the framework that the parliament agreed to in 1998. I ask the minister to respond to those questions.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2001-06-28,"—In the interests of speed—and while I am sure that if I spoke to the chamber I would immediately sway everybody's opinion—I seek leave to incorporate my second reading remarks.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
As we have heard, the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill is a bill to amend several sections of the Broadcasting Services Act.
There is no central theme to the bill, and so I will discuss the Democrats position with respect to the various measures within the bill.
The bill amends the BSA to
·	firstly, allow the allocation of additional commercial television licences in two-station markets;
·	secondly, to permit the automatic de-listing of events from the anti-siphoning list;
·	thirdly, to amend the simulcast provision for high definition television broadcasts, under certain circumstances, and
·	lastly, to make minor changes to datacasting.
Commercial Television Licences
The Australian Broadcasting Authority allocates commercial television broadcasting licences. Each licence is allocated in a given licence area and no more than three licences are allocated for any given area. Licences are also allocated in accordance with the rules relating to cross media and foreign ownership.
No one licensee is permitted to own more than one licence ion a single licence area. In remote or regional licence areas, the rules may be relaxed in order that people in these areas may receive additional service, in order that they may at least be similar to the services receive in metropolitan areas.
In solus markets - areas where there is only one commercial television licence, the licensee may apply for an additional licence. In areas where there are two commercial television licences, the existing licensees must submit a joint application in order for the ABA to grant an additional licence.
While we understand that there has not been a situation where one licensee wants an additional licence and the second does not, it is considered necessary to remove the anomaly to prevent this situation arising in the future. Perhaps licences will be considered more valuable when full digital conversion takes place. The amendment, removing the requirement for a joint application for a second licence, will allow a sole service provide to apply for a licence in their own right.
In supporting this amendment, the Democrats certainly hope the outcome contributes to additional services being provide to regional, and remote or solus market, and contribute to the diversity of content currently experienced by audiences in these areas.
Anti-Siphoning Provisions
The purpose of the anti-siphoning list is to ensure that the rights to broadcast major and significant sporting events, which have traditionally been broadcast on free-to-air television, are not acquired exclusively by the pay television sector.
At the time the anti-siphoning list came into force, the parliament was of the view that audiences should continue to receive the programming for free that they had always had access to. I am sure the parliament is still unified in this position today. Following the debate which led to the list's construction in 1994, the list ended up being comprised exclusively of sporting events and are those deemed to be the most important and most significant, to audiences.
Certainly to the free-to-air broadcasters, the rights to broadcast these events also means to ensure a loyal following of audiences (and that means high ratings) and therefore higher advertising revenue.
The anti-siphoning list is attached as a schedule to the BSA and includes events such as the Melbourne Cup, selected Australian Rules Football, Rugby League, Rugby Union, Cricket, Soccer, Tennis, Netball, Basketball, Golf and Motor Sports.
A pay television operator wishing to televise an event on the antisiphoning list must wait until a free-to-air network acquires the rights. As there is no dual rights system, the pay television sector cannot broadcast that event live, unless the free-to-air network gives its permission. 
Pay television operators may acquire the rights to an event if the event is removed from the anti-siphoning list.
However, events are automatically de-listed one week after the event has occurred.
It should also be noted that there is no obligation on the free-to-air television sector to broadcast events that they acquire the rights to. There are also provisions within the Act which relate to antihoarding.
The Australian Broadcasting Authority is currently undertaking a review of the anti-siphoning list and is due to report to the Minister on 30 June. The Democrats understand that the ABA's review does not impact on the amendments to this bill, as the ABA's inquiry relates to the composition of the list, rather than the process of acquiring the rights, as these amendments do.
While the list currently contains only sporting events - and most of these male sporting events - it would be nice to see recommendations to include a greater number of women's sporting events, and even events of national significance - like the opening of parliament, for example. I'm sure that is an event everyone in this chamber would think suitably significant. It would even be encouraging to think that theatrical or cultural events were deemed important enough drawcards by the commercial free-to-air broadcasters to have these included on the list too.
The Productivity Commission's inquiry into Broadcasting, tabled last year, also discusses the anti-siphoning list and related issues. The Productivity Commission's report - to which we are awaiting the Government's response - states that several submissions to it about the operation of the anti-siphoning regime found it cumbersome and lengthy.
The Productivity Commission found that the anti-siphoning provisions were anti-competitive and that there were costs across the industry which outweighed the benefits of the list. I'm not sure I necessarily agree with this assessment, so I am pleased to see that at the end of its assessment, the Productivity Commission agreed that at least some form of regulation is required.
The Democrats certainly agree with this assessment. We do not think this is something the industry can, at this point in time, self regulate. We are strongly of the view that regulation is required.
I think it is fair to sat in this instance that the amendments to the BSA in this bill are the Government's response to at least this section of the Productivity Commission report.
We should further note, however, that the amendments presented in this Bill relate to only to the de-listing, or removal, of events from the anti-siphoning list. The amendments do not challenge the existence of the list itself, nor do they propose any change to the composition of the list. Rightfully, these matters are subject to inquiry in 2003.
The amendments before the Senate will mean that events can be removed from the list 6 weeks before the start of an event, unless the minister declares otherwise. Naturally, at least one of the free-to-air broadcasters will have to have been offered the rights to the events before the process of delisting commences.
The Democrats believe this provides enough of a safety measure for the free-to-airs networks. As was pointed out during the Senate committee inquiry into the Bill a couple of weeks ago, that commercial realities would dictate that the rights to all these events would be negotiated far in advance of the six week cut off period. From the rights-holders point of view, they too would want the certainty that their event was to be broadcast and that a commercial return would be maximised.
Certainly from the evidence provided to the committee, I am firmly of the view that no right holders would hold out negotiations, but would want their event scheduled well in advance, and, as I say, to have their commercial returns maximised.
Finally, I wish to turn my attention to the amendments dealing with high definition television simulcasts. The bill allows the free-to-air broadcasters to broadcast high definition programming, which is on a 30 to 60 minutes loop tape” to be exempt from the simulcast provisions.
The idea behind this motion is to encourage consumer take-up of digital television by allowing the broadcast of segments of high definition programs compiled into a loop-tape in order that consumers can see and compare high definition television with standard digital or analogue television. Obviously, such material would not be suited to broadcast for ordinary programming and therefore the simulcast exemption is required.
We have assurances as I will be asking the minister additional questions about this in the committee stage, that these amendments will not permit de-facto multichannelling. The Democrats sought clarification of this issue in our additional comments to the Senate Committee report. The changes the Government has made to the bill in this regard, making the broadcast of the demonstration material more clearly defined, so I'm pretty sure that they will not result in any de-facto multichannelling.
Perhaps this is something the reviews into digital television will examine when the time comes in three years time.
Finally, there is a small amendment changing the definition of foreign language news services in the datacasting regime to include foreign news and current affairs programming. This means that datacasting service providers, when they eventually begin services in Australia, will be able to provide news and current affairs bulletins in foreign languages. I think this amendment will most obviously suit the SBS in the immediate term, and possibly other service providers in the longer term, and therefore the Democrats will support this small change.
In closing, the Democrats view these amendments as being favourable to Australian audiences and will monitor closely, the changes to both the anti-siphoning list and the HDTV amendments to ensure that Australian audiences truly benefit.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2001-06-28,"—It is a very powerful example set by Senator Bourne, and I find it irresistibly attractive. I will go one step further. I will not respond in detail other than to say that I adopt what Senator Bishop said in relation to the amendments for the demonstration loop tapes. I think all the other provisions are well understood, and we have obviously considered the Senate committee report. As far as Senator Bishop's questions are concerned, the government still regard datacasting as part of the 1999 legislative framework. We are considering options that might be available in the light of the cancellation of the datacasting option, which of course was based on a legislative framework supported by the Labor Party.

Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-06-28,"—Whilst the Migration Legislation Amendment (Immigration Detainees) Bill 2001 is being debated in a so-called non-controversial part of the day, it is anything but non-controversial. I think that point needs to be made. As I think would be fairly obvious, anything to do with immigration detention in this country at the moment would be clearly labelled as controversial. Indeed, the fact that it is being debated at this time should not be seen as an indication that the Democrats are supportive of the bill because we are not supportive of the bill. I think that point needs to be made clearly as well. It is unfortunate in a way that a bill of such significance in terms of the principle behind it is being rushed through in amongst many other bills on the final day of the sitting of this session, but that, of course, unfortunately, is not unusual either in relation to bills significant and not so significant.
The bill as it originally stood sought to introduce a number of provisions with a number of new offences. It seeks to introduce a new criminal offence for detainees who manufacture, possess, use or distribute weapons or who are found to be in possession of anything that may reasonably be suspected of being able to be used or intended to be used for the purposes of being a weapon. So anything that is perceived as being able to be used as a weapon is able to be confiscated, and it is an offence for the detainee to possess it. 
The bill also seeks to increase the maximum penalty for the offence of escaping from detention from two years imprisonment to five years imprisonment, bringing that penalty into line with that outlined for the same offence in the Crimes Act. It also seeks to provide extra powers for screening and searching people who are visiting detention centres. In its original form it also provided powers for delegates of the minister to strip search detainees and people in detention centres. I note that that provision of the bill has now been removed by amendment in the lower house and introduced separately as a new bill. I think it was introduced in the House of Representatives yesterday. So we are not dealing with powers for guards to be able to strip search detainees, and that at least is a welcome thing. It removes probably the most objectionable part of the legislation. 
Nonetheless, the legislation as it stands is still unacceptable to the Democrats for two key reasons. Firstly, as most Australians are now clearly aware, the operation and running of our detention centres and the level of scrutiny and accountability for what happens in our detention centres are clearly inadequate, and to pass any legislation which increases the powers in any way of people running detention centres or increases penalties for detainees is completely inappropriate at a time when our whole system of mandatory detention, in the Democrats' view, is being shown to be clearly not functioning. 
The second reason why the Democrats are opposed to the bill is that it reinforces the fiction, and unfortunately the widespread perception, that people who are in immigration detention are criminals. By bringing in offences and bringing them into line with offences in the criminal code, in the Crimes Act, it reinforces and equates detainees with convicted criminals. They are not only not convicted criminals; they are not even people charged with a crime. Unfortunately, a number of people in the community—indeed, a number of politicians—are now willing to use the false label of `criminals' to apply to asylum seekers who are in detention. 
Some asylum seekers are not in detention and some are. Those who arrive on an authorised visa—perhaps on a student visa, a visitor visa or any other type of visa—and then seek asylum are able to have their claim assessed while they are in the general community, even after the time frame of their original visa has expired. That occurs frequently with many people on a day-to-day basis without any threat to the community and without any general problem. Yet, if people arrive without authorisation, they are detained indefinitely—sometimes for extremely long periods, stretching into years—in part because, supposedly, they are a threat to the community and will abscond and disappear into the general community if they are not locked away. The falsehood of that is shown by the fact that many asylum seekers who are in the community do not disappear and are able to be located, and the system functions well. Clearly, detaining asylum seekers who arrive unauthorised is a punitive approach. It is deliberately punitive and the minister has said many times that it is a punitive measure to detain people indefinitely, despite the fact that they are not convicted of or charged with anything and that many of them are seeking asylum and protection from persecution. Many of them are recognised as such by our legal system and then released.
The Democrats oppose the practice of compulsory, mandatory, indefinite, ongoing detention of unauthorised arrivals. Therefore, we oppose any measures that seek to extend those offences with which people are charged. Despite the Democrats' opposition to detention centres, they exist and will continue to exist in the foreseeable future because the policy of mandatory, indefinite, compulsory detention is supported not just by the coalition but by the Labor opposition. Unfortunately, we will have detention centres in their current form until sufficient community pressure can be built to change that policy. In that circumstance, people who are in detention should be charged with offences if they break the law, in the same way as everyone else in the community should be charged, but they should not be equivalent to criminals, as the Migration Legislation Amendment (Immigration Detainees) Bill 2001 seeks to do. We think that is a poor principle which compounds the poor principle of mandatory detention.
We believe that asylum seekers are not a threat to be held at bay. They are a group of people who should be assessed properly and in many cases should not be in detention, and the criminal code type provisions should not be applied to people who have not been convicted of anything. It is worth reminding the Senate that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission found in reviewing a previous case that a detainee had been held in a remand centre or prison without trial, after attempting an escape. That has occurred in the past and it is on the record and documented by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Again, that is an example of how the overall approach to detainees is already overly harsh and punitive. We should not be extending penalties even further when the adequacy of our system is clearly not up to scratch.
There have been any number of allegations of inappropriate treatment of detainees by centre staff and guards. Indeed, there are allegations of physical abuse at Villawood Detention Centre in April, which are currently under investigation by the New South Wales police. The government and the opposition say that there is adequate opportunity for complaints to be investigated by the Ombudsman or the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The Democrats believe that there is not an adequate opportunity, that it is not sufficiently transparent and that they are not sufficiently empowered or resourced to perform that type of role.
In the specific case of people who have made allegations of assault at Villawood, despite the fact that police investigations are ongoing, there has been application by the government to deport a couple of those people before police investigations are complete and the allegations have been fully tested. The government is saying that, if the police need the people to stay, they can apply for criminal justice visas, but they are not the only ones. My advice is that the Attorney-General can also apply for those visas. The Democrats believe that the Attorney-General should do that to ensure that people are in the country until the investigation is complete. It is not a matter of judging the adequacy of their asylum claims; it is a matter of ensuring that people who allege they have been assaulted have the opportunity to have their allegations properly investigated and not be involved in some sort of lottery where it depends on whether or not they are able to remain in the country while those investigations are under way, particularly where such assaults are alleged to have happened when people are being deprived of their liberty.
The Democrats do not support the general principle of the bill. I note the amendments moved in the House of Representatives by Mr Theophanous, an Independent. Those amendments were supported by the Democrats. I could have moved similar amendments in this chamber and was of a mind to do so but, as in the House of Representatives, the bill has been put through the Senate reasonably quickly. While we are opposed to the bill, we recognise that both Labor and the coalition support it. We are not seeking to frustrate the will of the parliament by holding up debate on the bill but, on behalf of the Democrats, I indicate our support for amendments such as those moved by Mr Theophanous and that, if there had been longer debate and the bill had laid on the table a bit longer, I probably would have circulated similar amendments.
The Democrats oppose the bill for the reasons I have outlined. We welcome the fact that the government has taken out the specific provisions to do with empowering delegates to strip search detainees, although, as I said earlier, those provisions are now the subject of a separate bill in the House of Representatives. If it does come to the Senate, the Democrats will oppose that as well at a time when we have people across the political spectrum in Australia from human rights groups, refugee groups and people such as Malcolm Fraser, the Democrats and even the Labor opposition calling for an independent inquiry into what happens in our detention centres. It seems incongruous to the Democrats that on the one hand there is call for an inquiry into detention centres in recognition of the fact that they are not being run adequately and that there is not adequate transparency, yet on the other hand we are passing legislation to increase penalties against detainees. That seems incongruous to me and is not a desirable approach. In the circumstances, I will leave it at that and put on the record again our opposition to the bill.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (IMMIGRATION DETAINEES) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2001-06-28,"—At the outset, I thank all senators who have contributed to the debate on this matter. The Migration Legislation Amendment (Immigration Detainees) Bill 2001 is an integral part of a range of strategies being introduced by the government to promote safety and security at immigration detention centres. The measures in this bill will introduce new offences and penalties relating to the behaviour of immigration detainees in immigration detention centres. It also will provide for additional security measures for visitors seeking to enter immigration detention centres. The new offence of `manufacturing, possessing, using or distributing a weapon' will address the increasing problem of detainees fashioning weapons from materials obtained within immigration detention centres. These objects represent a serious danger to detainees, staff and other persons in detention centres—and some recent examples of this have given rise to these measures. The increased penalty for escaping from immigration detention seeks to provide a more effective deterrent against escape. Finally, the security measures for visitors entering immigration detention centres will seek to ensure that items that could disrupt the good order, safety and security of those facilities are not brought in.
I would also like to comment briefly on several matters raised by senators during the debate. Firstly, there has been some aspect of mandatory detention of unlawful non-citiz-ens being raised in this debate—and, although this is a tough measure, it is a fair one. It has bipartisan support and was first introduced by the Labor government in 1992. Opposition senators have called for a judicial inquiry into immigration detention and disturbances that have been occurring recently. Australia's immigration detention facilities are already subject to high levels of scrutiny and have been the subject of numerous reports. In fact, these reports and inquiries have included parliamentary committees, the Commonwealth Ombuds-man and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Also, there is the Immigration Detention Advisory Group, which was established in February this year and which has unfettered access to all detention centres in monitoring the adequacy and appropriateness of facilities, services and accommodation. Given this high level of scrutiny, the government believes that there is no need for a judicial inquiry.
Senator Schacht, during the debate, made some remarks implying that not all persons were treated equally by immigration law and policy. He claimed that the only reason the Kosovars were granted temporary safe haven in Australia was that they were white, Caucasian and from Europe. This is not the case, and the government emphatically rejects this argument. The Migration Act and migration regulations are applied fairly and without discrimination as to race or national origin. The Kosovars were brought to Australia in response to a call by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to help alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Kosovo. Australia also responded in a similar way for persons who were in a similar situation in East Timor in late 1999.
Senator Schacht also referred to the unanimous report of the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. A great deal has been said about this report and I will not repeat it here. But what I will say is that the Senate should remember that there has been criticism of aspects of this report from a wide sector, including members of the opposition. In fact, I think it was Senator McKiernan, who has had a longstanding interest in immigration matters, who expressed concerns about some elements of that report. I believe that what we have in relation to that report is certainly not a unanimous view across the community.
This is a bill that is needed. It is a fair bill. It deals with people who are held in detention for necessary reasons. As I have said, this has been a longstanding policy and has had bipartisan support. It is not possible to equate this sort of detention with the criminal jurisdiction, and I appreciate the comments that Senator Cooney made during the course of this debate. But here we have a situation where people are alleged to have entered Australia unlawfully and it is necessary for them to be detained until their status can be determined—and that is something, as I say, which has been the policy of the Australian government for some time. I commend this bill to the Senate, and I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
Leave granted; debate adjourned.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (IMMIGRATION DETAINEES) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2001-06-28,"—I will be tabling a number of amendments to the Passenger Movement Charge Amendment Bill 2001 which we believe are in the best interests of the Australian tourism industry. The Australian Democrats have worked closely with the tourism industry, especially the export side of the industry, for a number of years. We appreciate that tourism is our fourth largest export earning industry, contributing 4½ per cent of GDP annually. I think what is often forgotten in this debate is that the tourism industry directly employs about six per cent of the Australian work force. In that sense, it provides many jobs for young people and particularly for people living in regional areas. It delivers nearly $13 billion in foreign exchange earnings each year, and of course that sum is still growing. In fact, the industry's current five million visitors annually is set to increase to 10 million by the year 2010, and 20 million by the year 2020. 
This is a phenomenal growth, and it has come about with modest amounts of government investment—which is why I want to talk about this legislation. In fact, the government has been winding back the amount of money it allocates to the international promotional and marketing side of the industry, particularly that which is undertaken by the Australian Tourist Commission. Whilst the ATC's budget was boosted in the lead-up to the Olympics last year in Sydney, the commission saw its funding base decline as a result of funding cutbacks and, of course, the steep decline in the buying power of the Australian dollar overseas.
Whilst the government has continued to claim that the ATC is currently receiving record funding, in actual fact when you look at inflation and the value of the Australian dollar, the buying power itself is actually $22 million lower than it was five years ago. In effect, it means that the Australian Tourist Commission finds itself in a position of having to look at which overseas markets it will cease to run promotional campaigns in. It has had to determine what its absolute core markets are and where it simply cannot afford to stop advertising Australia as a holiday destination. The handful of countries, mostly in Europe and North America, will essentially be the backbone of the tourism industry market over the next few years. We will all just have to pray that other emerging and fledgling markets will continue to grow of their own accord or as a result of the very hard work of individual operators in the tourism industry who continue to promote themselves overseas.
I see this as a simply massive opportunity that was missed. In September last year, the eyes of three billion people were on Australia for two weeks during the Sydney Olympic Games; the value of that international attention is virtually incalculable. It was a once in a lifetime opportunity to build on the momentum brought about by good planning leading up to the Olympics and what has happened since that time. Yet only a matter of weeks ago in the 2001-02 budget, the Tourist Commission lost $3 million in supplementary funding and is due to lose a further $10 million per annum in the 2002-03 budget, according to the Tourism Task Force. Perhaps this is something that the minister may consider responding to.
On top of this, the tourism industry learnt that it would single-handedly generate the pool of funds to prevent the entry of foot-and-mouth disease into Australia and that this would be achieved by the government increasing the cost of the passenger movement charge by nearly 30 per cent to $38 per person. The initiative as proposed by the government fails to reflect the impact that would have on the tourism industry itself. The rise will reduce Australia's price competitiveness, add additional recovery costs for airlines and cruise companies and provide no assistance for the industry to promote Australia's clean and green image on the back of the initiative.
Whilst the tourism industry is the first to acknowledge that it would suffer enormously if Australia's clean and green image were smeared or indeed destroyed by an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, it does not believe it should be the only industry tackling what is essentially an agricultural issue as much as it is a potential tourism issue. Perhaps if the government had softened the blow of this tax hike on the industry and allocated a portion of the funds generated from the foot-and-mouth prevention scheme to the ATC, the Australian Democrats would not be seeking to move any amendment, nor would we have difficulties in supporting what the government proposes.
However, we know that the Tourist Commission currently receives no direct benefit from the passenger movement charge. In fact, a report from the Australian National Audit Office states on page 13 that the passenger movement charge is now applied partly as a general revenue raising source and is no longer solely linked to cost recovery or Customs, immigration and quarantine services. This has been confirmed by the Attorney-General in his answer to a question on notice, and indeed the Attorney-General stated that he is not considering any proposal to change these arrangements. Furthermore, the Board of Airline Representatives recently went on the public record with the accusation that about $20 million in revenue from the PMC is not being spent on border control services. This is an accusation that does warrant further detailed investigation and is a matter that the Australian Democrats want to see resolved to the satisfaction of the tourism industry itself.
As I stated earlier, the Australian Democrats have been working closely with the peak organisations of the Australian tourism industry, and it is their advice to us that underpins the amendments that we seek to move today. So we call on the Senate to support our amendment to schedule 1, section 6 of the bill, which in essence proposes an increase in the cost of the PMC from $38 to $40. We are advocating this because it will generate an estimated annual revenue of $16 million which would enable some direct financial returns to flow back to the tourism industry and the ATC.
I am well aware that this is a matter that has to be dealt with as a request from the Senate to the House of Representatives, but it is an amendment that would ensure there was no watering down of the government's proposed foot-and-mouth program, as the tourism industry appreciates the importance of being able to retain the integrity of the measure. I think it would also, in the opinion of the industry, offset the disadvantages to the industry as a result of an increase in the passenger movement charge. The Australian Democrats appreciate that we are not able to amend a bill imposing a tax, as provided by section 53 of the Constitution, but we are not prevented from seeking to move some of our amendments to this bill as a request of the government. Perhaps it is something that the minister may wish to consider. This is wholly in accordance with precedents of the Senate, and our other amendments are therefore in the form of a second reading amendment.
The Tourism Task Force and the Australian Tourism Export Council have both called on the Democrats to recommend to the government that $15 million of the passenger movement charge be allocated to the Tourist Commission to fund its promotional and marketing budget. That would allow the estimated $72 million generated by the government's $8 increase in the PMC to be allocated to the Australian Customs Service, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service to increase their inspections of passengers and their luggage, mail and cargo at airports as part of the government's foot-and-mouth disease prevention measures.
The Australian Democrats will move a second reading amendment calling on the Senate to make the collection of the passenger movement charge commissionable to travel agents. The Australian Federation of Travel Agents, the Tourism Task Force and the Tourism Export Council have all advocated this reform measure on the basis that the current regime is overly complex and costly. Some overseas travel agents do not always apply the charge to tickets sold, and we believe that efficiency improvements are possible in other areas. Faced with a similar situation, the Singaporean government recently made the collection of their departure tax commissionable to travel agents. They are already seeing the benefits in a much more efficient and effective system. They have also noted an improvement in compliance figures.
The measures that are addressed in the amendments that the Australian Democrats will move today should have all been addressed by the government as part of a long-term strategy to ensure that we have the most efficient and competitive tourism industry possible. Instead, the government has made a half-hearted attempt to address one issue—foot-and-mouth disease—in isolation of the needs of the tourism industry itself. Furthermore, the government has sought to address it a matter of weeks out from the budget being handed down, missing the opportunity to deal with what I regard as a range of outstanding matters concerning the Australian tourism industry, let alone the question of jobs and particularly jobs in regional Australia. This kind of policy making on the run is not in the best interests of our tourism industry and therefore not in the best interests of our economy, let alone the country itself.
In tabling these amendments, I put the government and the opposition on notice that we will be using every opportunity in future to ensure that these outstanding matters are addressed. The levels of government funding to the ATC must be significantly increased in the immediate future to ensure that we take full advantage of the amazing opportunity that our tourism industry has before it. The type of coverage that we got during the Olympic Games is the type of advertising and marketing that you cannot pay for and yet we are missing an opportunity to capitalise on the way that the image of Australia has been projected abroad. 
Similarly, the issue of how the government spends moneys in relation to the passenger movement charge has been raised again today for that very reason. Transparency and accountability as to how these funds are spent must be assured. We believe that the Australian tourism industry, which generates the money, should reap a significant portion of the rewards. These funds should not be disappearing into consolidated revenue. The tourism industry should be given some kind of idea about how long the government intends to collect tax to fund a foot-and-mouth prevention strategy as well as some indication of how these funds will be allocated once the possibility of a foot-and-mouth outbreak passes. The minister may wish also to respond to that. The Australian Democrats will continue to call for a solution that will make the collection of the passenger movement charge commissionable to Australian travel agents and will deal with the current inefficiencies in this area. I commend the Democrats amendments to the Senate. I move:
At the end of the motion, add:
“but the Senate calls on the Government:
	(a)	to make the charge commissionable and thereby encourage overseas travel agents to comply with the charge regime; and
	(b)	to introduce legislation allocating a further M$15 per year to the Australian Tourist Commission over the life of the foot and mouth disease prevention program for the purpose of marketing measures designed to boost Australia's image as a “clean and green destination”.",SENATE,<title>PASSENGER MOVEMENT CHARGE AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2001-06-28,"—I thank senators for their contribution to this debate and also remind the Senate that the purpose of this Passenger Movement Charge Amendment Bill 2001 is to amend the Passenger Movement Charge Act 1978 to increase the rate of passenger movement charge by $8 to $38 with effect from 1 July this year. This increase was announced by the Treasurer in this year's budget. It will fund increased passenger processing costs as part of Australia's response to the increased threat of the introduction of exotic pests and diseases, particularly foot-and-mouth disease.
The passenger movement charge, which is imposed on the departure of a person from Australia, is collected by airlines and shipping companies at the time of ticket sales and then remitted to the Commonwealth in accordance with arrangements entered into under section 10 of the Passenger Movement Charge Collection Act 1978. It is worth while remembering that this fee is collected by the airlines and shipping companies. Because of the nature of the airline industry, where tickets for travel are sold up to 12 months in advance the increase will only apply to tickets sold on or after 1 July 2001.
Senators Schacht and McLucas raised questions about whether all of the $8 increase in the passenger movement charge will be spent on increased screening for foot-and-mouth disease and other exotic pests and diseases. The $8 increase is expected to raise $279 million over four years. Over that period, the costs of Customs and the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service increasing quarantine inspections for air passengers only will be $283 million. So the money raised from this will fall some $4 million short of matching the cost of quarantine for airline passengers. All of the increased revenue will be used to offset the costs of Customs and AQIS for increased inspections for these airline passengers. It will not be used for mail and cargo inspections—I make that clear.
Senator Ridgeway on behalf of the Democrats raised a number of issues. He raised the question: what will we do with this when the threat of foot-and-mouth has passed? We have a program in place for four years and I believe that is an appropriate period of time to look at this. We will make a decision as to what to do with this measure. The government, from the information we have from the overseas experience and the great threat that foot-and-mouth poses to Australia, believe that the course of action that has been taken is entirely appropriate. We would reject any assertion that this is a half-hearted attempt at dealing with foot-and-mouth. It is the most comprehensive action taken by any government in relation to quarantine at the border. As a result of that increased inspection and scrutiny there will of course be other effects, including increased rate of detection of illicit drugs and other prohibited substances.
I now turn to the second reading amendment proposed by Senator Ridgeway on behalf of the Democrats. Paragraph (a) of that amendment calls for the charge to be commissionable, thereby encouraging overseas travel agents to comply with the charge regime. The issue of commission is a matter between the airline and the agent who sells the ticket. There are international agreements through the International Air Transport Association that cover the rules for the sale of airline tickets. Under the IATA rules, charges and taxes are not commissionable. The Australian government does not have the jurisdiction to require a foreign airline to pay commission to a foreign travel agent. We would have to rely on the foreign airline's cooperation to achieve that and, as has been said earlier, that is a matter between the airline and the travel agent. As an example, in a transaction between a travel agent in Italy who is selling a ticket on Lauda Air, a company based in Austria, for travel to and from Australia we would not have the jurisdiction but would have to rely on the cooperation of the travel agent and the airline. That is the reason why there are international agreements covering the sale of tickets. No single jurisdiction would be able to cover the details of these transactions.
There is a high level of compliance by travel agents under the charge regime. A recent report by the Australian National Audit Office indicated the Australian Customs Service collected 98 per cent of the expected revenue from the passenger movement charge. There is no evidence that any extra encouragement is required to increase compliance. At that level, you would have to agree that there is no reason for this. A commission rate of, say, 10 per cent would cost the Australian community around $30 million a year. That is $30 million that could not be spent on fighting foot-and-mouth disease. Why would the Australian taxpayer want to pay a commission to foreign travel agents when they do no additional work to collect the charge, which is just built into the price of the ticket? We would be forgoing that 10 per cent which could equate to $30 million that could be spent in Australia on fighting foot-and-mouth.
With respect to point (b) of the second reading amendment, I make the point that foot-and-mouth measures will also benefit the tourism industry. One only has to look at the examples overseas, particularly the United Kingdom. Tourism has suffered greatly as a result of the crisis with foot-and-mouth in that country. The tourism industry in Australia has more than a vested interest in Australia remaining clean and green, and in particular free from foot-and-mouth disease. Foot-and-mouth disease would be absolutely catastrophic for a country like Australia. One can only imagine the nightmare that would develop if foot-and-mouth gained a hold in Australia. In this particular instance, these measures are entirely appropriate.
In bringing about these measures, the government does not want to make any increase any greater than is needed. What was assessed as needed was what we have put in place. It was worked out that an $8 increase was appropriate. I believe that there is no reason to increase the amount of $8. That increase in the passenger movement charge will be sufficient for us to maintain an appropriate—
—Can't you incorporate this? We've got two bills to go and we want to get home tonight.
—If the Democrats are agreeable to incorporation, I will seek leave to incorporate the rest of my speech, but I thought Senator Ridgeway wanted to hear from the government on the reasons for opposing the amendment. I will abide by the chamber's wishes. I seek leave to have the rest of my speech incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted. 
The speech read as follows—
An outbreak of FMD would be an unprecedented tragedy for the tourism industry. British Tourism Authorities estimate foreign tourism revenue losses as high as 3 billion pounds.
It is only fair that the tourism industry, along with other sectors, contributes to funding FMD measures which will help keep Australia's image as a “clean and green destination”.
Indeed, the total costs of FMD measures well and truly exceed what the industry will contribute through the PMC increase.
The Government is very conscious of maintaining Australia's image and reputation as a welcoming and healthy destination for tourists to visit, and this funding measure will contribute to that.
Let me also say that the Government is funding the Australian Tourist Commission at record levels.
The Government has just delivered the fourth instalment of $91.9 million of the record ATC allocation of $361 million over four years, to bolster Australia's position in the international market place.
These record levels of Government funding and the ATC marketing performance have delivered unprecedented inbound tourism growth.
A record 4.9 million overseas visitors arrived in Australia in 2000. This is an increase of 11% over 1999.
The ATC's global 2001 strategy includes the launch of over 90 tactical advertising campaigns, worth more than $45 million involving 200 industry partners, promoting holiday packages to potential visitors and an aggressive $6 million direct marketing campaign.
With the appointment of Mr Ken Boundy as the new Managing Director of the ATC, the organisation is very well placed to convert the unprecedented interest in Australia, after the Olympics, into visitor arrivals and expenditure.
As I said before, and for all of these reasons, the Government will oppose the Democrats second reading amendment.
I commend the Bill to the Senate.
—I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,2001-06-28,"—Given the short time remaining and the need to finish the second reading of this bill, I will be brief, but I want to make some points, particularly about the first item in the Health Legislation Amendment (Medical Practitioners' Qualifications and Other Measures) Bill 2001. It is really the main item dealt with in this legislation, and that is the sunset clause. I can deal more fully with pathology collection centres in the committee stage. 
I put the sunset clause into this legislation in 1996 to make sure that we could monitor the impact of the new requirement, which was for general practitioners to train as general practitioners. All other medical specialties have a period of training after basic medical school requirements have been met. In 1996 the government's wish was to bring GP training in line with that, and we supported that. Now I would argue it is time to ensure that general practice stays in line with that requirement. It is time to ensure that general practice will be in the future treated as a specialty in its own right—treated as a specific and important area of medical practice that does need dedicated training. 
From the ALP speech in the second reading debate last night and from their amendments, I understand that the Labor Party want to avoid fully debating this issue at this time. Their proposed amendments would see the sunset clause extended for yet another year. Basically, they would delay all of this and keep everybody happy—keep the AMA happy—until a convenient time after the next election. But I am not quite sure, looking at what they plan to do, whether people will be terribly happy. As I will say in a minute, we have been through the various organisations interested in this legislation, and most of them do want us to make a decision, and make a decision now. 
Let us go back for a moment to 1996 and the doomsday predictions that were about then on the legislative changes. They really did scare many of the young medical students who were at that stage studying. It was a scare campaign run by the AMA, and it very much involved the Labor Party. They talked of hundreds of unemployed student doctors, of student doctors and doctors having to work as taxidrivers and of a shortage of training places. Fortunately, the scare campaign did not work, because the legislation got through, but also very fortunately it was proved to be nothing more than that—a scare campaign. None of that has come to fruition. Those scare campaigns were completely unfounded. 
Even more important now is that many of those who lobbied us and said to us, `Don't pass this legislation' now have come back to us and said, `We don't want to go back to the pre-1996 days. We actually want general practice to be treated as a specialty in its own right.' These organisations include the AMA, although, as I will say later, and certainly at the committee stage, they are not completely happy with removing the sunset clause. The Australian Medical Students Association have lined up with them. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, the Australian Divisions of General Practice, the Confederation of Postgraduate Medical Education Councils, the GP Registrars Association and the General Practice Partnership Advisory Council basically want us to have it over and done with and make our decision now.
The Democrats' 1996 amendments ensured that today's debate could actually take place—and take place on the basis of an informed level of decision making, on the basis of real information being provided. What I put in that legislation was a medical training review panel. We are very pleased to say that the government has now changed its original intent in this new bill and is going to fully support the retention of the Medical Training Review Panel. From my years as Democrat health spokesperson, I think this is one of my key achievements. It is essential that we know who is being trained, which colleges they are being trained in, how many women are getting opportunities and how many people are training part time. I am not saying it is all solved, by any means: there are still problems, and I will deal with those in the committee stage. Who is training, or who is getting into the colleges, and who is actually passing are issues we still have to deal with. But I am very pleased to see the way in which the Medical Training Review Panel has worked. 
In stark contrast to Labor's opposition back then, and now their delaying tactics, the Democrats have spent the past three years working with government and industry to encourage proposals which would assist in alleviating problems related to medical work force issues. 
In terms of opportunities for medical trainees and new graduates to experience general practice before they make the decision as to whether or not they are going to train in that area, there are opportunities now. This is the major stumbling block for the AMA. I understand their concerns. We are not walking away from this issue; it stays alive under our amendments. But there is a range of opportunities now for new doctors to experience this. They can go out into the Rural and Remote Area Placement Program. That now has 100 places and provides an avenue through which they can have three months and get GP experience while on rotation from hospitals. This program got $3 million for its implementation and over three years will involve 20 pilot sites across Australia. It is a link to either rural general practice or rural hospitals.
Secondly, there is the Rural Locum Relief and the Approved Medical Deputising Services programs. These also provide avenues through which experience can be gained by new doctors in a rural environment. While not specifically focusing on providing a substitute for postgraduate training, these programs do allow junior doctors to gain a better understanding of general practice. Concerns have been raised regarding the level of supervision in these programs, and we can address that in the committee stage later.
General work experience placements are also available, as they are for teachers and for nurses. There are some issues relating to this, and again we can go through this in the committee stage, to look at how voluntary work can be linked in with the clinics and the doctors' practices that are prepared to provide that. Indeed, I am confident that many community health services, small general practices and community general practices will be keen to share their knowledge and experience with young, or indeed older, graduates—any new graduates. There is a need to better coordinate this.
I am also very pleased to see the government's commitment to the AMWAC longitudinal study of medical graduates' attitudes to training and career choices, and that work has also been undertaken on the shortage of doctors in 24-hour clinics and deputising services. The government has provided $20 million for reforming general practice with a view to encouraging practice amalgamations, and we must see this funding continue.
Some flexibility has also been provided in the recruitment by deputising services of doctors who are subject to provider number restrictions. These services must already provide close supervision of these doctors; they must offer them support. That is another area we will need to come back to in the committee stage. There has also been significant progress on addressing the staffing pressures experienced by private hospitals' accident and emergency units. In negotiations with the College of Accident and Emergency Medicine and the Australian Private Hospitals Association, the government has developed guidelines for an approved private emergency department program, and that will hopefully be released very shortly.
All of these initiatives contribute significantly to improving the quality of GP training and reducing doctor shortages. We have tried at all times to work cooperatively with government, while keeping a very close eye on what they are doing and the outcomes. We have had some discussions with the government regarding this particular piece of legislation and we will be moving a batch of amendments. In particular, I am keen to see that the Medical Training Review Panel is formally retained and, with this in mind, that is one of the key amendments we propose.
We want to continue a two-year independent review of the provider number restrictions and require the holding of a junior doctors summit within three months of the tabling of the independent review in parliament. This is to be hosted by the panel, and I have amendments dealing with that—presumably later this afternoon or tonight we will get to those. The Democrats believe that it is important to retain oversight mechanisms relating to the provider number restrictions so as to ensure that there is continual improvement in the system. We also believe quite strongly that students need to be more actively involved in the actual process of planning their futures as fully qualified doctors. I believe that a junior doctors summit will alleviate some of the pressure and the problems that junior doctors are experiencing, particularly as many of them feel at the moment that they are unheard. That will be an opportunity for them to have their voices heard.
We have also gained from the government a commitment to actively monitor some of the concerns raised by those in the medical industry during the course of the debate over the provider number legislation. These include better monitoring of the demand for places in the rural and remote area placement program. I think there could well be an opportunity to expand this. I understand that it is already facing some vacancies that are unfilled, but there needs to be better monitoring. As well, we are keen for the government to be actively monitoring the adequacy of the supervision arrangements in the Rural Locum Relief and Approved Medical Deputising Services programs and we will need to discuss in detail the Labor amendments in this area. We believe, in brief, that a strict legislative regime could actually see fewer—indeed, in some cases no—doctors available and we believe an oversight approach would achieve a lot more. We are very keen to facilitate better work experience outcomes for junior doctors, as I said, and this will again be dealt with later.
The government has agreed to examine with state and territory governments the feasibility of establishing formal structures which would link those general practices offering to support voluntary work experience placements with the junior doctors wanting to undertake them. We also would support further investigation of the possibility of direct grants to supervising GP practices to compensate them for the costs of taking on a junior trainee as part of a hospital rotation. Also I think we need to look at some funding for the hospitals to ensure that they can release junior doctors—in other words, some compensation—but this will need to be negotiated with the states and territories.
In summary, we will be supporting the full removal of the sunset clause—not delaying this debate again, but making it clear that we do not want to risk at all going back to the pre-1996 days of general practice basically being a situation where you could go and hang up a shingle without any specialist training. Given the timing of a potential election, to see this legislation not dealt with in this sitting was also a considerable risk—a risk that we may never have got to the sunset clause before we actually had it lapsing. As for the pathology sections of this bill, I will deal with all of that in the committee stage of the debate. 
I just finish my comments by saying that we are very pleased to have been vindicated in relation to our initial decision to support this legislation. We are not saying, however, that there are not some problems. We still have some way to go before we have anything like sufficient doctors in rural areas and, indeed, quite a way to go before we have sufficient doctors in many of our outer metropolitan general practices. I think we should be having a debate as to how the minister's figures are arrived at in terms of actually how many doctors we need in this country. I suspect the way in which the government is counting doctors leaves a lot to be desired, and I will continue my remarks as we get into the committee stage.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS' QUALIFICATIONS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2001-06-28,"—I seek leave to incorporate my response to Senator Evans and Senator Lees and I will circulate it to them.
Leave granted.
The response read as follows—
Qualification requirements and the sunset clause
This bill has two main parts and I will address the sunset clause to begin with.
In debating this bill in the House of Representatives the member for Jagajaga said:
“it is not appropriate for young doctors who are not fully registered to have unrestricted Medicare provider numbers, as they are still going through paid training to acquire the full range of skills that they need as a specialist or general practitioner.
I take this to mean that the opposition agrees that the provider number restrictions have improved the quality of general practice in Australia. The removal of the sunset clause will support this improvement.
The negative impacts that were anticipated to arise from the provider number restrictions have not been realised. However, this government will continue to rely upon the medical training review panel to monitor and report on postgraduate training. The panel's operation will continue to be funded and it will continue to publish its reports.
One of the most significant fears that doctors had at the time that legislation was introduced was that they would not be able to get access to postgraduate training places.
The reports of the Medical Training Review Panel and the independent midterm review of the legislation have provided much needed data about the structure of the medical workforce and have shown that for the past few years, growth in the number of available training places has meant that more places than ever are available.
In 2000 a number of specialties, including rehabilitation medicine, geriatric medicine and intensive care, were unable to fill all available training positions. These figures undoubtedly demonstrate that there are more postgraduate training places than there are medical graduates.
The reality is that some specialities are more attractive than others but the Australian community needs access to appropriate numbers of graduates from all specialities.
Long term projects such as the bonded scholarships, new clinical schools and the rural and remote general practice program will give doctors incentives to become familiar with rural practice. The qualification requirements are a key part of this package. This incentive to new graduates to seek postgraduate general practice or specialist training will encourage them to acquire the skills to work independently. The government believes that this package of incentives creates the environment for more Australian doctors to voluntarily take up the challenge of rural general practice.
Pathology
To sum up the amendments relating to pathology in this bill, the new arrangements will introduce a national system of approvals of specimen collection centres under the MBS arrangements that applies to both the public and private sectors and:
is fair and open and encourages competition;
allows for controlled growth;
introduces requirements around quality collection services and facilities that have been developed by the pathology profession and will be overseen by the health insurance commission;
offers a three for one incentive to APAS that choose to set  up collection centres in rural and remote areas; and
does not affect collection services operated by recognised  hospitals on their premises. Nor does it affect community  based collection centres for public pathology services
I commend this bill to the Senate.

"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,2001-06-28,"—My question is to the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp.

"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,2001-06-28,"—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. I note the minister's response. Minister, can you confirm that many business tax changes, including the simplified tax system, the unified capital allowances system, the thin capitalisation rules and a new test to distinguish debt from equity are due to commence in a few days? Why is it that, with the GST about to celebrate its first birthday, consumers and businesses are still having to cope with complex administrative changes and delayed rulings from the tax office?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Rulings</title>,Questions Without Notice,31,1,question
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2001-06-28,"—I thank Senator Murphy for this question. Senator Murphy always shows a great interest in tax office matters. Sometimes he gets it right and sometimes he gets it wrong.
—You'll be able to say when you find your brief.
—I have now found my brief, Senator Ray.
—I was trying to help you.
—Thank you very much. That would be the first time you have ever tried to help, Senator Ray. That is certainly welcome. I do not know whether one can interpret from that that goodwill is breaking out all over. I rather doubt that, to be quite frank.
Senator Murphy's question touches on a number of articles which have appeared in the newspaper. There seem to be four areas of concern: sale of businesses, long-term leases, importation of intangibles and exporting services. The commissioner has issued private binding rulings to entities who have sought clarification on how the GST law applies to arrangements in this area. Senator Murphy, you are looking puzzled. It is all right. The commission has issued a number of major rulings clarifying issues in this area. I want you to listen very carefully, Senator, because I am worried about your supplementary question. It may be covered in this answer.
After extensive consultation with industry, the final version of draft ruling GSTR 2001/D2, issued on 28 February 2001, concerning when supply of a going concern is GST free, will be issued in July 2001. Another ruling, GSTR 2000/16, issued on 7 June 2000, addressing transitional arrangements for GST-free supplies under existing arrangements, included leases. GSTR 2000/31, issued on 30 June 2000, dealt with supplies connected with Australia and addressed issues related to imports and exports.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Madam President, I thought the question from Senator Murphy was an important question. I would appreciate a bit of silence so that I can provide that answer to him.
—There is a lot of background noise in the chamber.
—Thank you, Madam President. I am not surprised that the Labor Party does not show much interest in Senator Murphy's question, but I get a bit worried when my own side loses interest! The ATO has established a number of industry partnerships to address priority issues identified by peak bodies. In particular, the work through the property and import-export industries has identified a number of complex issues to be addressed. The ATO is currently working on a draft ruling, expected to be issued in August, on the export of goods. The commissioner also proposes to issue a draft ruling in September which will address a number of issues related to `supply of things other than goods or real property for consumption outside Australia'.
This government is very conscious, as is the tax office, of the need to provide certainty. The transition to a new tax system always poses particular challenges.

The answer read as follows—
SENATOR BRIAN HARRADINE - 25 June 2001
SYDNEY IVF AND MEDICARE PAYMENTS
Senator HARRADINE - My question is directed to the Minister for Health and Aged Care.  The Bulletin says that Sydney IVF is offering to couples pre-implementation genetic testing for sex selection for personal reasons.  What is the government going to do about that?  I also draw the minister's attention to the Compass program last night which documented the concerns of people with disability about genetic screening and abortion, and highlighted the importance of understanding disability as different, rather than inherent tragedy.  I ask the minister: what is the government's policy of prenatal screening and abortion on the grounds of disability? How are people with disabilities involved in the formulation of government policy on this matter?
Senator HARRADINE - Madam President, I ask a supplementary question.  I asked specifically in an area of competence of the federal government - on Medicare.  Will the minister representing the minister give an absolute guarantee to this chamber that for those procedures of sex selection for personal reasons - have a look at their website - Sydney IVF will not be paid by the taxpayer?   I ask the minister also: why has it been so long in filling the vacancy in the Health Ethics Committee of a person with an understanding of the concerns of people with a disability?  When will that position be filled?  I ask the minister to assure the Senate that the Australian Health Ethics Committee position will be filled quickly and that an evidence based approach, bearing in mind the experience, credentials and standing of the nominees for this position, be taken.  I ask the minister to assure the Senate on those two points, please.
Senator VANSTONE - The Minister for Health and Aged Care has provided the following answers to the Honourable Senator's questions: 
Responsibility for enacting legislation relating to the use of pre-implantation genetic testing lies with each State and Territory Governments.  The NHMRC has recommended that all States and Territories implement consistent legislation to regulate assisted reproductive technologies (ART).  This will avoid the situation where the laws relating to these issues may vary from State to State.  In relation to IVF, three states (Victoria, South Australian and Western Australia) have legislation and the others have stated their intention of enacting legislation in the area of assisted reproductive technology (ART).
At the 8 June 2001, meeting of the Council of Australian Governments, the Council agreed that jurisdictions will work towards nationally consistent approaches to regulate assisted reproductive technology and related emerging human technologies.  In reaching agreement on this latter issue, Heads of Government were acutely aware of the need to engage the community on these very important matters and to ensure that all sectors of the community benefit fully from advances in medical science while prohibiting unacceptable practices.
The matter of whether Medicare benefits are payable for genetic testing associated with assisted reproductive technologies, is also a very important, but separate matter.
Medicare benefits are only payable for clinically relevant services provided within the laws of the State/Territory in which the service is provided. A clinically relevant service means a service rendered by a medical practitioner that is accepted in the medical profession as being clinically necessary for the appropriate treatment of the patient to whom it is rendered.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Medicare: Prenatal Genetic Screening</title>,Questions Without Notice,32,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2001-06-28,"—I present the government's response to the report of the Legal and Constitutional References Committee entitled Healing: a legacy of generations, a report of the inquiry into the federal government's implementation of recommendations made by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in Bringing them home. I seek leave to incorporate the document in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The response read as follows—
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO HEALING: A LEGACY OF GENERATIONS
The Report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee Inquiry into the Federal Government's Implementation of Recommendations Made by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in Bringing Them Home
The federal government is committed to addressing the traumatic legacy of past practices of indigenous child separation.  There is no doubt that these practices represent a tragic part of Australia's history.  The government has recognised that, viewed from a present day perspective, these practices were misguided and caused great suffering, and has established programmes to assist those affected to move forward.
In responding to the Bringing Them Home report, the government noted that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission identified family reunion as “the most significant and urgent need of separated families”.  This is central to the government's response announced in December 1997, which included a $63 million package of measures designed to assist families with the provision of counselling and parenting programmes and family tracing and reunion services.  Other elements of the package included an oral history project, improved access to Commonwealth records for those tracing their past, and language and culture maintenance programmes.  Building on this initial package of initiatives, the government will provide ongoing funding of $44 million over a further four years for its parenting programmes, counselling services and support and training for mental health counsellors.  It will also provide an additional $9.9 million over an extra four years for Link Up services.
The federal government has considered the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee's report on its Inquiry into the government's implementation of the Bringing Them Home report's recommendations.  The Committee did not produce a consensus report.  The Majority Report of the non-government members of the Committee contains ten recommendations, of which nine are relevant to the Commonwealth.  The government supports, either in full or in part, five of these nine recommendations.  We agree with the Committee's first majority recommendation that it is timely to evaluate the original response to Bringing Them Home by all relevant parties.  We agree that it is vital that programmes and services be monitored and coordinated to ensure that the needs of those still suffering the effects of family separations are being met, and we can point to relevant policies already agreed or in place.  We agree that it is important that the events of the past and their legacy be acknowledged.  In addition, therefore, we are pleased to advise that in the 2001-02 Budget the government allocated funding beyond 30 June 2002 for key family reunion and health services at a further cost of $53.9 million over four years to 30 June 2006.
The government's response to each of the Senate Committee's individual recommendations follows.
Response to Majority (non-government Senators) Report recommendations
Recommendation 1 - The Committee recommends that the federal government, in conjunction with state and territory governments, commission an independent evaluation of the progress of initiatives implemented by governments in response to the Bringing Them Home report.  The independent evaluator should present its report within six months of the federal government's response to the report of this inquiry.
Supported, although the timeframe proposed may be insufficient to allow detailed consultation.
The Ministerial Council for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (MCATSIA) currently monitors progress of all jurisdictions in implementing their responses to the Bringing Them Home report.  Although it produces an annual cross-jurisdictional progress report, MCATSIA has not commissioned a formal, independent evaluation of progress.
The government will propose to MCATSIA that it sponsor an independent evaluation of all government and non-government responses to Bringing Them Home, to be coordinated by the Department of Reconciliation and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs.  This will be undertaken in consultation with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), as the government's principal source of advice from an indigenous perspective.
Recommendation 2 - The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth convene a Summit meeting twelve months from the date of the federal government's response to this inquiry, to coordinate and address the issues and recommendations identified in this report.
Supported in part.
The government agrees that it is important that there be a forum for discussion of issues related to indigenous family separations.  There are existing forums for this, however.
ATSIC already holds annual national workshops for Link Up staff to discuss common issues.  In addition, the second National Stolen Generations Conference was held in March 2001 to discuss a range of issues relevant to those affected by indigenous child separation.  Conference delegates included a number of stakeholders such as the Secretariat of National Aboriginal and Islander Child Care, the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation, the National Aboriginal and Islander Legal Services Secretariat, and individuals with direct experience of family separation.  These conferences, hosted by indigenous organisations, are planned to be held approximately every two years.  
There is also already a number of other mechanisms in place which serve to coordinate government responses to the Bringing Them Home report and provide opportunities for those affected by child separation practices to have a voice.  For example, MCATSIA has the separated children issue as a standing agenda item for consideration at its meetings.  It also publishes an annual progress report on Commonwealth and state and territory government responses to the Bringing Them Home report.  A study of best practice models in relation to contemporary child separation practices is also being undertaken in that context.
The government has implemented its health initiatives in partnership with indigenous communities and the states and territories.  The counselling, counselling support, and parenting initiatives in response to Bringing Them Home have been implemented under State/Territory Partnership Forums which include representation from ATSIC and the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation, as well as the relevant state/territory governments.
Community consultation regarding the archives project to improve access to Commonwealth records continues through an Aboriginal Advisory Group made up of community representatives in Darwin.  A similar group is being established in Melbourne.  (The relevant Commonwealth records are largely confined to the Northern Territory and Victoria, for historical reasons).
Recommendation 3 - The Committee recommends that recommendation 5a of Bringing Them Home be fulfilled by the Australian Parliament, and that a `Motion of National Apology and Reconciliation' be settled following wide consultation with individual members of the Stolen Generation and representatives of stolen generation organisations.
Supported in principle.
Both Houses of Federal Parliament passed the government's Motion of Reconciliation on 26 August 1999.  The motion acknowledged that the “mistreatment of many indigenous Australians over a significant period represents the most blemished chapter in our international history” and expressed the Federal Parliament's “deep and sincere regret that indigenous Australians suffered injustices under the practices of past generations, and for the hurt and trauma that many indigenous people continue to feel as a consequence of these practices.”
The motion also reaffirmed a whole-hearted commitment to the cause of reconciliation between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians as an important national priority for all Australians.
The period when indigenous family separations took place represents a lasting and tragic phase in our nation's history.  The government is very aware of the continuing hurt suffered by those affected by these past practices, and is committed to addressing its consequences.
Recommendation 4 - The Committee recommends, as a gesture of good faith, as in the case of the Parliament of the Australian Capital Territory, that the Northern Territory Parliament make a formal apology to members of the Stolen Generation.  The form of words for such an apology should be decided in consultation with representative members of the stolen generation in the Northern Territory.
This is a matter for the Northern Territory government.
Recommendation 5 - The Committee recommends the Commonwealth Government consult with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, Reconciliation Australia, members of the Stolen Generation and their representative organisations with a view to establishing a national memorial.
Supported in principle.
In May 2000, the Prime Minister announced plans to construct Reconciliation Place in the national capital's Parliamentary Triangle thereby demonstrating the government's commitment to the ongoing process of reconciliation.  It is to be an interpretative pathway linking the National Library with the High Court and National Gallery.
As noted by the Prime Minister, Reconciliation Place will acknowledge the history and significant achievements of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and incorporate an acknowledgment of the separation of indigenous children from their families.
The design for the project was determined through an open competition in the first half of 2001.  The winning design has been chosen and the project is scheduled to be completed by the end of the year.  The Steering Committee for the project is co-chaired by Dr Evelyn Scott and Mr Ian Spicer AM, and includes a majority of indigenous members.  ATSIC, the Torres Strait Regional Authority (TSRA), other relevant organisations and the local Ngun(n)awal community are being consulted regarding the project.
Recommendation 6 - The Committee recommends that the Government take steps to implement an effective and independent coordination and monitoring process for all programs which address the needs of members of the Stolen Generation.  This process should take into account the recommendations of Bringing Them Home and the recommendations and conclusions of this report.
Supported in part.
The government acknowledges the importance of monitoring and coordinating efforts to address the legacy of past policies and practices of indigenous family separation, and of ensuring that these programmes and services are more effective in meeting the needs of indigenous people affected by those policies and practices.
The Ministerial Council for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs already undertakes this coordination and monitoring role.  The Council comprises Commonwealth, State and Territory Aboriginal Affairs Ministers, along with the Chairs of ATSIC and TSRA, and the Head of the Australian Local Government Association.  The issue of government responses to the Bringing Them Home report is a standing agenda item for MCATSIA meetings.  MCATSIA publishes an annual report on the progress of government initiatives in response to Bringing Them Home.  In 2000 it also published a compilation of all jurisdictions' responses.
Furthermore, the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) has undertaken to monitor outcomes of all indigenous-specific programmes and services, and government responses to the Bringing Them Home report will therefore be incorporated in this process.  (See response below to recommendation 2.5 of the Australian Democrats' Minority Report).
Recommendation 7 - The Committee recommends the establishment of a `Reparations Tribunal' to address the need for an effective process of reparation, including the provision of individual monetary compensation.
Not supported.
The government's position on this matter has been clearly stated in its original submission to the HREOC Inquiry and in its submission to this Inquiry.  The government's $63 million package of initiatives (increasing to $117 million after 30 June 2002) to assist those affected by past practices of removal to, among other things, be reunited with their families and receive counselling and support for the pain they have suffered, represents a more practical way to assist in healing the suffering caused by past practices of family separation.  The Bringing Them Home report itself asserted that family reunion, not financial compensation, is “the most significant and urgent need of separated families”.
The government considers that establishing a tribunal with the comprehensive jurisdiction and extensive powers suggested would neither guarantee a less stressful consideration of matters nor less expense for either party than court proceedings.  The same complex and costly legal and factual issues would need to be addressed in order to assess individual claims and such decisions would still be open to further judicial review.  The experience of other administrative tribunals, including in the field of immigration and refugees, illustrates that it is not possible to insulate such deliberations from legal challenges and procedures.  The Dissenting Report of the Government Senators on the Committee also highlights the fundamental practical problems associated with the operation of a compensation tribunal in this context.  This includes the basic question of defining what circumstances and which affected individuals would or would not qualify for compensation.
Additionally, State governments are responsible for the laws which were in place in their jurisdictions during the period that indigenous child removals took place.  No state government has offered to pay monetary compensation or establish such a tribunal.  It is a matter for the non-government organisations involved in the removal and care of children to respond to compensation claims addressed to their actions.
Recommendation 8 - The Committee recommends that the Tribunal model put forward by the Public Interest Advocacy Centre of NSW be used as a general template for the recommended tribunal.  The model should consider the most effective ways to deal with issues of reparation.
See response to recommendation 7.
Recommendation 9 - The Committee recommends that details of the form and operations of the tribunal be finalised following consultation at the proposed National Summit.
See responses to recommendations 7 and 2.
Recommendation 10 - The Committee recommends that as soon as practicable after the tabling of this report, appropriate consultations should be held with representatives of the Stolen Generation and their organisations, including ATSIC, with a view to finalising an agenda for the proposed National Summit.
See response to recommendation 2.
Response to Minority Report recommendations by the Australian Democrats
Recommendation 1.1 - The Australian Democrats recommend that all of the recommendations contained in the Majority Report on the Stolen Generations be implemented as a matter of urgency.
See responses to the Majority Report recommendations.
Recommendation 2.1 - The Australian Democrats recommend that the federal government, in consultation with the stolen generations and their representative organisations, significantly increase the funding package to implement the government's response to the recommendations of the BTH Report to ensure that the needs of the stolen generations are fully addressed.  These negotiations should be a key element of the National Summit on the Stolen Generations, as proposed in the Majority Report.
Supported in relation to funding.
The government will provide ongoing funding of $44 million over a further four years for its parenting programmes, counselling services,  and support and training for mental health counsellors.  It will also provide an additional $9.9 million over an extra four years for Link Up services.  This is a significant boost to the government's original response to Bringing Them Home, bringing the government's total contribution to $117 million.
The government does not support a national summit, although it does recognise that there should be a forum for people to discuss issues related to indigenous child separation.  The government believes such fora already exist - see response to Majority Report recommendation 2.
Recommendation 2.2 - The Australian Democrats recommend that the federal government's funding package to implement the recommendations of the BTH Report should be ongoing and subject to review in terms of its adequacy by the independent auditing body referred to in Recommendation 2.6 below.
Supported.  See response to 2.1 above, and note that some of the government's original initiatives such as the oral history and archiving projects do not require further funding as they are finite projects.  See also response to recommendation 1 of the Majority Report.
Recommendation 2.3 - The Australian Democrats recommend the establishment of a mediation process and/or series of conferences by ATSIC to resolve a range of outstanding issues between the stolen generations communities, their representative organisations and Indigenous community organisations in the Northern Territory.  This should occur in advance of the Indigenous consultations referred to in Recommendation 10 of the Majority Report.
Supported.
Mediation between the competing interests for Link Up funding in the Northern Territory occurred in July and August 1999 and continued during 2000.  ATSIC staff have undertaken mediation sessions between the interested parties on a number of occasions and have used an independent facilitator to assist.  The government understands that ATSIC was unable to gain representation of all interested parties at the mediation sessions.
ATSIC has continued to attempt to resolve differences between the representative organisations and will continue the mediation process until a satisfactory resolution has been reached.
Recommendation 2.4 - The Australian Democrats recommend that the Churches proceed with their plans to establish their own compensation fund to facilitate the delivery of reparations, including compensation, to the stolen generations, their families and communities, in accordance with the recommendations of the BTH Report.
This is a matter for the Churches to consider.
Recommendation 2.5 - The Australian Democrats recommend, in acknowledgment of the enormity of the problems faced by the stolen generations throughout Australia, that COAG take up the responsibility of ensuring the delivery of a coordinated, effective whole-of-government response to the recommendations contained in the BTH Report.
Supported in part.
On 3 November 2000, COAG agreed to commit to a new approach to addressing indigenous disadvantage, based on partnerships and shared responsibilities, programme flexibility and coordination amongst agencies.  The focus is to be at the community level, to increase community capacity.  The Prime Minister has written to Chairs of Ministerial Councils and to relevant Commonwealth Ministers asking them to implement COAG's decisions.  Ministerial Councils will develop action plans and performance monitoring strategies, and report to COAG on progress in late 2001.  MCATSIA will coordinate the work of Ministerial Councils in implementing the COAG decision.
However, the government does not see a role for COAG specifically in relation to the response to Bringing Them Home.  MCATSIA is composed of Aboriginal Affairs Ministers in each state and territory, and the ATSIC and TSRA Chairs.  It is a forum in which members can consider relevant government activities and discuss issues of mutual interest.  The Council aims to achieve a coordinated approach to the planning, funding and provision of services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.  It is therefore logical that MCATSIA should continue to coordinate and monitor the responses of all jurisdictions to the Bringing Them Home report, as it has been doing since August 1997.  The MCATSIA officials' working party is convened and chaired by ATSIC.
Recommendation 2.6 - The Australian Democrats support Recommendation 1 of the Majority Report, relating to the need for the federal government, in conjunction with state and territory governments, to commission an independent evaluation of the progress of initiatives implemented by governments in response to the BTH Report.
Supported.
See response to Recommendation 1 of the Majority Report.
Recommendation 2.7 - We further add that periodic independent audits of governments' initiatives are required no less than every three years to ensure that the needs and aspirations of the stolen generations are being satisfactorily addressed.
Supported in part.
The government acknowledges the need to ensure that programmes and services targeted to people separated as children are delivered appropriately and effectively.  It is important that the government be accountable for its initiatives.
Government programmes are already subject to ongoing review and evaluation.  Commonwealth and state and territory government programmes are subject to internal review.  In addition, the Australian National Audit Office regularly undertakes performance audits of Commonwealth government programmes, just as state and territory Auditors-General audit programmes in their jurisdictions.
These ongoing audits of government programmes, in conjunction with MCATSIA's monitoring and reporting role, provide adequate assessment of the efficiency and effectiveness of government initiatives in response to Bringing Them Home.  In addition, the government has reported on the progress of its Bringing Them Home initiatives on a six-monthly basis, and, in line with Recommendation 1 of the Majority Report, will be arranging for an evaluation of its programmes established in response to Bringing Them Home.
Recommendation 2.8 - The Australian Democrats recommend that Recommendations 44-54 of the BTH Report be actioned as a matter of urgency to ensure that adequate national legislation is implemented which establishes minimum standards of treatment and protection of all Indigenous children and other children as appropriate (national standards legislation).
Not supported in relation to national legislation, but the adoption of consistent best practice standards by state and territory governments is encouraged.
In 1997, the Commonwealth/State/Territory Ministerial Council on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs agreed that jurisdictions would implement their own standards as they see fit.  In the interests of consistency however, MCATSIA has established a working group to identify best practice models in the juvenile justice and child welfare systems for jurisdictions to use as benchmarks.  ATSIC is managing this project.
Recommendation 2.9 - The Australian Democrats recommend that the Commonwealth provide full and just reparations to the stolen generations, their families and communities as soon as is practicable.  This recommendation should be carried out in conjunction with all other recommendations contained in this Minority Report.  Collectively, these recommendations constitute the minimum acceptable response required to heal the legacy borne by the stolen generations, their families and communities.
The government does not support a reparations tribunal.  See response to recommendation 7 of the Majority Report.
The government considers it most important to allow those affected by past practices to be assisted in finding their families, and to receive counselling and support for the trauma they have experienced.  It has therefore focused its response on addressing these needs.
Apart from the provision of family reunion and counselling services, the government has implemented parenting programmes, language and culture maintenance programmes, improved access to Commonwealth records, and an oral history project through which people can tell their stories.
The Prime Minister proposed, and the Federal Parliament passed, the Motion of Reconciliation which acknowledged the suffering and trauma experienced by indigenous Australians caused by the practices of past generations.
Recommendation 3.1 - The Australian Democrats recommend that all parties involved in negotiations for the establishment of a Stolen Generations Tribunal examine the Veterans' Entitlement Act 1986 as a successful legal precedent for the relaxation of the normal requirements for establishing liability.
Not supported.
See response to recommendation 7 of the Majority Report. 
Recommendation 3.2 - The Australian Democrats recommend that all parties involved in negotiations for the establishment of a Stolen Generations Tribunal consider the inclusion of a mediation process in the operations of such a Tribunal.
See response to recommendation 7 of the Majority Report.
Recommendation 3.3 - The Australian Democrats recommend that all parties involved in the negotiations for the establishment of a Stolen Generations Tribunal consider the inclusion of an alternative dispute resolution mechanism in the operation of such a Tribunal.
See response to recommendation 7 of the Majority Report.
Recommendation 3.4 - The Australian Democrats recommend that the Administrative Review Council (or an equivalent body) prepare a report for tabling in the Australian Parliament on the appropriate model for a Stolen Generations Reparations Tribunal.  This report should draw extensively on the views of the stolen generations, their representative organisations, and the outcomes of the National Summit on the Stolen Generations.
See responses to recommendations 7 and 2 of the Majority Report.
Response to Government Senators' Dissenting Report recommendations
Recommendation 1 - That family reunion and associated support services continue to be the primary focus of government and non-government responses to the separated children experience; that those services be targeted specifically to those separated children.
Supported.
The government is continuing to focus its response to Bringing Them Home on family reunion and support services, by extending funding for the Link Up and health initiatives.  This means the government will have contributed $117 million towards programmes to address the continuing trauma of past policies of indigenous child separation.
It is understandable that some separated children organisations feel they can provide the most appropriate services for those they represent, and that it would be better if the funds were distributed directly to them.  However, the government considers that this would unnecessarily limit the assistance available to those who require it.  The current organisations which provide Link Up and counselling services have access to an existing infrastructure and network which enables them to support their workers and provide related services to their clients. 
It is important that the government's initiatives are directed towards those who have been affected by family separation practices.  However, it is very difficult to differentiate between those who are accessing services because they were forcibly separated from their families as children, and those who are accessing services who may have been separated from their families for some other reason, but with nevertheless a very real need for assistance.  In the same way, it is difficult to identify the emotional and social issues which may cause someone to need mental health counselling, and to distinguish issues caused by past practices of indigenous child separation from other life affecting issues.
The government considers that, even if such a distinction were clinically possible and appropriate, it cannot adequately or reasonably make these distinctions in providing its family reunion and counselling services.  However, this does not mean that these services are not available to those affected by past practices of indigenous child separation.  The services are targeted to the broader group, that is all of those affected by past practices of removal, not necessarily only those who were removed as children.  The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission itself stated in Bringing Them Home that separation affected whole families and communities.
Recommendation 2 - That State governments and responsible non-government organisations, including the churches, be encouraged to give tangible as well as symbolic recognition to the needs of separated children.
Supported.
It is very important that the state and territory governments and non-government organisations, including churches, which were involved in past practices of indigenous child separation, acknowledge the part they played in this tragic part of our history, in substantial ways as well as through symbolic gestures.  As revealed in evidence to the Committee, while many governments and churches have made apologies, they have provided only modest tangible resources towards providing reparations.
As Chair of MCATSIA, the federal Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs wrote to the heads of the Anglican, Catholic, Uniting and Lutheran churches on 20 July 2000, asking them to provide reports on their responses to relevant recommendations of Bringing Them Home, for inclusion in the MCATSIA report on progress for 1999-2000.  In asking for this information, the Minister encouraged churches to develop relationships between themselves and Link Up services to facilitate access to church records by indigenous people trying to trace their families.  All of the church leaders have provided information for the report.
Moreover, the Commonwealth can work with the states and territories through MCATSIA to encourage them to respond in a more material way to the needs of those separated under their past laws.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional References Committee</title>,Committees,35,1,speech
"McKiernan, Sen Jim",ALP,2001-06-28,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
It is good to see some acknowledgment by the federal government of the recommendations arising from the majority report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee inquiry into the federal government's implementation of recommendations made by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in the Bringing them home report. However, this response is indicative of a government who believes that these issues will go away. They clearly will not. All Australians need to be able to honestly and openly own our shared history. Our sense of who we are and what we hope to be can never be securely held if it is based on a false and incomplete history. There are things that must be done and said if we are to be able to move on.
Those who are today still suffering from the direct and indirect consequences of past policies that saw indigenous families torn apart have particular rights and needs that have yet to be met. We must do so for their own good and for the good of all of us. We should never lose sight of the fact that the abuse and mistreatment of indigenous Australians has been the subject of ongoing contemporary debate and informed criticism since European settlement. There is no one true history; there is no one truth in these matters. We can no more say that all policy was motivated by racism and malice than we can say that all the motives were benign. What we can agree on is that the results of policies of governments and agencies over time were shameful and overwhelmingly to the great disadvantage of most indigenous Australians subject to them.
Every Australian legislator should be aware that every aspect of past policies, for which so many now express sorrow and regret, was framed in the context of contemporary criticism and debate. Legislators of those days were content, relaxed and comfortable in moving from majority public opinion rather than accepting informed and probably less popular advice. But we must move on. We must acknowledge past wrongs, guarantee against their repetition and express genuine sorrow both for these acts and for the consequences of these acts. I have moved in these terms in the parliament every year since the tabling of the Bringing them home report in 1997.
The government say in their response that they support in principle recommendation 3, which is:
... `Motion of National Apology and Reconciliation' be settled following wide consultation with individual members of the stolen generation and representatives of stolen generation organisations.
However, they quite clearly do not. The government say their motion of reconciliation fits this requirement. It quite clearly does not. Ultimately, for an apology to have an effect it must be made in terms acceptable to the parties affected. The government's motion of reconciliation does not do this, therefore it is not effective. This is unfinished business. The government also refuse to consider recommendation 7, to establish a reparations tribunal, on the grounds that it is just as complex and as costly as litigation presently proceeding through the courts. This is untrue. It is possible to address these matters in non-litigious ways, just as many present statutory schemes do. It is possible to come to agreed facts through a non-adversarial process which is designed to heal rather than to blame.
We cannot write or interpret our history in the courts. No finding of a contemporary court can either vindicate or punish legislators and administrators of the past. Litigation is a poor interpreter of history and an imprecise instrument of public policy. History deals with general patterns, big pictures, causes and consequences. Litigation moves slowly along, case by case, constrained by rules of evidence that restrict admissibility, that focus on the particular facts relevant to the specific action being pleaded and place all onus of proof on the plaintiff. Rules of evidence and other court rules have an honourable intent and an honourable purpose. They seek to protect the weak, usually an individual, from the strong, usually the state. When the roles are reversed, and the state as Goliath enjoys all the protections really intended for David, courts work not nearly as well as they should.
Governments are aware of this, and commit themselves to a code of practice that compels them to act in an exemplary manner. This code is referred to, in the case of the Commonwealth government, in the document The Commonwealth as a model litigant. It is instructive to look at some of the things that code requires of a government, so I will quote from it in part. It says:
The Commonwealth must act honestly and fairly in handling claims by: 
	...	...	...
·	paying legitimate claims without litigation, including making partial settlements of claims or interim payments, where it is clear that liability is at least as much as the amount to be paid;
	...	...	...
·	endeavouring to avoid litigation, wherever possible;
·	where it is not possible to avoid litigation, keeping the costs of litigation to a minimum, including by:
·	not requiring the other party to prove a matter which the Commonwealth knows to be true; and
·	not contesting liability if the Commonwealth knows that the dispute is really about quantum;
·	not taking advantage of a claimant who lacks the resources to litigate a legitimate claim;
	...	...	...
·	apologising where the Commonwealth is aware that it or its lawyers have acted wrongfully or improperly.
These words have a hollow and ironic ring to anyone in any way familiar with the Commonwealth's conduct in the Cubillo-Gunner case, currently under appeal in the Federal Court. This is a case where the Commonwealth has already spent in the order of $11.5 million. One lawyer alone has been paid $1 million. Private investigators have been paid $770,000.
This is a case where the singular lack of compassion or cultural sensitivity of the Commonwealth has astounded those who have studied it. The court has found that Lorna Cubillo and Peter Gunner suffered systematic abuse and trauma over a long period when removed from their families and placed in institutions. It also found that there is a causative relationship between their experiences in these institutions and their continued mental and physical suffering. Despite this, they have been subjected to humiliation and harrowing treatment in the court.
There is no doubt that the Commonwealth has set out to make an example of them. Any person making a complaint or any legal service thinking of supporting them is to be left in no doubt as to the consequences: the matter will be fought out in court; these processes will be long and expensive; no secret, no private matter and no youthful indiscretion will go untouched; the Commonwealth will set out to humiliate, discredit and defeat every claimant; and the highest paid legal pit bulls will cross examine each claimant and use all the experience and guile at their disposal to intimidate and confuse the claimant into inconsistent or uncertain testimony.
Currently, there is a total of 742 writs served on the Commonwealth in relation to claims by 2,104 people seeking damages in connection with forced family separations in the Northern Territory. There are cases under way around Australia against state governments. The Cubillo-Gunner case makes it clear that the greatest likelihood of success in these cases rests with going beyond governments and joining churches, agencies and individuals in these actions—more people and more pain.
We cannot afford—not in monetary terms nor in terms of the cost to our national reputation and sense of decency—to deal with these cases in the way the Howard government would have us proceed. Although there is acceptance in part of some of the recommendations of the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee, it is clearly not enough. This response is indicative of a government that will not acknowledge the full extent of the problem and hopes that it can shut its eyes and make the issue go away. It will not go away.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional References Committee</title>,Committees,35,1,speech
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2001-06-28,"—It has taken the government seven months to respond to this report and, given that it has taken that time, I hope that perhaps in another month's time there might also be a response to the final report of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation—after 10 years.
As the Australian Democrats stated in our minority report in Healing: a legacy of generations, the recommendations of the Bringingthemhome report are not a collection of options for governments to choose from. What we were essentially saying, and what the human rights commission said at the time, during the Senate inquiry, was that the recommendations are a package of complementary measures that need to be implemented as a whole. Collectively, it is about those recommendations constituting the minimum acceptable response required to heal the legacy that is borne by members of the stolen generations, their families and their communities.
This government has done exactly the opposite. It has picked out the recommendations of the Bringingthemhome report relating to family reunions and the need for the provision of Link Up services and then determined, in defiance of all of the recommendations and evidence put forward in both the Bringingthemhome report and the recent inquiry, that that alone is going to address the ongoing suffering of the stolen generations, their families and their communities. 
This is pertinent when you consider the debate that has raged—and is raging now—in the media in the past two weeks about how to address the issues of dysfunctionality within indigenous communities. Much of what can be seen there can be attributed to institutional policies that were designed to remove people and that left scars on people's hearts and on their souls. Now the challenge to government is how it can help to restore and repair the damage that has been done.
The Australian Democrats want to restate at the outset some observations that were made by the human rights commission in its submission to the Senate committee. One of the observations was that the adequacy of the Commonwealth response is best measured by assessing the redress provided against the harm done, rather than trying to highlight the paucity of redress from other sources or by attempting to transfer the responsibility to other groups, such as states and churches. 
The government did hear the message of those members of the stolen generations who appeared before the Senate committee, explained the difficulty in accessing family Link Up services and gave their stories of how overwhelmed and underresourced those services are. It has therefore decided to increase funds to parenting programs, counselling services, mental health counsellors and Link Up services. Whilst that is a welcome step in the right direction, I think that we can, at best, describe it as being good but not necessarily great.
The Australian Democrats do not want to respond in detail on the financial commitments that the government have made today; rather, we want to revisit that matter in the future after we have had an opportunity to examine the adequacy of the measures, speak to members of the stolen generations and look at the question of whether there is in fact the provision of sufficient resources to address the problems that exist. 
In particular, we would like to look into the matter of whether this really is new funding or, as was the case with most of the funding in the government's initial $63 million response to the Bringingthemhome report, whether it is simply old money that has been retagged. I do not think there is any clear indication about whether we are looking at the same process having been gone through again or whether in fact it is new money. But what all of the reports, inquiries, conferences and international laws have advised this government to do is to deliver a comprehensive package of measures. Instead, this government has ignored the best advice and results coming forward in those contexts.
In its response report, the Australian government decided, against all other advice, that the stolen generations do not need reparation or guarantees against repetition or a formal apology or a reparations tribunal or compensation. In the eyes of the government and from my reading of the response, all the measures that the stolen generations have asked for are seen as unnecessary and unhelpful. Clearly, the government is convinced that it is humane and compassionate because it has not removed the ability of the stolen generations to take their human rights violations to the courts. But it has not acknowledged that the process is prohibitively costly. Each of the handful of cases that has been heard during the last decade has dragged on for years. Each has cost the stolen generations and taxpayers millions of dollars each time one of these high profile cases does not succeed because the claimants cannot deliver the necessary paper trail of evidence that is required by the courts, and the stolen generations, having had their stories put on public display and under scrutiny, have to suffer collectively again. 
If the government were genuine and sincere in its statement in today's response that it wants to acknowledge the events of the past and their legacy, we would expect as a very minimum to be adopting the main recommendation of the Senate committee report, that is, committing to the establishment of a reparations tribunal to provide an alternative to the courts. The stolen generations community is meeting again in a couple of months to flesh out the details of how this tribunal would work in practice as there is already community support for the tribunal model developed by the Public Interest Advocacy Centre in New South Wales.
Similarly, the government would not be intentionally misunderstanding the intent of the Senate committee's second recommendation and suggesting that we already have sufficient forums to discuss issues of concern to the members of the stolen generations. The Senate committee recommended a national summit to progress recommendations of its own report. Suggesting, as the government has today, that this be done by the Ministerial Council on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, as one such forum, after the stinging criticism that it received in the committee's report, is nothing short of an insult to the stolen generations. 
It is simply unrealistic to expect the annual link-up meetings to deal with all of the business that they already have on their plate while additionally now taking on this additional responsibility of fleshing out a reparations tribunal or making recommendations on appropriate regimes to look at the monitoring and assessment of the adequacy of the government's response. These are enormous demands to place on these groups, which are already underresourced.
One of the other things that also needs to be mentioned is the somewhat fatigued question of a formal parliamentary apology to the stolen generations. I have to wonder whether the government read the transcripts of the hearings and heard the unanimous voice of the stolen generations that the motion for the national apology and reconciliation back in 1999 did not go far enough. Everyone agreed that, whilst it was a good first step, for the government to suggest in its response today that has delivered on that call is a misrepresentation of the facts. Any fence mending that the government might have achieved through the motion back then was destroyed by the then minister for indigenous affairs in his comments that there never was a stolen generation.
One of the key issues is about being able to monitor and report on these issues.  With respect to the government's response to the committee's recommendation regarding monitoring and reporting and all of the mechanisms required to look at how to overcome problems of disfunctionality in communities, as I stated earlier, the Senate committee found the ministerial council to be extremely remiss in meeting its own responsibilities and the junior ministerial council with no power or influence. As Sir Ronald Wilson said in his address to the committee, `What does it take? What does it do?' It waits for a year and then assigns the task to the Victorian committee, and the Victorian working party meets the best part of 12 months later and it has an understanding of what these states chose to have done. So I think the obligation to report in any way that would seek a coordinated response has again been disregarded by the government. There is simply no meaningful or inspiring response coming forward. 
Again, the Democrats repeat our recommendation in the minority committee report that the appropriate procedure for implementation is a four-tiered procedure coordinated at the highest level of government, namely, the Council of Australian Governments. The Australian Democrats believe that the enormity of the problems faced by the stolen generations throughout Australia is such that the highest level of government must step in to ensure a coordinated, effective and whole-of-government response. The government's persistence in relegating this to a junior council, quite frankly, does not instil confidence in members of the stolen generations that things will substantially change.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional References Committee</title>,Committees,35,1,speech
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2001-06-28,"—I endorse what has been said by Senator McKiernan and Senator Ridgeway, but there are a couple of things I would like to talk about. Firstly, recommendation 7—and Senator Ridgeway and Senator McKiernan both turned their minds to this—dealt with the committee's recommendation for the establishment of a reparations tribunal to address the need to provide an effective process of redress, including the provision of individual monetary compensation. The thinking behind this was that there ought to be some formal instrument set up by the state, which represents the community, to do justice to citizens of this country—in this case those with indigenous ancestry—who have been badly dealt with. The idea of the tribunal is for decision makers to make an assessment of what has gone on in individual cases and to do justice to them by way of compensation or some other relief. That is a normal part of the society we live in, that is, we have people making assessments, judging between two parties, as it were, and coming down with a decision to do justice between those two entities. The reason the government has used to reject that suggestion is as follows—and I quote from the government's reply:
The experience of other administrative tribunals including in the field of immigration and refugees illustrates that it is not possible to insulate such deliberations from legal challenges and procedures.
What is used in this context to reject a recommendation of the committee is that which has happened in the area of immigration. The area of unauthorised arrivals is used to put this present proposition down. In respect of the Refugee Review Tribunal and the Immigration Review Tribunal, the courts simplydecide whether those tribunals have done their jobs. The courts are not there to decide the facts. The courts are there to see whether the tribunals do their jobs. That is a reasonable process. However, a culture is developing in this society and in the government which, more and more, impugns the courts and the legal system in this country. Indeed, it tends to go beyond the legal system. The most recent example of where the government does that is the allegations made under parliamentary privilege here the other night against an Aboriginal leader, Mr Terry O'Shane. 
The problem with what happened the other night is that there is a legal process which has been set up by the community and which has been with us for centuries—and if we consider England as our predecessor in this regard, that process has been in operation for many centuries—to ensure that people are dealt with fairly when accusations of a most serious nature are made against them. However, in this chamber the other night a senator chose to ignore those legal processes and instruments of the rule of law to try to obtain a result which, if it was going to be obtained, should have been obtained through the legal system. The same sort of thing can be said with regard to matters outside this chamber in respect of the approach the media took to Mr Geoff Clark when it used a process other than the legal system to deny Mr Clark his right to have the allegations made against him processed through the proper institutions of this country. 
It is a matter of concern that we are increasingly trying to deal with issues that should be dealt with through the processes of the institutions I have referred to, to try to nail a person through allegation and repetition of allegation so that the allegation becomes the issue and not the resolution of that allegation so that a fair result is obtained. In the reply to the committee report, there is a furtherance of that attitude and culture which is developing, and a furthering of that climate which says, `Let's see what we can get away with. Let's not have a process of decision making which is done fairly according to law. Let's see if we can so create an atmosphere in which people lose a case, lose their reputation or their standing in the community'—through what, in effect, is a very nasty, vicious and unrestrained process. Given that context, it is a tragedy to see the reply to the committee's recommendation about the setting up of a tribunal.
It is time that we, as a community, started to think very seriously about how we determine the great issues that arise in the community. We seem to want to abandon those very instruments of democracy that make us safe. Democracy requires taking a risk. As I said last night, some people are going to escape their just desserts because the allegations against them cannot be proven. Even though those allegations might be true, they cannot be proven. However, we are not a society that would do anything to obtain its objectives. We are not a society that goes in for torture. We are not a society which would write out untrue confessions simply to obtain a result. We are not a society that believes in noble corruption. We ought to be a society that says, `There's due process to be gone through.' In many cases, due process means that people escape the consequences of the wrongs that they have done. However, we say that we want to be the sort of society that would prefer that to happen than to become a society where a more fearsome injustice is done because proper process is not undertaken. On this occasion, the government has chosen not to use one of those instruments suggested by the committee, which would accommodate the demands that there ought to be proper process to reach justice. I think that is quite a tragedy. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2001-06-28,"—I present the government's response to the report of the Legal and Constitutional References Committee entitled Healing: a legacy of generations, a report of the inquiry into the federal government's implementation of recommendations made by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in Bringing them home. I seek leave to incorporate the document in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The response read as follows—
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO HEALING: A LEGACY OF GENERATIONS
The Report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee Inquiry into the Federal Government's Implementation of Recommendations Made by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in Bringing Them Home
The federal government is committed to addressing the traumatic legacy of past practices of indigenous child separation.  There is no doubt that these practices represent a tragic part of Australia's history.  The government has recognised that, viewed from a present day perspective, these practices were misguided and caused great suffering, and has established programmes to assist those affected to move forward.
In responding to the Bringing Them Home report, the government noted that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission identified family reunion as “the most significant and urgent need of separated families”.  This is central to the government's response announced in December 1997, which included a $63 million package of measures designed to assist families with the provision of counselling and parenting programmes and family tracing and reunion services.  Other elements of the package included an oral history project, improved access to Commonwealth records for those tracing their past, and language and culture maintenance programmes.  Building on this initial package of initiatives, the government will provide ongoing funding of $44 million over a further four years for its parenting programmes, counselling services and support and training for mental health counsellors.  It will also provide an additional $9.9 million over an extra four years for Link Up services.
The federal government has considered the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee's report on its Inquiry into the government's implementation of the Bringing Them Home report's recommendations.  The Committee did not produce a consensus report.  The Majority Report of the non-government members of the Committee contains ten recommendations, of which nine are relevant to the Commonwealth.  The government supports, either in full or in part, five of these nine recommendations.  We agree with the Committee's first majority recommendation that it is timely to evaluate the original response to Bringing Them Home by all relevant parties.  We agree that it is vital that programmes and services be monitored and coordinated to ensure that the needs of those still suffering the effects of family separations are being met, and we can point to relevant policies already agreed or in place.  We agree that it is important that the events of the past and their legacy be acknowledged.  In addition, therefore, we are pleased to advise that in the 2001-02 Budget the government allocated funding beyond 30 June 2002 for key family reunion and health services at a further cost of $53.9 million over four years to 30 June 2006.
The government's response to each of the Senate Committee's individual recommendations follows.
Response to Majority (non-government Senators) Report recommendations
Recommendation 1 - The Committee recommends that the federal government, in conjunction with state and territory governments, commission an independent evaluation of the progress of initiatives implemented by governments in response to the Bringing Them Home report.  The independent evaluator should present its report within six months of the federal government's response to the report of this inquiry.
Supported, although the timeframe proposed may be insufficient to allow detailed consultation.
The Ministerial Council for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (MCATSIA) currently monitors progress of all jurisdictions in implementing their responses to the Bringing Them Home report.  Although it produces an annual cross-jurisdictional progress report, MCATSIA has not commissioned a formal, independent evaluation of progress.
The government will propose to MCATSIA that it sponsor an independent evaluation of all government and non-government responses to Bringing Them Home, to be coordinated by the Department of Reconciliation and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs.  This will be undertaken in consultation with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), as the government's principal source of advice from an indigenous perspective.
Recommendation 2 - The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth convene a Summit meeting twelve months from the date of the federal government's response to this inquiry, to coordinate and address the issues and recommendations identified in this report.
Supported in part.
The government agrees that it is important that there be a forum for discussion of issues related to indigenous family separations.  There are existing forums for this, however.
ATSIC already holds annual national workshops for Link Up staff to discuss common issues.  In addition, the second National Stolen Generations Conference was held in March 2001 to discuss a range of issues relevant to those affected by indigenous child separation.  Conference delegates included a number of stakeholders such as the Secretariat of National Aboriginal and Islander Child Care, the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation, the National Aboriginal and Islander Legal Services Secretariat, and individuals with direct experience of family separation.  These conferences, hosted by indigenous organisations, are planned to be held approximately every two years.  
There is also already a number of other mechanisms in place which serve to coordinate government responses to the Bringing Them Home report and provide opportunities for those affected by child separation practices to have a voice.  For example, MCATSIA has the separated children issue as a standing agenda item for consideration at its meetings.  It also publishes an annual progress report on Commonwealth and state and territory government responses to the Bringing Them Home report.  A study of best practice models in relation to contemporary child separation practices is also being undertaken in that context.
The government has implemented its health initiatives in partnership with indigenous communities and the states and territories.  The counselling, counselling support, and parenting initiatives in response to Bringing Them Home have been implemented under State/Territory Partnership Forums which include representation from ATSIC and the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation, as well as the relevant state/territory governments.
Community consultation regarding the archives project to improve access to Commonwealth records continues through an Aboriginal Advisory Group made up of community representatives in Darwin.  A similar group is being established in Melbourne.  (The relevant Commonwealth records are largely confined to the Northern Territory and Victoria, for historical reasons).
Recommendation 3 - The Committee recommends that recommendation 5a of Bringing Them Home be fulfilled by the Australian Parliament, and that a `Motion of National Apology and Reconciliation' be settled following wide consultation with individual members of the Stolen Generation and representatives of stolen generation organisations.
Supported in principle.
Both Houses of Federal Parliament passed the government's Motion of Reconciliation on 26 August 1999.  The motion acknowledged that the “mistreatment of many indigenous Australians over a significant period represents the most blemished chapter in our international history” and expressed the Federal Parliament's “deep and sincere regret that indigenous Australians suffered injustices under the practices of past generations, and for the hurt and trauma that many indigenous people continue to feel as a consequence of these practices.”
The motion also reaffirmed a whole-hearted commitment to the cause of reconciliation between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians as an important national priority for all Australians.
The period when indigenous family separations took place represents a lasting and tragic phase in our nation's history.  The government is very aware of the continuing hurt suffered by those affected by these past practices, and is committed to addressing its consequences.
Recommendation 4 - The Committee recommends, as a gesture of good faith, as in the case of the Parliament of the Australian Capital Territory, that the Northern Territory Parliament make a formal apology to members of the Stolen Generation.  The form of words for such an apology should be decided in consultation with representative members of the stolen generation in the Northern Territory.
This is a matter for the Northern Territory government.
Recommendation 5 - The Committee recommends the Commonwealth Government consult with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, Reconciliation Australia, members of the Stolen Generation and their representative organisations with a view to establishing a national memorial.
Supported in principle.
In May 2000, the Prime Minister announced plans to construct Reconciliation Place in the national capital's Parliamentary Triangle thereby demonstrating the government's commitment to the ongoing process of reconciliation.  It is to be an interpretative pathway linking the National Library with the High Court and National Gallery.
As noted by the Prime Minister, Reconciliation Place will acknowledge the history and significant achievements of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and incorporate an acknowledgment of the separation of indigenous children from their families.
The design for the project was determined through an open competition in the first half of 2001.  The winning design has been chosen and the project is scheduled to be completed by the end of the year.  The Steering Committee for the project is co-chaired by Dr Evelyn Scott and Mr Ian Spicer AM, and includes a majority of indigenous members.  ATSIC, the Torres Strait Regional Authority (TSRA), other relevant organisations and the local Ngun(n)awal community are being consulted regarding the project.
Recommendation 6 - The Committee recommends that the Government take steps to implement an effective and independent coordination and monitoring process for all programs which address the needs of members of the Stolen Generation.  This process should take into account the recommendations of Bringing Them Home and the recommendations and conclusions of this report.
Supported in part.
The government acknowledges the importance of monitoring and coordinating efforts to address the legacy of past policies and practices of indigenous family separation, and of ensuring that these programmes and services are more effective in meeting the needs of indigenous people affected by those policies and practices.
The Ministerial Council for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs already undertakes this coordination and monitoring role.  The Council comprises Commonwealth, State and Territory Aboriginal Affairs Ministers, along with the Chairs of ATSIC and TSRA, and the Head of the Australian Local Government Association.  The issue of government responses to the Bringing Them Home report is a standing agenda item for MCATSIA meetings.  MCATSIA publishes an annual report on the progress of government initiatives in response to Bringing Them Home.  In 2000 it also published a compilation of all jurisdictions' responses.
Furthermore, the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) has undertaken to monitor outcomes of all indigenous-specific programmes and services, and government responses to the Bringing Them Home report will therefore be incorporated in this process.  (See response below to recommendation 2.5 of the Australian Democrats' Minority Report).
Recommendation 7 - The Committee recommends the establishment of a `Reparations Tribunal' to address the need for an effective process of reparation, including the provision of individual monetary compensation.
Not supported.
The government's position on this matter has been clearly stated in its original submission to the HREOC Inquiry and in its submission to this Inquiry.  The government's $63 million package of initiatives (increasing to $117 million after 30 June 2002) to assist those affected by past practices of removal to, among other things, be reunited with their families and receive counselling and support for the pain they have suffered, represents a more practical way to assist in healing the suffering caused by past practices of family separation.  The Bringing Them Home report itself asserted that family reunion, not financial compensation, is “the most significant and urgent need of separated families”.
The government considers that establishing a tribunal with the comprehensive jurisdiction and extensive powers suggested would neither guarantee a less stressful consideration of matters nor less expense for either party than court proceedings.  The same complex and costly legal and factual issues would need to be addressed in order to assess individual claims and such decisions would still be open to further judicial review.  The experience of other administrative tribunals, including in the field of immigration and refugees, illustrates that it is not possible to insulate such deliberations from legal challenges and procedures.  The Dissenting Report of the Government Senators on the Committee also highlights the fundamental practical problems associated with the operation of a compensation tribunal in this context.  This includes the basic question of defining what circumstances and which affected individuals would or would not qualify for compensation.
Additionally, State governments are responsible for the laws which were in place in their jurisdictions during the period that indigenous child removals took place.  No state government has offered to pay monetary compensation or establish such a tribunal.  It is a matter for the non-government organisations involved in the removal and care of children to respond to compensation claims addressed to their actions.
Recommendation 8 - The Committee recommends that the Tribunal model put forward by the Public Interest Advocacy Centre of NSW be used as a general template for the recommended tribunal.  The model should consider the most effective ways to deal with issues of reparation.
See response to recommendation 7.
Recommendation 9 - The Committee recommends that details of the form and operations of the tribunal be finalised following consultation at the proposed National Summit.
See responses to recommendations 7 and 2.
Recommendation 10 - The Committee recommends that as soon as practicable after the tabling of this report, appropriate consultations should be held with representatives of the Stolen Generation and their organisations, including ATSIC, with a view to finalising an agenda for the proposed National Summit.
See response to recommendation 2.
Response to Minority Report recommendations by the Australian Democrats
Recommendation 1.1 - The Australian Democrats recommend that all of the recommendations contained in the Majority Report on the Stolen Generations be implemented as a matter of urgency.
See responses to the Majority Report recommendations.
Recommendation 2.1 - The Australian Democrats recommend that the federal government, in consultation with the stolen generations and their representative organisations, significantly increase the funding package to implement the government's response to the recommendations of the BTH Report to ensure that the needs of the stolen generations are fully addressed.  These negotiations should be a key element of the National Summit on the Stolen Generations, as proposed in the Majority Report.
Supported in relation to funding.
The government will provide ongoing funding of $44 million over a further four years for its parenting programmes, counselling services,  and support and training for mental health counsellors.  It will also provide an additional $9.9 million over an extra four years for Link Up services.  This is a significant boost to the government's original response to Bringing Them Home, bringing the government's total contribution to $117 million.
The government does not support a national summit, although it does recognise that there should be a forum for people to discuss issues related to indigenous child separation.  The government believes such fora already exist - see response to Majority Report recommendation 2.
Recommendation 2.2 - The Australian Democrats recommend that the federal government's funding package to implement the recommendations of the BTH Report should be ongoing and subject to review in terms of its adequacy by the independent auditing body referred to in Recommendation 2.6 below.
Supported.  See response to 2.1 above, and note that some of the government's original initiatives such as the oral history and archiving projects do not require further funding as they are finite projects.  See also response to recommendation 1 of the Majority Report.
Recommendation 2.3 - The Australian Democrats recommend the establishment of a mediation process and/or series of conferences by ATSIC to resolve a range of outstanding issues between the stolen generations communities, their representative organisations and Indigenous community organisations in the Northern Territory.  This should occur in advance of the Indigenous consultations referred to in Recommendation 10 of the Majority Report.
Supported.
Mediation between the competing interests for Link Up funding in the Northern Territory occurred in July and August 1999 and continued during 2000.  ATSIC staff have undertaken mediation sessions between the interested parties on a number of occasions and have used an independent facilitator to assist.  The government understands that ATSIC was unable to gain representation of all interested parties at the mediation sessions.
ATSIC has continued to attempt to resolve differences between the representative organisations and will continue the mediation process until a satisfactory resolution has been reached.
Recommendation 2.4 - The Australian Democrats recommend that the Churches proceed with their plans to establish their own compensation fund to facilitate the delivery of reparations, including compensation, to the stolen generations, their families and communities, in accordance with the recommendations of the BTH Report.
This is a matter for the Churches to consider.
Recommendation 2.5 - The Australian Democrats recommend, in acknowledgment of the enormity of the problems faced by the stolen generations throughout Australia, that COAG take up the responsibility of ensuring the delivery of a coordinated, effective whole-of-government response to the recommendations contained in the BTH Report.
Supported in part.
On 3 November 2000, COAG agreed to commit to a new approach to addressing indigenous disadvantage, based on partnerships and shared responsibilities, programme flexibility and coordination amongst agencies.  The focus is to be at the community level, to increase community capacity.  The Prime Minister has written to Chairs of Ministerial Councils and to relevant Commonwealth Ministers asking them to implement COAG's decisions.  Ministerial Councils will develop action plans and performance monitoring strategies, and report to COAG on progress in late 2001.  MCATSIA will coordinate the work of Ministerial Councils in implementing the COAG decision.
However, the government does not see a role for COAG specifically in relation to the response to Bringing Them Home.  MCATSIA is composed of Aboriginal Affairs Ministers in each state and territory, and the ATSIC and TSRA Chairs.  It is a forum in which members can consider relevant government activities and discuss issues of mutual interest.  The Council aims to achieve a coordinated approach to the planning, funding and provision of services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.  It is therefore logical that MCATSIA should continue to coordinate and monitor the responses of all jurisdictions to the Bringing Them Home report, as it has been doing since August 1997.  The MCATSIA officials' working party is convened and chaired by ATSIC.
Recommendation 2.6 - The Australian Democrats support Recommendation 1 of the Majority Report, relating to the need for the federal government, in conjunction with state and territory governments, to commission an independent evaluation of the progress of initiatives implemented by governments in response to the BTH Report.
Supported.
See response to Recommendation 1 of the Majority Report.
Recommendation 2.7 - We further add that periodic independent audits of governments' initiatives are required no less than every three years to ensure that the needs and aspirations of the stolen generations are being satisfactorily addressed.
Supported in part.
The government acknowledges the need to ensure that programmes and services targeted to people separated as children are delivered appropriately and effectively.  It is important that the government be accountable for its initiatives.
Government programmes are already subject to ongoing review and evaluation.  Commonwealth and state and territory government programmes are subject to internal review.  In addition, the Australian National Audit Office regularly undertakes performance audits of Commonwealth government programmes, just as state and territory Auditors-General audit programmes in their jurisdictions.
These ongoing audits of government programmes, in conjunction with MCATSIA's monitoring and reporting role, provide adequate assessment of the efficiency and effectiveness of government initiatives in response to Bringing Them Home.  In addition, the government has reported on the progress of its Bringing Them Home initiatives on a six-monthly basis, and, in line with Recommendation 1 of the Majority Report, will be arranging for an evaluation of its programmes established in response to Bringing Them Home.
Recommendation 2.8 - The Australian Democrats recommend that Recommendations 44-54 of the BTH Report be actioned as a matter of urgency to ensure that adequate national legislation is implemented which establishes minimum standards of treatment and protection of all Indigenous children and other children as appropriate (national standards legislation).
Not supported in relation to national legislation, but the adoption of consistent best practice standards by state and territory governments is encouraged.
In 1997, the Commonwealth/State/Territory Ministerial Council on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs agreed that jurisdictions would implement their own standards as they see fit.  In the interests of consistency however, MCATSIA has established a working group to identify best practice models in the juvenile justice and child welfare systems for jurisdictions to use as benchmarks.  ATSIC is managing this project.
Recommendation 2.9 - The Australian Democrats recommend that the Commonwealth provide full and just reparations to the stolen generations, their families and communities as soon as is practicable.  This recommendation should be carried out in conjunction with all other recommendations contained in this Minority Report.  Collectively, these recommendations constitute the minimum acceptable response required to heal the legacy borne by the stolen generations, their families and communities.
The government does not support a reparations tribunal.  See response to recommendation 7 of the Majority Report.
The government considers it most important to allow those affected by past practices to be assisted in finding their families, and to receive counselling and support for the trauma they have experienced.  It has therefore focused its response on addressing these needs.
Apart from the provision of family reunion and counselling services, the government has implemented parenting programmes, language and culture maintenance programmes, improved access to Commonwealth records, and an oral history project through which people can tell their stories.
The Prime Minister proposed, and the Federal Parliament passed, the Motion of Reconciliation which acknowledged the suffering and trauma experienced by indigenous Australians caused by the practices of past generations.
Recommendation 3.1 - The Australian Democrats recommend that all parties involved in negotiations for the establishment of a Stolen Generations Tribunal examine the Veterans' Entitlement Act 1986 as a successful legal precedent for the relaxation of the normal requirements for establishing liability.
Not supported.
See response to recommendation 7 of the Majority Report. 
Recommendation 3.2 - The Australian Democrats recommend that all parties involved in negotiations for the establishment of a Stolen Generations Tribunal consider the inclusion of a mediation process in the operations of such a Tribunal.
See response to recommendation 7 of the Majority Report.
Recommendation 3.3 - The Australian Democrats recommend that all parties involved in the negotiations for the establishment of a Stolen Generations Tribunal consider the inclusion of an alternative dispute resolution mechanism in the operation of such a Tribunal.
See response to recommendation 7 of the Majority Report.
Recommendation 3.4 - The Australian Democrats recommend that the Administrative Review Council (or an equivalent body) prepare a report for tabling in the Australian Parliament on the appropriate model for a Stolen Generations Reparations Tribunal.  This report should draw extensively on the views of the stolen generations, their representative organisations, and the outcomes of the National Summit on the Stolen Generations.
See responses to recommendations 7 and 2 of the Majority Report.
Response to Government Senators' Dissenting Report recommendations
Recommendation 1 - That family reunion and associated support services continue to be the primary focus of government and non-government responses to the separated children experience; that those services be targeted specifically to those separated children.
Supported.
The government is continuing to focus its response to Bringing Them Home on family reunion and support services, by extending funding for the Link Up and health initiatives.  This means the government will have contributed $117 million towards programmes to address the continuing trauma of past policies of indigenous child separation.
It is understandable that some separated children organisations feel they can provide the most appropriate services for those they represent, and that it would be better if the funds were distributed directly to them.  However, the government considers that this would unnecessarily limit the assistance available to those who require it.  The current organisations which provide Link Up and counselling services have access to an existing infrastructure and network which enables them to support their workers and provide related services to their clients. 
It is important that the government's initiatives are directed towards those who have been affected by family separation practices.  However, it is very difficult to differentiate between those who are accessing services because they were forcibly separated from their families as children, and those who are accessing services who may have been separated from their families for some other reason, but with nevertheless a very real need for assistance.  In the same way, it is difficult to identify the emotional and social issues which may cause someone to need mental health counselling, and to distinguish issues caused by past practices of indigenous child separation from other life affecting issues.
The government considers that, even if such a distinction were clinically possible and appropriate, it cannot adequately or reasonably make these distinctions in providing its family reunion and counselling services.  However, this does not mean that these services are not available to those affected by past practices of indigenous child separation.  The services are targeted to the broader group, that is all of those affected by past practices of removal, not necessarily only those who were removed as children.  The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission itself stated in Bringing Them Home that separation affected whole families and communities.
Recommendation 2 - That State governments and responsible non-government organisations, including the churches, be encouraged to give tangible as well as symbolic recognition to the needs of separated children.
Supported.
It is very important that the state and territory governments and non-government organisations, including churches, which were involved in past practices of indigenous child separation, acknowledge the part they played in this tragic part of our history, in substantial ways as well as through symbolic gestures.  As revealed in evidence to the Committee, while many governments and churches have made apologies, they have provided only modest tangible resources towards providing reparations.
As Chair of MCATSIA, the federal Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs wrote to the heads of the Anglican, Catholic, Uniting and Lutheran churches on 20 July 2000, asking them to provide reports on their responses to relevant recommendations of Bringing Them Home, for inclusion in the MCATSIA report on progress for 1999-2000.  In asking for this information, the Minister encouraged churches to develop relationships between themselves and Link Up services to facilitate access to church records by indigenous people trying to trace their families.  All of the church leaders have provided information for the report.
Moreover, the Commonwealth can work with the states and territories through MCATSIA to encourage them to respond in a more material way to the needs of those separated under their past laws.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Committees,35,2,speech
"McKiernan, Sen Jim",ALP,2001-06-28,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
It is good to see some acknowledgment by the federal government of the recommendations arising from the majority report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee inquiry into the federal government's implementation of recommendations made by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in the Bringing them home report. However, this response is indicative of a government who believes that these issues will go away. They clearly will not. All Australians need to be able to honestly and openly own our shared history. Our sense of who we are and what we hope to be can never be securely held if it is based on a false and incomplete history. There are things that must be done and said if we are to be able to move on.
Those who are today still suffering from the direct and indirect consequences of past policies that saw indigenous families torn apart have particular rights and needs that have yet to be met. We must do so for their own good and for the good of all of us. We should never lose sight of the fact that the abuse and mistreatment of indigenous Australians has been the subject of ongoing contemporary debate and informed criticism since European settlement. There is no one true history; there is no one truth in these matters. We can no more say that all policy was motivated by racism and malice than we can say that all the motives were benign. What we can agree on is that the results of policies of governments and agencies over time were shameful and overwhelmingly to the great disadvantage of most indigenous Australians subject to them.
Every Australian legislator should be aware that every aspect of past policies, for which so many now express sorrow and regret, was framed in the context of contemporary criticism and debate. Legislators of those days were content, relaxed and comfortable in moving from majority public opinion rather than accepting informed and probably less popular advice. But we must move on. We must acknowledge past wrongs, guarantee against their repetition and express genuine sorrow both for these acts and for the consequences of these acts. I have moved in these terms in the parliament every year since the tabling of the Bringing them home report in 1997.
The government say in their response that they support in principle recommendation 3, which is:
... `Motion of National Apology and Reconciliation' be settled following wide consultation with individual members of the stolen generation and representatives of stolen generation organisations.
However, they quite clearly do not. The government say their motion of reconciliation fits this requirement. It quite clearly does not. Ultimately, for an apology to have an effect it must be made in terms acceptable to the parties affected. The government's motion of reconciliation does not do this, therefore it is not effective. This is unfinished business. The government also refuse to consider recommendation 7, to establish a reparations tribunal, on the grounds that it is just as complex and as costly as litigation presently proceeding through the courts. This is untrue. It is possible to address these matters in non-litigious ways, just as many present statutory schemes do. It is possible to come to agreed facts through a non-adversarial process which is designed to heal rather than to blame.
We cannot write or interpret our history in the courts. No finding of a contemporary court can either vindicate or punish legislators and administrators of the past. Litigation is a poor interpreter of history and an imprecise instrument of public policy. History deals with general patterns, big pictures, causes and consequences. Litigation moves slowly along, case by case, constrained by rules of evidence that restrict admissibility, that focus on the particular facts relevant to the specific action being pleaded and place all onus of proof on the plaintiff. Rules of evidence and other court rules have an honourable intent and an honourable purpose. They seek to protect the weak, usually an individual, from the strong, usually the state. When the roles are reversed, and the state as Goliath enjoys all the protections really intended for David, courts work not nearly as well as they should.
Governments are aware of this, and commit themselves to a code of practice that compels them to act in an exemplary manner. This code is referred to, in the case of the Commonwealth government, in the document The Commonwealth as a model litigant. It is instructive to look at some of the things that code requires of a government, so I will quote from it in part. It says:
The Commonwealth must act honestly and fairly in handling claims by: 
	...	...	...
·	paying legitimate claims without litigation, including making partial settlements of claims or interim payments, where it is clear that liability is at least as much as the amount to be paid;
	...	...	...
·	endeavouring to avoid litigation, wherever possible;
·	where it is not possible to avoid litigation, keeping the costs of litigation to a minimum, including by:
·	not requiring the other party to prove a matter which the Commonwealth knows to be true; and
·	not contesting liability if the Commonwealth knows that the dispute is really about quantum;
·	not taking advantage of a claimant who lacks the resources to litigate a legitimate claim;
	...	...	...
·	apologising where the Commonwealth is aware that it or its lawyers have acted wrongfully or improperly.
These words have a hollow and ironic ring to anyone in any way familiar with the Commonwealth's conduct in the Cubillo-Gunner case, currently under appeal in the Federal Court. This is a case where the Commonwealth has already spent in the order of $11.5 million. One lawyer alone has been paid $1 million. Private investigators have been paid $770,000.
This is a case where the singular lack of compassion or cultural sensitivity of the Commonwealth has astounded those who have studied it. The court has found that Lorna Cubillo and Peter Gunner suffered systematic abuse and trauma over a long period when removed from their families and placed in institutions. It also found that there is a causative relationship between their experiences in these institutions and their continued mental and physical suffering. Despite this, they have been subjected to humiliation and harrowing treatment in the court.
There is no doubt that the Commonwealth has set out to make an example of them. Any person making a complaint or any legal service thinking of supporting them is to be left in no doubt as to the consequences: the matter will be fought out in court; these processes will be long and expensive; no secret, no private matter and no youthful indiscretion will go untouched; the Commonwealth will set out to humiliate, discredit and defeat every claimant; and the highest paid legal pit bulls will cross examine each claimant and use all the experience and guile at their disposal to intimidate and confuse the claimant into inconsistent or uncertain testimony.
Currently, there is a total of 742 writs served on the Commonwealth in relation to claims by 2,104 people seeking damages in connection with forced family separations in the Northern Territory. There are cases under way around Australia against state governments. The Cubillo-Gunner case makes it clear that the greatest likelihood of success in these cases rests with going beyond governments and joining churches, agencies and individuals in these actions—more people and more pain.
We cannot afford—not in monetary terms nor in terms of the cost to our national reputation and sense of decency—to deal with these cases in the way the Howard government would have us proceed. Although there is acceptance in part of some of the recommendations of the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee, it is clearly not enough. This response is indicative of a government that will not acknowledge the full extent of the problem and hopes that it can shut its eyes and make the issue go away. It will not go away.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Committees,35,2,speech
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2001-06-28,"—It has taken the government seven months to respond to this report and, given that it has taken that time, I hope that perhaps in another month's time there might also be a response to the final report of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation—after 10 years.
As the Australian Democrats stated in our minority report in Healing: a legacy of generations, the recommendations of the Bringingthemhome report are not a collection of options for governments to choose from. What we were essentially saying, and what the human rights commission said at the time, during the Senate inquiry, was that the recommendations are a package of complementary measures that need to be implemented as a whole. Collectively, it is about those recommendations constituting the minimum acceptable response required to heal the legacy that is borne by members of the stolen generations, their families and their communities.
This government has done exactly the opposite. It has picked out the recommendations of the Bringingthemhome report relating to family reunions and the need for the provision of Link Up services and then determined, in defiance of all of the recommendations and evidence put forward in both the Bringingthemhome report and the recent inquiry, that that alone is going to address the ongoing suffering of the stolen generations, their families and their communities. 
This is pertinent when you consider the debate that has raged—and is raging now—in the media in the past two weeks about how to address the issues of dysfunctionality within indigenous communities. Much of what can be seen there can be attributed to institutional policies that were designed to remove people and that left scars on people's hearts and on their souls. Now the challenge to government is how it can help to restore and repair the damage that has been done.
The Australian Democrats want to restate at the outset some observations that were made by the human rights commission in its submission to the Senate committee. One of the observations was that the adequacy of the Commonwealth response is best measured by assessing the redress provided against the harm done, rather than trying to highlight the paucity of redress from other sources or by attempting to transfer the responsibility to other groups, such as states and churches. 
The government did hear the message of those members of the stolen generations who appeared before the Senate committee, explained the difficulty in accessing family Link Up services and gave their stories of how overwhelmed and underresourced those services are. It has therefore decided to increase funds to parenting programs, counselling services, mental health counsellors and Link Up services. Whilst that is a welcome step in the right direction, I think that we can, at best, describe it as being good but not necessarily great.
The Australian Democrats do not want to respond in detail on the financial commitments that the government have made today; rather, we want to revisit that matter in the future after we have had an opportunity to examine the adequacy of the measures, speak to members of the stolen generations and look at the question of whether there is in fact the provision of sufficient resources to address the problems that exist. 
In particular, we would like to look into the matter of whether this really is new funding or, as was the case with most of the funding in the government's initial $63 million response to the Bringingthemhome report, whether it is simply old money that has been retagged. I do not think there is any clear indication about whether we are looking at the same process having been gone through again or whether in fact it is new money. But what all of the reports, inquiries, conferences and international laws have advised this government to do is to deliver a comprehensive package of measures. Instead, this government has ignored the best advice and results coming forward in those contexts.
In its response report, the Australian government decided, against all other advice, that the stolen generations do not need reparation or guarantees against repetition or a formal apology or a reparations tribunal or compensation. In the eyes of the government and from my reading of the response, all the measures that the stolen generations have asked for are seen as unnecessary and unhelpful. Clearly, the government is convinced that it is humane and compassionate because it has not removed the ability of the stolen generations to take their human rights violations to the courts. But it has not acknowledged that the process is prohibitively costly. Each of the handful of cases that has been heard during the last decade has dragged on for years. Each has cost the stolen generations and taxpayers millions of dollars each time one of these high profile cases does not succeed because the claimants cannot deliver the necessary paper trail of evidence that is required by the courts, and the stolen generations, having had their stories put on public display and under scrutiny, have to suffer collectively again. 
If the government were genuine and sincere in its statement in today's response that it wants to acknowledge the events of the past and their legacy, we would expect as a very minimum to be adopting the main recommendation of the Senate committee report, that is, committing to the establishment of a reparations tribunal to provide an alternative to the courts. The stolen generations community is meeting again in a couple of months to flesh out the details of how this tribunal would work in practice as there is already community support for the tribunal model developed by the Public Interest Advocacy Centre in New South Wales.
Similarly, the government would not be intentionally misunderstanding the intent of the Senate committee's second recommendation and suggesting that we already have sufficient forums to discuss issues of concern to the members of the stolen generations. The Senate committee recommended a national summit to progress recommendations of its own report. Suggesting, as the government has today, that this be done by the Ministerial Council on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, as one such forum, after the stinging criticism that it received in the committee's report, is nothing short of an insult to the stolen generations. 
It is simply unrealistic to expect the annual link-up meetings to deal with all of the business that they already have on their plate while additionally now taking on this additional responsibility of fleshing out a reparations tribunal or making recommendations on appropriate regimes to look at the monitoring and assessment of the adequacy of the government's response. These are enormous demands to place on these groups, which are already underresourced.
One of the other things that also needs to be mentioned is the somewhat fatigued question of a formal parliamentary apology to the stolen generations. I have to wonder whether the government read the transcripts of the hearings and heard the unanimous voice of the stolen generations that the motion for the national apology and reconciliation back in 1999 did not go far enough. Everyone agreed that, whilst it was a good first step, for the government to suggest in its response today that has delivered on that call is a misrepresentation of the facts. Any fence mending that the government might have achieved through the motion back then was destroyed by the then minister for indigenous affairs in his comments that there never was a stolen generation.
One of the key issues is about being able to monitor and report on these issues.  With respect to the government's response to the committee's recommendation regarding monitoring and reporting and all of the mechanisms required to look at how to overcome problems of disfunctionality in communities, as I stated earlier, the Senate committee found the ministerial council to be extremely remiss in meeting its own responsibilities and the junior ministerial council with no power or influence. As Sir Ronald Wilson said in his address to the committee, `What does it take? What does it do?' It waits for a year and then assigns the task to the Victorian committee, and the Victorian working party meets the best part of 12 months later and it has an understanding of what these states chose to have done. So I think the obligation to report in any way that would seek a coordinated response has again been disregarded by the government. There is simply no meaningful or inspiring response coming forward. 
Again, the Democrats repeat our recommendation in the minority committee report that the appropriate procedure for implementation is a four-tiered procedure coordinated at the highest level of government, namely, the Council of Australian Governments. The Australian Democrats believe that the enormity of the problems faced by the stolen generations throughout Australia is such that the highest level of government must step in to ensure a coordinated, effective and whole-of-government response. The government's persistence in relegating this to a junior council, quite frankly, does not instil confidence in members of the stolen generations that things will substantially change.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Committees,35,2,speech
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2001-06-28,"—I endorse what has been said by Senator McKiernan and Senator Ridgeway, but there are a couple of things I would like to talk about. Firstly, recommendation 7—and Senator Ridgeway and Senator McKiernan both turned their minds to this—dealt with the committee's recommendation for the establishment of a reparations tribunal to address the need to provide an effective process of redress, including the provision of individual monetary compensation. The thinking behind this was that there ought to be some formal instrument set up by the state, which represents the community, to do justice to citizens of this country—in this case those with indigenous ancestry—who have been badly dealt with. The idea of the tribunal is for decision makers to make an assessment of what has gone on in individual cases and to do justice to them by way of compensation or some other relief. That is a normal part of the society we live in, that is, we have people making assessments, judging between two parties, as it were, and coming down with a decision to do justice between those two entities. The reason the government has used to reject that suggestion is as follows—and I quote from the government's reply:
The experience of other administrative tribunals including in the field of immigration and refugees illustrates that it is not possible to insulate such deliberations from legal challenges and procedures.
What is used in this context to reject a recommendation of the committee is that which has happened in the area of immigration. The area of unauthorised arrivals is used to put this present proposition down. In respect of the Refugee Review Tribunal and the Immigration Review Tribunal, the courts simplydecide whether those tribunals have done their jobs. The courts are not there to decide the facts. The courts are there to see whether the tribunals do their jobs. That is a reasonable process. However, a culture is developing in this society and in the government which, more and more, impugns the courts and the legal system in this country. Indeed, it tends to go beyond the legal system. The most recent example of where the government does that is the allegations made under parliamentary privilege here the other night against an Aboriginal leader, Mr Terry O'Shane. 
The problem with what happened the other night is that there is a legal process which has been set up by the community and which has been with us for centuries—and if we consider England as our predecessor in this regard, that process has been in operation for many centuries—to ensure that people are dealt with fairly when accusations of a most serious nature are made against them. However, in this chamber the other night a senator chose to ignore those legal processes and instruments of the rule of law to try to obtain a result which, if it was going to be obtained, should have been obtained through the legal system. The same sort of thing can be said with regard to matters outside this chamber in respect of the approach the media took to Mr Geoff Clark when it used a process other than the legal system to deny Mr Clark his right to have the allegations made against him processed through the proper institutions of this country. 
It is a matter of concern that we are increasingly trying to deal with issues that should be dealt with through the processes of the institutions I have referred to, to try to nail a person through allegation and repetition of allegation so that the allegation becomes the issue and not the resolution of that allegation so that a fair result is obtained. In the reply to the committee report, there is a furtherance of that attitude and culture which is developing, and a furthering of that climate which says, `Let's see what we can get away with. Let's not have a process of decision making which is done fairly according to law. Let's see if we can so create an atmosphere in which people lose a case, lose their reputation or their standing in the community'—through what, in effect, is a very nasty, vicious and unrestrained process. Given that context, it is a tragedy to see the reply to the committee's recommendation about the setting up of a tribunal.
It is time that we, as a community, started to think very seriously about how we determine the great issues that arise in the community. We seem to want to abandon those very instruments of democracy that make us safe. Democracy requires taking a risk. As I said last night, some people are going to escape their just desserts because the allegations against them cannot be proven. Even though those allegations might be true, they cannot be proven. However, we are not a society that would do anything to obtain its objectives. We are not a society that goes in for torture. We are not a society which would write out untrue confessions simply to obtain a result. We are not a society that believes in noble corruption. We ought to be a society that says, `There's due process to be gone through.' In many cases, due process means that people escape the consequences of the wrongs that they have done. However, we say that we want to be the sort of society that would prefer that to happen than to become a society where a more fearsome injustice is done because proper process is not undertaken. On this occasion, the government has chosen not to use one of those instruments suggested by the committee, which would accommodate the demands that there ought to be proper process to reach justice. I think that is quite a tragedy. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
Leave granted; debate adjourned.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Committees,35,2,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2001-06-28,"—by leave—I have two responses to returns to order to table and two statements to make. In response to Senator Collins's request for the Minister representing the Minister for Employment Services to table certain documents, I advise the Senate: first, there is no interim report of the investigations by the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business into Leonie Green and Associates. It is my understanding that the minister advised on this issue in the other place earlier today. Secondly, I table documents provided to the minister at the offices of Leonie Green and Associates on 10 April this year. Thirdly, I table the diary entry in relation to the visit to Leonie Green and Associates on 10 April 2001. I am informed that this was an informal visit, which included a tour of the LGA premises and a brief discussion with key personnel in the boardroom over a cup of coffee. No notes of the meeting were taken.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—And they are not going to auction the coffeepot! I table those documents.
Further, in relation to the return to order made in relation to the G & K O'Connor Pty Ltd issues, I respond further to an order made by the Senate on 24 May 2001. It follows a motion moved by Senator Carr that the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business table certain documents, and it follows a statement made in the Senate by me on behalf of the minister earlier this month. The documents sought are held by the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business and they relate to an industrial dispute in the meat processing industry involving G & K O'Connor Pty Ltd, the operator of an abattoir, and the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union. On 18 June, the Senate was advised that the minister was unable to respond fully to the Senate's order until the government had received and considered advice on correspondence received on 15 June from the employer party to this dispute.
I table certain of the documents subject to the order. The remainder of the documents identified in the order are not tabled, as it would be contrary to the public interest to do so. Broadly speaking, the documents that are being tabled are those for which no public interest argument exists for their non-disclosure. Conversely, the documents that are not being tabled are of a kind that have long been recognised by governments, irrespective of political persuasion, as contrary to the public interest to disclose.
The documents not tabled include confidential advice prepared by departmental officers and provided to ministers on sensitive matters to assist the deliberative processes of government. Disclosure of such documents would discourage the proper provision of advice to ministers. Were the government to disclose such information, it may prejudice the future supply of information from third parties to the Commonwealth. Such a prejudice would clearly be detrimental to effective government and contrary to the public interest. Further, some of the documents sought are drafts prepared for the internal evaluation and assessment processes within the department. Disclosure of such drafts may discourage the future discussion of such issues within departments.
In making its decision on this matter, the government is aware of the importance of the principles of transparency and accountability, and has balanced those considerations against those other factors—as have previous governments. I note, for instance, the comments made to the Senate on 3 June 1992 by the former Senator Gareth Evans, while a minister in the previous Labor government, when commenting on ministers' responsibilities when responding to orders such as this and why, in similar circumstances, he was precluded from acting upon such an order. Former Senator Evans spoke of `wrestling with the very difficult and sensitive responsibilities' he had, on the one hand, to the Senate and to the public interest to disclose as much material as he reasonably could but, on the other hand, the `responsibility to the country and to other individuals and interests that might be prejudiced by unreasonable disclosure'.
I should also add that this return to order moved by Senator Carr is not made in a vacuum. Freedom of information requests on the same subject were made of the relevant department back in 1999 by the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union and they were responded to according to the principles laid down by legislation passed by this parliament. After an internal review of those decisions, it is noteworthy that the applicant union did not exercise its further statutory rights of appeal to access documents now sought by Senator Carr. I mention this because it is important that the Senate not allow itself to become an appeal forum for documents lawfully withheld through the freedom of information process.
There has been and continues to be substantial litigation in the courts and industrial tribunals between G & K O'Connor and the union. It is also noteworthy that, for a number of years, departmental officials have responded to questions from Senator Carr and others through the Senate committee process and other forums of this parliament on the role adopted by the department in its advice on and monitoring of this dispute.
In considering this matter, it is apparent that Senator Carr is on a fishing expedition for political and industrial purposes. For over two years, he and officials of the AMIEU have been speculating and alleging publicly that the government has been improperly or unlawfully involving itself in this dispute. This is despite the responses that have been provided on the record by officials and ministers outlining the government's position in this dispute. Inconveniently for Senator Carr, there is no wrongdoing by the government, and there never has been. Senator Carr will no doubt continue to perceive a conspiracy. The government's reasons for tabling some of the requested documents, but not the remainder, go to matters of good public administration and the public interest, as well as precedent.
Finally, I inform the Senate that in making this decision to table some but not all of the relevant documents, the government has not provided the assurance sought by G & K O'Connor Pty Ltd in their correspondence of 15 June, nor provided the company with advance notice of this statement.",SENATE,<title>LEONIE GREEN AND ASSOCIATES: INVESTIGATIONG &amp; K O'CONNOR MEATWORKS: DEPARTMENTAL FILES</title>,<title>Returns to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,36,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2001-06-28,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the statement.
—For how long?
—It is normally 10 minutes or so for these sorts of responses. Given that we have no time limits on debate today, Senator Harradine, I would not have thought that the question of time would arise. The government seems to feel that we have plenty of time. I moved a motion earlier this day to conclude the proceedings at 12 o'clock. I do not recall many senators from the crossbenches supporting that motion. Senator Brown did, I believe, but I do not recall that many others did. The issue of time will perhaps be more carefully considered sometime tomorrow.
Quite clearly, the government's response to the return to order is totally inadequate. It is of course a response that one would expect. It said that some of these documents are available. Presumably, the various newspaper clippings that are in the government's file will be provided. Presumably, the copies of the Senate Hansard that are in the government's files will be provided. But I do not anticipate that a great deal more than that will be. What I am concerned about is that the government claims that these matters should not be put on the public record because there is no demonstrable public interest served by doing so. There is no explanation given as to what that grand statement means. It is said that these are matters that should remain private. No serious explanation is provided on that basis, other than it being suggested that people who would come to the government will not necessarily do so if there is a fear that the information provided to government would at a subsequent point be made public.
We have a number of propositions prepared within the government about the government's response to a quite serious situation. We are told that we are not to be provided with documents concerning the government's evaluation of what has been the longest lockout in Australian history since the 1920s—an action whereby the minister for industrial relations through his solicitors, in common with the company, has clearly acted to coerce a group of 250 of the constituents that I seek to serve into accepting wage cuts of 20 per cent. This same company has engaged a group of industrial thugs who have been involved in Queensland on previous occasions and in the waterfront dispute last year. The notorious scab herder, Townsend, has been employed by this company and, it is my allegation, has been working in concert with this government to destroy the wages and conditions of 250 people at O'Connors in Victoria.
This is of course a deliberate strategy by the company working in concert with the government in contravention of the law to de-unionise a plant. I would regard that as a serious matter that ought to concern this Senate. That is a matter that clearly raises quite profound issues in public policy terms. So when the government says that it is not in the public interest that we know about these matters, I think what we have been asked to accept is the government's proposition that it is not in our interests to know about actions it has taken which seem to me, on a prima facie basis, to involve breaches of the law.
In recent times a Channel 9 program, for instance, has demonstrated that this group supplied by Mr Townsend has been engaged in actions which are clearly outside the law. We have seen the employment of spies within the plant to illegally tape-record and coerce other workers into breaches of the law so that they would be sacked. People that have chosen to change their view as to the rights and wrongs of this dispute have been harassed at their homes. Their families have been harassed and violently intimidated. People who have come across from Tasmania to participate in this dispute have been set upon at their houses, and their families have been set upon by these paid thugs.
It is my contention that this government and this department, through its so-called workplace reform unit, have been directly involved in this dispute from the very beginning. I have been asking questions in Senate estimates for two years and I think we can demonstrate conclusively the government's complicity in these breaches of the law. That is why it is important that these questions are raised here and that is why they will continue to be raised. We will hear more, because further questions have been placed on notice whereby the government will be obliged to respond to inquiries as to the involvement of a number of officials who have been identified directly and their cooperation with a certain law firm, which just so happens to be the same law firm—the same personal solicitor—as that of the former minister, Mr Reith. So there is no doubt in my mind about the connections between the owners and operators of the O'Connors plant and members of the Senior Executive Service and other members of the Australian Public Service.
My concern is whether or not this Senate has a right to pursue these issues. I will argue that it has and that it has responsibility to do so, because there are fundamental rights in this country which I would have thought each and every one of us ought to be defending. The right to be in a union just happens to be one of those. The right to actually engage in reasonable negotiations about your wages and conditions is another. Given that these workers did not engage in one day of industrial action, one stop-work meeting in company time or one strike—not one of those things occurred—but were locked out for nearly nine months (as I said, the longest lockout since the 1920s) one would have thought we would be entitled to ask what sorts of actions are being pursued by this company. We are also entitled to pursue this when it can be demonstrated that the government has been directly involved in using the resources of government against Australian citizens in this way. For the government to say, `You're not entitled to know about this because there is no demonstrable public interest in you knowing about the detail' is complete nonsense.
If the government wishes to maintain that it is not guilty of any offence, it should produce the documents. The documents are all quite clearly listed in the FOI application. It cost the union $1,000 to make that application and was told for its trouble that, in document after document, the majority of the folios fell within the provisions of subsections 36(1) and 45(1) of the act. That is the sole explanation given to the union as to why these documents will not be provided. Of course, you are advised that you can appeal against it, but what good would that do?
There are some documents that are so extraordinarily inoffensive that one has to ask on what possible basis a government would refuse them. Clearly such things as copies of Senate Hansards fall outside the sections of the Freedom of Information Act that I have just cited. Newspaper clippings fall outside the provisions of subsections 36(1) and 45(1) of the act and are marked `not to be provided'. You pay your $1,000, and you are told that there is a whole series of files within the department but you cannot have them because they fall outside the Freedom of Information Act. Of course, that was not all that the files contained, and it would be nonsense for me to suggest to you that those were the only documents that were being sought. Folios 33 to 36 contain newspaper clippings re the G & K O'Connor dispute and are `outside the scope, under subparagraph 22(a)(ii)'. That is the government's explanation.
There are others. Extracts from Hansard—folios 38 to 41—are `outside the scope of the request' and marked `not to be provided'. An independent weekly newsletter on industrial relations—issue 1212, July 1999—is `outside the scope of the request'. Senate questions cannot be provided under FOI. They are `outside the scope of the request'.
There are other documents that I am more interested in than the questions that were asked in the parliament. They go to the evaluations of this government. They go to the actions of public servants spending public money to prosecute a case of this particular employer, at the behest of Minister Reith, in such a way that it does serious injury to that group of workers at Pakenham. I say that in the context that there were a series of meetings, prior to the actions being taken by the company, with officials from the department. Ms Leslie Riggs, who has been involved in discussions about Leonie Green, said to a Senate estimates committee:
In advance of taking that action, the proprietor of that company sought to brief the minister's office. A member of my group was present at that briefing. Since that time we have, on one or two occasions, had contact with the proprietor simply for him to confirm that he is maintaining contact with the office or with ourselves and to let us know he is remaining firm at this stage.
The inference from that statement by the officer to the estimates committee is that the government was seeking to assure itself that the employer was going to remain firm in his assault upon those particular workers. We discovered in further estimates committees that the contact between the firm and the government has been quite extensive. In that context, it is reasonable for us to ask, given the importance of this particular matter, that this parliament be advised as to what actions the government has actually taken—acting on our behalf—to assault the living standards of these particular Australians.
It seems to me that this is what this government is trying to hide from us. This is deliberate policy by this government to hide the truth. If the claims I have made are wrong, let it be demonstrated that I am wrong by putting the documents forward. As I said the other day, there are many issues here that I wish to pursue, and I expect that I will pursue them at length. I anticipate that, when those answers come back in, other issues will need to be examined as well. There may well be a need for us to put to this chamber a request for a Senate inquiry to demonstrate—once again, if the government is right—that its hands are clean, that it has not been involved in a conspiracy to undermine the wages and conditions of these particular Victorians, that it has not been involved in any illegal activity involving Mr Townshend or his company, that it has not been involved in actions to ensure that witnesses before courts in this country perjure themselves and that actions have not been taken by this government to encourage others to engage in assault against citizens of this country.
It will no doubt be argued by this government that it knew nothing of these matters. Well, produce the files! The officers told us before the estimates committees that they have had quite extensive involvement with the company and with the company's solicitors, which just so happens to be the same solicitors used by a senior minister in this government. I think these questions do require further inquiry. I trust my colleagues agree with me.",SENATE,<title>LEONIE GREEN AND ASSOCIATES: INVESTIGATIONG &amp; K O'CONNOR MEATWORKS: DEPARTMENTAL FILES</title>,<title>Returns to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,36,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2001-06-28,"—I rise very briefly to explain to the Senate the reason why I asked Senator Carr how long he sought leave to take note of a statement by the government.
 (Senator Murphy)—Are you seeking leave to make some comments in that respect?
—No, I am speaking to the motion. My request was in no way related to the subject matter of either the statement by the minister or the response by Senator Carr. Honourable senators will realise that we are in the middle of a debate that is likely to take considerable time and there are a whole lot of people in the background who would like to know when they are needed around the place. So there was no reflection. I say to Senator Carr that he should observe that I too was opposed to the extension of time tonight. I have never seen that situation, I do not think I have seen that situation where there was no open—
—It happened a couple of months ago.
—I stand corrected. But, for my part, I would like to have knocked off at midnight tonight and come back tomorrow and, if necessary, next week.

APPENDIX ONE
RESPONSE BY MR TERRY O'SHANE
PURSUANT TO RESOLUTION 5(7)(B) OF THE SENATE
OF 25 FEBRUARY 1988
On Monday evening, 25 June, 2001, Senator Heffernan made the following remarks in the Senate in the context of a speech on Child Sexual Abuse:
“Recent events have highlighted the sexual, physical and emotional abuse, often in warlike conditions, of women and children in our indigenous community. The honesty and clarity of the statements by the former chair of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, Dr Evelyn Scott, is to be commended.  The courage and strength of her family - her daughters and son, Mr Sam Backo - is awe-inspiring.  Their honesty in breaking the code of silence on the stolen innocence and ultimate betrayal of their childhood should be both a beacon of light at the end of what has been a very long and dark tunnel and an inspiration for all victims of child abuse.
In view of the widespread allegations that a high profile indigenous leader, Mr Terry O'Shane, is the person who abused members of Evelyn Scott's family, I find the contradictions and hypocrisy of some male Aboriginal leaders breathtaking - none more so than that of the deputy chairman of ATSIC, who was convicted and jailed for rape in the 1960's and is now seeking the high moral ground.”
1.	Senator Heffernan's remarks were made in the knowledge that the Supreme Court of Queensland had made an order on Friday night, 22 June, 2001 prohibiting the publication of any allegation by Dr Evelyn Scott to the effect that I sexually abused any of her children.
2.	These allegations are false and without foundation.  To my knowledge, no complaint has ever been made to the Police.  There has never been a Police investigation nor have any criminal charges ever been laid.
3.	Senator Heffernan's unfounded remarks in the Senate have done irreparable harm to my family and I and have immeasurably damaged my reputation and standing in the community.
4	Under the laws of this nation, every person is presumed to be innocent unless and until proven guilty in a Court of law.  By attacking my character in this manner, Senator Heffernan has not only harmed my family and I but has undermined the integrity of our judicial process.  It cannot be right or fair for a person's character to be destroyed under the cloak of parliamentary privilege with no recourse to legal redress.

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2001-06-28,"—I would like to seek some clarification from the minister. The amendments that we have before us at the moment go to removing from the bill the reference to an `Australian-based' organisation. That is amendment (2) on sheet ER279. Amendment (5) on the same sheet will remove the definition of `Australian-provider link'. In the same group of amendments that we are looking at, amendment (31) refers to an `Australian-customer link'. Could the minister clarify whether there are any problems in this regard? I recognise the difference in wording. Amendment (5) omits the definition of an `Australian-provider link'. Does that create any problems with amendment (31), which has a reference in it to an `Australian-customer link'.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,47,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2001-06-28,"—The short answer is that, when the bill was originally drafted, it was not anticipated that we might be able to invoke the powers that are available under the Interstate Wire Act to deal with offshore companies in the way we are proposing. The removal of the link enables us to have jurisdiction over all companies providing services to Australian gamblers whether or not they have links with Australia. We took the reference out because, in doing so, it gives us a broader power or a greater reach and enables us to take action against those providers who come to Australia whether or not they have any other connection with Australia.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,47,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2001-06-28,"—Again, for clarification, can the minister, for the benefit of the committee, convey to us whether, in removing the reference to `Australian-based', that has the effect of allowing an offshore entity to provide wagering in Australia, or is there sufficient state legislation that will preclude an offshore provider providing wagering facilities within Australia?",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,47,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2001-06-28,"—The short answer is that we would allow the provision of services from offshore in the area of wagering, because we have allowed wagering to be exempt from the provisions of the bill—wagering meaning sports betting.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2001-06-28,"—by leave—I move amendments (1) and (4) on sheet 2225:
(1)	Clause 4, page 6 (after line 9), after the definition of lottery, insert:
non-Australian-based interactive gambling service has the meaning given by section 8B.
 (4)	Page 9 (after line 14), after clause 8A, insert:
8B  Non-Australian-based interactive gambling services
	(1)	For the purposes of this Act, a non-Australian-based interactive gambling service is a gambling service, where:
	(a)	the service is provided in the course of carrying on a business; and
	(b)	the service is provided to customers using any of the following:
	(i)	an Internet carriage service;
	(ii)	any other listed carriage service;
	(iii)	a broadcasting service;
	(iv)	any other content service;
	(v)	a datacasting service; and
	(c)	the service does not have an Australian-provider link (see section 7).
Note:	This definition relates to the offences created by section 15A.
	(2)	Subsection (1) has effect subject to subsection (3).
Excluded services
	(3)	For the purposes of this Act, none of the following services is a non-Australian-based interactive gambling service:
	(a)	a telephone betting service;
	(b)	a service to the extent to which it relates to the entering into of contracts that, under the Corporations Law, are exempt from a law relating to gambling or wagering (see section 9);
	(c)	an exempt service (see section 10).
A service under subsection (1) includes any agent or intermediary used by the gambling service for the making or receipt of any payments within the meaning of subsection 8A(1)
These amendments are the first of a number amendments that I am seeking to move. I am proposing these amendments so that the legislation will be effective. Unless these amendments are accepted by the parliament, the government's legislation will be substantially ineffective. The reason for that is that nothing in this legislation, or in any proposed amendments to this legislation of which I am aware, will prevent the non-Australian based interactive gambling sites or services from taking advantage of the government's legislation. In other words, these organisations will in fact be able to conduct gambling services from outside Australia to Australian citizens. Despite what the minister said, this legislation therefore will be next to useless, unfortunately. 
Amendment (4) defines an overseas gambling service. It is described as a non-Australian based interactive service which provides a service in the course of carrying on a business using the Internet, broadcasting or datacasting, and does not have an Australian-provider link. You will note that I have dealt with the issue of agents and intermediaries in this amendment. I think Senator Greig raised this very important matter. I am aware that the National Office for the Information Economy, NOIE, at page 25, used the arguments that `overseas operators could use an intermediary to avoid financial controls'. This amendment counteracts that situation. This amendment spells out that any agent or intermediary is included in the definition of a non-Australian based interactive gambling service—an overseas gambling service—and would include associated companies such as hotels and casinos if they are part of the business. I challenge anyone to deny that that ties up those intermediaries which are chosen to avoid financial controls. 
The key issue in all of these amendments is that if you go to the question of money and ensure, by dint of the legislation, that it would be imprudent financially for overseas gambling services to undertake services to Australian customers then that is the answer. There have been all sorts of arguments put forward that generally it is technically very difficult because of ISPs and cooperation and all the rest of it. This has got nothing to do with that. This is to do with hitting them where it hurts, and that is in the back pocket. Once you start hitting them in the back pocket, they will find somewhere else to go. Later, there will be proposals from me and Senator Brown so that the contracts become unenforceable. The banking industry would be required to come into the picture. It is unfortunately necessary for me to explain that situation, because to deal with these two amendments in isolation makes it very difficult to explain. 
I will foreshadow for the committee what I am going to do later when I define, in amendment No. 3, what a prohibited payment is. All financial transactions are covered. The term `payment' would be defined inclusively to cover a wide range of payment media, including currency, cheques, credit card transactions and electronic transfers of funds such as direct debit and direct credit. So that the minister can understand this, I will quote from page 35 of the NOIE report. It states:
Other payment types such as cheque ... do not identify merchants by type of service ...
That may be so, but these amendments introduce such an element of uncertainty into gambling transactions with overseas operators that the amendments will act as a powerful deterrent. Overseas operators will be dissuaded when dealing with Australian customers if their money is at risk by law. That is the way to fix it all up. I do not know what the government is frightened of. The banking industry may be yelling in the background, but it would be very sad if the government were taking notice of the banking industry, because the banking industry itself has admitted certain things.
I draw the attention of the chamber to what the Australian Bankers Association has said in answer to questions from the South Australian Select Interactive Home Gambling Committee about other means of telecommunications. There were certain questions asked of the Australian Bankers Association, and it made certain things clear. The main force behind the South Australian inquiry was the Hon. Nick Xenophon of the South Australian Legislative Assembly. The answers that were given are very revealing as to what the banking industry itself is able to let us know about Visa cards, for example. This is what the banking industry said to that committee:
Effective December 2000, Visa Issuers—
that is, banks—
must inform their cardholders via the cardholder agreement that a Visa card may not be used for any illegal purchase.
Is this committee aware of that? The banking industry went on to say:
This is a reminder of the cardholder's responsibility to ascertain the legality of Internet gambling in his country of domicile.
Effective December 2000, Visa Issuers may systematically decline online gambling to meet local regulations, or for their own reasons.
The banks are saying that. What guarantee has the government got from the banks? If the banks are being critical of this approach, what are they now saying to the government? Is the minister aware of what the banks said to the South Australian inquiry? Are they saying one thing to the committee—when they are under the provisions of the South Australian legislature and its standing orders in respect of committees—and another thing to the federal government? The banking industry are saying that they do have a role to play in this. They have also indicated:
Visa requires Internet gambling merchants to:
	Identify the transaction as originating from a betting/gambling merchant by using the merchant category code ...
That is all right for the organisations here in Australia, but under this legislation those organisations are no longer able to conduct gaming operations. That opens it up again to the internationals. 
As I have pointed out—and I will deal with it further—the banking industry says it is quite clear that it is able to respond to situations where transactions have been conducted illegally. Just to reinforce that, I will quote from the transcript of the South Australian inquiry. The Hon. Nick Xenophon said:
Further to what the Chairman said about 90 million transactions, you do see a clear distinction between a gambler who has lost money taking a proactive role to contact the bank, and the banks themselves having to be policemen of the scheme?
On behalf of the Australian Bankers Association, Mr Gilbert responded:
Absolutely. If the community is given a right that is exercisable in those circumstances, of course we would recognise it and are quite happy to do so. That is what the law of the land provides. There is no equivocation on that. We would be very concerned about transferring the cost of detecting, identifying and policing onto the private sector, which is simply providing financial services for a whole range of legitimate consumer activities.
Why wouldn't the government, in the end, agree to the proposition that a contract between a punter and an operating overseas site is unenforceable? (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,47,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2001-06-28,"—I say to Senator Harradine that he, Senator Brown and many of us want to limit as much as possible the ability of people to gamble with offshore service providers. We all operate against a background of constant changes in technology. I do not accept the throw-in-the-towel, hopeless position of Senator Greig that it is all too hard and you just do not do anything about it. You have to do your best. I do not think it is responsible behaviour on the part of the government to essentially adopt Senator Harradine's approach, which is to make a virtue of uncertainty—make it so uncertain as to who might be hit with what. This is just random fire being sprayed around, and you hope that that will be sufficient to deter.
When I look at Senator Harradine's amendments—and bear in mind that we have had these for only a day or two—I see that the issue does require considerable careful examination of the implications. For example, this amendment talks in terms of customers. I presume a customer is meant to be a gambler or someone who is lodging a bet. But it does not give me any consolation to see a broad term such as `customer' used. You could have a customer obtaining services from someone who happens to be providing interactive gambling services but who also runs subsidiary services, whether it is operating a pizza service on the side as part of the casino operation or whether that person deals in other equipment that you could argue is for the benefit of an interactive gambling service. You may well have a host of unintended consequences.
When I look at the offence provision, I see that a person is guilty of an offence if a person makes or receives a prohibited payment. Given that we are all aware of the difficulties of taking action against someone on the other side of the world who might be providing a service or receiving a payment, and given their relative ease of dealing with someone who makes a payment in Australia, it seems to me overwhelmingly likely that this would make it a criminal offence for everyone who makes a bet in Australia with an offshore service provider. That cannot be good social policy. As we know, there are 290,000 problem gamblers. Most of these are not people who are acting rationally, or they would stop gambling. If you have people betting offshore beyond their means, to make it a criminal offence does not seem to be a way to help those people.
I say to Senator Harradine: we have sympathy for the general proposition that we should be doing what we can to limit their ability to gamble offshore, and to limit financial transactions as much as possible may well be a way to go. As I have already indicated to Senator Harradine, we have attempted to formulate some words which would go to the enforceability of illegal gaming transactions. This is the advice that I have received. I have not been sitting down with banks or anyone else, trying to work through precisely how these things would operate. It is a very arcane jurisdiction. I had Nick Xenophon explaining charge-back arrangements to me. I have no idea how clearing house operations work in practice.
All I know is that there are probably many credit provider agreements that you would have to wade through in great detail because they would probably have access to the world's best lawyers. You would have to very carefully and scientifically analyse the impact of what looks, on the face of it, to be a simple proposition: let us ban credit card transactions. If I get a statement from Visa because I bought a book overseas, it just tells me that Mark Bishop Pty Ltd sold me the book. I say, `I've never had any dealings with Mark Bishop Pty Ltd.' It just happens to be the name that that shop uses for its own purposes. It could just as easily be called Joint Venture No. 4 Pty Ltd.
In all sorts of ways, it needs a great deal of careful consideration and analysis. I am just not attracted to the idea that we should make a virtue of confusion by going ahead and doing something that looks like a good idea at the time and that throws up a lot of unintended consequences. Everyone throws their hands up in the air and says, `This is chaos,' and Senator Harradine says, `There you go, we have achieved our principal effect: we have scared a lot of people off.' A more responsible approach to take is to have this matter carefully examined, and we certainly have that in mind. Senator Vanstone wrote a letter to Senator Woodley yesterday that gives a commitment to having these matters carefully examined at the Ministerial Council on Gambling.
Senator Brown's amendment commends itself to the government. It provides a power to make regulations which would allow for an agreement to be unenforceable and to have no effect where it provides for the payment of money for the supply of an illegal interactive gambling service and that civil proceedings do not lie against a person to recover money alleged to have been won from or paid in connection with an illegal interactive gambling service. It puts a requirement on the minister to take all reasonable steps to ensure that regulations are made for the purpose within nine months. It makes it clear what direction the parliament wants to go in. It obliges the minister to take all reasonable steps to provide regulations that will address that issue.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I rise on a point of order, because I do not know what the minister is talking about. That is not an amendment that I have been provided with.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, on the point of order: Senator Harradine is quite right. That amendment has not been circulated. I have asked for it to be circulated, and I apologise that it is not in here. I did not know the minister was going to make such early reference to it. He has a copy. I will see that Senator Harradine gets one posthaste.
—I certainly think that Senator Harradine should see it for the purpose of assessing what we regard as being the better way ahead. My principal point remains that we should not be looking for a quick fix on the run. We should put ourselves in a position where we can take considered action after the matter has been thoroughly examined both at the ministerial council level and at, presumably, various other technical levels. Then you have an obligation on the minister to take all reasonable steps to introduce regulations that will give maximum effect to that statutory intent. It seems to me that that is a much safer way to proceed. You are much more likely to achieve your end objective and you are much more likely to not have a whole host of unintended consequences. For those reasons, whilst I have sympathy for what Senator Harradine is proposing to do, I think it is too complex to put something in in the hope that it will improve the situation when it may well have the opposite effect. We would rather get it right.
This puts us under pressure to take action and to carefully consider the position. There are a number of things that are being considered. As we know, Nick Xenophon was doing the rounds the other day, and he put forward a proposal which in the short time available has been considered. There are a number of other matters. Presumably, if the states are serious about harm minimisation approaches, they may well have gone down this track to some extent. There is a proposal to conduct an independent study into current ATM card technology. There are a number of issues that need to be considered in detail. That is why I am foreshadowing that the government is attracted to Senator Brown's approach, because it both gives us time to get it right and puts us under an obligation to take the matter further as quickly as we can.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,47,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2001-06-28,"—I rise to speak in support of Senator Harradine's amendments. What Senator Harradine is proposing is actually a reality. All of us know that banks outsource simple functions like the processing of cheques. That is a normal function of banking that is accepted today. In that same process we have companies like E-success—who have a subsidiary called Citadel—and Falcon, who also has a subsidiary company. Their function is to vet a card transaction in the time between it being implemented by the customer and the service being delivered by the provider. Why is this already in existence? It is in existence because we have electronic fraud. We already have a process for the step between the customer paying for the service and the provider supplying that service to check whether that card is legitimate. There is no reason whatsoever that that function could not be extended to check whether it is an Australian based card that is paying for an offshore Internet gambling function. There are two very simple steps that could be put into a process that already exists. That is why I favour Senator Harradine's process, because the ability to do that is already there. I commend Senator Harradine's amendments.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,47,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2001-06-28,"—I just wanted to respond briefly to some comments the minister made at the beginning of his contribution. The minister said, reflecting on my position on this bill, that I was saying it was all too difficult and therefore nothing should be done. That is a complete misrepresentation of my position and I will not allow it to pass. I have never said that nothing can be done. My position is that it ought not be done. I am not a prohibitionist; I do not support the prohibition of online gambling. In addition, I argue strongly—and will continue to do so throughout this debate—that it cannot be done. Regardless of your moral, philosophical or social position or reasoning, I believe strongly that technically it cannot be done. My position is that it ought not be done and cannot be done. Never have I said that it is too difficult and therefore should not be attempted.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,47,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2001-06-28,—A transaction between two or more persons which involves an illegal act—is that transaction itself not unenforceable?,SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,47,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2001-06-28,"—If you mean in terms of civil recovery, then I think it would be that an agreement is void if against public policy, from my long distant days of contract law back in the sixties. In terms of what other consequences flow, that would be a function of what is provided in the criminal law itself. And you often find, for example, that there is no penalty imposed on a mere purchaser; it is only on the provider. You may well find, for example, that the benefits are all one way.
I seem to recall there were a range of cases on this in terms of void if against public policy and gambling and I think in some respects that operated to mean that a gambler could get his money back but a service provider could not, so there is not an equality of treatment necessarily. It often depended where the loss had fallen as to whether the courts would simply let the loss lie where it fell or intervene and allow action to be taken to recover it to protect the interests of the party with less bargaining power—that being the gambler.
It simply highlights the fact that we are all wanting to go in the same direction. No-one is for a moment standing here saying, `People want to gamble offshore—away they go,' although I think you can probably distinguish between people who pay cash and people who bet with credit cards, because you can say that the person betting with a credit card may well be betting beyond their means and ability to pay, whereas a person who has cash, presumably, at least has the current wherewithal. But in principle we are all trying to do what we can to limit the ability of Australians to gamble offshore, because if we are making it illegal to gamble here we should therefore be doing our best to limit their ability to do the same thing elsewhere.
I am simply concerned to ensure that we get it right and I feel profoundly uncomfortable with going ahead with what might look like a simple proposition but which may take you to all sorts of areas that you do not want to end up in. That is why the cautious approach is the right one here. It does mean that we are not just walking away from it saying that we will have a look at it later when we have a review. The amendment of Senator Brown actually does put the onus very much on the government to conduct inquiries, to look into what is feasible and then to take appropriate action. It seems to me that is the way we should be going.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,47,1,speech
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,2001-06-28,"—Minister, you referred to the letter from Senator Vanstone to me in this particular debate a few minutes ago. Did you table the letter? If not, I think it should be incorporated in Hansard and I seek leave to have that happen.
Leave granted.
The letter read as follows—
Senator John Woodley
Senator for Queensland
Parliament House
CANBERRA ACT 2600
27 June 2001
Dear Senator Woodley
I would like to assure you that the Commonwealth is absolutely committed to reducing the harm that problem gambling imposes on the community. We also share your concern over the impact that new forms of gambling are having on individuals and families. With this in mind, I am writing to outline the work being done by the Commonwealth and the Ministerial Council on Gambling in relation to problem gambling. I also hope to underscore the Commonwealth's determination in this area, inform you of the work that we are planning to undertake in the future and make a commitment that the Commonwealth will proceed with the development of a National Harm Minimisation Strategy on Problem Gambling.
As you may be aware, after a period of inaction by the states, the Commonwealth established the Ministerial Council on Gambling. At the Council's meeting in April 2001, as a first step towards a common approach, a National Strategic Framework on Problem Gambling was agreed to. The Framework aims to provide a platform for the sharing of information and good practice between jurisdictions on issues associated with problem gambling. It will also build on work already undertaken collaboratively between jurisdictions and be a vehicle for the development of some national initiatives. The National Strategic Framework has four themes; prevention, early intervention and continuing support, building effective partnerships, and national research and evaluation.
At the same meeting, the Council also agreed to evaluate the impacts of pre-commitment schemes, the phasing out of note acceptors, breaks in gaming machine operation and linked jackpots. These topics will be added to the work program of the working party on research. The working party will report back to the Ministerial Council on the current research programs and also facilitate new research initiatives.
Other relevant matters that are under active consideration by the Ministerial Council include setting limits to the further growth in the numbers of poker machines in any area, restricting the hours that poker machines might operate and placing messages on machines about the amounts won and lost, and time spent playing.
Only recently, I also announced the membership of the National Advisory Body on Gambling. This body reports to directly to me. On 5 June, the Advisory Body agreed that it would seek public submissions on the best focus for new research into problem gambling, best practice harm minimisation and possible areas for Commonwealth intervention.
I am convinced that the Ministerial Council's collaborative approach is essential to achieve sustainable, long-term results, nevertheless, I share your view that efforts need to expedited in order to minimise the harm that problem gambling is currently having on individuals, families and the community.
With this urgency in mind, I am proposing that the information gathered by the Advisory Body be worked into a draft National Harm Minimisation Strategy on Problem Gambling. I then propose that this document be presented to the Ministerial Council on Gambling for their consideration.
While I am sure that the strategy I have mapped out is the only way to achieve effective results in our federal framework, I would welcome any suggestions you may care to offer to strengthen or expedite this strategy. In particular, I am keen to hear of your views on harm minimisation and the research that you think needs to be undertaken to ensure that properly informed policy decisions are made.
Should you wish to arrange a meeting to discuss these important issues, please contact my office on 02 6277 7560.
Yours sincerely

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2001-06-28,"—Minister, you have been having this discussion with Senator Harradine and Senator Brown and opposing Senator Harradine's amendment, which I think at first glance most people regard as one that would be completely effective in achieving the government's end purpose of restricting growth of interactive gambling. I do not pass any comment as to the utility of the approach but it certainly reads on first glance to be effective in achieving the stated purpose of the government that has been spelt out in recent months.
As I understand it, we have Senator Brown's amendment, which similarly addresses this issue. As I understand your remarks, there has been some sort of discussion with Senator Brown and perhaps an agreement reached as to process if his amendment should be passed by this chamber. Does the minister mind putting on the record—so we can all understand—what has been the outcome of his negotiations on this issue with Senator Brown and what undertakings derive from that which are imposed upon the government in terms of future action in respect of those undertakings? I am a little bit unsure as to how specific they are.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,47,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2001-06-28,"—There have been discussions between various senators in my office, many of which I have not been privy to. I have essentially been concerned to try and judge these issues on the merits and to look at what seems to me to make sense and what does not. I simply say again that you say it looks like eminent commonsense on the face of it but I am very nervous about something that makes it an offence—I presume a criminal offence—for a person to make a payment to an offshore gambling provider. That just means an ordinary common garden Australian who has a bet on the Internet commits a criminal offence. It does not seem to me to be what we are on about here. We are trying to make it very difficult for offshore service providers to cater for Australian gamblers.
Senator Harradine's notion of maximum uncertainty, I am sure, is directed entirely to those providers to try and discourage them, whereas the mere fact that they are offshore makes it much less likely that you will be able to do anything tangible about their behaviour—certainly in terms of it being an offence. I would have thought that again it would only be if they came to Australia that you could prosecute them because you do not have an extraterritorial power that is recognised internationally. If these services are being provided from the Caribbean, you really cannot do anything about it in terms of it being an offence. All you are left with is an offence committed by ordinary Australians who have made what might be a very modest bet—it might be someone who can well afford to lose substantial sums of money having a modest bet on an irregular basis and they commit the offence. That is not where I would want to end up in all this. I think what we are trying to do is say that consumers are not the problem here; the only people who are wanting online gambling are the providers because they see a lot of money to be made out of it. We should be making their lives as difficult as possible. I agree with Senator Harradine on that. It is then a matter of how you can best achieve that outcome. Even on the face of it, the amendment that Senator Harradine has put before the committee just needs further work.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,47,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2001-06-28,"—I was not asking that question to take a partisan position as to the utility of the amendment moved by Senator Harradine one way or the other. I was more seeking to get an understanding on the public record of the nature of any agreement, if it does exist, between the government and Senator Brown. You have just informed us there have been a series of negotiations in your office—some of those you have participated in, some you haven't. I have just been handed an amendment to be moved by Senator Brown in due course as to the making of regulations in respect of illegal interactive gambling services.
What I am trying to establish is: what process has the government undertaken to go through now? Are you going to have some sort of review? Who is going to conduct the review? When will it be concluded? Will it be made a public document? If the review recommends a particular course of action, how is the government going to give effect to it? What are the regulations seeking to achieve? If you are unable or unwilling to make us privy to your discussions, I would put the same question to Senator Brown, so that we have an understanding of what the outcome will be of the alternative position if Senator Harradine's amendment is defeated.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,47,1,speech

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2001-06-28,"—When Senator Harradine's amendment comes to a vote we will not be supporting it, Senator Brown.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,47,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-06-28,"—That is quite important. I thank the opposition for that because the government is not supporting that or similar amendments that I have as well. I would support Senator Harradine's amendment because I think it is the right one. Given that situation where on the crossbench we are faced with the government and the opposition both setting themselves against the unenforceable agreement provisions that Senator Harradine has quite rightly brought forward and a similar amendment I have, my office has been talking with the minister's office. I have not done it directly, but my office has been doing so to come up with this amendment, which says that the minister must take all reasonable steps to have regulations for this purpose within six months. You might note, because it is on the record, that it was nine months. I have insisted that be brought back to six months because I want to see it this year. No doubt it will be brought in and dealt with this year.
I agree with Senator Harradine and Senator Harris and others that the mechanism is there. But it is a big breakthrough to use this mechanism on an industry as big as this one. I do not want to see it dropped simply because we do not have the numbers in this place. Getting the government committed to this course of action is very important. Therefore, I have brought forward this alternative amendment, but it is effectively a fallback situation for me. I will be voting for Senator Harradine's amendment.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,47,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2001-06-28,"—Is the minister suggesting that you can make it an offence for the provider but not for the customer, the punter? Is the minister suggesting that that would hold up in law? Is the minister aware of the argument that this could be open to fraud? This is a very key point. Quite clearly I would love to be in a situation of saying let the provider beware, not let the customer beware. I assume now that, because of the other amendments, the overseas site will be an illegal site and they will be acting illegally in accordance with Australian law. You are saying that, on the one hand, one person involved in the transaction will be committing an offence, whereas the other person will not be committing an offence. Do you think that is going to stand up? I would have loved to have done that because I think that is a great joke. The punter could run up a lot of winnings and then, if he runs up losings, he dobs the overseas site into his bank and says `Don't pay.' Are we being realistic here? I was advised, though I did not obtain legal advice about this, that it could be regarded as opening the way for fraud.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,47,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2001-06-28,"—I hope Senator Harradine will appreciate that this sort of advice is not worth very much. My understanding from first principles of criminal law is that you can make something an offence in any form you would like. I recall, for example, that it was illegal under the Police Offences Act to provide services for prostitution, but it was not illegal for someone to take advantage of those services. Guttercrawling used to be a way of frightening people off. If you were driving too slowly down the street, they would pick you up for guttercrawling even though they really knew what you were on about. You had a situation where the offence was not on the part of the consumer; it was on the part of the service provider. I do not think we ever called them `service providers' in those days, but that is probably what they were doing. 
The criminal law can go wherever it wants to. Parliament is the ultimate authority. If it wants to ignore or modify or have a one-sided outcome, it can do all of those things. That is my understanding. Maybe you could get into arguments about whether you are aiding and abetting, and again, I suppose, you could have a specific provision that said, `No conduct on the part of a gambler should be construed as aiding and abetting or colluding with' or whatever else, even though you say you might be happily taking advantage of the service while you are winning and then dobbing them in when you lose. You can spell it out in any form you like, essentially.
All those issues deserve to be explored. They are social policy judgments. Some people might say that the maximum deterrent effect is to tell all these punters that they are actually at risk of going to jail if they gamble offshore and so there is a social purpose to be achieved. On the other hand, people might say, `Well, they are really quasi-innocent victims and we should be focusing on the real offenders.' It is certainly an area of legitimate public debate that should be carefully considered. I am grateful to Senator Brown for the efforts he has made to come up with a workable solution.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,47,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2001-06-28,"—I thank Senator Brown for his response to my previous question, but that puts the question back to you, Minister. If Senator Brown's amendment gets up, you have six months to make some regulations, under section 69, which go to Senator Brown's purpose. Are you going to be conducting an inquiry? Will it be done within your office? Will it be done by NOIE? Will it be a public inquiry? Will there be an opportunity for public input into that inquiry? Once the inquiry is concluded, is it intended that it be made public or tabled on the floor of either house for inspection?",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,47,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2001-06-28,"—We are putting a framework in place here. We are not endeavouring to spell out, step by step, precisely what will flow from it. However, it does impose obligations. It requires the minister to take all reasonable steps. As I understand it, the ministerial council meeting will occur within that period so that will obviously be an important opportunity to explore all of these things to see where the states have got to in terms of their harm minimisation strategies and what they have already discovered in terms of feasibility in going down this path. We will certainly be doing whatever we can to give effect to the obligation that this provision would place on the government.
As I have said repeatedly, we are in sympathy with the whole approach so there is no question of us somehow saying, `Right, we can forget about all this.' We actually want to make it work and we will do whatever we can to explore all the possibilities. There is not much point in me trying to be definitive today. If this amendment is carried, we will have a statutory obligation. There will be at least one major event and all the parties around the country who are interested will presumably have views on the subject which they will direct to us. I am sure that Senator Brown, Senator Harradine and Senator Woodley, who has probably lived with this issue for longer than most people, will all have suggestions which, by and large, will prove to be very helpful.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,47,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-06-28,"—I think that the opposition is pursuing the point of whether there is going to be a full-blown public inquiry into this, and I cannot see the purpose of that. We have evidence from Senator Harradine and from Senator Harris, and I have it as well, having spoken to the banking authorities and the other people who are most engaged with this issue, that it can be done. This provides the opportunity to ensure that there are no glitches. The government has the ability to get the expert advice and to come up with the regulations, and then it is up to us to tackle those regulations in here if we think that they are faulty.

This comprehensive set of amendments deals with foreign based interactive gambling services. They are aimed at most appropriately defining regulations within the legislation to deal with foreign based interactive gambling services. The concern of the majority in the Senate is not to allow foreign based services to ply their trade in Australia. This set of amendments is the premium set of amendments to deal with that. However, I am aware that they do not have the numbers to get through the Senate. I wanted to make the point forcefully, but I will leave the matter there.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2001-06-28,"—by leave—I move my amendments (2), (3) and (5) on sheet 2225:
(2)	Clause 4, page 6 (after line 19), after the definition of prohibited Internet gambling service, insert:
prohibited payment has the meaning given by section 8A.
(3)	Page 9 (after line 14), after clause 8, insert:
8A  Prohibited payments
	(1)	For the purposes of this Act, a prohibited payment is either:
	(a)	a payment made for the benefit of a non-Australian-based interactive gambling service by, or on behalf of, a customer who is physically present in Australia; or
	(b)	a payment made by, or on behalf of, a non-Australian-based interactive gambling service for the benefit of a customer who is physically present in Australia.
	(2)	A payment includes, but is not limited to, any or all of the following forms of payment:
	(a)	an amount of Australian currency;
	(b)	an amount of foreign currency;
	(c)	a cheque;
	(d)	a money order;
	(e)	a credit card transaction;
	(f)	an electronic transfer of funds;
	(g)	a bill of exchange;
	(h)	a promissory note;
	(i)	a loan;
	(j)	a transfer or allotment of securities;
	(k)	an agreement or contract conferring on a person a right (whether actual or contingent) to receive any valuable consideration or the performance of any service.
Note:	This definition relates to offences created by section 15A.
(5)	Page 11 (after line 22), after Part 2, insert:
Part 2A—Prohibited payments
15A  Offences relating to prohibited payments
	(1)	A person is guilty of an offence if the person makes or receives a prohibited payment.
Penalty:
	(a)	for a person who is customer of an interactive gambling service—10 penalty units; or
	(b)	for any other person—200 penalty units.
	(2)	A constitutional corporation is guilty of an offence if the corporation makes or receives a prohibited payment.
Penalty:	1,000 penalty units.
	(3)	It is a defence to a prosecution of a person or a corporation for an offence against subsection (1) or (2), as the case may be, if the person or corporation proves that the person or corporation did not know, and could not with reasonable diligence have discovered, that the person or corporation was making or receiving a prohibited payment.
	(4)	In this section:
constitutional corporation means:
	(a)	a foreign corporation; or
	(b)	a trading corporation to which paragraph 51(xx) of the Constitution applies; or
	(c)	a financial corporation to which paragraph 51(xx) of the Constitution applies; or
	(d)	a corporation incorporated in a Territory.
	(e)	a body corporate that carries on, as its sole or principal business, the business of:
	(i)	banking (other than State banking not extending beyond the limits of the State concerned); or
	(ii)	insurance (other than State insurance not extending beyond the limits of the State concerned);
	(f)	a body corporate that is a holding company of a body corporate covered by any of the above paragraphs.
15B  Agreements relating to prohibited payments unenforceable
		Any agreement, whether oral or in writing, that relates to a payment that is a prohibited payment under this Act has no effect, and no action may be brought or maintained in any court to recover any such payment.
It is important that we at least have in the legislation a definition of `prohibited payment'. Irrespective of what the government might or might not do, we should deal with this matter so that it is in the legislation, no matter what happens. `Prohibited payment' is defined in proposed section 8A(1) as:
	(a)	a payment made for the benefit of a non-Australian-based interactive gambling service by, or on behalf of, a customer who is physically present in Australia; or
	(b)	a payment made by, or on behalf of, a non-Australian-based interactive gambling service for the benefit of a customer who is physically present in Australia.
No matter what happens to my other amendments, that provision is necessary if the government is going down the track of regulation. I for one am not very happy about leaving major questions to government for its regulatory decisions. Matters should be contained in legislation. Proposed section 8A(2) states:
A payment includes, but is not limited to, any or all of the following forms of payment ...
I will not go through all those forms—you can see them in front of you. In amendment (5) I put forward the offences to be created by proposed section 15A which apply to four categories of persons. I put that forward on the understanding that you may run into problems if it is not an offence to gamble on a prohibited site which is an overseas site. I could accept the minister's advice and thus excise any offence being created for an individual customer—I am open to that. But, as the government has indicated that it will vote down the amendments—and, of course, the opposition has constantly stated that it has an overall view on all of the proposed amendments, and I understand that—there is no point in my proceeding further than to ask that the amendments be put to the vote.
Under proposed section 15A, which is headed `Offences relating to prohibited payments', the penalty for a person who is a customer of an interactive gambling service is 10 penalty units. I seek leave to excise proposed section 15A(1) on the last page of sheet 2225.
Leave granted.

15D  Agreements relating to unlawful gambling unenforceable
	(1)	Any agreement, whether oral or in writing, that relates to any form of gambling that is prohibited under this Act has no effect, and no action may be brought or maintained in any court to recover any money alleged to have been won from, or any money paid in connection with, any such form of gambling.
	(2)	Nothing in subsection (1) applies to or in respect of any form of gambling that is otherwise lawful.
	(3)	Any agreement, whether oral or in writing, that relates to funds transfer to, or through, an intermediary for the sole or dominate to facilitate transfer of cleared funds to a gambling service provider who is providing a service that is unlawful under this Act has no effect and no action may be brought or maintained in any court to recover any money alleged to have been won from, or any money paid in connection with, any such transfers.
	(4)	Nothing in subsection (3) applies to or in respect of any form of funds transfer that is otherwise lawful.

	(1)	A person must not provide, by means of the Internet, subscription broadcasting or narrowcasting or any other online communications system, any service that enables a person to gain access to any form of gambling service prohibited by this Act.
Penalty:	50 penalty units.
	(2)	Subsection (1) does not apply to, or in respect of, any form of gambling that is otherwise lawful.
	(3)	The regulations may exempt any person, or class of persons, from the operation of part or all of subsection (1) in such circumstances, and subject to such conditions, as may be specified in the regulations.
This is the amendment which makes it an offence to provide an electronic link to an interactive gambling service. It is a bit like if I have my bookshop with a little blinking sign facing customers which says, `If you want a quick bet with your change, press this button and maybe you will go straight to an overseas gambling site—who knows?' It is to stop that from happening. I recommend that strongly to the committee.

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2001-06-28,"—I think the shortest answer is that this bill is all about prohibiting interactive activities, particularly the new and exciting temptations that are likely to be coming online shortly. It is not about correcting the current problems that are essentially the responsibility of the states. We have always taken the view that we have clear constitutional power, under the telecommunications power, to deal with interactive activities in all their manifestations but that poker machines and their regulation are a matter for the states. It is true that technology now allows a number of things to occur in terms of linking poker machines—for data and monitoring purposes, for example, which can be quite helpful in assessing the activities. But linked jackpots, which I think is what you have in mind as the vice you seek to remedy, are really part and parcel of the way in which poker machines have evolved. It is very much open to the states to deal with the excesses of the poker machine business. We would certainly encourage them to do that, and we will be doing that through the ministerial council and elsewhere. But we do not believe that this act, which is essentially concerned with interactive gambling activities, should be used as a means of incidentally dealing with the offline old forms of gambling.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,47,1,speech

9B  Designated country-customer link
		For the purposes of this Act, a gambling service has a designated country-customer link if, and only if, any or all of the customers of the service are physically present in a designated country.
These amendments are to prevent the export from Australia of Internet gambling to certain designated countries. I am sure all senators have read the amendments including, at the back, the section headed `Offence of providing an Australian-based interactive gambling service to customers in designated countries'. In brief, this addresses my concern right from the outset that the majority in this place is wanting to move to prevent Internet gambling because of the damage it causes to Australian society, but the legislation ostensibly allows gambling houses in Australia to export Internet gambling facilities all around the world to other countries. It is obvious that what is bad for Australian households is bad for households elsewhere around the world. This provision allows another country which does not want Australian service providers exporting gambling into its domestic situation and which has similar legislation in place to say to the Australian government, `Please put us on the list as a designated country to make it illegal for a gambling house in Australia to export to us.' That is a good neighbour policy. I think it is somewhat of a breakthrough in terms of innovative legislation, and I strongly commend it to the committee.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,47,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2001-06-28,"—I too will be supporting these amendments. I think they are important. Initially my colleague Senator Woodley and I were concerned about the prospect of Australia's indicating that there were dangers—as indeed there are—associated with a massive expansion of interactive gambling online. To us it seemed to be untenable to say that this was a danger for our own citizens but we were not prepared to protect other countries that thought likewise. This is a good compromise to that blanket ban. It still allows Australian companies, which in some states at least are well regulated, to provide a service which is welcome in some parts and to some people. So this is a good solution which does allow other countries to opt in to our ban. I hope that it will be an encouragement to many countries around the world, when they examine the potential dangers of interactive gambling, to take a lead from Australia and that it will be easier for them to do so because of our precedent and our willingness to take on board their concerns about operatives in this country working in their country. I will vote for these amendments with some enthusiasm.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,47,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2001-06-28,"—The government also accepts the proposition. It is very much in line with what I have been saying consistently for some weeks and months now. We do not have jurisdiction over other countries and we have no right to presume that they do not want certain types of social activity but, where they make it plain through their parliaments that they do have a similar view, we have an obligation to respond positively. Therefore, I acknowledge these amendments as being very much in line with what we have been advocating.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,47,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2001-06-28,"—The flaw in this argument is the fact that, if we were to succeed in banning online gambling from within Australia to Australians, or from an online gaming provider that is Australian to an offshore site, they can simply move offshore. Mr Kerry Packer has already said that, if his operations in online gambling are frustrated in Australia, he will move to Vanuatu—an obvious outcome. I do not mean to single him out—it could apply to anybody or any organisation—but Australian companies could still locate themselves in a country where there was no prohibition, such as Vanuatu, and continue their services into those countries that would theoretically be banned from receiving those services from within Australia. So the argument to me is a nonsense. For that reason, I cannot support the amendments.
Amendments agreed to.
Amendments (by Senator Alston)—by leave—agreed to.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2001-06-28,"—I move Democrat amendment (1):
Clause 68, page 49 (lines 25 and 26), omit subclause (1), substitute:
	(1)	Before 1 July 2003, the Minister must cause to be conducted a review of the following matters:
	(a)	the operation of this Act;
	(b)	the growth of interactive gambling services;
	(c)	the social and commercial impact of interactive gambling services;
	(d)	the effect of the following provisions:
	(i)	paragraphs 5(3)(aa) and 6(3)(aa) and section 8A (excluded wagering services);
	(ii)	paragraphs 5(3)(ab) and 6(3)(ab) and section 8B (excluded gaming services);
	(iii)	paragraphs 5(3)(ac) and 6(3)(ac) and section 8C (services that have a designated broadcasting link);
	(iv)	paragraphs 5(3)(ad) and 6(3)(ad) and section 8C (services that have a designated datacasting link);
	(v)	paragraphs 5(3)(ae) and 6(3)(ae) and section 8D (excluded lottery services);
	(e)	the effectiveness of this Act in dealing with the social and commercial impact of interactive gambling services;
	(f)	technological developments that are relevant to the regulation of interactive gambling services;
	(g)	technological developments that may assist in dealing with problem gambling.
This amendment brings forward the review which was in the legislation for 2004 to 1 July 2003 and identifies, in terms of reference, the matters to be considered in that review. They include the effectiveness and operation of the legislation. They look at the exemptions which have been agreed to—wagering, lotteries and the like. They also look at the technological developments, which I think are likely to develop and arise over the next two years or so. I think it is important that we have this review and that it takes place sooner than was planned. In that period of time there will be an opportunity to see, as I said, how effective the bill has been. I think we will also see in that period of time a development of interactive gambling through datacasting, through digital television and the like. Already, as I mentioned in my second reading contri-bution, there are many organisations which have identified those last two areas I ment-ioned—interactive television—as being opportunities for exploitation and great opportunities for generating wealth, very often at other people's expense. I commend this amendment as being a way in which we can see at a sooner stage how well this ban is being put into effect.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,49,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-06-28,"—I will be supporting that amendment. I want to comment on some public response to this legislation as it proceeds. Lasseters say that the legislation and amendments that were passed today have set a dangerous precedent for global Internet censorship and call the amendment, which is the one to do with designated countries, `totally unnecessary', but then go on to threaten the minister with legal action, although the minister has not done anything yet. They also say that they might seek compensation in the High Court. In a very twisted argument, they say, `We have voluntarily adopted the policy'—that is, of stopping players from registering—`if they reside in states or countries prohibiting online gambling on religious or legislative grounds.' They have a policy that they say is the equivalent to what the Senate has passed today; but the Senate cannot do it, the parliament cannot do it—Lasseters can. 
We have this extraordinary situation of a big gambling company threatening action against the parliament moving to prohibit online gambling from Australia being exported to a country that says, `Please, do not send it to us because we have similar laws to you, and we do not want it exported to citizens in our country either. You do not allow it in Australia; we do not want it exported to our country.' What an extraordinary thing from Lasseters. Yet, after saying that they are looking at the law and what they might do about challenging the minister abusing the powers and questioning in the High Court the constitutional rights to enact the law—that is, questioning our right in the Senate to amend this legislation as we see fit—they go on to bring out the biggest threat of the lot, the daddy of threats. They say that this legislation may be subject to action through the World Trade Organisation. Aren't Australians going to be glad to hear Lasseters threatening us with the World Trade Organisation because we are trying to regulate gambling in this country and, in so doing, say, `We want to extend the same sorts of opportunities to other countries that may be affected by this'?
I think Lasseters need to take an orange juice, to settle down a little, to think about their responsibility as a corporate citizen in the same way that we are considering our responsibility as a parliamentary citizen and to come up with something more construc- tive than that. I think they may well do themselves a service if they think much more about how they can make their services unavailable to problem gamblers altogether, whether they be overseas or here. I know Lasseters have a big clientele overseas. If they say that do not operate where it is against religious tenets, then they need to think about whether they should operate in circumstances which are socially repugnant, whether or not they are religious. It is a nice try from Lasseters, but it will not wash.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,49,1,speech
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NP,2001-06-28,"—I would like to direct a question to the minister. I refer to government amendment No. 27, which says:
	(1)	For the purposes of this Act, an excluded lottery service is:
	(a)	a service for the conduct of a lottery; or
	(b)	a service for the supply of lottery tickets.
	(2)	Subsection (1) does not apply to an electronic form of:
	(a)	scratch lottery; or
	(b)	other instant lottery.
Could the minister inform me whether a game of keno that throws up results every five minutes would be excluded under clause 8D?",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,49,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2001-06-28,"—The excluded service provision involves a new definition. You will find it on sheet XX222, the Australian Democrats amendments. Amendment No. 3 states:
(1B)	Without limiting subsection (1A), a condition specified in regulations made for the purposes of that subsection may provide that the lottery must not be:
	(a)	a highly repetitive or frequently drawn form of a keno-type lottery; or
	(b)	a similar lottery.
The scheme of the act is that gaming is banned, and gaming involves casino like activities where you do have frequent and repetitive conduct. Insofar as keno activity is conducted offline, that is not of concern to this legislation. Insofar as it is conducted online, it would probably be caught by the gaming definition. If it is not and it is occurring frequently and repetitively in accordance with that definition, it will be ruled out. There is a general discretion vested in the minister to limit or preclude those types of activities, and that Democrats amendment will allow us, after the event if necessary, to take action in respect of any particular offering.
As I understand it, these things are not available now. Obviously, there will be many modifications and new initiatives, both home-grown and imported, and we will need to have that general power in order to give effect to the spirit of the legislation. It is one thing to allow a lottery which occurs on a periodic basis—it is a defined event which ought to be allowed because there is no evidence that it is socially harmful—but it is another thing to have events which occur frequently and repetitively, where people have the opportunity and almost the inevitability of losing significant sums of money in a fairly short period of time. They will be caught either under the gaming provision or under the general discretionary power vested in the minister to take action in respect of highly repetitive or frequently drawn forms of keno type lotteries or similar lotteries.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,49,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2001-06-28,—Earlier I spoke about Democrats amendment No. 1 on a different running sheet. I realise now where we are at. My amendment No. 1 relates to the minister setting conditions on the exemptions which will be disallowable.

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2001-06-28,"—In light of Senator Boswell's question to the minister, I would like to seek clarification. The third dot point on page 1 of the government's supplementary explanatory memorandum says:
The proposed Government Amendments to the Interactive Gambling Bill 2001:
...	...	...
clarify that television games and trade promotions are exempt from the scope of the Bill ...
Could the minister clarify whether such programs as Who Wants to be a Millionaire? and The Weakest Link would be caught by this legislation, or would they be excluded?",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,49,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2001-06-28,"—There are certain games and promotions that might unintentionally be captured by the original provisions of the bill, including services running in conjunction with television broadcasts such as Big Brother or Who Wants to be a Millionaire? Of course, it has not been the intention in the whole scope of this bill to limit current activity which precedes interactive technology. Therefore, because of the difficulty of anticipating precisely what might emerge but recognising that there may well be some relatively harmless categories of interactive programming run by the television networks, the government's amendments will exempt such services that are expressly and exclusively associated with a particular broadcast program or solely provided for the purpose of promoting goods or services other than gambling services that are the subject of advertisements that are broadcast—in other words, t-commerce. These services are not gambling and are not intended to be covered. However, the government's amendments do build in a review mechanism to allow a re-examination of the social impacts of these services before two years has elapsed.
Some concerns were expressed that the legislation might also operate to unintentionally ban game shows or promotions like Video Hits or Classic Catches, where there is some form of entry fee, such as a 1900 phone call. Because these services were not intended to be covered by the legislation, we are introducing amendments to exempt them and future services offered in conjunction with material on digital and interactive television but subject to a ministerial power to impose further conditions, with a review of this part of the legislation after two years.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,49,1,speech

	(4)	Paragraphs (1)(a), (b) and (c) do not apply to the extent to which the service relates to betting on a horse race, harness race or greyhound race that is to be held anywhere in Australia, unless the person who provides the service is authorised under a law of a State or Territory to provide the service.
	(5)	Paragraph (2)(a) does not apply if the person who provides the service is:
	(a)	authorised under a law of a State or Territory to provide the service; and
	(b)	is bound by a national Code of Practice prepared by a body that is representative of legal Australian wagering service providers and approved by a majority of State and Territory Racing Ministers.
	(6)	The regulations may exempt a person who is bound by a national Code of Practice mentioned in paragraph (5)(b) from the operation of paragraph (2)(b) in such circumstances, and subject to such conditions, as are prescribed.
These amendments are to bring the Commonwealth legislation closer in line with the state legislation. Amendment (2) has the ability to insert in subsection (1) the ability for a person to place a bet by telephone as a service to the extension as it relates to a bet on an event, a series of events or a contingency in horseracing, harness racing, greyhound racing or a sporting event.
One of the primary reasons for moving this amendment is that, in the government's original bill, there was an exclusion that would allow those people with a disability to be able to use the Internet to place a wagering bet—only those with a disability. TABs around Australia now have the ability with voice recognition to recognise the voice of a disabled person. That is why we are asking for this to be inserted in this section of the bill. It would allow the disabled to use a telephone with voice recognition to place a wagering bet with their TAB. That is the purpose of that section of the amendments.
The purpose of amendment (4) is to bring the Commonwealth legislation closer to the state requirements. Subsection (4) of amendment (4) would have the function of excluding any overseas providers for the purpose of placing a wagering bet in Australia, and I believe that should receive the support of the majority of the senators in the chamber. The intention of the amendment is to mirror the state licensing requirements for wagering and, in doing so, it would exclude a service provider from outside Australia providing a service for wagering within Australia. I commend both of the amendments, particularly the amendments that will allow the disabled in Australia to use voice recognition to place their wagering bets.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,49,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2001-06-28,"—I will just indicate why the government opposes these amendments. Insofar as telephone betting is concerned, I do not quite understand what Senator Harris's desire to extend the ability for disabled people to use the Internet has to do with telephone betting. Telephone betting is a legal activity now and I do not think anyone has proposed to ban it or indeed make it subject for the first time to Australian licensing requirements. Telephone typewriter facilities have been available for quite some time for those who are not able to use the telephone for making a voice call. They can now type in the message that can be then transmitted via a computer and converted into a voice call at the other end. It is perfectly possible for disabled people to use the telephone for betting, and I do not therefore see why we should be imposing restrictions on telephone betting.
As far as the second proposal is concerned, I am not clear whether this is only designed to apply to activities in Australia or whether it is effectively saying that you cannot provide wagering services from offshore unless you are licensed by an Australian authority. If it is the latter, given that we are allowing sports betting to occur, it does not seem to me to make much sense to say that you can bet on Australian events and with Australian providers but you cannot go offshore. You may be a very irregular punter—you may simply want to bet on Ascot once a year. You want to check the best odds, so you go to William Hill or Ladbrokes. They have better odds, but because they are not licensed in Australia to provide that service somehow that becomes illegal. That is illogical.
If we are providing an exemption for sports betting, we can obviously address some of the excesses of that activity by a variety of means, which the states keep swearing on a stack of bibles they are about to get around to doing. Insofar as the activity itself is concerned, I do not see why we should suddenly be imposing a licensing requirement when the Commonwealth's responsibility is to regulate the activity itself, and the states can impose any additional obligations that they choose.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,49,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2001-06-28,"—I thank the minister for his response. The clear intention is to exclude a provider of a service from outside of Australia. The majority of punters who are going overseas normally have arrangements with their own Australia based betting services. This amendment is not intended in any way to exclude an Australian citizen who is outside of Australia from placing a bet with a service provider from within Australia. Its clear intent is to ensure that nobody from offshore can provide a service unless they have a licence to provide that service that is authorised by a state or a territory. As I said in my speech in the second reading debate, we already have one service provider in Vanuatu who has a turnover of over half a billion dollars annually. That does not bring any benefits to the Australian people, nor does that person pay any turnover tax to the state governments.
This is the purpose of these amendments: to ensure that a wagering facility cannot be put in place unless that person has a licence that is granted by a state or a territory. It is not intended to exclude a person from being overseas and betting on a service that is provided by an Australian licensed provider; it is to ensure that we do not end up with a proliferation of service providers offshore who are actually deriving the benefits from their businesses and not returning anything to Australia. Very briefly, I read into the record in my speech earlier a section about the approximate $600 million which the racing industry pays by way of fees or taxes to the state governments. These amendments are distinctly directed towards ensuring that the industry will continue to be Australian based and not run by a service provider outside of Australia.

 (Senator George Campbell)—The question now is that the government amendments, as amended, be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,49,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2001-06-28,"—I think it is probably appropriate at this time to make a few comments. I will address my comments to the issue of wagering but they apply generally to the list of exemptions that have been moved by the government as amended by the various crossbench parties. The opposition want to make five points at the outset and I will develop each briefly.
Firstly, the bill still permits Australians access to Internet wagering and we make the obvious point that wagering is hardly immune from causing gambling problems. Wagering is as much of a problem in terms of problem gambling as any other form of gambling and to exclude it seems, to the opposition, to demonstrate the extent of the hypocrisy that the government displays with this bill. If the bill does become law, Australian gamblers will be able to gamble away all they have and more on many offshore sites that they will still be able to access. Problem gamblers are almost 1½ times more likely to prefer gambling on racing to casino gambling. It is difficult to identify any sensible rationale for the government's exclusion of wagering from this bill. The government also has chosen to exclude sports betting from the bill, contradicting its decision to restrict new forms of gambling.
The series of amendments exclude wagering and the other forms from the scope of the interactive gambling ban, with the exception of ball by ball or microevent wagering, which will continue to be prohibited. It is clear that the amendments proposed by the government and the crossbench and minor parties cater to the demands of the racing industry and associated industries. The government has stated that it remains `concerned about the impact of Internet wagering but recognises that this concern needs to be balanced against the impact of a ban on a bona fide and long-established industry in Australia'.
I stated in my speech in the second reading debate and again tonight that the bill still permits Australians access to Internet wagering, and wagering is hardly immune from causing gambling problems. This amendment to exclude interactive wagering and the other exemptions, when wagering is as much a problem in terms of problem gambling as any other form of gambling, demonstrates, as I said earlier, the extent of the hypocrisy that runs rampant through this bill.
The amendments place beyond a doubt everyone's suspicions that the government's primary concern in the passage of this legislation is not the protection of problem gamblers. The government's decision to cave in to the relatively brief but intensive lobbying by the wagering industry is just further proof to the opposition of the government's ad hoc policy approach in this whole area. It demonstrates to us that its selective approach is the reason why it cannot come up with a sensible and effective policy for interactive gambling that minimises interactive gambling to the greatest extent possible.
During a recent interview, the minister said:
There's a huge difference between picking up your phone, putting on a few bets at the TAB, and sitting there with a remote control and clicking your head off until you've lost all of what you had, and more ...
I make the obvious point that if gamblers play on Australian Internet gambling sites they could not gamble all of what they had and more because there are expenditure thresholds imposed by the legitimate operators in this country. If this bill does become law, Australian gamblers will be able to gamble all they have and more on many offshore sites that they will still be able to access.
My second point in this context is that the Productivity Commission found that problem gamblers are almost 1½ times more likely to prefer gambling on racing to casino gambling. The minister undoubtedly knows this—I tried to bring it to his attention before. We make the obvious point that wagering is not any safer than any other form of gambling. Wagering is not immune to the social effect of problem gambling. It is impossible for us to identify any consistent or sensible policy rationale behind this.
Furthermore, the government has stated repeatedly that it is concerned to prevent any increase in the accessibility of gambling and that is one of the drivers behind this whole approach. We ask this question in passing: if that is one of the drivers that motivates us in this debate, why has the government chosen to exclude wagering and sporting events from the bill?
Sports betting is still a relatively new form of gambling and is highly suited to Internet and home based gambling. The Productivity Commission report observed that it is likely that sports betting: 
... will grow rapidly via the internet, largely creating a new market, though there may be some shift away from wagers on racing.
Essentially, then, the government's own amendments and the amendments of the minor parties, catering to the requests of the horse racing and other existing industries, are encouraging the expansion of an entirely new gambling form in this country. Hypocritical? We say yes.
Finally, the government fails to mention that this bill will permit one form of gambling on the Internet to continue unabated and essentially unregulated, or at least not regulated to the same extent as the existing Internet gambling industries that the bill will prohibit Australians from accessing.
Bringing that together, we ask the obvious question that a range of people have been discussing in this debate and in the press over recent times: how is wagering different? How and why are problem gamblers who choose to bet in the various forms of the racing industry around the country tolerated? Why is that encouraged? Why does this government allow these new products and these new forms of betting to take place in the marketplace when Minister Alston, the Prime Minister and the government have said that the ostensible reason for their intention to ban Internet gambling in various forms is that they want to prevent the further spread of gambling in this country?
To prevent the further spread of gambling is their whole rationale. But this bill, and the amendments we are currently discussing, send out the clear message that they exclude new forms of gambling—Internet wagering and Internet sports betting—which are developing and which technology will allow to spread. So the conclusion we draw is that this bill and the comments of the government are about accommodating new forms of betting. They are about accommodating racing industry and sports betting interests in new mediums of communication.
—But you are against it, are you?
—You say this bill is about preventing further forms of gambling and further access to gambling and about attending to existing social problems, yet in this debate and these amendments you expressly provide and allow—and, by implication, encourage—new forms of gambling in new forms of communication. We just make the obvious point, which I think is probably understood and accepted in this chamber, that that is just contrary to your stated purpose.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,49,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2001-06-28,"—Minister, why has an exemption been given to wagering on Internet overseas sites and yet we have just made it illegal to have Internet gambling on overseas lotteries? I am concerned that there is this difference. If there is a feeling around the chamber, as apparently there is, why don't we revisit that again and see whether we cannot get agreement about that? I think Senator Harris pointed out that it is illogical, and now we have heard Senator Bishop virtually say that it is illogical, to have a ban on the lotteries and not a ban on the wagering.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-06-28,"—I move Australian Greens amendment (1) on sheet DL200:
 (1)	Page 50 (after line 7), after clause 69, insert:
69A  Regulations about unenforceability of agreements relating to illegal interactive gambling services
Agreements
	(1)	The regulations may provide:
	(a)	that an agreement has no effect to the extent to which it provides for the payment of money for the supply of an illegal interactive gambling service; and
	(b)	that civil proceedings do not lie against a person to recover money alleged to have been won from, or paid in connection with, an illegal interactive gambling service.
Deadline for making regulations
	(2)	The Minister must take all reasonable steps to ensure that regulations are made for the purposes of this section within 6 months after the commencement of Part 2.
Illegal interactive gambling service
	(3)	For the purposes of this section, an interactive gambling service is an illegal interactive gambling service if, and only if, the provision of the service contravenes a provision of this Act that creates an offence.
Definition
	(4)	In this section:
agreement means an agreement, whether made orally or in writing.
This is the backstop amendment to provide that, after the minister has taken all reasonable steps to ensure that it is okay, regulations are made to have agreements relating to illegal interactive gambling services overseas made unenforceable. In brief, if somebody bets on their card overseas, the overseas gambling house cannot enforce the payment of the debt that has accrued through that bet. This is the best way of ensuring that overseas gambling houses do not take Australian bets. Instead of saying, `We can't prohibit you from setting up in Vanuatu,' we say, `If Australians bet on your service in Vanuatu, you can't enforce the agreement. It is illegal to enforce the agreement whereby the debtor—the person who has placed the bet—has to pay you through the credit card.' 
Senator Harradine, Senator Harris and I have all tried to have this measure instituted tonight as part of the legislation, but the government and the opposition opposed it. However, it is breakthrough legislation. The government wanted nine months to consider it. We have come to an agreement that it will be within six months. The government then has the opportunity to ensure that there are no hidden pitfalls or glitches. It is a very central amendment to this legislation. It provides for the all important restriction that we, at this end of the house, want to see, that is, overseas gambling houses cannot provide for, or attract, Australians to bet because they will not want to because there will be quite widespread default on debts.
Gambling is a business of gaining a debt for the client and a profit for the provider. That is what it is about. A person who provides gambling facilities cannot survive if the punter can default. This is a method of allowing the punter to default. The outcome would be a prohibition on Australians when they try to sign up to gambling houses overseas. It is not the best outcome, but it is the careful outcome. However, the government has come a long way towards accepting that unenforceability of agreements is a necessary requirement if we are going to stop people gambling overseas. The Prime Minister and ministers have all said that they wanted to achieve that aim. It is a pivotal amendment. It is going to take good faith and it has taken my good faith, I can tell you! It is going to take good faith from the government. The amendment speaks for itself, but it is very important and I commend it to the committee.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,49,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2001-06-28,"—I support Senator Brown's amendment. As Senator Brown has said, we have tried this evening to ensure clarity in the bill. I believe that Senator Harradine's amendments that required penalties for services provided by offshore entities, because of the ability of the banking industry with today's technology, can achieve what Senator Harradine set out. When a single mainframe computer in one of three locations in the world can do the entire banking transactions for the world in a day, how difficult would it be to find out where a transaction came from? What Senator Brown is proposing would have to be the de facto of all de facto amendments, but I implore the committee to support it. I possibly have reservations about supporting it, because in actuality it will enact the ability for somebody to enter into a legal contract to receive a service or the supply of a product—and the product in this case is Internet gambling—and then allow that person to rescind that legal contract. That has implications that we may regret in future. Unfortunately, in light of the way the bill has been developing, this is our last chance. I commend the amendment to the committee.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,49,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2001-06-28,"—I suspect that the Russian Mafia and West Indian gangsters may not necessarily rely on the legal system to enforce the payment of debts. As Australians are driven by this legislation from safe, regulated Australian casinos onto unregulated, unsafe casinos, the possibility of international criminals bashing and killing defaulting Australians could become a reality. To be serious, this proposal from Senator Brown could work as a policy only after we have taken the time to consult with other governments. If one country anywhere allows the processing of casino credits, all that the Australian government would be doing by accepting this amendment would be creating a market for money laundering.
No matter how much we dislike gambling, it is an international industry that is accessible from any computer, with unlimited options for sneaking financial transactions around regulators. Australia does not have the policy option that Australians can be prevented from online gambling—we have only the option as to whether the casinos most visited online by Australians are run by Australians, foreigners or crooks. Frankly, if the government is short-sighted enough to ban Australian online gambling businesses, I would much rather see Australians gambling at Ladbrokes.co.uk than at dodgy Russian sites.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,49,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2001-06-28,"—We have got to the stage where, with the exemptions that are now in the legislation for certain types of Internet gambling from overseas, the utility of this is questionable. Nevertheless, the minister claims authorship, or the minister's office claimed authorship. The minister's officers did not claim authorship in this chamber, and I do not know whether they did outside the chamber, but Senator Alston said something that encouraged me to ask what it means. The amendment talks about agreements and it states:
The regulations may provide:
(a)	that an agreement has no effect to the extent to which it provides for the payment of money for the supply of an illegal interactive gambling service; and
(b)	that civil proceedings do not lie against a person to recover money alleged to have been won from, or paid in connection with, an illegal interactive gambling service.
I thought that, prior to the dinner suspension, the minister said that such proceedings do not lie against a person who has engaged in illegal activity. Therefore, I wonder what the purpose of the amendment is. Is it or is it not a fact that an agreement between two parties to engage in illegal activity has no effect to the extent to which it provides for the payment of money for the supply of an illegal service, for example, and that civil proceedings do not lie against persons who have engaged in illegal activities, whether or not they be illegal interactive gambling?
So I really raise that point again. Is it or is it not a fact that (3) says:
 For the purposes of this section, an interactive gambling service is an illegal interactive gambling service if, and only if, the provision of the service contravenes a provision of this Act that creates an offence.
Could the minister point precisely now to the parts of the proposed act to which this amendment is referring? There are two things: firstly, whether or not at the moment civil proceedings do not lie against a person or persons who are engaged in an illegal activity if there is an agreement to engage in that illegal activity; and, secondly, could the minister point now to the areas in the legislation referred to in paragraph (3)?",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,49,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2001-06-28,"—In relation to the first point, I think the situation is generally that the common law does not allow you to recover moneys paid pursuant to an illegal activity, that being void as against public policy. However, the Commonwealth position is always capable of being modified by statute or indeed overturned and in this instance, of course, you have every state and territory with a capacity to make their own rules of the game. So I think the purpose of this is really to put beyond doubt the fact that it is competent to protect an individual from having to pay money which he has paid pursuant to a gambling transaction that is illegal. It does in a sense clarify what Senator Harradine was raising earlier, where I took him to be saying that he did not think you could have a different regime for the customer on the one hand and the service provider on the other. I think that clearly this makes it clear that is the intention here.
Although my memory of all of this from contract law days is pretty hazy, certainly I think we are trying to give effect to that original principle that you should protect the party with the weaker bargaining power from having to make the payment where the transaction itself is illegal. I do not suppose you have a situation where money is likely to go the other way, but if it did you could still preclude the service provider from recovery so that you could in fact have in these terms a win-win outcome for the customer and a lose-lose outcome for the service provider.
Insofar as (3) is concerned, clauses 15 and 15A, I am advised, contain the substantive offence provisions. This seems to be simply bringing together a regulation making power which makes it clearer, at the same time as indicating the general areas of power, that if it is an illegal activity then as a result of the commission of an offence it is an illegal activity for these purposes. Some might say that is surperfluous but I suppose draftsmen want to be absolutely sure that the position is clear.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,49,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-06-28,"—If I can just help Senator Harradine too, under proposed section 6 a service is prohibited if it is provided to customers using an Internet carriage service or if the service is provided in the course of carrying on a business and has an Australian customer link.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,49,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2001-06-28,"—I suspect it is there because otherwise it might be possible to argue that an interactive gambling service is illegal for other reasons and therefore you should not be able to recover a debt from a customer. It is really saying these regulations will only apply in respect of offences created by this legislation or illegality.

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2001-06-28,"—I seek the indulgence of both the chair and the senators in the chamber. I believe there should have been a very hastily scribbled amendment that has been circulated in my name that refers to page 9, line 14, and the end of clause 8. Could the chair indicate whether they have a copy of that?
 (Senator Chapman)—We do not have a copy at the moment, Senator Harris. It has not reached this desk.
—The amendment is just being photocopied at the moment. I did ask a few minutes ago for that to be done. I apologise for this.
—If you speak to the amendment, I am sure it will arrive in due course.
—The purpose of this amendment is very similar to that of an amendment Senator Brown moved earlier which the government found they could support. The essence of the amendment is that the government could, if they wished, structure the regulations in such a way to exclude an external lottery or wagering service. It does not in any way exclude it, but this amendment gives the government, when we have gone away from this bill, six months to reassess the situation. 
The amendment inserts a clause 8E on page 9, line 14, at the end of clause 8. It clearly gives the government the ability in the regulations to exclude wagering services in such circumstances and subject to such conditions as are prescribed. It would then include a clause 8F to follow 8E, which would mirror exactly 8E but speak to copies for lotteries. That is the intention of the amendment. It is not to bind the government into having to do anything, but it would allow the government, if they so wished, to make regulations that would provide for the variation of 8A(2) in such circumstances and subject to such conditions as are prescribed in the regulation. It is not binding the government; it is merely providing a facility to the government that is identical to an amendment moved by Senator Brown that the government has accepted. I commend my amendment to the chamber and so move:
Page 9 (after line 14), after clause 8, insert:
8E  Regulations about excluded wagering services
		The regulations may provide for the variation of the operation of subsection 8A(2) in such circumstances, and subject to such conditions, as are prescribed.

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2001-06-28,"—For the record, I must say that it is always dangerous to consider things on the run. This is one minute past midnight, I would have thought, rather than five minutes to. In any event, we have essentially taken a decision not so long ago to say that, if activities are legal, you ought to be able to engage in them onshore and offshore. We rejected a proposal from Senator Harris to require offshore providers to obtain an Australian licence before they could provide services to Australian customers. This is really a slightly watered-down version of the same. To the extent it gives the government power to do it, sure, we will not have to do it now, but someone else might later. It really just attempts to do by the back door what you were not able to do by the front door. I simply cannot see the logic of it. You can say, `It's only giving powers to do things,' but that is the very point: why would you give power to exclude external wagering services unless they are licensed when we have already determined that that is not a sensible policy approach?

 (Senator Chapman)—The attendants will distribute that, Senator Brown, but I can advise you are next.
—The Democrats welcome the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Amendment Bill 2001. It is long overdue and it does not go far enough, but we think it is a small step in the right direction. I notice that the second reading speech of the minister talks about this being brought more into line with community standards. That is what so many people have been calling for for such a long time. Back in 1997, the Democrats initiated an inquiry into just this question. At that time, there was already—and, no doubt, there was for some decades until that point—dissatisfaction with the fact that a separate set of rules applied for parliamentarians, and a very generous set of rules at that, in terms of their superannuation retirement benefits.
For this reason, we do welcome it. I note, however, that the bill proposes to put these changes into effect before the next election. No doubt this has been done so the government not only can respond to the many thousands of complaints that I have received and that the superannuation committee has received but, more importantly, can have said by the time the election comes along, `We've done something about this.' We can give moderate support to this move. You could not call it reform, by any measure, but it does take away one of the most serious problems with the bill, and that is that parliamentarians are entitled to pensions provided they are in this place for eight years or three elections, as the case may be. It could mean that for a very long period there is an entitlement to a very substantial pension—much higher than most people can expect in their retirement.
It is important that we have at least reached this milestone. I hope that the Senate will consider the amendments the Democrats will put up. Essentially, they will go to a number of important areas. They will allow parliamentarians to opt out of the pension scheme that we currently have and into an accumulations scheme. We have picked up on Mr Andren's private member's bill, which allows parliamentarians to do just that—to opt out into something which is truly a community standards level of retirement benefits. We will also reduce the entitlements. This is what sticks in the craw of so many people in the community: the fact that, while their employer is contributing eight per cent of SG contributions to their superannuation, the notional contribution in this place is more like 69 per cent. So there is a massive difference in the amount of taxpayers' money which is going into entitlements. That is something that we cannot ignore in this debate.
We cannot in this legislation or in any other legislation force, or through amendment re-create, the parliamentary superannuation scheme into an accumulation scheme, and so the Democrats have opted to bring the parliamentary scheme into line with public service standards. So there will be a considerable reduction in contributions, at least in line with a group in society, the Public Service, where there is some rationale and fairness. Our amendments will deal with that question. They will also apply to the current membership. It is unconscionable that we would in this place make laws for members of parliament who are yet to arrive here and not make laws reducing entitlements for ourselves. It seems to lack any moral strength. It is certainly not fair to the next group of parliamentarians that comes along, when people in this place will continue, as long as they are here, to have a very generous entitlement indeed.
You could argue that we cannot do this—and no doubt we will hear this argument from the government when I come to put my amendments—and that this is acquiring property which is not on just terms. I would argue that it is a cancellation of a benefit. Of course there is only one way to put that to the test, and that is through the courts. We support the preservation to age 55, and I have drawn up amendments for the Democrats on a bill which was to have been dealt with last week—a minor bill regarding the surcharge—which would have done exactly that. Importantly, our final set of amendments will deal with an ongoing problem which the government refuses to face, and that is one of same sex entitlements. Anyone who does not have a spouse or a de facto spouse relationship in this place cannot pass on their entitlements by way of pension to their partner, and that is an ongoing problem which has not been dealt with by the government. We will continue to push amendments wherever there is an opportunity to do so.
I thought I would quickly mention a couple of the recommendations made in the Democrats dissenting report Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Scheme and the Judges' Pension Scheme of September 1997. The first of those recommendations was:
That the level of public subsidy to the PCSS is excessive and needs to be substantially reduced. 
We will do that in our amendments. The second recommendation was:
That the Remuneration Tribunal should be asked to determine an appropriate, reduced level of superannuation benefits for parliamentarians, taking into account standards prevailing in the community at large and the unusual nature of parliamentary life.
Recommendation 6 is one that we have not acted on because it is difficult from this position—I think one needs to be in government. It really was saying that we need to: 
a. Restructure the scheme as a fully vested accumulation scheme with the level of public subsidy being substantially reduced, and with the Government contribution becoming an appropriate multiple of the parliamentarians' 11.5 per cent contribution.
It also said:
b. That the redundancy function be separated from the retirement function.
There are some steps, I note, being put in place in this bill to look at that question of redundancy. The Democrats have always said that there may well be an argument in cases of hardship for that to take place. I do not think it should be across the board and I do not think it should be generous. Nonetheless, members who have lost their seats or who are otherwise not in this place should not be starving, but we do expect that there should be a reasonable measure of scrutiny over those benefits.
Recommendation 6(d) was:
d. That membership of the scheme remain compulsory, but where a member can satisfy the trustees that they have adequate retirement savings already, they may opt out of the scheme, thereby forfeiting the benefit of the Government contribution.
When you get to the end of this scheme, if you have served in this place for a lengthy period of time, again the inequities start to apply, just as they do up to the eight-year point. The contributions over that cut-off time suddenly become very generous, whereas up until that point they are not. So there are inequities in this scheme right throughout, and that is why it needs more than simply a bandaid measure which says we will simply preserve until age 55. Other recommendations are:
e. That the rules for survivor and invalidity benefits be reviewed; 
f. That parliamentarians be able to make additional contributions if they so opt and be paid interest on those contributions; 
g. That benefits under the scheme be paid as a pension, actuarially determined based on the value of the accumulated benefit when the parliamentarian retires or turns 55 (which ever is later), with the parliamentarian able to commute up to 50 per cent of their pension to a lump sum as at present. 
The Democrats will support this bill. We do not think it goes far enough, and we do hope that the Senate will look carefully at the amendments that we put up and be of a mind to support them.",SENATE,<title>PARLIAMENTARY CONTRIBUTORY SUPERANNUATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,52,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-06-28,"—It is not the bill in itself that is at fault here—although it is way short of the mark and should have incorporated into it the provisions along the lines that Senator Allison just outlined—but it is the process which is so abhorrent. As I said earlier, it is a prime ministerial ambush of the Senate. This bill was not even on the list this morning. It was not even on the list of eight that the government flagged for debate tonight. Through that procedure we saw a little earlier with the precipitant application of the rules to get around the cut-off provisions—which would have, through normal processes, seen this bill debated when we return in August—we are now debating it here tonight, and it will be done, through and out.
I think there is some expectation in this place that I am going to filibuster on this bill tonight, but I can tell all those who are looking at the clocks that I am not in the business of self-flagellation for somebody else's wrong. In this case, it is the wrong of the government, supported by the opposition, that we are witnessing. I will put the case, and I know that we are not going to have the numbers—so be it.
Let us not mince words about this: the process tonight is to get around public anger about the parliamentary superannuation scheme. Do it in the dead of night; make the improvement so that you can go to the electorate in an election year saying, `We've put in this age 55 provision,' to shake off at least some of the public angst there is about it; but leave substantially unchanged the core problem with the superannuation provisions for parliamentarians, which is they are too generous. They are not at arms length. They are something that we and our predecessors have voted for and the big parties are hanging on to like grim death because the current members look forward to the day when they retire with a golden handshake way out of kilter with what people in the Australian work force could expect.
Nice as that feeling might be—that there is a huge bag of money awaiting on retirement for members of parliament compared to what they would be getting if they were in a similarly renumerated job in the general community or that there may even be a multimillion dollar payout through pensions, if they are young enough, for the rest of their lives, as we have seen with former Senator O'Chee's payout—the fact is that it is not right that that is there. We as parliamentarians cannot think of ourselves as different from the rest of the community. Everybody is in the business of taking the main chance, but those of us elected to parliament can be expected to set community standards when it comes to pay and remuneration. Sadly—and we are not the only parliament in this—politicians as a group do not live up to that.
In my experience, whenever it comes to superannuation, to pay and conditions or to provisions protecting the advantage big parties have through the Electoral Act to get themselves re-elected, the two big parties—the coalition and the opposition—come together very rapidly. Senator Sherry might be interested to know that, back in 1986, I think it was, in the Tasmanian parliament, both my colleague Gerry Bates and I—the two Greens then—were diverted by other matters for half an hour and in that time a big salary rise was put through the parliament by the Labor and Liberal parties. The time taken from the suspension of standing orders to the completion of the third reading was six minutes. I have often thought of writing to the GuinnessBookofRecords about that. Like the tallest trees in the Southern Hemisphere, we might just have a good case for a Tasmanian record there.
But let us not underestimate the seriousness of the matter. Politics is not in great odour in the wider community. People are cynical and critical of politics, and I guess never more than now—although it has always been there. One of the worst things we can do, as far as allowing that cynicism to fester goes, is to keep on with a superannuation scheme as manifestly selfish, greedy and unfair to the taxpayers as the one that is enjoyed by the current members of this parliament. What we should be doing here tonight is reformulating that so that we get the same sort of superannuation benefits under the same conditions that workers would in the Australian work force in similarly renumerated jobs, and that is not going to happen.
I laud the Australian Democrats amendments. The Greens have got amendments here too. I support them all, I declare a vested interest in every one of them and I will be voting for them. But we are not going to get them through. The reality is that the big parties yet again, late at night, on the last night of sitting before the winter break, are going to push this through and there is not much we can do about it. However, we must try because there are some of us here who very genuinely feel aggrieved at being caught up in this situation and want to change it.
I do adopt the provision—and I will be moving it; let me call it the Andren amendment—put forward by the honourable member for Calare in the House of Representatives for an opt-out clause. That clause would allow at least those parliamentarians who want to opt out of this superannuation provision and go for an ordinary superannuation provision through another scheme out in the marketplace to do that. If that is good enough for Peter Andren in the House of Representatives, it is good enough for me. I will do the same. But I do not think we are going to even be able to do that. I do not think that that freedom of choice is going to be allowed us. I think that will be denied by this need of the big parties to stick together in a situation like this where self-interest becomes the glue that shows up a solidarity in the parliament rarely seen on any other topic, except perhaps in a national emergency.
I will leave the amendments to the committee stage, but I want to move an amendment to the second reading motion. I move:
Omit all words after “That”, substitute:
		“the bill be referred to the Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services for inquiry and report by 9 August 2001”.
It is a very brief time but, as members will know, we have referred the bill proposed by Mr Andren to the same committee. There have been thousands of submissions to that committee. It would be appropriate to put this piece of legislation to the same committee—after all, it has only got a provision in it that Mr Andren has catered for. We would then give the community an opportunity to, in a constructive way, express both its feelings and its ideas about how the parliamentary superannuation scheme should be altered. This is an effort to say, `Let's let the people have a say here.' I will be interested to see how the big parties respond to that option.",SENATE,<title>PARLIAMENTARY CONTRIBUTORY SUPERANNUATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,52,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2001-06-28,"—I support Senator Brown's comments and record my support for an ability to opt out of a superannuation scheme that is the same as that for other Australians. I would also like at this point in time, with great respect, to reflect upon the position of Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen. Not only did he not participate in the superannuation scheme in Queensland for parliamentarians but, when he left his public office, he left it with no superannuation whatsoever. I take my hat off to Sir Joh with great admiration, and record that Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party supports the ability to opt out.",SENATE,<title>PARLIAMENTARY CONTRIBUTORY SUPERANNUATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,52,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-06-28,"—Let me commence my remarks by indicating the way in which the Labor Party strongly believe that parliamentary superannuation—and, indeed, all MPs' entitlements—should be dealt with. We believe that entitlement matters, including superannuation, should be dealt with by an independent body. That is our preference. We regard the Remuneration Tribunal as the appropriate organisation to deal with these issues. Politicians should not determine the entitlements of politicians. I make this point because the Labor Party has a view that it is inevitable that, no matter what we say about entitlements in this context, the public not unreasonably will believe that we may be acting to some degree out of self-interest. That is why we strongly believe the matters should go to a body like the Remuneration Tribunal.
Let me comment now on Senator Brown's second reading amendment, which is to refer the bill to the Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services for inquiry and report by 9 August 2001. The date that Senator Brown has selected coincides with the date for the report back on the referral from Senator Brown of the so-called Andren bill dealing with so-called choice. I want to draw a distinction between choice and levels of superannuation contribution in a short while. On my understanding, that particular piece of legislation was referred by Senator Brown to the select committee. I am deputy chair of the select committee and my fellow Tasmanian senator, Senator Watson, is chair. Obviously, we sit on opposite sides of the chamber. However, I would acknowledge his level of expertise in these areas and the significant contribution he has made on these matters. That piece of legislation has been referred to the Senate committee. Hearings will take place in approximately a week and a half in Sydney, following some advertisements that were placed. There will be a full day of hearings on that particular piece of legislation.
We will not be supporting Senator Brown's second reading amendment because to refer this legislation conflicts with the earlier principle—and Labor's primary principle—that I outlined, which is that politicians should not determine the entitlements of politicians. If this bill is referred to a Senate committee—and in this case, the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services—you will be expecting a group of politicians to make recommendations in respect of politicians. We do not believe that is appropriate.
I comment about the use of the term `choice'. The issue of membership choice—the right to choose to be a member of a particular fund—is a very different issue from the level of contributions that Australians may receive from their employer or choose to contribute themselves. In this country the situation is that membership choice of a particular fund is a very different principle from the level of effective contribution, whether it be to an accumulation fund or to a defined benefit fund such that we enjoy. I might say that politicians are not the only people in the community who are members of a defined benefit fund.
The legislation that we are considering has a number of changes to the existing scheme. My understanding of the bill—and I first read it yesterday afternoon—is that it will impact on new senators and members who joined the parliament following the last election, including MPs and senators who returned to the parliament after previous service was completed before these arrangements take effect and who leave parliament voluntarily or involuntarily, become entitled to a parliamentary pension before age 55 and would have payment of that pension deferred, including the option to commute part of that pension to a lump sum until age 55. There are some exceptions set out in the legislation in respect of invalidity and early access in case of financial hardship. I note that the financial hardship provisions are required to mirror the current publicly available provision that is generally provided for in the community. There is also a reversionary death benefit whereby eligible spouses and children would receive a reversionary pension on the death of a former member whose pension is deferred before age 55. 
On my reading earlier today of the regulations for early access to superannuation, there is not a full list of criteria. However, I understand that payments of superannuation prior to age 55 are available on application in respect of what is defined as financial hardship. A person is required to be on certain defined social security payments for a period of 26 weeks and a figure of up to $10,000 a year is available in those circumstances. There is also an early access provision that provides for payment of superannuation where the foreclosure of a person's mortgage in respect of their own home is threatened. There are provisions in respect to the death of a relative and the payment of a funeral benefit. There are also some other provisions which, depending on the circumstances, may not be considered as major, but which apply, for example, to health costs. Health costs not covered by Medicare are also covered by the hardship provisions. Several limitations and criteria apply to that, but that is a brief summary of those early access provisions.
I want to say a little about the process. As my colleague Senator Ray correctly outlined earlier to the chamber, the bill required the waiving of the cut-off. We have often agreed to the waiving of the cut-off. The cut-off was imposed on us when we were in government by the present government and the Australian Democrats. It is not unusual for the cut-off to be waived. I make the point that this matter is on the agenda tonight for the Senate at the government's request. The government has listed its program and has chosen the time for this debate to take place. Similarly, with regard to this legislation, the government went through its own very quick internal processes which led to the legislation being presented in the House of Representatives and passing that house late yesterday afternoon or early evening. It was a government backbench committee—I am not aware of the individuals who comprised that committee—which considered the matter and the government then put this particular legislation together.
Because of the very tight time frame—as I have said, the legislation was dealt with in the House of Representatives late yesterday afternoon or early evening—there has not been an opportunity for the legislation to be presented through the normal Labor Party caucus processes. Nevertheless, my colleague Mr Kelvin Thomson, who is the Labor Party's opposition spokesperson on superannuation matters, indicated in the House of Representatives that we would not be opposing the legislation that the government had presented. It is a change and, ultimately, a reduction in cost in respect of the current parliamentary superannuation fund.
With regard to that issue—and I ask the minister to deal with this point in his speech—the explanatory memorandum states several figures for the cost savings. It is indicated that there is a small positive effect on the fiscal balance estimated to be $0.22 million in 2001-02; $0.24 million in 2002-03; $0.25 million in 2003-04; and $0.50 million in 2004-05. As those figures indicate, there is a positive effect on the budget starting in 2001-02. I ask the minister to explain that because a member's or senator's entitlement, this being a defined benefit fund, does not become a legal entitlement until they have met the minimum required standard within the superannuation fund of three parliaments or eight years. Given that this legislation will apply to new senators and members who are elected at the next election, and given the other criteria I outlined earlier, I cannot see how there can be a saving in the first eight years or three elections. I cannot see how a saving can result until that period of time has elapsed. I would appreciate an indication of how those figures are derived. It may be because of the accrual budget process rather than the cash budget process, but it would be useful to know the reason for that.
The Australian Democrats and Senator Brown for the Australian Greens have circulated a number of amendments. Again, I make the point that these amendments were circulated just prior to the commencement of this debate. There are three pages of amendments from Senator Brown, plus his second reading amendment, and from the Australian Democrats we have six pages of amendments. We are doing our best to scrutinise them in the time available. We will obviously indicate our position as we go through those amendments. However, on my cursory glance, there are some quite technical, complex amendments. We will nevertheless make a call as we go through them one by one. I remind the Australian Democrats and the Greens that they criticised the government for bringing on this matter in the way that it has—to some extent, that concerns me as well—but it cuts all ways. The Australian Democrats and the Greens have presented us with detailed amendments in a very limited time.
—No, it goes to a matter of courtesy, Senator Brown. We have the skilled expertise to examine the amendments. If you were going to move the amendments, they should have been circulated a little earlier.
—Codswallop!
—They should have been circulated a little earlier, Senator Brown. It also puzzles me, given the extensively drafted amendments, whether it was such a surprise that the bill was coming on so quickly. Anyway, those are the issues that I want to deal with at this stage of the debate. I referred earlier to the government process. I wonder at the speed of that process, given the election environment that we are in, but perhaps the minister can outline the rationale.
I conclude my remarks by indicating, as I indicated at the commencement of my contribution, that the Labor Party is strongly of the view that parliamentary superannuation, including MPs' entitlements, should be dealt with by an independent body, and we regard the Remuneration Tribunal as the appropriate body to deal with these issues. We believe that politicians dealing with politicians' entitlements is not an appropriate way to deal with the matters. The Remuneration Tribunal would have been a far better process.",SENATE,<title>PARLIAMENTARY CONTRIBUTORY SUPERANNUATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,52,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2001-06-28,"—The government has put forward by way of the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Amendment Bill 2001 a proposal that will bring the parliamentary superannuation scheme more into line with community standards by deferring the payment of parliamentary pensions for new MPs who join the parliament after the next general election until they reach age 55. The Prime Minister promised changes to the parliamentary superannuation scheme to bring it more into line with community standards, and this bill delivers on that promise. In doing that, the bill imposes a higher standard of preservation on MPs than applies to other Australians who receive pensions. However, it will closely align superannuation for MPs with a majority of Australians who receive lump sum benefits that must be preserved until at least age 55 in most circumstances.
A number of senators have contributed to this debate, and I thank them for that. I thank Senator Allison for her contribution. Senator Brown made a few contributions, some matters of which I believe I have some understanding of—for example, the pay rise that was referred to that went through the state parliament. I note that consolidated revenue never got moneys paid into it from those Green MPs who objected to the pay rise. Whilst they complained about the morality of it, they were more than willing to take the consequences of it. In fact, it reminds me of one Labor candidate in Tasmania who campaigned against that pay increase. Of course, as soon as he won the seat, he very kindly took the increased salary and nothing was ever done about it.
Senator Brown has also told us about superannuation entitlements. You, Mr Acting Deputy President Murphy, and other senators from Tasmania may well recall that it was well known that one of Senator Brown's mates, Mr Gerry Bates, wanted to leave the parliament. If he had resigned voluntarily, he would not have been entitled to certain superannuation benefits. What he did was resign to contest the Legislative Council seat of Queenborough without any intention of winning it, and, as a result, lost his seat and therefore became entitled, and shortly thereafter moved out of the state of Tasmania.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. We should keep the debate at a good level. I wonder whether the senator would like to repeat that outside.
 (Senator Murphy)—There is no point of order.
—If I can move on to Senator Harris's contribution, he praised Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen for not accessing the Queensland superannuation scheme. I do not know the terms of that superannuation scheme, but I do know that Lady Flo Bjelke-Petersen, who served in this place, accessed the federal superannuation scheme. Senator Harris might have one Bjelke-Petersen on his side, but there may well be a Bjelke-Petersen on the other side of the debate. I am not sure that that example necessarily takes us much further.
In relation to Senator Sherry's contribution, I understand where he and the Labor Party are coming from in relation to politicians' entitlements. In fairness, this is a diminution of parliamentarians' entitlements, so I would not necessarily put it into the same category as voting for benefits or to increase benefits to parliamentarians. I make that distinction for Senator Sherry. He also asked me how the expected savings could be justified. I must say that I spooked myself when I found out that I understood the reasoning—that is, that we have now changed the budgeting system from cash to accruals, and it is on the basis of accruals that the anticipated savings are made.
Another issue has been raised which I want to put on the record during the conclusion of the second reading debate, that is, why we are in effect grandfathering entitlements that currently exist. I do not know why it has not been mentioned, and there is somebody sitting pretty close to me here in this chamber whom I thank for this information. The High Court, in November 2000, brought down a decision in Smith and ANL Ltd. A very strong High Court—five to two—determined that section 54 of the rehabilitation act was, for the purposes of section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution, a property right and, therefore, if you changed the legislation but the person had some benefit beforehand, that benefit could not be taken away from them without just compensation. So it is not possible to try to change people's entitlements now if they are already in a particular scheme. That is a constitutional argument that has not been considered and, whilst I accept I am only a humble Hobart lawyer, I think that argument has some merit.
I will also respond to the suggestion by Senator Sherry that we are in an election environment. I am not sure that we are, but there is no doubt that constitutionally there needs to be an election within the next six or seven months. As a result, a lot of good men and women in Australia are considering running for the parliament—be they Democrats, Greens, Independents, Labor or Liberal—and I believe it is appropriate for them to have some idea of some of the benefits that may or may not accrue to them. I have expressed from time to time a view—and I am not sure that it is necessarily the government view—that the superannuation benefits parliamentarians get are generous. When I came into this place I in fact took a substantial pay cut; I still consider it a great honour to be able to serve in this place and I did not take it begrudgingly. But I think those that have families and have certain financial commitments have an entitlement to know what sort of financial benefits may come their way should they decide to run for the parliament, and that applies across the board. I thank honourable senators for their contributions to this debate.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2001-06-28,"—If ever there was an acknowledgment by the government that its original package or scheme for the dairy industry was a failure, then this amendment that has been carried by the government in the House of Representatives is that acknowledgment. If ever there was an admission by this government that its supplementary assistance package that we are now debating was flawed and needed improvement, then it was made and demonstrated by the amendment that was moved by the government in the House of Representatives and carried yesterday.
What the government has done here is another mean and tricky exercise, and that is appropriate for this government. As I have said all along, the thing that underpins this scheme is an 11c a litre tax on retail sales of milk. When it comes to tax matters—as indeed all other matters, but particularly tax matters—this government is mean and tricky. They are not my words; they are the words of Shane Stone, federal president of the Liberal Party.
Senators will recall that a couple of days ago this Senate carried an amendment, moved by the opposition and supported by the Democrats and other minor party senators, to improve the supplementary assistance scheme for dairy farmers to ensure that more dairy farmers in serious financial difficulties would be able to access the package. We lowered the threshold of 35 per cent of income earned from market milk—that is the qualifying factor for access to this scheme—to 25 per cent. Further, we put into this scheme a floor of $15,000 as a guaranteed minimum, so that any farmer who earned 25 per cent of their income or more from market milk would be able to access this scheme and would be guaranteed at least $15,000. Just as there is a cap of $60,000 on this supplementary assistance package, we put in a floor of $15,000.
When it got to the House of Representatives after that amendment had been opposed by the government in this chamber, what happened? The government put up what it calls its compromise position. Its so-called compromise position was to say that $15,000 was what the opposition moved and the Senate agreed with as a minimum, so this government reduced it to $10,000. There was no real reason given as to why there should be a reduction from $15,000 to $10,000. In fact, the minister's speech identified the cost that the department had worked out for the additional assistance as some $19 million. It is clear that what the government has done here is not saving all that much on the total cost of what was involved in our amendment.
The minister, in my view, misled the House of Representatives. He repeated the assertion that was made by Senator Macdonald in this chamber that the opposition's amendment was going to cost $60 million. We clarified that in this chamber during the debate. That was an honest misunderstanding in respect of the government's interpretation of the intention of our amendment. We addressed that issue during the debate. The amendment was revised to make it very clear that people could access the scheme and get the minimum of $15,000 or a higher entitlement under the formula, but not both.
Having had that clarified and acknowledged by Senator Macdonald on the record, the minister, Mr Truss, gets up in the House of Representatives and continues this fallacious argument that the opposition's amendment would cost $60 million. Then he says that we have to amend this amendment, and he does it by reducing the minimum from $15,000 to $10,000 and comes up with this figure of $19 million. I would not have thought that the difference between $10,000 and $15,000 for that group of farmers who might be eligible to be paid the minimum because their formula does not give them that amount would cost a total of $41 million. But, according to this minister, it did.
The minister knew he was misleading the chamber, because it is on the record that we clarified that. But that is not the only thing that this minister misled the House of Representatives about. He asserted, once again, that this package was coming out of the goodness of the heart of the government and that it had been developed by the government, that it had been funded by the government, that this was terrific and that the opposition were really about trying to undermine the scheme. But by accepting our amendment, even though the government has qualified it, the government has acknowledged that our amendment was necessary to ensure that farmers who desperately needed this assistance would actually get an entitlement to it, and that will now happen.
The unfortunate thing, however, is that this government, in its trickiness, has played with the figures and has said, `Oh well, if the opposition, the Democrats and the other parties in the Senate say that you should get a minimum of $15,000, this government says that you are going to get a minimum of $10,000.' Frankly, you have to start asking what really drives the policy decisions of this government when it makes that sort of a change to what was a very appropriate amendment moved by this Senate.
I particularly want to point out that this minister once again has put this parliament in a position where it is now a quarter to one on Friday morning and if this legislation is not passed then the money will not be able to be paid to the dairy farmers. It is an affront to this parliament for such an important item for such an important industry that this parliament is put in this position. What did the minister say in his concluding remarks yesterday in the debate in the House of Representatives? He said:
Frankly, if it is not passed by the Senate in this form tomorrow, the money simply will not be paid to dairy farmers.
Once again, the minister is threatening the parliament and threatening the Senate by saying that, unless we agree to the meanness and the trickiness of this government and agree to reduce the amount that we guaranteed in our amendment from $15,000 to $10,000, dairy farmers are not going to get a cent out of this government. That is just disgraceful. I have to say that the opposition are going to reluctantly support this amendment because we are not going to stand by and watch dairy farmers hung out to dry again by this government and allow them to become the innocent victims of the games being played by the minister for agriculture and of his mismanagement of this scheme. 
I want to clarify a couple of other issues. During question time yesterday, the minister sought to attack me. He had a bit of a shot at me by saying that I had made an incorrect statement when I referred to a meatworks that had received Dairy RAP funding as being in his electorate when it was actually in the electorate of Mr Somlyay. Honourable senators will recall that I corrected that on the record as soon as I became aware of it. I felt that that was the necessary thing to do. What is the government and the minister on about when the subject of a question in question time is to try to run some line on the basis that I might have made that slight error? 
What I can say, which is true and which I will put on the record, is that this minister has had huge amounts of money paid to enterprises and other ventures in his electorate under a number of schemes, including Dairy RAP and Regional Solutions. Under round 1 of Dairy RAP, according to the figures that I have been supplied with by the department—and it was not easy to get these details originally, as Senator Woodley will recall, at estimates—65 per cent of the money in Queensland paid under Dairy RAP went to the minister's own electorate. I understand that he has an electorate that has a high dairy community. We have supported Dairy RAP, contrary to what the minister tried to assert—in fact, Dairy RAP came about because of our urgings—but it has become the plaything of this minister, as we saw with money being given to polocrosse centres and wine appreciation courses. Yet, as my colleague the member for McMillan, Mr Zahra, pointed out in the House yesterday, when his electorate put forward an excellent proposal for funding under Dairy RAP, what did they get? They got nothing—not a cent—out of this government, but Mr Truss has made sure that his electorate has done well.
We know that almost a third of the funds in the Regional Solutions scheme—$4 million out of $12.6 million—has gone to Mr Truss's electorate. You start to wonder why this has happened. Well, obviously he is concerned about his political future. My colleague Senator Hogg referred to the motto in Monto. Monto is a dairy community in Mr Truss's electorate. I recall when I visited there, and Senator Hogg referred to this, that I saw the motto of the shire council in Monto is: `In abundance prepare for scarcity.' It is a good motto for that area because, in the past in Monto, they have had abundance but, unfortunately because of this minister's neglect of his electorate, they are now suffering scarcity. We certainly support the Dairy RAP scheme, which of course is also a part of this legislation, but we will continue to point out areas where we believe there has been pork-barrelling or milk-barrelling, or whatever people want to call it, which is simply to try to prop up the political future of Mr Truss and other members of the government. 
I do not want to hold up the Senate any longer, but I believe it is important to put on the record our absolute disgust at the government's approach to this issue. It has delayed bringing this legislation in, it dropped it in the Senate only in the last couple of weeks and the committee was forced, once again, to hold in a hurry public hearings to allow people in the industry to make their representations. We have cooperated at every step of the way to get this legislation through the parliament, and we passed an amendment that the government itself recognised needed to be passed. But what did it do? It got back to the House, tinkered with the figures and reduced the minimum payment from $15,000 to $10,000.
—You could have passed this on Tuesday.
—The parliamentary secretary at the table says that we could have passed this. I recall from reading the Hansard that Mr Truss said that the government's proposal was put to the opposition and to the Senate during proceedings in the Senate. It was not. What discussions may have occurred between advisers to the government and advisers to the opposition and minor parties is one thing, but there was never any proposition put by this government during the debate—and you can check the Hansard—that it would be prepared to accept the opposition's amendment on the basis that there might have been some change to the minimum guarantee. That was never put. In fact, the minister, Senator Ian Macdonald, stood up at the end of the debate and said that the government did not accept the amendment in any event. So, once again, Mr Truss has misled the House of Representatives as to what actually happened in the Senate. 
I will leave my remarks there. We will support this amendment and the legislation, but we do so because we have the interests of the dairy farmers at heart. We are not going to see them become the innocent victims of the meanness and the trickiness of this government. The dairy farmers will know what has happened in respect of this legislation, and they will get the opportunity to pass judgment on this government in a few months time.",SENATE,<title>DAIRY PRODUCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SUPPLEMENTARY ASSISTANCE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,67,1,speech
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,2001-06-28,"—I rise to speak in this debate, and perhaps I should begin by saying that the Democrats will support this government amendment, but I would echo some of the words of Senator Forshaw: I really do not understand why we have played around with the figures before us. Really, the government accepted the rationale for the amendment moved here. I think senators will remember that, in fact, there were three amendments: one from the Labor Party, one from the Democrats and one from Senator Harris for One Nation. There was a compromise. We worked together to get a compromise amendment up. It is a shame that the government did not enter into that debate at that point and actually put its compromise. We could probably have expedited the whole debate if that had been so.
I point out that, in the minister's second reading speech, the government indicated that this new payment would provide benefits to about 892 additional farm enterprises. The parliamentary secretary might comment on whether that is 892 on top of the 300 to 400 we were told about the last time we had this supplementary assistance bill before us, or whether that includes the original 300 to 400. In any case, whichever way you look at the figures, this is at least a doubling of the number who will be assisted, and I am pleased about that. I am pleased that the government has taken on board what the Senate told it. 
The government amendment does not quite mirror the amendment that was passed here but it mirrors it fairly closely, apart from the money. So the Democrats accept that the government has at least come some of the way towards acknowledging that we were right. The only regret I have, of course, is that the other amendments that Senator Harris and I moved, which would have helped other farmers who are in desperate need, were not accepted by the Senate. I believe they were also totally valid. They were based on the evidence we heard at the Senate committee hearings and, in fact, were acknowledged in the Senate committee's report. But the Senate did not accept those other amendments. That is a terrible shame, because I expect there is going to be some fairly disappointed people out there. Nevertheless, we have come part of the way to solving the problem.
The minister really needs to be careful about what he says—and not only what he says about Senator Forshaw. He was reported in the media as having said that if we do not accept his amendment, there will be a blow-out in the budget. That is just not accurate. The budget is not involved in this issue at all. The revenue is raised through the 11c a litre levy on retail sales of milk. We could argue about who actually pays it. Farmers have had a drop in their income of more than 11c a litre, particularly on market milk, so in a sense they are paying. This bill, as did the previous bill, simply refunds the money that has been taken from farmers. There was no threat of a blow-out in the budget because of what the Senate did. The minister really needs to be careful about what he says in the House of Representatives and in the media.
As I have said, the Democrats will support the amendment. I checked with the QDO and the South Australian dairy farmers who gave evidence to our Senate committee, as well as with some farmers in Queensland. They are so desperate they said, `We will accept the drop that this government compromise amendment represents, because we desperately need the money.' In a sense, they were held over the blowtorch and were prepared to accept it as long as the money began to flow. Certainly, I am not about to be blamed for depriving desperate struggling farmers from receiving some more assistance. With those few words, I indicate again that the Democrats will support this compromise amendment moved by the government in the House of Representatives and now here in the Senate.",SENATE,<title>DAIRY PRODUCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SUPPLEMENTARY ASSISTANCE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,67,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2001-06-28,"—Pauline Hanson's One Nation will support the government's bill, but the amendments that the government have agreed to do not address the lessors' situation. The government have indicated that their proposal is costed at approximately $19 million and that it will take two months of levy to cover it. If we use that equation and the government's assessment of up to $60 million for Labor's original proposal, all that was required was to extend the period for six months. No Australian would object to paying 11c a litre extra for their milk to assist those dairy farmers by way of what was Labor's original amendment. There does not appear to be any elaboration on any of the difficulties that may continue to arise with sharefarmers, lessors and lessees. Is 21 May 2001 set down as a criterion? In other words, does a person have to be operating their dairy on that date to be eligible for this supplementary assistance package?
If that is the case, how does the government propose to assist those lessors, where the lessee has walked off the property—taken the package and the stock—and they do not have a dairy to be eligible for this additional supplement? I would really appreciate a response from the minister on that. The figures that I have to hand indicate that there will be approximately 892 farmers who will gain a benefit from this additional package. As Senator Woodley has clearly indicated, the figures we have show that more than 1,000 farmers missed out in the first assessment, so there are still a substantial number of farmers who will not be assisted. Although the government's proposed additional funding is appreciated by those in the industry, it does not solve the problem; it is merely a stopgap measure. Sadly, the price that is being paid to producers is still going down.
Senator Forshaw raised an interesting situation in Minister Truss's own electorate, which had previously supplied a substantial amount of dairy products into Brisbane. We now have the ridiculous situation where, because of the shortages in the south-east corner, they are now trucking milk on a weekly basis from Mareeba to Brisbane. That is more than 1,800 kilometres. The government did not anticipate that some of the largest producers would take the package and opt out, and that is what has caused the shortages of dairy products in these areas. For the industry to survive, and to enable the farmers to have some negotiating leverage back into their industry, there is only one way to resolve this issue: to re-regulate the industry.",SENATE,<title>DAIRY PRODUCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SUPPLEMENTARY ASSISTANCE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,67,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2001-06-28,"—I thank honourable senators for their comments. Earlier this week, the Senate requested the House to consider an amendment to the Dairy Produce Legislation Amendment (Supplementary Assistance) Bill 2001 to provide for a flat minimum payment of $15,000 to farmers whose market milk deliveries are more than 25 per cent under the DSAP scheme. The proponents in the Senate, the ALP, estimated the cost of the minimum payment under this amendment to be within the range of $10 million to $15 million. Due to what the government understands was an unintended drafting error, the cost of the implementation of that change was likely to be closer to $60 million. The change was therefore rejected by the government. I understand from the advisers that we were told not to put our present compromise amendment because you, Senator Forshaw, would not accept it. If you were too proud at that stage to change your amendment, that is why we are here at 1.05 a.m. debating this particular amendment. We could have passed this on Tuesday, but the delay in the legislation has been caused by what happened during the debate in the Senate earlier this week.
The government has indicated that it is prepared to consider a compromise amendment which reflects the intent of the opposition amendment. It also increases the coverage of the additional market milk payments but it does so in a much more targeted way and retains a sharp and measured focus on providing assistance to the most vulnerable dairy farmers. The government's amendment would lower the eligibility threshold by 10 percentage points from 35.1 to 25.1 per cent market milk dependency and would provide a stepped minimum payment of $10,000 or $15,000, depending on the level of market milk deliveries.
In effect, the government's new basic market milk payment right sets a floor in the market milk payment for those enterprises which have a market milk dependency of more than 25 per cent. Enterprises with a market milk dependency of more than 25 per cent and less than 30.1 per cent would be eligible for a minimum enterprise entitlement of $10,000, and from 30.1 per cent upwards the entitlement would increase to $15,000. Once market milk dependency reaches more than 35 per cent, the enterprise would then be entitled to the additional market milk payment currently provided for in the bill.
As senators are aware, the bill already provides for additional payments to be made based on a sliding scale from 0.12c a litre, for market milk deliveries of 35.1 per cent or more, up to 12c a litre at 45 per cent and above. It is important to note that an entity will be eligible for the larger of the basic payment or the additional market milk payment. This means that, if an enterprise meets the eligibility criteria for both the minimum basic market milk entitlement of $15,000 and an additional market milk entitlement of $20,000, the enterprise would be entitled to the larger of the two sums, which is in fact $20,000. This entitlement would be shared amongst the entities in accordance with their sharing of the entitlements under the original package, provided they were still involved in a dairy farm enterprise on 21 May 2001.
Senator Harris, for your benefit I would just like to say that the point you raised about the lessors will still be up to the Dairy Adjustment Authority to decide and would depend on such questions as whether they were actively seeking a lessee, et cetera. But the date of 21 May 2001, which you asked about, still applies.
As with the additional market milk payment, farmers will have the choice of taking the basic market milk payment as a lump sum or as a quarterly payment over eight years. This new payment is expected to provide benefit to about 892 additional farm enterprises, with some 569 being in South Australia, 129 in New South Wales, 134 in Queensland and 60 in Western Australia. The proposal is estimated to cost an extra $19 million and will require an extension of the 11c levy for about two months.
Senator Woodley, with regard to your question about the additional numbers, we are not aware of the 300-plus figure that you mentioned. The minister actually referred in his remarks to the increase in the number of enterprises picked up by the additional—either $10,000 or $15,000—minimum payments over the original Commonwealth proposal.
I believe that the government has moved promptly to address the concerns of vulnerable dairy farmers and their communities in light of the request it has received from the industry and as revealed by the ABARE report. If there is any disgrace in these whole proceedings, it is the fact that Labor state governments, by and large, have failed to help farmers; it is the federal government which has stepped in to help. Indeed, the alternative dairy plan which was being canvassed by Queensland Labor earlier this year wanted to remove part of the Dairy Regional Assistance Program, and indeed dairy farmers would be a great deal worse off under any of the ALP policies than under this proposal by the government.
Payments under the Supplementary Dairy Assistance Scheme, including the basic market milk payment, will be largely based on DSAP entitlements and information already available to the Dairy Adjustment Authority. Notification of the additional market milk and basic market milk entitlements will be made shortly after passage of this bill, and payments can be made promptly on completion of acceptance processes. As this is the last day of the current winter sittings, the government wishes to stress the importance of the passage of the legislation before parliament rises. Farmers are in genuine need, and it is imperative that they receive this additional assistance as soon as possible rather than face a delay of two months or more, should the government's compromise proposal not be accepted today.",SENATE,<title>DAIRY PRODUCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SUPPLEMENTARY ASSISTANCE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,67,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2001-06-28,"—I will not delay the debate very long. I just have to rise to speak again. Senator Troeth, the parliamentary secretary, has just repeated the false and misleading statement that the Labor Party rejected the government's compromise proposal in the Senate. Referring to his compromise amendment, which has now been passed in the House of Representatives, Minister Truss said yesterday:
This alternative was offered in the Senate but rejected by the Labor Party at the time. The issue could have been resolved in the Senate last night but that was not what happened.
That is not true. What happened is this: the Labor Party's amendment was moved and carried very early in the debate. I am sure Senator Harris and Senator Woodley will recall that it was one of the first amendments carried. Subsequently, approaches were made by the government advisers to the opposition advisers with respect to the wording of the amendment. I would have thought that what goes on in negotiations between the government advisers and the advisers of the opposition or any other party stays there. At no stage in the course of the debate did Minister Macdonald ever indicate that the government had an alternative proposition. Bear in mind that the amendment had already been carried, and it was some time later that approaches were made through the advisers. I understand no approaches were ever made to Senator Woodley or to Senator Harris about any compromise amendment. People from the government's side were still trying to do calculations as to the cost. I am saying again—and I want it recorded—that the parliamentary secretary has misled the Senate with her statements, just as the minister misled the House of Representatives yesterday as to what occurred. I invite the parliamentary secretary to read the Hansard to see what took place.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2001-06-28,"—Can I just check what the parliamentary secretary has moved?
—I have just read it out.
—Right. So it was amendments Nos 1 to 4. Thank you. I have a copy of the running sheet now. Now that I have been provided with the running sheet, let me try and encapsulate in one concise but thorough contribution the view of the opposition in relation to the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2000. In this instance, on behalf of Senator Evans, I would like to put on the record again Labor's position on this important issue.
Labor of course believes in the need for a child support scheme. Labor introduced this scheme in 1988 and it has been an important policy. There are few non-resident parents who today question their obligation to provide material support for their children. Unfortunately, that was not always the case. The child support scheme has reinforced to parents that they have obligations to their children. The scheme is also an important hedge against child poverty. Research by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling concludes that the scheme lifts around 60,000 children out of poverty each year. However, there is clearly a case for reform of the child support scheme, and Labor supports reform.
The scheme is now more than 12 years old and, during that time, a great deal of change has occurred that has impacted on the scheme's efficiency. There are also considerable concerns from both resident and non-resident parents that the scheme is not as fair as it could be. Nevertheless, it is difficult for political representatives because we are told by each side that the scheme is skewed against them. This may be the case in some areas. Changes to taxation laws, to employment patterns and to social security legislation, not to mention shifting community expectations, have all had an impact on people's experience of the child support scheme. However, we cannot respond properly to these pressures on the scheme with ad hoc changes that simply tilt the scales marginally one way or the other or, worse still, simply take money from one side to address perceived unfairness on the other. This kind of cheeseparing always leaves the same number of problems.
The legislation contains a number of positive measures. In fact, we have, without question, supported some seven out of the original 10 measures proposed. Tonight, we will support an additional two measures. However, in the view of the opposition, this legislation has attempted to fudge the reform task that confronts us. I will give an example that relates to the proposal to limit the income cap for payers on high incomes. Labor's opposition to this measure is about fairness and concern for lower income earners. 
There are a number of ways to tackle this issue. One way, which would deliver benefits to those on lower incomes as well as high income earners, is to lift the amount of disregarded income that is not currently considered an amount of more than $10,000. This might be fairer because it takes into account those at the bottom. But you cannot do this without looking across at the financial impact on resident parents. That is the real problem with some of the measures in this bill. There is a failure to look thoroughly at the overall effect of some of the changes. No-one would expect resident parents looking for a break on child support obligation that they believe is unfair to focus only on the big picture. They just want some relief. We understand that. But for every person that will gain a dollar, there is one losing a dollar. There are plenty of resident parents with these concerns that will not get one cent from the government's measures. It is time we took everyone's views and circumstances into account.
In the interests of trying to move this particular committee stage debate along, I would like now to move to the measures in this bill that will benefit second families. Labor has supported these measures from the beginning. We are hopeful that they will be passed and come into force soon. These measures have been well thought out and, unlike other parts of this bill, do not simply take from one side to give to the other. There is a recognition that government has to do more to assist separated families and in particular second families. We are proposing a request to amend the bill to alter the impact of the measure relating to shared care. Our request is to make further changes to family tax benefits to ensure that the introduction of shared care to the child support scheme creates no losers. 
In trying to do shared care on the cheap, the government is playing God with other people's money. The only rational way to proceed, if you want to make it fair, is to recognise that government has a role to play. The opposition's view is that unless our request is passed we cannot support the shared care measure to be discussed after that. This request makes shared care workable. The opposition would like to restate its support for the principle of shared care. There is nothing wrong with it. However, the government's attempt to enshrine this principle in legislation in both the social security rules and now in the child support rules has created a crude financial incentive to shared care rather than addressed the costs to parents who want to share care.
Recent research conducted by Paul Henman and Kyle Mitchell has thrown more light on this issue. Their research shows that non-resident parents do incur costs as a result of having contact with their children. What is important about the research is that they show that the costs to both separated parents sharing care are higher than the costs of share for intact families. This means that reform of child support which seeks only to shift the balance of resources between resident and non-resident families does not address the real economic pressure both sides may be under. In other words, if the combined costs of caring for children in separated families are 120 per cent of the costs they incurred when they were together, it is no good just trying to divide the original pool of resources differently. The research conducted by Henman and Mitchell should force senators to look more closely at what the opposition has proposed: the change to social security payment tapers that would have ensured that we do not have a situation of robbing Peter to pay Paul.
Whichever way the debate goes tonight, Labor is prepared to sit down with the government and other parties in the near future to settle the outstanding issues. The opposition is moving a number of requests for amendments to this bill, and I urge the Senate to support them. In the interests of time, I have tried to canvass the issues that will come before the committee in this debate. I hope it might assist the committee to make this one substantive contribution and to propose at a later stage in a more formal way—if that would please the minister, and I am sure it would—the requests for amendments that stand in the name of Senator Evans on behalf of the opposition.",SENATE,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,68,1,speech
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,2001-06-28,"—I seek leave to incorporate a general speech on this matter.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
With the marked increase in marriage dissolution and family separation in Australia over the past 25 years, the welfare of the children of that dissolution is paramount.
We recognise that for the most part children have two parents. The latest terminology of resident and non-resident parents is not a true description of parenting. It is probably better than access, or contact, but it does not reflect the reality that both parents have responsibilities and rights with regard to the parenting of their children, and the Democrats will not lose sight of the importance to children of having both separated parents involved in their upbringing. For this reason social policy debate and actual policy developments relating to issues of resident or non-resident parenthood should not be limited to in terms of financial obligations, but must encompass terms of active parenting relations.
For most children of separated parents, there is a second non-resident parent out there somewhere. Some have little or no contact with their children, most have some contact and many provide significant amounts of direct care for their children. Nor will we allow any notion of assignation of guilt relating to the reasons behind the separation of parents to impact on the rights of children to be parented, supported and nurtured. We will not support moves to make them pawns in the difficult relationships between their parents.
But in the end, the majority of the Child Support Bill is about the cost and payment of raising children in families where for whatever reason parents do not live together. It is not surprising that research by Henman/Mitchell reports that payer parents do incur additional costs as a result of having contact with their children. Indeed that research seems to be the basis for the Government wanting to move the measures before us which take from one parent and give to the other. But Henman/Mitchell, reports that the cost of caring for children by separated families is considerably greater than a pro-rata proportion of the cost of caring for children by an intact couple. Shifting the cost from one parent to the other does not address this.
It is disappointing that, despite having indicated from the start, our support for 7 of the 10 elements of the Bill, and which would have provided financial advantage for payers, this Bill has been delayed by 7 months. It is particularly unfortunate that the Government could not have seen the wisdom of earlier separating out and passing those elements, particularly as they do not negatively impact on the payee. However this did not happen and we are here today to again consider all 10 measures of the original Bill and indeed a further two amendments.
I will now address the two amendments proposed by the Government and which deal with Family Tax Benefit. With the wisdom of hindsight, the shared care provisions of Family Tax Benefit are certainly problematic. We are about to witness the raising of hundreds of thousands of FTB debts by Centrelink simply because the change in FTB legislation with relation to shared care was not made clear to parents in that situation. Time and time again constituents contact my office to say they have been hit by a debt of FTB. Their puzzlement is clear—their caring circumstances have not changed. They were not clearly told that the goalposts of eligibility for FTB for shared care had moved significantly. It was only in a Centrelink families publication received by parents in January of this year, and after questions raised by the Democrats that the reality that shared care would mean that Centrelink would be seeking repayment of FTB since July 2000. Their degree outrage at the debt is mirrored by the difficulty and hardship they will encounter in repaying it, over many years. I am interested to hear this morning of at least one successful appeal to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal where the notion of changed circumstances was thrown out, and the debt nullified.
New Amendments
So the Australian Democrats welcome with caution the opportunity for the payee parent to receive the full entitlement to FTB. We are concerned at the leverage this could provide to some payee parents who face difficulties in negotiating their parental role with the resident parent. The notion of “guess what I can do to you” is inappropriate empowerment over parties where in reality, animosity and bad behaviours may already exist between separated parents. However the capacity for one party to waive their entitlement to Family Tax Benefit in favour of the other, provided it is done so in a non-extortionlike manner, allows parties to agree that the percentage of shared care does not equate to shared costs, as was found by the Henman report. Henman points out that for example, a child's dental costs are almost exclusively met by the resident parent, notwithstanding that the child may spend between 10 and 30% of time with the non-resident parent. In supporting this amendment, I would like to think however that it will advantage those parents who elect to use it to maintain harmonious parenting.
The Australian Democrats also support the second amendment, which enables a child support debt to be recovered from a person's entitlement to Family Tax Benefit. Child Support assessment is based on the premise that parents pay a share of their income to support their children. The legislation allows for ongoing factors which result in changes to that income, and therefore it can be generally stated that where a person has a child support debt, that they have failed to meet their obligation.
Our support of this amendment does not mean we are not concerned at its impact on payee parents. The measure before us is not punitive to the payee parent, rather it is based on the need of the child to access the assessed level of support determined. It is undesirable that a person who has failed to provide for the support of their child should benefit from Family Tax Benefit legislation while the child goes without. In an ideal world, the child would benefit from the full payment of child support, however this does not happen and in this circumstance this amendment is appropriate.
INSIST ON 3 PREVIOUS AMENDMENTS
Reduction in child support liability for shared care where the non-resident parent has contact with the child for between 10 and 30% of the time-oppose
We do not dispute that non-resident parents have costs—indeed the 1988 report of the Child Support Formula for Australia (a report from the Child Support Consultative Group) at Chapter 11 included in the development of the formula, the access costs incurred by non-custodial parents. But this is not the way to meet the costs of the non-resident parent—by taking directly away from the resident parents whose costs have not reduced proportionately. A non-resident parent will continue to incur accommodation, educational, ongoing health and non-consumable costs notwithstanding that the children spend time with the other parent. We have said before, we will enter into discussions with the Government on how to address this—perhaps a contact allowance is the answer—but we categorically oppose the inequity proposed by this amendment which will directly disadvantage those parents who have between 70 and 90% care of their children, and whose costs have not proportionately reduced.
Reduction of the cap from $101,153 to $78,838—oppose.
There is no evidence that the present cap constitutes a disincentive to payers to work. Another measure of the Bill, supported by the Democrats, enables Payee families to keep more income from a second job or overtime. Modelling shows that resident parents may lose up to $90 per week for one child and the effect is most likely to be on the child's well being. This measure is poorly targeted, and there is no social justice in denying children of higher income earners the opportunity to share in the income of their parents.
Non-disclosure of supporting documents—oppose
We remain opposed to this measure. It is a denial of natural justice and contravenes basic legal principles of access and full and open disclosure. It will mask the transparency and accountability of the departure from assessment process. It is unacceptable to create a situation whereby a party is required to challenge or argue a case when they are not given access to the documentation on which the other party is relying. A person cannot respond to an application which cannot be proven on the basis of that application. It will impact adversely on a payee's ability to obtain informed advice, and will further disadvantage a payee's ability to ensure that the payer has made accurate representations as to their financial position. While we do not dispute the personal nature of documents, it remains that this is the case in a range of jurisdictions. I am aware that in these, parties can be compelled to sign a declaration that they will not disclose to third parties, any information gained.
—I need to explain the amendments that I will be moving at the appropriate time. They pretty well mirror the amendments of the Labor Party, so I presume that means we can come together fairly quickly. The Australian Democrats insist on our earlier Senate amendments (1), (3), (4) and (5), which oppose three measures in the original bill. At the same time, we support the two new amendments proposed by the government. The first of the previous amendments upon which we insist is reduction in child support liability for shared care where the non-resident parent has contact with the child for between 10 and 30 per cent of the time. In other words, we will be insisting on our original opposition to that issue. We do not dispute that non-resident parents have costs. Indeed, the 1988 report of the child support formula for Australia, a report from the Child Support Consultative Group, at chapter 11 included the access costs incurred by non-custodial parents in the development of the formula. But this is not the way to meet the costs of the non-resident parent—by taking directly away from the resident parent whose costs have not reduced proportionately. A non-resident parent will continue to incur accommodation, educational, ongoing health and non-consumable costs notwithstanding that the child spend time with the other parent. We have said before we will enter into discussions with the government and other senators on how to address this. Perhaps a contact allowance is the answer, but we categorically oppose the inequity proposed by this amendment, which will directly disadvantage those parents who have between 70 and 90 per cent care of their children and whose costs have not proportionately reduced. We continue to oppose the reduction of the cap, from $101,153 to $78,838, for the reason that there is no evidence that the present cap constitutes a disincentive to payers to work.
Another measure of the bill supported by the Democrats enables payee families to keep more income from a second job or overtime. Modelling shows that resident parents may lose up to $90 per week for one child, and the effect is most likely to be on the child's wellbeing. This measure is poorly targeted, and there is no social justice in denying children of high income earners the opportunity to share in the income of their parents.
The third issue is the non-disclosure of supporting documents. We continue to oppose this measure. It is a denial of natural justice and contravenes basic legal principles of access and full and open disclosure. It will mark the departure from the transparency and accountability of the assessment process. It is unacceptable to create a situation whereby a party is required to challenge or argue a case when they are not given access to the documentation on which the other party is relying. A person cannot respond to an application which cannot be proven on the basis of that application. It will impact adversely on a payee's ability to obtain informed advice and will further disadvantage a payee's ability to ensure that the payer has made accurate representations as to their financial position. While we do not dispute the personal nature of documents, it remains that this is the case in a range of jurisdictions. In these, parties can be compelled to sign a declaration that they will not disclose to third parties any information gained.
We support two new government amendments. The first is to waive family tax benefit in favour of the other parent. The Democrats welcome, with caution, the opportunity for the payee parent to receive the full entitlement to family tax benefit. We are concerned at the leverage this could provide to some payee parents who face difficulties in negotiating their parental role with the resident parent. The notion of `guess what I can do for you' is inappropriate empowerment over parties where in reality animosity and bad behaviour may already exist between separated parents. However, the capacity for one party to waive their entitlement to family tax benefit in favour of the other, provided it is done in a non-extortionlike manner, allows parties to agree that the percentage of shared care does not equate to shared costs, as was found by the Henman report. I might add that Paul Henman is a personal friend of mine. He points out that, for example, a child's dental costs are almost exclusively met by the resident parent notwithstanding that the child may spend between 10 and 30 per cent of their time with the non-resident parent. In supporting this amendment I would like to think that it would, however, advantage those parents who elect to use it to maintain harmonious parenting.
Finally, we agree to the beneficial measure to recover child support debt from the payee's family tax benefit. We support this second amendment moved by the government. It enables a child support debt to be recovered from the payee's entitlement to family tax benefit. Child support assessment is based on the premise that parents pay a share of their income to support their children. The legislation allows for ongoing factors which result in changes to that income and therefore it can be generally stated that where a person has a child support debt they have failed to meet their obligation. Our support for this amendment does not, however, mean we are not concerned at its impact on payee parents. The measure before us is not punitive to the payee parent. Rather, it is based on the need of the child to access the assessed level of support determined. It is undesirable that a person who has failed to provide for the support of their child should benefit from family tax benefit legislation while the child goes without.

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2001-06-28,"—I rise to make some comments on the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2000. It is pleasing to see that this bill does take into account the impact and the difficulties felt by second families. This is the first of what I hope will be many steps to right a lot of the wrongs in relation to the child support process.
It has been suggested that one section of the bill that recognises the costs of the custodial parent who has the children from 10 per cent up to 30 per cent of the time is merely taking from the other parent. I strongly disagree with that. I believe that if the non custodial, or payer, parent has the custody of the children for between 10 per cent and 30 per cent of the year then that should be recognised. It is a difference of between 30 nights per year and 100 nights per year. At present, if the bill is not amended, there is no consideration for a parent who has the children in his or her custody for 70 nights per year, and I believe there should be. I would like to see the child support process improved to the point where the payer, or non custodial, parent had some form of input into how the payments were used. That could be by agreement, preferably, and I believe that it would remove from the process a lot of the dissatisfaction if the payer parent had some form of input. 
To emphasise the point, I will give as an example the situation with one paying parent that I know whose children's ages range between 18 and 20 years. That parent would like to make those payments directly to the children. However, the custodial, or the receiving, parent will not in any way consent to that and maintains that the payment for these adults—because at this stage they are not children—must go through the custodial parent. If those issues were addressed within the child support process, it would move a long way towards removing some of the problems with the act in its present form. I commend the government for moving in the right direction and indicate that Pauline Hanson's One Nation will support the government in these requests.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2001-06-28,"—Mr Temporary Chairman, I think I have indicated to the committee the position of the opposition in relation to this matter. I do not intend to move the request for amendment, given that the minister did make the government's view clear, which was useful from the point of view of facilitating the committee debate. Obviously, in relation to the Senate amendments and House amendments we have dealt with, the opposition's view was governed by the government's attitude to the opposition's further request for amendment. Given the form of the running sheet, it did assist the committee that the minister made clear the government's position in this regard. Clearly, there is no point pressing that issue and it will not be pressed.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2001-06-28,"—We have a very heavy schedule this morning, so I will keep my comments brief. The Democrats will accept the amendments passed in the House of Representatives. Senators will be aware that the Democrats had a number of significant concerns with the original bill, which is why we moved a number of amendments and supported a number of opposition amendments to substantially strengthen the legislation. We acknowledge the support of the opposition for our changes to the board and the government's agreement to this representative structure. In the committee stage, we indicated that we were happy for an additional representative from New Zealand, pending discussion with the relevant New Zealand authorities. The government's amendment to our board structure to allow the additional member from the non-mandated positions is acceptable to the Democrats.
Senators will recall that the Democrats were particularly unimpressed with the structure of the ministerial council. We were of the view that the intergovernmental agreement needed to be revisited to ensure that the health ministers were the lead ministers from each jurisdiction. We did not and do not consider appropriate that the agriculture and trade ministers should have undue influence on food standards which fundamentally go to ensuring health and public safety. That is why we supported the opposition's amendment to make ministerial guidelines a disallowable instrument.
The Democrats are pleased that the Prime Minister has taken note of opposition and Democrat concerns and has indicated to the health minister that he would write to the heads of government in the near future to convey the Commonwealth government's wish to make health ministers the lead minister from each jurisdiction. We welcome the government's movement on this. It needs to be noted that the change to the IGA is not certain. However, we are aware that the majority of states support the refocusing of the ministerial council to reflect the core objective of FSANZ, the body that supersedes ANZFA. Accordingly, the Democrats will not press for the retention of the disallowable instrument. Given the significance of this change for public confidence in Australia's food standards, I think it is only reasonable that the Prime Minister's intention be publicly recorded. So I would ask two things of the parliamentary secretary: firstly, what precisely has the Prime Minister stated in respect of his intention to write to the other heads of government; and, secondly, what precisely is the Prime Minister's request to other heads of government?",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,69,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2001-06-28,"—I indicate on behalf of the opposition that we will support the bill as amended by the House of Representatives. In fact, I endorse the comments of Senator Greig which referred to the fact that the government has taken on board a number of the amendments moved by the opposition and the Democrats and carried in the Senate. We are pleased to see that the government has accepted those proposals. While the government has not agreed to all the amendments, we believe that the amendments improve the bill substantially and that they strengthen the transparency, independence and science and public health focus on the Australia New Zealand Food Authority.
We also note that the government has given a commitment—and, again, Senator Greig has referred to this—that the Prime Minister will write to all the state and territory heads of government proposing that the food regulation intergovernmental agreement be amended to specify that the lead minister on the ministerial council will be the health minister in all jurisdictions. On the basis of that commitment, and similar to the Democrats, we have agreed not to pursue our amendments in relation to the disallowable instruments. We believe the states will embrace this change. We hope that the commitment will be honoured as soon as possible and that the issue will be resolved as soon as possible. On that basis, we support the bill with the amendments that have been accepted and determined by the House of Representatives.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,69,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2001-06-28,"—I thank the opposition and the Democrats for their indications of support for the amendments and arrangements that have been made in the House of Representatives. I note the continuing reservations of Senator Brown on these particular issues. I hope that he will be convinced with the passage of time that the arrangements between Australia and New Zealand will lead to a very satisfactory arrangement as the new Food Standards Australia New Zealand comes into being. The broad policies and principles were extensively debated previously and I think that, given those extensive debates and the issues agreed in the intergovernmental agreement about Australian jurisdictions and the proposed treaty with New Zealand, we will reach a good accord.
Senator Greig asked about the Prime Minister's intentions. I can confirm that a commitment has been given by the Prime Minister, in correspondence with Dr Wooldridge, that he will be writing to the heads of government in the near future to convey to them the ALP's preference that the food regulation intergovernmental agreement be amended to specify that health ministers will be the lead ministers in each jurisdiction. It is, of course, a matter for COAG in that regard but, certainly, the Prime Minister has given an undertaking, and I am pleased to make it known here.

The speech read as follows—
EPBC Amendment (Wildlife) Bill
It has been unfortunate that this bill has been rushed through the parliament. We have had limited time to first of all consider the bill, and second to consider the significant number of amendments that were moved during the debate.
Senator Bolkus said then that Labor's support for those amendment's was on the proviso that we have a bit more time to look at them in more detail before the bill returned to the senate.
The Government also noted that it needed more time for consideration of the amendments. They have now further amended the Bill in the House, undoing many of the senate amendments and altering others.
It is unfortunate that we do not have more time to full consider their amendments. We do not accept all the arguments they have put forward in rejecting some of the Senate amendments.
However, in the interest of progressing the bill, we will support the Government's bill as it was amended in the house.
But, be assured that an incoming Labor government will address review these amendments in government.
Labor is already committed to a full scale review of the EPBC legislation. We will return to the amendments moved to this bill and consider how we might achieve better outcomes in the context of this legislation.
I would like to note that we are particularly disappointed with the Government's failure to appropriately amend the bill to provide the assurance that this bill will not infringe or extinguish any indigenous rights including native title rights.
This failure leaves open two undesirable possibilities:
1.	at worst it will facilitate infringements of indigenous rights
2.	any legal challenge to defend these rights might put at risk other aspects of the  bill.
I would also like to make a brief comment on the prior authorisations and associated fisheries provisions. These were provisions moved during the debate on the Environment Legislation Amendment Bill No 1 and we had concerns with them then and those concerns are still valid.
In Government, Labor will seek to address those issues we outlined during the ELAB No. l debate, particularly in relation to the requirements for accreditation of a fisheries regime and offence provisions.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION AMENDMENT (WILDLIFE PROTECTION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,70,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-06-28,"—I will not speak for long because of the time, but this is important legislation, so it is appropriate to speak briefly to it. As Senator Brown has indicated, and I concur, the bill as it now stands amended by the House is not as good as it could have been. It is certainly not as strong as it was with the 90-odd Democrat amendments that were agreed to in this place earlier in the week. I put on the record that the process with the bill has been less than ideal, but I recognise that it is preferable to have it pass now. The additional amendment the government has added in the House of Representatives is problematic. The process involved with that is of concern to the Democrats as well, but the package of legislation as it now stands is clearly an improvement on the law in relation to wildlife trade. Some of the Senate amendments that have been retained do mean significant enhancements, in particularly making it an offence for the release of live plants held under permit.
Allowing the release of live plants is significant, particularly given the weed problem in many areas of Australia. Ensuring the precautionary principle is an important measure. The duration of permits has been shortened as a result of Senate amendments. A range of matters are required to be considered by the minister. Assessment is required of environmental impact of the activities covered by any plan to approve a wildlife trade operation. Exceptional circumstance permits must comply with CITES requirements. These are some of the Senate amendments that have been agreed to by the government, and they certainly strengthen the bill. It is a shame that some other amendments—particularly some of the consultation measures and some of the animal welfare measures—were not accepted by the House of Representatives. There is still plenty of room for improvement in the environmental legislation governing this country. The Democrats, as I am sure will others in this place, will continue to look for opportunities to further strengthen our federal environment laws, but this legislation goes some steps in that direction. For that reason, the Democrats support this motion.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2001-06-28,"—My intention is to seek to incorporate some remarks on the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2001, but there are some other issues I need to articulate. Given that we are now at 2 o'clock and we have another education bill to follow, I am sure all senators would welcome us proceeding at speed. Unfortunately, though, I need to get some advice from some officials.
This particular proposition is to amend the Higher Education Funding Act to: provide base funding for universities for 2003; provide funding for 2002-03 for extra places as part of the budget measures, and that is to include some 670 extra places for regional universities; provide funding for 2002-03 for extra support for people with disabilities; vary maximum funding levels to reflect higher HECS receipts; reflect supplementation in regard to Commonwealth superannuation liabilities; transfer funds from the Australian Research Council Act to enable the Institute of Advanced Studies at the Australian National University to access ARC competitive grant programs; clarify the treatment of HECS debts in the event of bankruptcy of the debtor; and broaden the ministerial guidelines making power in relation to HECS and work experience in industry. Further, the bill will amend the Australian Research Council Act to provide base funding for 2003, to supplement for price increases and to transfer funds from HEFA, as already indicated. The opposition's view is that we should support this legislation, depending upon clarification of a number of issues. 
I move this second reading amendment:
At the end of the motion, add “but the Senate condemns the Government for:
	(a)	reducing government expenditure on universities by $3 billion and shifting the burden onto students and graduates;
	(b)	cutting 3,500 research training places, including 800 at regional universities; and
	(c)	continuing to work towards total university fee deregulation”.
I trust the Senate will support that second reading amendment.
Is the minister able to advise me whether or not the government is prepared to take some questions on notice and provide answers within a reasonable period, such as that set down for the return of answers to questions from estimates? If so, it may in fact facilitate the passage of this legislation. Is that possible? At the end of the second reading debate, I will seek the answers to those questions.
In particular, I would like to have answers to the following questions. Does this bill seek to establish clearly that accumulated HECS cannot be extinguished by bankruptcy? Have there been instances where this has happened already? Is it the case that, under the changes proposed in the bill, the Commonwealth would have the power to claim a proportion of bankrupt HECS debtor's assets, even if in the year of bankruptcy the debtor's income was below the normal HECS repayment threshold? What are the equity measures in this for the debtors, given that others of the same income would not need to repay HECS? What are the equity arrangements for other creditors who might receive less because of the HECS repayments being made to the Commonwealth? To what extent do the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act not apply to HECS as currently administered? If it is possible, I would like to have those questions answered. I expect there will be a need to have detailed responses to those questions.
The opposition is concerned about the inconsistencies in this legislation. It is normal that after three years a bankrupt is discharged, and other debtors are automatically freed from most kinds of debts. The bill establishes that the provision for the automatic discharge of debts will not apply to HECS debts and that HECS debts have a particular character. Unlike other debts, they do not automatically have to be repaid but are repaid only under certain circumstances—that is, when the debtor's income reaches a certain level—and they are extinguished by death. For other debts, repayments are made out of the deceased debtor's estate but for HECS there is no repayment made from the estate of the deceased debtor. Why are HECS debts not treated equally with other debts by making them provable—that is, payable—in the event of bankruptcy?
It would be simpler, more effective and consistent to exclude all HECS debts from the operation of the Bankruptcy Act. That does not appear to be the case under this arrangement, and, if I have understood that correctly, why not? It would seem that there is not an extinguishment of debt. Rather, such a debt would not be considered or repaid by the trustee appointed under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, but would still be repaid when the debtor's income reached the required level. Can the Commonwealth initiate bankruptcy proceedings against the result of unpaid HECS debts? As you can see, a number of issues still require further explanation. Is it possible to have detailed answers to those questions in the same time frame as Senate estimates questions on notice are answered? I seek leave to incorporate the remainder of my remarks.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
Apart from providing base funding for universities and ARC for 2003, the major measures in this Bill implement Budget measures to provide funding for extra places at regional universities and campuses, and extra support for people with disabilities.
The regional universities initiative—$35.2 million over four years doesn't go anywhere near making up for the $171 million taken from regional universities in the 1996 Budget cuts.
As well, the Government's reduction of 3,500 research training places, as part of its White Paper changes, included 800 places lost from regional institutions.
This shows that the Howard Government has not suddenly realised the importance of education, training and research to Australia's future, but is simply in pre-election spending mode, in a desperate attempt to stay in office.
If they succeed, then the infamous Cabinet Submission will be given new life. Total deregulation of university fees, real-interest loans, and a voucher system of funding will be back at the top of the agenda.
Under this scenario, newer and regional institutions would be most likely to suffer, as well as students. who would face higher fees and, with real interest rates, pay big penalties for not having the money to pay off loans quickly.
This is Dr Kemp's privatisation/user pays agenda, which benefits the wealthy, and sees no advantage in providing opportunities to less well off Australians.
This government has cut $3 billion from university funding. If public funding had been maintained at 1996 levels, there could have been an extra 21,000 places in 1997, and an extra 54,000 places this year.
Compared with these cuts, the extra places in this Bill look hopelessly inadequate.
Despite the Government's attempts to deny the findings of the Monash University Report on Australia's performance as a Knowledge Nation, it cannot deny that Australia ranks 21 out of 29 in the OECD in terms of public expenditure on education.
Australia's public expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP—at 4.34—is still below the OECD average of five per cent, and well below that of the five leading OECD countries. which all spend more than six per cent.
Australia's average investment per tertiary student of $US29,194 compares with an OECD average of $35,087.
DETYA's own figures show the number of students per teaching staff member in our universities has risen from 15.3 to 18.84 since the Howard Government took office.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,71,1,speech

The speech read as follows—
The Democrats will support the various measures in the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2001.
I notice the Minister's second reading speech proudly points out that enrolments are projected to grow by 27% between 1995 and 2003. What the Minister didn't point out was most of that growth is international students domestic student numbers dipped in 2000 and preliminary estimates suggest it has declined again in 200 1. What the Minister also failed to mention is revenue is only expected to increase by 21.5% in the same period.
This simply means less resources per student. While the projections for further effective cuts per student may suit the ideological agenda of the Minister, nobody who knows anything about education or cares about the quality of education will consider this good news.
Universities cannot sustain their current rate of expenditure relative to income growth. Analysis of the state of universities' finances undertaken by DETYA and published in the Higher Education Reports for the 2000 to 2002/ 2001 to 2003 Trienniums show a declining trend since 1996. For example, the sector-wide safety margin (which measures the ability of universities to contain expenditure within the constraints of available revenue) has fallen from 6.5% in 1997 to 3.3% in 1999, with two institutions recording negative safety margins in 1998 and 1999. Since 1996, borrowings have increased by $83m, or 31 %. Total revenue growth has slowed over each of the past two years.
We are all aware of the 6% cuts to operating grants announced in 1996 but this doesn't give a true picture because the increases in higher education cost structures over the past five years have been dramatic.
The First Assistant Secretary of the Higher Education Division of DETYA, Michael Gallagher, estimates that the gap between operating grant indexation and actual salary outcomes has risen to around 15% over the last 5 years. When the effects of a declining Australian dollar are factored into the cost structure of universities—which spend heavily on foreign-sourced items such as books, journals and laboratory equipment—the unfunded shift in the cost structure of universities is at least 20%.
The Minister also boasts in his second reading speech that university revenues have grown to a record level—estimated to be $9.5 billion in 2001—despite Commonwealth cutbacks.
What the Minister also neglects to mention is `diversification' of income sources and increase revenues from commercial and other private sources are not going back to universities' core activities to ensure a sufficient increase in dollars per student to meet rising expenditure costs. As a consequence, academic staff have dropped to 3 8% of the total staff of universities. Libraries are slashing their purchases of books and serials. Staff-student ratios have ballooned from 1:14.8 in 1996 to 1:18.8 in 2000.
The new private income from international education and elsewhere, has been applied to different functions to those supported by the old public income. Thus, the new private income has failed to substitute for the public investment that this Government has cut. The new private income has been applied to new or additional functions.
How much are our notionally public universities spending on marketing?
·	On international campuses?
·	On recruiting international and other fee paying students?
·	On corporate boxes at sporting events?
·	On fund-raising and alumni relations?
·	How much are they spending to make a commercial buck—90 cents in the dollar, 95 cents in the dollar?
These important questions go to the governance, resourcing and quality of the teaching and learning experience in our universities. The Democrats and indeed the sector remain frustrated that the Minister's persistent misinformation glosses the undeniable crisis in our universities. A crisis bought about by this government's own doing.
One of the measures in this Bill is to amend the Australian University Act 1991 to modify the advisory structure of the ANU Council. I am aware that there has been an effective consultation process within, the university on these governance changes and that they are supported by staff and students.
This Bill also provides for a modest increase of 670 funded places targeted at regional universities and campuses. This will help ameliorate the damage done by this government to regional universities.
One of the more devastating critiques of this Governments' approach to universities was recorded by the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Tasmania who recently told the Senate Inquiry into The Capacity Of Public Universities To Meet Australia's Higher Education needs that the University of Tasmania could no longer meet the needs of Tasmania because of the lack of funded places.
The Lilydale Campus of Swinburne University of Technology has been forced into an unsustainable policy of massive over-enrolments at the marginal rate because this Government withdrew the Commonwealth Industry Placement Scheme (CIPS) and have never given Swinburne funded places for Lilydale.
The Government approved of Swinburne investing in this campus to ensure access for students in Melbourne's outer east—and have provided capital grants for the campus—they just refuse to provide funded student places. And the Government's response to such circumstances? Provider Beware, yes provider beware.
A fundamental responsibility of the Commonwealth is to ensure equitable access to education thus the Democrats welcome the appropriation in this Bill of $1.8 million in 2001 and $2.9 million in 2003 for disability support.
However, we need to consider the Government's performance in broader terms and the performance is poor. Indigenous students, rural and isolated students, people from low socio-economic backgrounds all remain seriously underrepresented in higher education. The difficulties these students, and indeed all students face is compounded by overly restrictive and totally inadequate income support measures.
A major barrier to participation is cost and it is important to understand that Australian students pay significantly higher tuition fees than most.
Let us set aside the miniscule percentage of students in expensive American ivy league private universities—in 1999-2000, the average fee paid by a student at a 4 year public university in the US—the largest sector in the US—was $US3,356. How does this stack up against fees in Australian Universities?
The only meaningful method in measuring relative cost is a conversion based on the respective purchasing power of the currencies involved. When converted to Australian dollars using the OECD purchasing power parities (PPPs) the average US fee is $A4,396.
However, in Australia in 2000, the average HECS fee was $A4,454. Thus, fees at Australian public universities are actually 1.3% higher than at comparable institutions in the US. Indeed Australia is now the third most privatised higher education sector in the world—a feat achieved at the direct expense of students.
As a final comment on this Bill, I note it is one of two omnibus education Bills we are considering today. Given the absolute mess the Government has made of the other Bill—this may well be one of the last two of these we see from this Government in this portfolio area.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,71,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2001-06-28,"—I thank senators for their contributions to the debate. Senator Carr's questions will be taken on notice. The department has advised me that it will endeavour to answer them by the date that was applied to the questions on notice at the recent Senate estimates.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2001-06-28,"—I will seek leave to incorporate my remarks on the Innovation and Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2001. In addition to those remarks, I will say that this bill contains amendments to three separate bills. Some we considered only a few months ago—the ARC Bill and the HEFA Bill; and we have just considered another, separate amendment to the HEFA Bill. The third issue is amendments to the state grants bill, which we considered in December. I am particularly concerned that this government has felt it necessary to bring forward an omnibus bill covering those three areas. It is the first time this has occurred, to my knowledge. I cannot find another instance where an omnibus bill has been brought forward to contain matters that relate to the different sectors of education within one bill.
It is particularly unfortunate and annoying that the government has sought to combine a range of measures which are, in reality, non-controversial—they are reasonable in the context of this government's policies—and which the Labor Party has no objection to with a range of other measure which appear to me to be unfair and unreasonable in the way in which they are being administered and which pose serious questions about basic equities. Therefore, as the shadow minister has indicated, we will be seeking to move a number of amendments in the committee stage that balance out the proposals and move for support for public education, which has so sadly been neglected by this government.
The substantive matter that we will need to discuss, which we will discuss by a contingent notice of motion that I will move in the committee stage, goes to splitting this bill into three. I will have to raise the matter in some detail at that point, because I believe it is quite a serious issue. If it is necessary, I will then bring forward other arguments about what I regard to be the administrative failure of the department insofar as they have paid certain moneys to certain schools which, on my reading, appear to be outside the guidelines. Frankly, the arguments put forward by the department in response to questions which they gave me only this morning are incredibly thin and not persuasive at all. When the opportunity arises, I may well have to explain the detail of that.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
Innovation and Education Legislation Amendment Bill
This Bill implements some of the measures from the Innovation Statement - a good thing, you might say, except that the Innovation Statement only slightly addressed the problems created by the previous five years of short-sighted and damaging cuts by the Howard Government.
Under John Howard, Commonwealth funding for universities has fallen every year - from $4.875 billion in 1996 to $4.223 billion by 2002.
This adds up to more than $3 billion taken from the public funding of universities.
In 2000, the number of Australian students at our universities fell by more than 3,000.
The extra university places announced in Innovation Statement - 2000 extra places a year - mean that it will take years even to repair last year's damage.
And the extra funding for research doesn't change the reduction in research training places at most Australian universities. This year, there are almost 3,500 fewer research training places at Australia's universities, thanks to the Government's White Paper on research. So much for its new-found, election-year interest in innovation.
Removal of these places research training places punishes newer universities which have tried to extend their research effort.
The Government tries to say this is about concentrating Australia's research effort but it is really about reducing investment. Despite the rhetoric, John Howard has not changed - while he might be giving with one hand, he's still taking away from our future with the other.
This Bill also establishes the Postgraduate Education Loan Scheme (PELS), described by Dr Kemp in his second reading speech as being “designed to encourage lifelong learning and to help Australians upgrade and acquire new skills.
All very fine, except that, if this government was so concerned about helping Australians with lifelong learning, they would not have reduced HECS places for postgraduate coursework by 60 per cent.
Labor believes that a loan scheme has the potential to help students who otherwise would miss out on postgraduate study because of their inability to pay upfront fees, and we are prepared to support it in principle. Nevertheless, we recognise this framework - deregulated fees, with capped loans from the Commonwealth - as the scenario Dr Kemp would like to impose on the entire university sector. He outlined his plan in the infamous leaked Cabinet Submission. If the Coalition is returned at the next election. we can expect the full implementation of that Cabinet submission: total deregulation, vouchers, and real interest rates on student loans.
I should take this opportunity to state again, categorically, that a Labor Government will not deregulate undergraduate university fees and we will not allow real-interest loans.
We will, in fact, as we have said all along, phase out the capacity of universities to charge upfront fees to Australian undergraduates.
The introduction of PELS also opens up the possibility of universities putting up fees unreasonably, and we have some concerns about the mechanism the Government envisages to deal with this: a limit on the amount students may borrow.
The Opposition understands that what the Government has in mind is a single amount.
This could work unfairly in the case of people who incurred large HECS debts (because of course choices) before beginning postgraduate study.
In 1996, this Government increased HECS charges by up to 125%.
Courses in band three now cost $5,870 a year.
A four-year course at that rate would leave a student with a debt of $23,480.
Now, the same Government is seeking to limit that student's ability to access postgraduate education, because of their debt level.
But the students who would be most affected by the loan limit would be those whose only path to postgraduate study is a loan -those who can pay upfront will still be able to enrol.
The loan limit on the combined HECS / PELS debt could also disadvantage those students who are unable to pay their HECS up front in other words, those for whom financial considerations make access to university more difficult. And those are the students PELS is supposedly designed to help.
For this reason, Labor will be moving an amendment in to limit the Minister's power to set a maximum loan amount to consideration of PELS debts only - that is, not to include HECS.
I listened to the objections to this proposal as put by Departmental officers in the enquiry into this Bill on 25 June. My response to that is, Labor does not accept that the difficulties that were described ought to outweigh considerations of equity and fairness. For that reason, we will be proceeding with our amendment.
I note that the Minister's office is reported (The Age, 16 June) to have been “unable to supply examples of excessively high HECS debts” but advised that there were 2266 graduates with debts exceeding $20,000. So they have presented no evidence that HECS debts alone are a problem, but seem to have decided that debt levels exceeding $20,000 cross some sort of difficulty threshold.
Labor will also be moving an amendment requiring a review of the operation of PELS after 12 months. This will include looking at movements in fees, and I would like to reiterate the point made by the Shadow Minister when this Bill was debated in the House: Labor in government will review the PELS arrangements if universities seek to treat it as a major new source of revenue.
Before moving to the schools part of this Bill, I would like to make a further comment about evidence given to the committee on 25 June enquiring into this legislation. It was put to members of that Committee that there was a great deal of urgency about this Bill, because it implemented some important measures due to commence next year.
Those measures were announced in the Innovation Statement on 29 January. The Bill implementing them was not debated in the House until 19 June. If it is all so urgent, why wasn't it treated as urgent by the Government? Taking five months before beginning a second reading debate doesn't sound to me like a Bill that's being given priority by the Government.
Secondly, much was made in Departmental evidence before the committee about the so-called doubling of funding for the Australian Research Council. The fact is that the extra funding for the ARC, as announced in the Innovation Statement, is heavily back-loaded, with the vast bulk of funds - more than 65 per cent - not allocated until 2004 or Funding in this Bill for the ARC represents just 2.5 per cent of the promised extra funding.
The Government is so keen to develop innovation and research in Australia that it will be 2004 before any significant increase in funds is seen. It is clear that there is no urgency there. So let's have no more of this sham concern.
Nevertheless. Labor wants to make it absolutely clear that we do not want to stand in the way of any increase in funding for higher education research or university places, particularly given the way in which these key areas have been neglected by the Howard Government.
Therefore, in line with the notice I have already given, Labor will be moving to split this legislation into three parts,, one of which will deal only with the additional funding for the ARC and for higher education places. This will allow swift passage of the non-controversial parts of this legislation, while providing appropriate time for debate of the other elements.
It should be noted that. at the hearings of the Senate committee enquiry into this Bill on 25 June, the chairman, Senator Tierney, described this Bill as “complex”. His words were, “it is a complex bill”.
So it is very reasonable for Labor to seek to split it into schools and higher education parts, and, given the message of urgency the Government has sent, despite its own laxity, to seek to separate the non-controversial parts from the rest, in order to ensure quick passage for the sections delivering additional funding for the hard-pressed higher education sector.
I will now move on to the second part of this strangely-constructed Bill. There appears to be no precedent for funding for both universities and schools to be bundled into the one piece of legislation - another reason supporting splitting the Bill as I have described.
Last year's States Grants legislation provided $859,000 in 2001 for establishment grants, and $1,289m per annum in each of the following years.
This Bill seeks to increase those amounts by a total of $9.5 million, with the increase in 2001 being 330%, 262% in 2002, and 128% in both 2003 and 2004.
We now know that last October, the Government knew that the funds in the States Grants legislation then before Parliament were insufficient to provide for the number of new schools, and their large enrolments.
So what did this Government do?
Did it introduce an amendment to the legislation to try to ensure that, before any funds were actually paid out in establishment grants, the Parliament had appropriated the right amount of money?
No. It allowed a Bill which it knew was wrong to continue its passage through Parliament. And now the Government is trying to tell us that, because it has run out of money, because it failed to correct its own error last year, the Parliament must jump to attention, and deal with this Bill this week. Eight months after the Government knew of its mistake, it has the gall to tell the Senate that this Bill must be passed five days after it was introduced.
Labor's message to the Government is this: the Opposition has no intention of approving one extra cent of expenditure for non-government schools without a proportionate increase in funding for public education.
Secondly, the Senate Inquiry into this Bill suggests that a significant cause of the blowout in the cost of the establishment grant program is poor administration of the scheme. There are important questions to be answered before the Senate can give proper consideration to this legislation.
A significant element in this blowout is due to the Government and the Department neglecting their own guidelines and in the process artificially inflating the number of students at new non-government schools. We question whether any of the three schools (Christian College Institute of Secondary Education in Geelong, the Australian Islamic College in Kewdale, Perth and All Souls St Gabriels at Charters Towers, Queensland with a total of 1350 `new' students) cited by the Government as the principal reason for the massive increase in establishment grant funding do fall within the government's own guidelines.
The Government denies this concern. Their response is that “on the balance of evidence available at the time” they were accepted as new schools, that none of the schools are considered to have been formed from the separation, or the closure and re-opening, of an existing school. It is only possible to maintain their position if other evidence, that they either ignored or didn't bother to seek out, continues to be ignored.
Let me consider two examples, those of the Christian College Institute of Secondary Education, at Highton in Geelong and the Australian Islamic College at Kewdale in Perth, Western Australia.
The Government's opinion is based on the limited nature of the records that DETYA keeps. On the basis of that evidence they conclude that CCISE has a different ownership structure as the Christian College Highton, an adjunct school. They conveniently ignore three points: 
·	That the boards of the two schools are almost exactly identical, with evidence of co-ordination and collaboration. Only the limited nature of the information that DETYA cares to keep allows them to maintain the legal fiction that the two are separate,
·	CCISE is registered as an RTO for purposes of VET in schools. If they are so separate, how does one explain the fact that the postal address for CCISE as an RTO is C/- Christian College Highton!
·	In the preamble of the report of the Victorian Registered Schools Board on its visit to CCISE there is a specific mention of the intention of Christian College Highton establishing CCISE as a new senior campus. DETYA notes this fact, but prefers not to pursue it, noting instead that it does not appear to be a new school.
This reminds me of the saying - if it looks like a duck, waddles like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck!
But the wilful blindness and evasion of the Government is equally in evidence in the case of the Australian Islamic College. I refer them to the 2000 edition of the National Register of Independent Schools of Australia, page 46. Here the AIC is described, with its Head Office at Marmion Street, Booragoon with, AND I USE THEIR WORDS, campuses at Thornlie, Dianella and Kewdale. A campus at Kewdale! The school's own publicity makes this clear-
“The AIC has re-established the former Kewdale Senior High School site as co-educational operation with classes from years 1-12. The college has two other campuses...”
Campuses again! As I have said previously, the Government is either wilfully blind or intent on misleading us all. A new campus operation, by the government's own criteria, is ineligible for funding yet it persists with misrepresenting the facts.
Our concern does not lie with any of these schools or their registration, but with the sleight of hand in which this government is engaged. Although the Department couldn't be bothered to follow this up, even basic research reveals that these schools are either campuses of existing schools or is a pre-existing school re-established under a slightly altered name.
Two issues require greater scrutiny. To what extent has the Government ignored its own guidelines in this matter? Secondly, to what degree has DETYA engaged in expenditure beyond its appropriation as the result of sloppy administration?
Needless to say, there is not a cent extra in this Bill for government schools. Labor will not agree to it on those terms. We will be moving an amendment which calls for additional spending on government schools proportionate to the extra $12.9 million this Bill provides for non-government schools.
It is time for fairer treatment for public education from the Federal Government.
The Minister told us in a media release at the time of the Budget that the Government had a “commitment” to government schools. This is their chance to prove it.",SENATE,<title>INNOVATION AND EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,72,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2001-06-28,"—I seek leave to incorporate both my speech and that of my colleague Senator Stott Despoja on the Innovation and Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2001.
Leave granted.
The speeches read as follows—
Speech by Senator Allison
I rise to speak tonight about the Innovation and Education Amendment Bill 2001.
This omnibus bill seeks to amend the Higher Education Funding Act 1998, the Australian Research Council Act 2001 and the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 2000.
I will confine my comments to the provisions in this bill, which relate to the States Grants (Primary and Secondary) Assistance Act 2000. My colleague, Senator Natasha Stott-Despoja, will speak about those parts of the bill relating to higher education.
Amendments to the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 2000, contained in this bill provide for:
·	an additional $9.5 million for establishment assistance for new non-government schools;
·	an additional $2.5 million for students with disabilities; and
·	an additional $760,000 for strategic assistance for educationally disadvantaged students in non-government schools
over the 2001-2004 quadrennium.
The Democrats welcome the provision of additional funding for students with disabilities and educationally  disadvantaged students in non-government schools.
We are, however, very concerned about is the massive increase in funding for establishment grants for non-government schools. Up by a staggering 330% for 2001, 200% for 2002 and by more than 100% for 2003 and 2004.
The Government is getting very used to significantly increasing the funding to non-government schools at the expense of government schools and the Democrats are getting very used to fighting them on this.
And we are clearly have the support of the Australian public.
The Government and Opposition may well be interested in Australian Education Union polling in marginal seats, which found that 94% of voters thought that the Government should spend more money on public education.
 The Democrats were the only party to  oppose the iniquitous States Grants (Primary and Secondary Assistance) Bill 2000, when it was debated late last year. This Act awards an additional $700 million to the private schools over the next four years.
The Democrats opposed this bill because we are strongly committed to ensuring adequate resourcing of the public education system. We remain strongly opposed to the inequitable grants to non-government schools, particularly wealthy non-government schools, while public schools remain chronically under-funded.
There is simply no justification for providing already wealthy schools with even more public money, when government schools are starved of funds. I regularly visit government schools whose portables have been portables for so long that they are now considered permanent classrooms. You can't really say that they are portables when they have been in the same position for over 20 years.
And it needs to be understood (and the Opposition needs to be reminded) that it is not just the former Category 1 schools which are very well off. Penleigh and Essendon Grammar, a former Category 3 school in Victoria, which has a gymnasium, a swimming pool, an astro-turf hockey field, ovals, soccer grounds and squash courts was awarded an extra $3.39 million annually.
The annual fees of this school are approximately $8,900.
The Government claims that by providing more funding to such schools, they will lower their fees as a result. But there is no evidence to back this up. In fact evidence to the contrary was provided to the Committee.
One submission made reference to the survey of category 1 schools conducted by the Weekend Australian in June this year. The Australian spoke to all schools in this Category and found that only 8 out of the 59 said that any of that money would go to reducing fees.
It seems clear to me that Dr Kemp is on a mission. His mission is to get as many Australian students as possible into the private education sector.
The Australian Democrats, however, believe in public education. We believe in the benefits of being educated in the public realm. And we believe that the vast majority of public funds should be spent on the 70% of Australian students that belong to the public education system.
So, when the States Grants bill was debated last year, we put up amendments to remove provisions related to establishment grants for non-government schools but the Government and the Opposition voted against them.
We moved these amendments because the Democrats are opposed to the provision of establishment grants for non-government schools.
We believe that scarce public resources should not be spent on new non-government schools which have not been considered within the context of viability or need and which would be better spent on the severely underesourced public schools.
The Democrats argue that this extra money should be spent on government schools so that they are also able to attract more students to them.
But we note that $9.5 million is a drop in the ocean compared with what is really needed.
At this point I'd like to quote from the Association of Primary School Principal's report into the views of primary principals on the state of public education. This report examined the views of nearly 2,500 government primary school principals, who represent nearly 50%  of government principals in Australia. Collectively, these principals educate nearly a third of all Australian primary school children and hence what they have to say should be afforded great weight.
In relation to the condition of school facilities, the report stated that:
“Twenty -six per cent of principals indicated that their school facilities are badly in need of an upgrade. The largest group of principals, 57 per cent, indicated that their school facilities are adequate. The high rate at which problems with facilities were identified in handwritten statements, however, suggests that `adequate' may be a term that is applied fairly loosely.
The resource needs identified by respondents suggest that many school facilities, particularly old schools and those with high proportions of demountable buildings, have major design problems. Principals raised concerns about not being able to protect students from the sun, wind, rain or snow during Physical Education, school assemblies and when moving between buildings. The design problems associated with introducing computers into old classrooms are significant. More spacious and flexible learning areas are required in order to implement new outcomes-based curriculum frameworks and attain higher standards. And many schools lack an area where they can meet as a whole school, constraining the development of a sense of community.”
The Democrats are fully aware that the lack of appropriate facilities is just one of the myriad of problems facing public educators at the current time.
We say that at least another billion dollars should be allocated to our schools, so that public education is funded at a level which matches community expectations, whether parents can afford to pay fees or not.
In addition to the increasingly lop-sided balance of support between government and non-government schools, the Democrats are most concerned that automatic establishment payments to new non-government schools have far from adequate accountability requirements.
The Committee heard that there are:
No requirements along the lines of minimum enrolment size. There is no explicit or special accountability or reporting requirements attached to that; in fact, the funds do not even have to be accounted for separately. It is, in fact, a rather profligate use and an unaccountable use of the public's money - not the federal government's money.
The Democrats note that the establishment grants can be spent on marketing, advertising or even corporate ventures.
A new private school, may choose to do what Mentone Boys Grammar in Melbourne has done and advertise for new students at prime time on Melbourne radio.
The Democrats are also concerned that the inadequacy of the criteria could lead to the proliferation of poorly planned schools which are not economically viable. This would be poor allocation of scarce resources, and something which is unparalleled in any other sector. For example, if a group of people decide that they want to start up a new community health centre, they don't just simply receive public money as soon as they open their doors.
Our concerns extend to the lack of any cap on the per capita grants of $500 in the first year and $250 in the second, which together with the lack of stringent accountability mechanisms means that the grants could be easily manipulated to maximise the benefit.
In response to questioning about these accountability requirements, the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs advised the Committee that there is nothing to stop a school from selling off the school buildings and the site and moving to another site with a new registration number and the same students.
Clearly, this is not a desirable situation and in no way could be considered an appropriate use of public money.
The evidence presented to the Committee about the circumstances surrounding the provision of establishment grants to Christian College, Highton in particular, deserve further investigation. This school received an establishment grant when it was operating at the same address and with the same board of directors as an existing school. When a situation like this arises, you have to question the degree of analysis brought to bear on evaluating the legitimacy of claims for automatic payment of establishment grants.
As I stand here today, I note that we are clearly not alone in our concerns.
 In their submission to the Senate inquiry, the Independent Education Union (IEU) recommended that:
The Commonwealth request that MCEETYA, together with non government schooling authorities, broker a common set of guidelines or a co-operative national framework for a nationally consistent approach to the planning, renewal, funding and operation of new and existing government and non government schools.
The IEU further recommended that in the absence of a planning and regulatory regime for the establishment of new non-government schools, that the proposed legislation should be amended to provide for clear guidelines as to the purpose of the grants and rigorous accountability and reporting requirements.
In the view of the Democrats, this is the very least the Government should do.
Before I finish today, I want to make a few brief remarks about the inclusion of these schools provisions in this omnibus bill.
It is more than curious to me that these amendments were included in this bill, when a bill amending the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Assistance) Act 2000, was introduced on June 7, particularly given the 
government's great reluctance to split the bill. We will support the oppositions amendment on schools however we will not be supporting the bill.
—————
Speech by Senator Stott Despoja
The Innovation and Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2001 is an omnibus bill which implements a number of changes announced in the Government's Innovation Statement - Backing Australia's Ability:
·	additional funding to the ARC,
·	additional research infrastructure funding,
·	2000 new undergraduate places for IT, science and mathematics, and
·	the Postgraduate Education Loans Scheme (PELS).
In addition, the Bill adjusts increases funding to non-government school students with disabilities and appropriates an additional $10 million to reflect a significant increase in the average size of new non-government schools in 2000.
The Democrats believe the Innovation and Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2001 Bill should not be passed in its current form. While most of the measures in the Bill are not opposed by the Democrats - the postgraduate loans scheme and the increased appropriation for new schools - are not supported by the Democrats.
This contributes to our reason for supporting the Oppositions desire to split the Bill three ways.
My colleague, Senator Allison will speak to the changes in the States Grants so I will be confining my comments to the changes to the ARC Act and the Higher Education Funding Act.
ARC & Research Infrastructure In Backing Australia's Ability, the Government announced a funding package of $2.9 billion for R&D and Innovation over 5 years. While the Government's backflip to increase investment was welcome it needs to be emphasised that this simply slows down Australia's decline in R&D investment relative to other OECD countries.
Moreover, only $159 million of this package - 5.5% - will actually be made available in 2002. The massive `back-ending' of the increase is a major disappointment and does not sit well with the Government's rhetoric on investing in Australia's future prosperity.
One initiative of Backing Australia's Ability that was widely welcomed was the decision to double the funding of the ARC over five years. This Bill introduces the first stage of the increase - $18.6 million in 2002.
While better than nothing - a Government that took international realities and the urgent needs of Australia's researchers and our research capability seriously - would not be so timid. While the Democrats support this increase we urge the Government to reconsider its priorities and `front-load' its intention to double the budget of the ARC.
The Chief Scientist made it very clear that infrastructure spending represents about 40 cents in the competitive research dollar invested in the USA and other OECD countries. However, despite the modest increase to infrastructure funding in this Bill, our investment in research infrastructure remains at a very uncompetitive 20 cents in the dollar. So much for this Government's commitment to our future.
PELS
The Postgraduate Education Loans Scheme (PELS) is the Government's response to market failure in domestic postgraduate coursework.
At is important to understand that this failure comes about because of poor policy by successive Governments and in particular the current Government who have removed 25,000 funded places from postgraduate education. That is - it is a failure largely of this Government's own making.
The key characteristics of the market failure in domestic postgraduate coursework are; evidence that the high cost of fees and removal of HECS places are major barriers to participation in postgraduate coursework from equity groups, declining enrolments from domestic postgraduate students (down more than 12% between 1997 - 2000), and alarming drops in enrolments in particular disciplinary fields, notably science 21.5%, education 21% and agriculture 27%. Indeed, between 1997 and 2000 only Maths and Computing had any growth because of the increase in IT enrolments - all the other disciplinary fields declined. Even Business, Administration and Management fell significantly last year.
It is precisely this scenario that PELS is supposed to address.
In its own terms, PELS it is quite a clever proposal that will enable some students who are currently unable to access postgraduate courses the opportunity to do so.
However, the Democrats are obliged to look at the broader policy context and while superficially PELS is `better than nothing', we cannot support its implementation in the seriously defective policy and funding regime this Government has imposed on education.
The Democrats are opposed to the marketisation of education and believe the sorry state of postgraduate coursework is a salutary reminder of the limitations and distortions of marketisation.
Our primary concerns with PELS are;
·	It is premised on postgraduate education being solely a private benefit for the student,
·	it avoids the real problem of insufficient funded places, and
·	it cannot overcome the substantial cost differentials between disciplines.
PELS is conceptually quite different from HECS. While both are income contingent loans, HECS is a private contribution to a publicly funded place. This explicitly recognises that there is a considerable public benefit from higher education. PELS, on the other hand, simply advances the full cost of tuition and thus either assumes a private benefit only or refuses to make a public contribution to the public benefit.
Full fees, in conjunction with a substantial drop of HECS places, has led to declining numbers of students in disciplines with little or no private benefit such as education, social welfare, nursing, sustainable agriculture and science. Yet there is considerable public benefit in having graduates with postgraduate skills and knowledge in terms of better teachers, nurses and agriculturists. We are not at all convinced that students in such disciplines are likely to enrol just because they can get a loan to cover up-front fees.
In 2000, there were 409,560 full-time equivalent, fully funded places. Of these 365,920 was the minimum undergraduate target load and 21,498 were HECS-exempt postgraduate research places. This left a notional 22,142 places for postgraduate coursework students.
Universities, allocated 3,000 places to postgraduate research students - the so-called gap places - and 14,663 to postgraduate coursework students. This means nearly 5,000 notional postgraduate coursework student places were not used for postgraduates but rather were used by universities to help ameliorate the unmet demand in undergraduate places.
Universities are fully entitled to use these places how they see fit, but it does highlight one of the real issues affecting universities and postgraduates in particular insufficient places due to poor policy. Indeed HECS places for postgraduate coursework students have dropped precipitously from 30,400 in 1996 to 14,600 in 2000. In the same period fee-paying increased from 13,300 to 24,500 - it is this massive cost-shifting to students that has caused the decline in student load.
Universities are still required to offer a HECS place for initial vocational entry qualifications in education and nursing -although not in specialist courses such as midwifery or TESOL - Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages.
However, there is a serious anomaly whereby an increasing number of vocations including psychology, social welfare, museum studies and librarianship are requiring a postgraduate qualification for initial vocational entry. `Credentialism' combined with inadequate HECS places raises major access concerns with or without a loan.
The Democrats are particularly concerned by a particularly serious distortion in reliance on markets for education.
In the early 1990s, the then ALP government introduced the Relative Funding Model (RFM). This weighted the funding that went to different disciplines precisely because it was recognised that disciplines have different delivery costs. So science, engineering, medicine are weighted much higher than education, law and humanities.
Whether the cost relativities in the RFM are, or indeed were, ever a good indicator is of course, another matter.
Differential HECS works on a similar basis although the inclusion of law in the top band is predicated on potential private benefit.
The Democrats are concerned that as PELS does not and cannot take cost of delivery into account as it simply relies on markets.
This will create enormous problems in high cost areas with significant industry and/or public benefit but comparatively low private benefit, for example, engineering and science.
The Government has made it very clear it expects universities to offer fee-paying courses on a full-cost recovery basis. The Democrats acknowledge there may be good reasons for wanting to prevent public funds substantially subsidising an MBA or IT student who is likely to receive considerable private benefit.
However, there must be public investment into high cost areas where there are substantial public and industry benefits such as science and engineering by either, or preferably a mixture of;
·	permitting cross-subsidies,
·	increased provision of funded places,
·	and supplementation to universities for PELS places in high cost and/or high public good areas.
The Democrats are aware of an opposition amendment to establish a review process of PELS. I would like to see that review also focus on the consequence of fee-paying and the operation of PELS on strategic areas including science and education are an explicit term of reference of any reviews.
Without a more sophisticated policy mix, which takes account of significant cost differentials for course delivery -students in key strategic areas will necessarily be discriminated against.
The Democrats find it utterly bizarre that within the same Bill the Government proposes to introduce 2000 new funded places to address the skills shortage in science, maths and IT. But in the very same Bill it proposes a measure that will ensure that science remains unattractive for postgraduates.
It is truly indicative of the poverty of this Government's policy commitments to education and innovation.
If the Government comes back with a better approach to postgraduate education, which includes additional funded places and other mechanisms to overcome the distortions from simple-minded commitments to markets in education -then the Democrats would be more than happy to revisit our principled rejection of PELS.
As Senators will be aware, this Bill was subject to a brief - and far from satisfactory inquiry process. Before commenting on the Government's poor process I do want to touch on a number of issues raised in the inquiry process.
The committee heard evidence that the proposal to allow a Minister the capacity to cap student debt represented an important change to HECS policy that had not been discussed or justified. I think it is important to note that there was widespread consensus in the sector on the need to separate debt incurred from PELS and debt incurred from HECS such that a cap could not be applied to HECS. Indeed, we had recommendations to that effect coming from student groups, the National Tertiary Education Union and the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee - a broad church by any definition.
In addition, there is considerable concern that PELS represents the `thin edge of the wedge' for dismantling HECS and moving to a PELS environment in undergraduate education. There is already a precedent for expanding student loan arrangements into other areas as one of this years' budget measures was to effectively introduced PELS for overseas trained professionals enrolled in previously funded bridging programs to meet Australia's recognition requirements.
While there is a substantial difference between administrative arrangements for handling HECS and PELS debt and legislation to dismantle HECS, the Democrats do believe that on balance there is a very good case for quarantining HECS. Accordingly, the Democrats take a principled position on this issue and support the splitting of HECS and PELS.
The AV-CC recommended that Bond University be made eligible for PELS. As PELS represents a significant public subsidy to students - though not institutions - through an interest free loan, the Democrats do not support expanding PELS to private universities. As the AV-CC pointed out, this does leave an anomalous situation whereby students at other institutions including Australia's other private university, Notre Dame, are able to access PELS but students of Bond are not.
The Democrats believe it was an inappropriate decision to place Notre Dame on List A of the Higher Education Funding Act in 1998 - and it is disappointing that the opposition did not appreciate the significance of the Minister's sleight of hand at that time.
The Democrats accept there may be good contingent reasons to allow public funds going to private universities if there is an absence of public provision - as was the case with Notre Dame's teacher training programs in the Kimberley.
However, this should only justify inclusion on List B.
The Democrats take the AVCC's point about Notre Dame and Bond - however it is not good policy to use a poor decision as precedent for another poor decision. Accordingly, we do not support students at Bond University accessing PELS. Moreover, I want to put on the record that the Democrats believe it is time to revisit the status of private universities on the HEFA lists.
To conclude, I want to place on the record our view on some of the process issues that Senator Carr has lightly touched upon.
The Democrats note with much concern that the Government chose not to defend their legislation by putting a submission before the Senate inquiry. We also' note that the Department did not provide requested information in a timely fashion to the committee.
This is very poor practice and must be considered a contempt of this House.
The Democrats take our responsibilities as legislators very seriously and believe that we, and more generally, this Chamber would be abrogating community expectations if we do not consider legislation that has very important implications for the policy and funding of education closely.
Not only has the sorry example of what has occurred with this Bill undermine our legislative responsibility it totally undermines the various assertions about the urgency of this Bill.
—I indicate that the Democrats will be supporting the ALP amendments but we will be voting against this bill in whatever form it ends up.",SENATE,<title>INNOVATION AND EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,72,1,speech
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2001-06-28,"—I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard my remarks on the Innovation and Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2001.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
I rise to speak on the Innovation and Legislation Amendment Bill 2001, which put into effect many of the provisions announced in the Prime Minister's Innovation Statement earlier this year.
The Innovation Statement, and those parts of it that will be legislated through this Bill, does not provide a proper, forthright answer to the challenge being made to Australia in terms of our international competitiveness.
Rather, it is a slow and belated response.
Those parts of this Bill relating to the Innovation Statement merely put back what's already been taken out. Like most of the things this Government does, the government's new innovation program lacks vision and direction.
But what this Bill lacks in vision and direction, it makes up in trickiness. Once again we've seen the government engage in all sorts of shenanigans to ensure that they trick, or even blackmail, members of the Senate into quietly supporting some of the mean legislation that they put before us.
It is unprecedented in the history of this parliament that a Bill containing provisions for the funding of universities has been tied in with provisions for schools funding.
And the only reason it's never been done before is because we've never had a government so willing to pull swifties like this and so willing to misuse the processes of this parliament to get their legislative agenda through.
Last year the Minister for Education rammed through his unconscionable schools funding bill by tying the changes that saw the nation's 58 most wealthiest schools get millions extra to funding for every school in Australia.
And now we're told there's a need for an extra $10 million for non-government schools that wasn't accounted for in the original Bill from last year. And once again, the Minister for Education has sought to avoid any scrutiny over the lack of funding he provides for public schools by ramming it through and holding the Senate to ransom - pass my Bill to give more money to non-Government schools, or else universities and R & D won't get any money, he says.
Labor will, as my colleagues have already indicated, support any increase for much needed funding for universities and research, and will support any extra funding made available for schools.
What we will insist on, however, is that any extra funding made available for private schools be matched by an increase in funds for public schools. That is the fair way to do it, and our amendments will be insisting on that.
Innovation
But first let me turn to those parts of the Bill that implement the Prime Minister's Innovation Statement made earlier this year.
The importance of proper investment in education and investment is relatively undisputed. Few would argue with the fact that significant investment in education and innovation is fundamental to not only expanding Australia's export base, but also to attracting foreign investment, and thus for creating quality, skilled employment for Australians and high living standards.
Productivity, our ability to entice the world's best companies to invest in Australia, and our ability to sell our products to the world are the key elements to our future prosperity.
That is why the current Government's dramatic failure to pursue policies that facilitate innovation and create a skilled workforce is so alarming.
Australia under the Howard Government is one of the few OECD nations whose investment in research and development has actually declined as a percentage of GDP in recent years.
In 1996, Australia spent around 1.65% of its national income on research and development. Under this Government, we've fallen to about 1.4%. Had it not been for the innovation statement and the provisions contained within this Bill, our level of investment was predicted to decline to about 1.2%.
What this basically means is that this Bill and the Prime Minister's Innovation Statement only go some of the way to putting back what the Government has already taken out.
Even after the Innovation Statement, Australia is still short changed when it comes to education and R & D investment.
The Government has cut a total $3 billion from the Commonwealth's investment in universities and $2 billion from Research and Development, and the Innovation Statement will, over several years, only put back around $3 billion into education and research.
My concerns with the Innovation Statement and this whole package, however, go much deeper than the mere figures.
It is the fundamental nature and character of the sort of investment that's being planned that concerns me. I think the essential problem is that a lot of this package is about, as I have said earlier, merely restoring funding.
It's a package that fills in gaps and puts in what should've been there in the first place. It's a backwards-looking program that isn't concerned with the need to broaden our export base nor the need to attract foreign investment.
In fact, it doesn't really seem to have any aims other than to restore funding.
Numerous commentators outside of this parliament have thus been very critical of the package. Paul Kelly, whom we all know as not only a well renowned journalist, but as a respected and knowledgeable public affairs writer, has said that “The paradox of the innovation statement was its old-fashioned character - government handouts for special interests and tax breaks for business.”
Even writers in publications like the Business Review Weekly, which is not known for its support of the non-conservative cause, have remarked, and I'm quoting from an article by T Stotnicki written in BRW in February this year, “that it was largely the Howard Government's 1996 cut-back in the R & D concession, and the subsequent drop in private sector R & D, that created the need for this innovation package.”
A large criticism that has come from many quarters, for example from John Schubert, the President of the Business Council of Australia is that the package does not do enough to encourage private sector investment in research.
Australia's current level of private sector investment in research and development is only at 0.67% of GDP, which is the seventh lowest in the OECD. Business is not seeing the benefits of investing in innovation, and is receiving very little assistance or incentive from the government to do so.
The Government's answer in this package is merely to restore the R & D tax concession. There is no extension or development of this policy, which was established years ago under the Hawke Government. The Innovation Statement thus only goes some of the way to increasing Australia's private sector investment in innovation.
The package is, broadly speaking, directionless. It has no targets or aims for building export industry, no targets or aims for creating jobs, no targets or aims for attracting foreign investment, and no targets or aims for encouraging business to put more into R & D, and more importantly, no targets or aims for helping business to make capital returns on innovation and R & D.
The Government has identified a political problem in terms of the public's well-founded perception of it being anti-education and anti-innovation. It has responded to this by throwing money in areas in familiar territory - grants and tax breaks, coupled with little to no strategic direction.
The package is funding for funding's sake. The Innovation Statement was a purely politically motivated reaction from the Prime Minister to the huge electoral defeats he suffered earlier this year.
It is not a serious package for investing in Australia's future.
Schools Component
The other missing element from this Bill is any effort from this Government to ensure equal access to opportunities in a globally competitive Australia.
Proper investment in education is not only an underlying tenet of achieving the goals of expanding our export base, attracting foreign investment and creating quality, skills-based jobs.
It also trains people and gives them the skills and hence opportunity to have access to highly skilled and well-paid employment.
Investment in education and research and development will arm Australia in the international battlefield of global competitiveness.
For individuals, the arms required to take part in the battle for skilled and well paid employment is a good and decent education.
It is the responsibility of Government, if it aims to facilitate equality of opportunity, to ensure that all its citizens have proper access these arms.
Everyone should equally have the right to access decent education to enable access to highly skilled and well-paid jobs.
That is why those of us in the Labor Party were so thoroughly outraged by the Government's schools funding Bill that came before us at the end of last year.
It was deeply wrong and drastically unfair to give millions of dollars to the nation's richest schools, schools like the King's School at Parramatta that have rifle ranges and swimming pools and the rest of it, and then give virtually no increase to poorer non-government and government schools.
And now tied into this Innovation Bill is another $ 10 million for private schools that the Minister for Education tells us he simply failed to include in the Schools Funding Bill we were forced to pass last year.
As my colleagues and I have already stated, Labor's position is that we will move amendments to make sure that this extra funding being made available to private schools is to be matched by extra funding for the public system.
This is the first time in the history of this parliament that a Bill has simultaneously dealt with funding for universities and schools, as I have indicated earlier.
Once again, the Minister knows how inequitable his proposals for schools funding are, but is nevertheless determined to ram through his agenda, and will go to any lengths to force the Senate to pass his inequitable funding proposals.
Senators will remember the way many of us here were given an ultimatum by the Minister late last year - pass my Bill or else every school in Australia gets no funding.
And now it appears we are being given a similar ultimatum here tonight - pass my Bill or else Australia's investment in education and research will continue to decline. Pass my bill or else we won't increase Australia's global competitiveness. Pass my Bill or else we won't create jobs for the future.
Labor will be supporting this Bill to the extent that it returns some of the funding the Government has cut from education and research and development funding.
It is my belief though that if this Government, or even a future Labor Government is serious about strengthening Australia's global competitiveness or creating quality, well-paid, highly-skilled jobs for the future, then we need to change the way we look at innovation strategy.
It is also my belief that the opportunities to fully participate in a globally competitive Australia should be available to all. High quality education should therefore be made available equally to all Australians, not just the very rich.
I commend the Bill with amendments.",SENATE,<title>INNOVATION AND EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,72,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2001-06-28,"—Given the hour, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard my remarks on the Innovation and Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2001.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
The Innovation and Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2001
·	amends the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 and the Australian Research Council Act 2001 to provide additional funding and introduce a loan scheme for postgraduate coursework students, as announced in the Innovation Action Plan and
·	amends the States grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 2000 to provide additional funding for establishment assistance for non-government school ($9.5 million) and an extra $2.7 million for students with disabilities in non-government schools and
·	allows universities more flexibility regarding electronic communications
This legislation supports the words of Shane Stone and is a clear sign that this is a mean and tricky government. The Government has sought through this Bill to bring together in one package, for the first time in many many years, omnibus legislation relating to higher education and research, on the one hand, and on the other a series of amendments to school funding provisions, contained in the States grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 2000.
The bill before the Senate implements some of the measures from the innovation statement. While the government might be seeking to brag about the announcements that were made in the innovation statement, then this needs to be done in the context of the government's performance since it was elected in 1996.
Under this Government, Commonwealth funding for universities has fallen every year, from $4.8 billion in 1996 to $4.2 billion by 2002, projected in the forward estimates. This adds up to a reduction of $3 billion being taken from the Commonwealth's investment in universities. When you add to this a $2 billion reduction in government support for research and development, we have had a total of $5 billion cut by this government from investment in university education and from government support for research and development.
A close examination of the table released by the Prime Minister when he launched the innovation statement, it is quite clear that the government has backloaded the funding in the innovation statement.
In the year 2001-02 the Prime Minister's announcements involve a commitment of extra funding of $159 million; in 2002-03 it is a commitment of $414 million; in 2003-04 it is $619 million; in 2004-05 it is $758 million; and in the last year, 2005-06, it is $947 million. So basically almost 60 per cent of the funding announced by the Prime Minister in January is backloaded into the last two years of the five-year innovation statement.
In other words, almost half of the extra funding announced by the Prime Minister in January this year is not going to be spent until two elections away.
The reality is that last year the number of Australian undergraduate students at our universities fell by more than 3,000. While the extra funding for research is welcome, it does not change the fact that we have had a reduction of almost 3,500 in the number of research training places at Australia's universities.
One of the announcements made in the innovation statement was the commitment to introduce the Postgraduate Education Loans Scheme, or PELS, and it comes after a major reduction in HECS places for postgraduate course work.
The number of Commonwealth funded postgraduate course work places is estimated to have fallen by around 60 per cent since 1996. To the extent that the new PELS system helps this situation, in giving more Australians access to postgraduate study, Labor will support it. However, we do recognise that it does have the potential to act as a pilot for the full deregulation of undergraduate university fees as outlined in the leaked cabinet submission from October 1999 of the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Dr Kemp.
The Labor Party categorically opposes the deregulation of undergraduate university fees at some or all universities and also opposes the replacement of HECS with a real interest rate loan system. We are also committed to phasing out full cost up-front fees for Australian undergraduate students.
With the introduction of PELS, the new Postgraduate Education Loans Scheme, we also recognise the possibility of some universities seeking to put up their fees unreasonably. We have some concerns about the mechanism that the government envisages to deal with this-that is, giving the minister the power to set a limit on how much students can borrow under the combined HECS and PELS.
We have two concerns about this. The first is that it is common knowledge that the children of wealthy parents are more likely to have their university fees paid for by their parents each year. If you make an up-front payment for the university fees, you get a 25 per cent discount on that HECS fee. The parents of students from struggling families cannot afford to make that university fee payment on their behalf. That means that, at the end of an undergraduate degree, the students that have zero HECS debt are more likely to be the students that come from wealthy families. That is one reason why we are concerned about putting a ceiling on the combined HECS and PELS debts.
The second reason is that, because of the changes that this government made to HECS in 1996, students end up with very different HECS debts depending on which course they have enrolled in. Not only did the government increase HECS charges in 1996 by up to 125 per cent but also we now have three different bands.
The second part of this Bill deals with a number of school funding issues. Last year's states grants legislation allocated $859,000 in the calendar year 2001 for establishment grants and $1.2 million per annum in each of the following years. This bill seeks to increase those amounts by very significant quantities. For example, in 2001 the increase is 330 per cent-that is, a total of $3.7 million. In 2002 it is up 262 per cent-an increase of $4.7 million. In 2003 it is up 128 per cent to $1.65 million. In 2004 it is up 128 per cent again to $1.65 million. The total increase is almost $10 million.
The Labor Party has been accused of holding up education in the Senate during the last few days. This is misleading, mischievous and is simple a question of this Government being inefficient when it comes to dealing with its legislation program.
What needs to be ask is when did the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs know that he needed to provide an extra $10 million for these establishment grants for non-government schools?
This is an issue that came up in the Senate committee that dealt with this issue last week and which reported in the Senate later this week.
We now know from the evidence last week that the department knew last October that an extra $10 million was needed to fund the schools that David Kemp claims that he is so concerned about.
But the department claims that they did not let the minister know about this or make this decision because they did not want David Kemp to actually exercise the responsibilities of being the Commonwealth Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs. We now have a position where the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs decides whether they will tell their minister that there is a $10 million hole in the funding for new non-government schools.
When a bill is required to fix up the problem the minister for education puts out a press release saying that it is the Labor Party's fault that he did not take action last October because his department did not tell him about a $10 million hole.
So the delay in the passage of the innovation rests entirely with David Kemp.
If the passage of this Bill is so important then:
·	why was it first debated in the House of Representatives on only the 7th June,
·	Why is it inappropriately link universities and schools measures but this Government refuses to split the Bill,
·	Why are not sufficient increases for public schools to match the latest round of schools funding increases for private schools and
·	why wasn't the $10 million for private schools not included in last year's schools' bill when he was told about the error last October?
Why are the people of this country subject to a Minister that cannot administer his department and is not aware of what is happening with the funding situation of our schools sector.
So if anything could be described as mean and tricky-using the Shane Stone language again-it is this minister's attempts to claim that the Labor Party in some way is responsible for any potential delay in funding for these schools.
The Labor Party has stated our position many times, which is, we are not against extra funding for non-government schools. Last year we supported the extra funding that was provided to needy non-government schools.
But what we support is fair funding for all of our schools. That means that, having provided massive increases to the non-government schools sector what is missing is the balancing increase in funding for government schools.
There are amendments before the Senate that will increase funding for government schools by an extra $30 million to balance the $10 million that the Government is proposing in this legislation for non-government schools. Our amendments seek to provide an extra $30 million in capital works funding for government schools across the country.
Certain sectors of education in this country under this Government have been severely disadvantaged.
We have a situation where King's and Geelong Grammar have had their $1 million a year increases by 2004.1 but the local Catholic schools have got only about $60,000 per school and the local public school has got only $4,000 per year out of this government.
The Government has sought to bestow massive increases in establishment grants for new private schools, only months after striking the levels of the allocations in the 2000 State Grants Act. While these grants amount to a very small part of the total recurrent allocations for schools provided by the Commonwealth, this consideration of itself does not justify allowing the funds to be increased, nor does it provide a rationale for the lack of rigorous accountability and eligibility requirements applying to the program.
So this Government and in particular this Minister has got to answer two questions. Why did he get it wrong by a factor of three? Why did he get it wrong when he sat down and tried to calculate how much extra money was needed for the non-government schools? Was it incompetence? Was it a deliberate attempt by this minister to cover up the fact that he is providing very significant increases in establishment grants for non-government schools? If he did find out about it before the legislation passed through both houses last year, why did he not fix it last year? Why did he not fix it when he or his office were first informed that there was a $10 million hole in funding for these new non-government schools?
There is no link between the university and school elements of these Bills and the Parliamentary Library can find no precedent for a Bill, which includes new funding for both schools and universities.
The Labor believes that this Bill should be redrafted to provide for an additional $30 million in capital works grants to be provided to government schools, to match the extra funding being provided for establishment grants to non-government schools; improved accountability arrangements to apply to the use of establishment grants; and the Minister's power to determine a maximum permitted student debt to be limited to only those amounts borrowed under the Postgraduate Education Loan Scheme.
There are no reasons why this Government cannot excise the section of the Bill containing school establishment grants. They won't do it because they want to sneak through the extra money for private schools. Despite what Mr Gallagher, the head of the Department's higher education division says about the impact on research and development, this Bill could be passed in August with no adverse affects on Universities or students.
This is the best example of a mean and tricky government. It highlights a government that is not concerned about the state of public education in this country, but is willing to blame anyone else for this mess in the funding arrangements but itself. This Bill should be split and dealt with accordingly and at the same time the public and private sectors of our education industry should be funded fairly and equitably.",SENATE,<title>INNOVATION AND EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,72,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2001-06-28,"—I thank senators for their contributions on the Innovation and Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2001. It is best left for the government to make its remarks when we have the debate on the motion to split this bill, which will be shortly conducted.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Bill read a second time.
Motion (by Senator Carr) proposed:
That it be an instruction to the committee of the whole that:
	(a)	the committee divide the Innovation and Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2001 (the parent bill) into three separate bills as follows:
	(i)	a bill dealing with extra funding for research and higher education, comprising clauses 1 to 3 and Schedule 1 of the parent bill,
	(ii)	a bill dealing with extra funding for primary and secondary education, comprising Schedule 2 of the parent bill, and
	(iii)	a bill dealing with the postgraduate education loan scheme, limits on student debts to the Commonwealth and electronic communications with students, comprising Schedules 3, 4 and 5 of the parent bill; and
	(b)	the committee amend the title of the first bill and add enacting words and provisions for titles and commencement to the second and third bills.",SENATE,<title>INNOVATION AND EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,72,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2001-06-28,"—The government opposes this motion. I think it is perhaps best if, in addressing this motion, I cover aspects which could be dealt with in the committee stage as well, because I do not want to repeat the government's position on this. Suffice to say that, as Senator Carr as outlined, this is a bill which the opposition is seeking to split into three; and this is an unusual practice, to say the least. We have in this bill an initiative by the government which deals with extra funding for higher education—a postgraduate education loans scheme which will provide some 245,000 students per year with an ability to take up loans to advance themselves in further education, and the extent of those loans would be to the tune of $995-odd million.
The third part deals with funding amounts listed in the states grants acts—that deals with primary and secondary education assistance—and also deals with small increases in Commonwealth assistance for non-government students with disabilities. The bill increases amounts appropriated for establishment grants for new non-government schools in 2001-04. It deals with an increase from $4.7 million to $14.2 million. So we have here very worthwhile initiatives in the form of one bill.
Omnibus bills are not unusual. In fact, in 1995, the previous Labor government brought forward six omnibus bills. There is nothing untoward or unusual in such a bill having these three aspects to it. The opposition is taking premeditated action designed to kill off this legislation if the bill is split. Those listening to this debate should be aware that, on the two occasions that the Senate acted to divide bills which had originated in the House of Representatives, the practical effect was to kill off the legislation, and I refer to health legislation under the previous Labor government in 1995 and a health bill under this government last year.
Like previous governments, we are not willing to establish a precedent whereby a hostile Senate can cherry pick the government's legislative program; that is, the government puts up a program, a package of initiatives, and it is then picked off one by one by splitting the bill. The established rules and practices of the Senate provide ample opportunity for consideration and amendment of bills which are brought before the Senate. Opposition senators should be using the normal procedures in amending the bill instead of using this device of splitting the bill to seek to avoid the consequences of their actions in defeating this legislation. In taking this action, opposition senators are rejecting this bill and rejecting every item in it, and no sophistry on their part will change that fact.
Although there is a provision in the Senate for a bill to be split, it is not an exercise that has been embarked upon freely. Indeed, the record shows that this would be only the third time that a bill originating in the House of Representatives has been split. In his letter dated 28 June this year to the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, the Clerk of the House of Representatives advises:
House of Representatives Practice indicates that the action is highly undesirable, as `the established rules and practices of the Houses provide ample opportunity for the consideration and amendment of bills by each House'. In short, this motion will have the effect of killing the bill and the government will have to reintroduce it in the spring sittings.
I have to place that on record because of the highly unusual approach that the opposition has embarked upon in this matter. We have an omnibus bill. There is nothing untoward about it. But we have an opposition which, rather than reject the legislation and take the consequences for that action, seeks to split the bill, which it knows will kill the legislation. The implications that will be suffered as a result of this splitting of the bill are that, in relation to the amendments to the states grants act which I referred to earlier, there will be delays in some schools being paid the 50 per cent advance establishment grant entitlement. It is estimated that the establishment grant entitlement for the five applications that have been approved for general recurrent funding total just over $240,000, or $131,000 in excess of the remaining allocation of $109,000. We have a delay in funding for five applications from schools, and this involves some 967 students.
But there would also be implications of further delay if this bill were not passed in time for the October payment. That would result in delays in making the payment of the remaining 50 per cent entitlement. On current numbers, that would mean delaying payments for some 54 schools, involving nearly 4,000 students. So a further delay would have a wider impact. Furthermore, if the number of new school applications remained consistent with that of previous years, there could be around 20 new school applications still to be submitted which will not receive any entitlement for 2001. Depending on the number of new schools and their enrolments at the 2001 school census day, schools could be denied funding of between $1 million and $2 million.
If the bill were not passed at all, the implications would be more severe, as these schools would receive no payments this year. Failure to pass the bill would also lead to difficulties with payments in future years. This could affect the funding of new non-government schools across Australia, including Catholic schools, an indigenous school in the Kimberley in my home state, Lutheran schools, Montessori and Steiner schools, Jewish day schools and Islamic schools. The opposition should be ashamed of holding up payment to these schools. The Democrats should also be ashamed if they join in the opposition ruse to thwart this legislation.
If the bill is split and not passed by 30 June 2001, there will also be significant resource implications in relation to non-government schools educating students with disabilities. In particular, Catholic and independent schools who have students with disabilities will not be able to receive payment for their full strategic assistance entitlement of $561 for each student with a disability. There will be a shortfall of $34 per student until the bill is passed.
There will also be implications for the Postgraduate Education Loan Scheme. I point in particular to those adjustments which need to be made in order to accommodate this scheme. Universities have software provided by outside companies, and most of these companies will not make changes to these computer systems until the legislation is passed. The consequence of a delay is that institutions may not have the required forms which are designed to collect data relevant to universities', DETYA's and the ATO's requirements. If the system is not operational in time, institutions may have to use supplementary forms and input the data into their information systems at a later date, which may lead to errors. Legislative certainty means that institutions will be able to get this work under way.
There are also problems in relation to course planning. During discussions, institutional staff indicated they needed lead time to plan which courses will be subject to the Post Education Loans Scheme, and to consider potential student numbers and consequently appropriate staffing levels resulting from increases in enrolment. There are also communication products which are essential to administering the Post Education Loans Scheme. Institutions require information booklets and forms provided by the department to assist students with applying for the loan service facility. This delay will cause a good many students to be disadvantaged in relation to this Post Education Loans Scheme. I mentioned some 240,000 students that have the prospect of enjoying this initiative, which runs to the tune of in excess of $900 million worth of loans.
The opposition cannot hide behind the fact that by splitting this bill they are casting the onus back onto government to take action to have the legislation passed, because they are really using this ruse in effect to kill the legislation. That is what it will do. The opposition has spoken about amendments which we are yet to have details on. There has been a good deal of contact between the office of the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs and the opposition. We are yet to have details of any amendments that might be forthcoming. Suffice it to say that the splitting of this bill is a thoroughly undesirable practice. It is designed to kill the legislation and it will delay, if not—even worse—avoid funding for those essential purposes that I have indicated. There can be no other description of it than that the opposition are intent upon thwarting these good initiatives by the government. We will oppose vehemently the splitting of this bill, but if when we get to the committee stage the bill is split, the minister has indicated that he will introduce legislation in the spring sittings in an attempt to make the best of a bad situation brought about by the opposition.",SENATE,<title>INNOVATION AND EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,72,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2001-06-28,"—I was seeking the call before. I asked a question, but perhaps I was a bit too slow. The minister jumped, and that is fair enough because from what the minister said we now know what the government's position is on these matters. Firstly, those amendments have been circulated, so they should be available to the government.
—Just now.
—I understand that they were distributed earlier this evening, Minister. I turn, in responding to the minister's statement, to the rights of the Senate and the appropriateness of the action being proposed here tonight by the Labor Party in regard to splitting this bill. The minister has said tonight that this is a position that the government basically disagrees with. He does not say it is not in the standing orders, because quite clearly the Senate standing orders have always included provisions for bills to be divided on the instructions of the committee of the whole.
That is the established practice in this chamber. That has been the established practice because over a very long time governments have attempted to incorporate within a particular piece of legislation different measures, some of which are good, some of which are bad, some of which affect the operations of departments and some of which go to other policy issues that are not quite as likely to attract the support of the public at large. We have seen through the history of this government attempts to tag unpopular measures onto various popular measures. In the Senate—and in legislative councils around this country—the opportunity has been taken to divide bills, and that remains the case. Every time this occurs, the government of the day claims that the world as we know it will end and that these actions are reprehensible.
The minister indicated that this action has been undertaken in this place on at least three occasions. The first occasion on which the Senate divided a bill was on 9 June 1995, when the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 was divided into two bills, pursuant to the instruction to the committee of the whole, and was moved on notice. That was the action of a Liberal opposition, the detail of which is contained in Odgers on page 260. I suggest that whoever is writing the minister's speeches draw attention to that. They will also find that the government of the day chose to introduce new legislation—two new bills—reflecting the decisions of the Senate on that matter, which contained provisions that effectively divided the bills.
What we have heard from the minister tonight is that, when this matter is carried by the Senate, the government intends to withdraw the bills. That is a decision the government is taking. The government chooses to do that. The minister also went on to say that Minister Kemp will introduce new legislation in the spring session. It seems to me that what we are being told is that this bill has to be accepted in this particular form or not at all and that that has been the tradition of governments—what has always been referred to as Hobson's choice. I note a point that Senator Harradine made on the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill in 1995, when he drew attention by way of a paper prepared by the Senate clerks which argued that the purpose of dividing a bill is to facilitate the Senate's consideration of a matter; to give the Senate an opportunity to vote separately and effectively on all the issues involved; and, should it be necessary, to prevent any possible tacking provisions in a bill, the effect of which may be to infringe the various constitutional powers on amendments.
What was argued on that occasion was that, since the 1600s, when the phrase first entered the language, it has been an elementary political tactic to leave an opponent with what is called Hobson's choice—that is, one thing or the other; my choice or none. I understand that that provision arose from an old story whereby, at a Cambridge inn, Thomas Hobson enjoyed a monopoly over which customer would have access to his horses. He said that the horse nearest the stable door would be the horse that is taken—`It's that horse or none.' That is where this whole principle of Hobson's choice arose—that those enjoying a monopolistic capacity demand that a certain action be taken or that no action at all be taken. That is what the government is putting to us here tonight. Essentially it is Hobson's choice.
Labor say that there are measures in this bill that are worthy of support. The government has options to make sure that those particular provisions are implemented in law but it will not do so, by responding in the way that it has tonight. Labor say that we cannot find any precedents in education to make an omnibus bill, where essentially popular measures or reasonable measures are being put together with unpopular measures that essentially are designed to cover up the mistakes of the department and the government. We cannot find an example where that has occurred in recent times.
I think we are entitled to speculate on the motives of the government in packaging the legislation in the way that it has. Essentially, the department has made a complete mess of this issue of payment of establishment grants to new non-government schools. Last October, when we were in the middle of the consideration of the state grants bill—remember that great controversy over the government's measures to provide a million dollars extra a year for the wealthier schools in this country—departmental officials discovered that they had made a mistake in the forward estimates in regard to the payment of establishment grants to new non-government schools. 
I have found in politics that, if you make a mistake, it is wise not to repeat it, to do something about it and to address it square on. You would expect that public officials would certainly do that. We discovered through an inquiry process of the Senate that the government was not told initially that there had been an error in the forward estimates. It was put to us by senior officials that it was felt within the department that, because the bill was controversial and they were worried about getting the bills through, they were not going to say anything about the matter and that they were not going to seek amendments in this place, which is the normal practice when governments find that they have made errors, but that the government would seek to move amendments to the bill at a more convenient date. We discovered at a subsequent hearing that the minister was involved in this process and that the minister, presumably, was complicit in this parliament passing legislation which the department knew was wrong. The government did not correct that error, and now they expect us to correct it in this legislation.
We discovered that there were other errors last year in regard to not just the establishment grants but also the strategic assistance payments—for funding students with disabilities—where the government had calculated incorrectly certain moneys. We discovered a third error, which is not particularly relevant to this bill, in the innovations statement. In February this year, I asked why the $130 million in the fiscal balance table which had been released as part of the innovation statement was not included. The department told us that the exclusion of the measure to change the operation of the EBA from the fiscal balance table was an oversight. The innovation measures, including the measures that were reported in the 2001-02 portfolio budget statement, were measures affecting the 2001-02 budget. 
There are quite a few oversights in regard to the education spending and the administration of programs in this portfolio. Essentially, the administration of the establishment grants program has been abysmal. I think we can show categorically that, in the case of a number of the schools which the government has paid moneys to, there are serious questions as to the actions taken by the government in the payment to those schools which, under the government's own guidelines, are not to be paid where the school establishes separate campuses of the one school which are not new schools at all but which are just campuses of the existing school. We found from the web sites of those schools that, in terms of their registration or their registered training organisation status, their company structures, their personnel and the actual statements of the state registration boards—which, we are told, is just another error in the preamble of the state registration boards in Victoria—these schools are in fact separate campuses of the one school but are being registered as new schools. Of course, the government has paid money to those schools. That has occurred in Western Australia, in Victoria and, it would seem, in Queensland. 
It seems to me that there is a series of questions that relate to the actual payment of the establishment grants to date. What is really quite disturbing is that, having discovered that the expenditure, the appropriation, was in error, the government continued to spend the money and, of course, are at a point where they are now saying that, if this bill is not passed, the October payments will not be made. The reality is that this bill does not prevent moneys being paid in October, because there is an opportunity for the government to reconsider these issues in August. It is disingenuous of the government to argue other than that, because they know the reality of it. That is why they said tonight that they are prepared to consider legislation in the next session.
We are saying that there are other amendments to provide extra money for government schools. There is a need to review the PELS scheme, and there are questions that need to be addressed in relation to the ministerial discretion on the cap, the amount of money that is being set at the maximum loan limit, on the PELS scheme itself. These are issues that we believe can be addressed by way of amendment. That is why we are saying that the splitting of the bill provides an opportunity for the government to allow those measures on which there is broad agreement—such as the extra funding for the universities and the ARC—to be dealt with and processed, but the question of providing additional moneys for government schools should be dealt with separately. So, in that way, I think we are being more than reasonable. It is now appropriate for this government to acknowledge they have made a few blues about this and settle down and talk to people about getting those blues fixed.",SENATE,<title>INNOVATION AND EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,72,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2001-06-28,"—I just want to indicate that the Democrats will support this motion to split the bill. I think the minister is being disingenuous by indicating that this is some ruse. He knows very well that this bill was put together for the express purpose of pushing it through. I think we had a states grants bill that should have had the amendments associated with primary and secondary education attached to it rather than to this bill. But, in any case, we all know that the need for this amendment, leaving aside its importance of otherwise, was known when we dealt with the states grants bill in December. It is extraordinary that the minister would have the cheek to suggest that the Senate was somehow being unreasonable or irresponsible in wanting to split this bill. Senator Carr is right: it is entirely up to the government as to whether it accepts a split bill or not.
It seems to me that, if you put these measures together in one omnibus bill, you take that risk. The Senate wants to properly consider each of them and have the opportunity to reject them if that seems necessary. I have to say that it does seem necessary to us in a number of instances. There are some good measures in this bill, but we would like to be able to vote for those measures separately. It would be interesting to get the minister to respond as to why it was necessary to pull these three together, why it is that we have two quite separate higher education bills, essentially, coupled with the primary and secondary schools set of amendments to the legislation. Perhaps the minister can explain why it was so important that these measures be brought together in this way.
Question put:
That the motion (Senator Carr's) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>INNOVATION AND EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,72,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-06-28,"—The Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation Contributions) Bill 2000 deals with the use of a number of different types of superannuation entities to minimise and avoid tax. The main vehicles for this minimisation of tax relate to offshore superannuation funds and certain categories of onshore superannuation funds into which, over a period of three years from 1996 through to 1999, approximately $1.5 billion have been placed. Approximately 2,000 high wealth individuals have placed $1.5 billion in these superannuation funds and, in doing so, they have sought to avoid—and so far have avoided—income tax, superannuation taxes including the superannuation surcharge and fringe benefits taxes. The tax office estimates that the level of revenue at risk is approximately half a billion dollars.
When this matter was last considered, the Labor Party moved an amendment to retrospectively implement this legislation. However, we did not secure agreement with the Australian Democrats and that consequently meant that we were effectively forced to support the Australian Democrat amendment which did not go to the same period of retrospectivity. The Australian Labor Party maintains that it was never the intention, when superannuation funds were enacted in Australia, for superannuation funds to be used to avoid income tax, the various superannuation contributions taxes, the so-called superannuation surcharge and fringe benefits tax.
Other than the 2,000-odd individuals who have been identified by the tax office, everyone else in Australia pays the appropriate level of tax in respect of superannuation. For those reasons, the Labor Party believes that it is compelling that this legislation be retrospective. It is not unreasonable, if everyone else in Australia is paying their respective level of tax on superannuation funds, for these 2,000 individuals to do the same. Accordingly, the Labor Party will continue to support the amendment moved by the Australian Democrats to ensure that this legislation has at least some measure of retrospectivity.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2001-06-28,"—I seek leave to incorporate my speech. 
—Have you shown it to us?
—Yes, I certainly have.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
Over the past year I have been listening to the constituents of Queensland through various methods of communication in order to give Queenslanders the opportunity to express their concerns and to allow me to assist them wherever possible.
The responses have indicated that there is considerable discontent throughout the community over the policies that this Government has chosen to adopt. A number of constituents have also asked that I raise these concerns over Government policies in Parliament in the hope that this Government may attempt to address these issues.
The overwhelming majority of responses came from senior citizens, including both self-funded retirees and pensioners. These people have seen first-hand the `tricky' manner in which the Coalition has handled the provision of government assistance to the elderly. The $300 one-off payment was a prime example of an attempt to buy back the elderly's vote and provide a basis for massive taxpayer-funded self promotion. The $300 was an insult for those that were promised $1000 at the last election, and older Australians know that it doesn't even come close to compensating for the slug of the GST.
What is most concerning about the entire manner in which the Government has chosen to provide this assistance is the $4.5 million wasted on advertising to promote the Government in this election year. The Government could have informed pensioners and retirees of changes through normal channels, however they decided to target the broader community to gain wider electoral support for the upcoming election.
Rather than targeting potential recipients in a cost-effective manner, the advertising campaign gratuitously covers radio, television as well as print.
This is just another example of the Government's extraordinary wastage of taxpayers money on self promotion. The $4 million campaign would easily have payed for the extension of the $300 payment to all carer pensioners aged over 55. Carers save the Government millions of dollars every year yet the Coalition seem to believe that they do not deserve this additional assistance. This Government clearly has its priorities muddled when it chooses to spend millions of dollars on taxpayer-funded advertising rather than extending a benefit to those most in need. The value of the campaign is highly questionable given the $300 one-off doesn't even require pensioners to apply—it's paid automatically. The detail of this payment could have easily been incorporated into the regular seniors newsletter that is mailed directly to all age pensioners and most retirees.
Another example of this Government's muddled priorities is the $15 million being spent on private health insurance advertising. Rather than spending taxpayers money on health services in the public health system, the Government is further subsidising private health funds. As noted by Labor's Shadow Minister for Health, the money used for these advertisements could have funded an extra 1250 hip replacement operations or 1000 heath by-pass operations.
It is clear that the Coalition's attempt to advertise its way back into government will continue throughout the rest of the year, with Senate Estimates indicating that other expenditure proposed for the year include $6.9 million on the Telstra Besley response, a $5 million campaign on the abolition of the Financial Institutions Tax and a $4.2 million campaign to promote Work for the Dole. This Government will spend approximately $20 million per month leading up to October this year on advertising. This is a disgraceful waste of taxpayers money which should be spent in areas of genuine need.
Rather than spending money on genuine public information, this Government has chosen to waste money on opportunistic, cynical advertising.
Telstra
I have mentioned the issue of Telstra's regional services a number of times in this chamber, primarily because it is an issue which continually arises as being of concern to those outside of the major centres. There is clearly a continued need to be vigilant, as indicated by the recently leaked memo from Telstra. The memo confirms that the providers plan to cut further jobs from the organisation, with the majority being from regional centres. The memo indicated that of the job cuts Telstra is considering for its National Network Solutions arm, 70% will come from rural centres. This equates to more than 600 jobs lost in regional Australia. National Network Solutions is a unit within Telstra responsible for installing and fixing telephones and contains the field workers who actually do the work on individual phones in homes. Unfortunately for those living in regional towns such as Charleville, Longreach, Dalby and Boonah, it looks as though the already inadequate telephone services will only get worse.
In the March 2001 Performance Monitoring Bulletin, the Australian Communications Authority (ACA) found that Telstra has failed to meet even the Government's low standards for performance on fifty out of seventy-nine criteria. The ACA's Customer Satisfaction Survey has also found unprecedented levels of dissatisfaction by Australians with the service they are receiving from telecommunications carriers. As Labor has maintained consistently, the Government needs to retain its position as the majority shareholder in order to ensure that services improve. Telstra's recent price changes were only achieved via the Government's position as a majority shareholder in the organisation. The Government would no longer have this influence if it were to fully privatise Telstra, ending any chance of improving services to regional consumers. Privatisation will only ensure that Telstra focuses solely on profits rather than providing services to people living in the regions.
Unemployment
Responses I have received from the electorate of Forde show concern at the growing level of unemployment in the area. The unemployment figures in the area of Forde show the Howard Government has broken its promise that the GST would create jobs. From December 2000 to March 2001, the unemployment level has increased by 3% in Beenleigh; 3.7% in Eagleby; 4.6% in Loganlea; and 4% in Waterford West. This Government's policies on taxation and small business have placed unprecedented pressure on the economy causing small business to suffer and unemployment to rise.
The unemployment problem is certainly not going to be addressed by this Government's refusal to deal with the situation of Job Network providers using labour hire firms to place their unemployed clients into `phantom jobs'. The recent Senate Estimates hearings exposed the practice of Job Network providers setting up their own labour hire company and then employing job seekers in this company only to sack them after completing 15 hours of work. The Government then pays the provider up to $400 for each unemployed person who they place into a job which lasts for a minimum of 15 hours. These so-called jobs often only require the unemployed person to only fill out a survey and often do not even require the unemployed person to leave home at all. The Government should be acting immediately to investigate the Job Network providers to ensure that this practice is stamped out. It must also investigate the apparent sanction given to this practice given by the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business. Not only is it a blatant misuse of taxpayers money—it is taking advantage of those in the community who are most in need of assistance. Unemployed people who are attempting to find work should be given as much assistance as possible, not exploited by the bodies who are funded by the government to provide genuine employment opportunities.
Small Business and Taxation
On my recent visits to Toowoomba I have again been confronted with the extent to which small businesses are struggling under the current Government's business and taxation policies. This was confirmed by a substantial number of responses from the Gold Coast area which indicated that small businesses are still hurting from the taxation system implemented by this Government. It is difficult to reconcile this situation with Mr Howard's boast before the last election that “the tax plan is good for Australia ... It will boost the growth and the strength of the Australian economy”. (Parliament House, 13 August 1998). It is now clear that the GST has not boosted growth or strengthened the economy. In fact, the new taxation system has had a devastating effect on small business, with many simply preferring to close their doors rather than deal with the compliance nightmare and becoming part-time tax collectors for the Government.
An extraordinary number of businesses within the tourism industry on the Gold Coast have been adversely affected by the economic climate created by this Government. The Government needs to provide much more assistance to those small businesses involved in the tourism industry, particularly after slugging them with the most oppressive tax system this country has ever seen. Australian tourists now have the option of going overseas for their holidays and avoiding paying the GST or holidaying in their own country and being slugged with this tax. Prior to the introduction of the GST, the tourism industry briefed this Government extensively about the effect this tax would have on small businesses in this area. The Government ignored the warnings and now the small business operators in the tourism industry are paying the price.
Unfortunately, small business owners now have the end-of-financial-year GST nightmare to look forward to. According to the President of the National Tax Accountants' Association, Rob Regan, the tax system has been complicated to such an extent that tax agents' fees would increase by 50 to 100 per cent this year. With regard to the 350-page Tax Guide which arrives in the mail this week. Mr Regan made the point in the Courier-Mail (p.3. 26/06/01) that “Prior to the Howard Government coming into power, it was 200 pages - now it's almost doubled in size”.
Mr Regan went on to say that even experts were confused about the new tax regime, concluding that “Tax reform has failed under the Howard Government because it's too cumbersome”.
Dairy Deregulation
The Government's handling of dairy deregulation was identified as an issue of major concern by many survey respondents in the Forde and Groom areas. Many dairy farmers have seen their income plummet as a result of dairy deregulation, with precious little assistance offered by this Government. The Government has set the cut off point for access to additional assistance at only those who had over 35% of their operation devoted to producing market milk. This effectively cuts out at least 20% of dairy farmers in Queensland. Any farmers which took advice prior to deregulation to expand and diversify their businesses have now been penalised for doing so. Many of these farmers now have very low incomes, considerable debt, and yet still cannot access this additional assistance. The Government has failed to develop a cohesive plan to secure the futures of dairy farming families and others in the industry. Labor's Shadow Agriculture Minister recently highlighted the Government's vast number of failings in their handling of this issue including: failing to allow dairy farmers to directly access Dairy Regional Assistance Program (DRAP) grants where a project can be shown to result in long-term employment in a dairying area; failing to support farmers seeking to bargain collectively with processors and manufacturers; failing to ensure that neither suppliers nor consumers are being exploited in the wake of deregulation and producing an exit scheme which very few farmers have been able to access. Labor's amendment to the Government's legislation was passed through the Senate yesterday. Unfortunately, the government watered down this measure this morning. This amendment was to reduce the cut-off point for access to additional assistance to 25%, as well as introducing a minimum payment of $15000 for eligible farmers. This amendment would have meant that most of the farmers in the `quota' states, including my state of Queensland, who would have missed out under the Governments plan will now qualify for assistance. The ball is now in the Government's court as the legislation returns to the House of Representatives - they can support the legislation with Labor's amendments to insure a fairer compensation deal for our dairy farmers or they can abandon them yet again. The government took the low road and pared back our amendment.
Environment and Heritage
Environment and heritage issues seem to consistently rate as issues of major concern in public forums, with similar results emanating from responses from constituents. People seem to be very concerned about the preservation of their local environment as well as the conservation of local man-made structures of historical and natural value. Residents who visit areas such as Mt Tamborine or the Lamington National Park in Forde or the Burleigh Heads National Park in McPherson greatly appreciate the opportunity to regularly visit such beautiful local environments and are rightfully determined to ensure that these areas are protected. To ensure the protection of these and other areas of national importance, Labor is campaigning to save the Register of National Estate. This Register has been developed over the last twenty-five years and consists of some thirteen thousand places that have been recognised for their heritage values. It appears that the Howard Government is proposing to scrap the Register through legislation and replace if with two far more limited lists. The Government's legislation will immediately remove all of these listings from the Register and will replace the Australian Heritage Commission with an advisory council with significantly reduced powers and independence. Labor supports retaining the Register of National Estate as a comprehensive statutory register to be updated and maintained at a national level. Labor will also supporting stronger protection provisions in the existing framework for protection of heritage places with national significance. However, we believe that this should be achieved through amending the current legislation. Many of the places listed on the Register have received greater recognition and protection as a result of their listing. Many places in my local area are listed on this Register including: the Beaudesert War Memorial, the Bethania Lutheran Church, the Boonah War Memorial, Catswold Cottage in Rathdowney, Bishops Peak Shelter, Hillview Art Site, Cedar Creek National Park, Joalah National Park and Tamborine Mountain National Park. It is of great concern to me that these places will lose the recognition and protection offered by their listing in the Register. Local constituents who also wish to voice their concern over this issue can sign a petition at my office which calls on the Government to maintain the Register of the National Estate.
Whilst it has been clear for some time that the policies embraced by this Government are failing, responses to my survey have confirmed that people do not believe that this Government is up to the job. More importantly, Australians have a right to expect that the Government will attempt to address these issues in a responsible manner - not indulge in a panic-fuelled advertising blitz to buy their way back into government.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Queensland: Government Policies</title>,Adjournment,77,1,speech

NATIONAL ARCHIVES OF AUSTRALIA  (NAA)
(1)	NAA is in the process of setting a time frame.
(2)	Initial consultations within NAA will commence as soon as a time frame has been finalised.
SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE  (SBS)
(1)	SBS has set a time frame to test the costs of the provision of the corporate services against market providers prior to the close of the current financial year.  It has recently benchmarked some services against other organisations and the other models, and will continue to do so, and use the most appropriate mix of internal and external resources.
(2)	Not applicable
AUSTRALIAN COMMUNICATIONS AUTHORITY  (ACA)
(1)	The ACA has already outsourced a number of corporate services functions as follows:
·	Network operations for its information technology services;
·	Internal audit services;
·	Records management services;
·	Property management services;  
·	Graphic design services; and
·	Computing services.
The ACA is a body subject to the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997, and is not subject to the mandatory requirements for market testing of corporate services functions.  It therefore has no formal program for the market testing of its corporate functions.  
The ACA will, however, examine the scope for outsourcing some more of its corporate services as part of its ongoing efforts to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of its corporate services.  The ACA relies heavily on external contractors for provision of applications development and maintenance services in relation to its computerised business systems.  
In relation to computing services, the ACA is a member of Group 8.  Ipex ITG was the successful tenderer for Group 8, and commenced the provision of services on 26 June 2000.
(2)	The ACA has consulted with affected employees during each of the outsourcing initiatives identified in our response to part (1) of this question.  The ACA will continue to consult with staff and unions in respect of any future outsourcing initiatives.
AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION  (ABC)
(1)	The ABC has not set a time frame to market test any of its corporate services.
However, the ABC does benchmark its IT services against the industry, benchmarking at a minimum of 20% of its IT activities each year.  To date the cost of running services in-house has compared very favourably with industry averages.
The ABC also annually benchmarks the cost of the provision of its legal services against the industry.  The results show that the ABC makes a considerable saving by having in-house lawyers.
(2)	See response to part (1)
NATIONAL GALLERY OF AUSTRALIA  (NGA)
(1) and (2) The NGA has not set a time frame to market test any of its corporate services.   In recent years the NGA has participated with other national collecting and exhibiting institutions in looking at our ancillary services and has participated in a review of the delivery of such services.  The review resulted in a report being presented by Tooher Gale and Associates which confirmed that corporate services delivered in-house was still the most appropriate option for the NGA.  The NGA has outsourced janitorial services in the last 12 months, but at this time has no plans to market test other aspects of its operations.
