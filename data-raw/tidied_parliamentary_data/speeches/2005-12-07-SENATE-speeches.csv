"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2005-12-07,"—The Senate is dealing with the Tax Laws Amendment (Loss Recoupment Rules and Other Measures) Bill 2005. This bill is what is known as an omnibus tax bill. It seeks to deal with a number of outstanding tax issues, some of them of great complexity. There are a number of important changes in the bill that will improve the taxation regime—in particular in relation to the depreciation of copyright in the film sector.
Schedule 1 relates to loss recoupment rules for companies. Companies, as distinct from individual taxpayers, can generally claim a tax deduction for losses outside the income year in which they are incurred, and they are effectively carried forward. This is particularly important for sectors where there is a significant lead time between the start-up of commercial operations and the earning of the profits that subsequently flow. Venture capital in innovation sectors is an example, as is mining and minerals exploration. In the case of these ventures, the loss recoupment regime is a factor that is considered before entering into the final investment. If there is a question as to whether the losses will be recouped, initial investment may not occur.
In order to obtain these losses a number of tests need to be satisfied. For the purposes of this bill, the tests under review are what are known as the substantial continuity of ownership test—I will refer to it as COT—and the same business test, or SBT. The COT now means that a company holds 50 per cent of the voting power, half the dividends or capital gains. The SBT now requires that the company carries on basically the same business before and after the loss. Only one of these tests needs to be met. Under current arrangements, the COT has become very difficult to calculate due to the difficulty of tracing ownership with many interposed entities in place, such as holding companies, trusts, foreign entities and superannuation funds. The test is continuous, so theoretically it should be monitored all the time. The government is right to identify that the compliance burden is far too high and Labor supports the policy intent of seeking to reduce that burden. Companies have, therefore, relied upon SBT. It is questionable whether this was the original intention of the regime. The government’s bill proposes a new regime for COT which makes it much easier to comply with. The new COT is met by a company being widely held or listed. A private company basically faces a 75 per cent rule; that is, the owner receives 75 per cent of income, capital gains or holds 75 per cent of control.
The Liberal government also proposes that a company can only rely on SBT to obtain the losses if total income is less than $100 million. So, from the perspective of business, the change could be described as something of a mixed blessing. This is because it is not easy for companies to get over the new $100 million threshold for SBT in the case of merging entities. Consolidation is the normal process of industry evolution in some sectors; for example, mining and venture capital. Such companies will now be denied SBT and have to rely on the new COT. There is concern that the new COT may still be too hard for some companies to meet and that, under the proposed law, they may not receive the tax benefit of losses that they currently make use of. If true, this is potentially a major barrier to investment in some sectors.
Schedule 1 of the loss recoupment rules follows industry consideration and will generally reduce compliance costs. But key tax policy advocates, including the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia and the mining sector, for example, have major concerns. The changes make it more difficult for venture capitalists and miners, who face losses in early years, to raise capital. The new rules may also be tougher on merges. Merging of companies can be important in capturing economies of scale in these sectors which incur losses in early years.
The Senate Economics Legislation Committee considered this particular issue. It included the Labor Party, and I acknowledge the active support of Senator Murray from the Democrats on this matter. The committee unanimously—I stress the word ‘unanimously’—recommended that the $100 million cap for the same business test be excluded. Later committee amendments, and there are a considerable number of them, all go to this one issue of the removal of the $100 million cap, which has been designed by the Assistant Treasurer, Mr Brough. I did say unanimous because there were two government members of this committee. I always refer to Senator Watson as the esteemed Senator Watson because there is no doubt about his technical knowledge in these types of matters. I would not refer to Senator Brandis that way. He is certainly very knowledgeable but not so much esteemed—ambitious, perhaps. Certainly, two leading government backbenchers, Senator Brandis and Senator Watson, agreed with both the Labor Party and the Democrats’ Senator Murray, another esteemed senator on the occasion of this bill. The unanimous recommendation came from a very well-qualified committee. I have to say I was not at the hearings.
—George Campbell was.
—Senator George Campbell was, that is right, representing the Labor Party. There was a unanimous recommendation from the Senate committee to remove this $100 million threshold which is of major importance, particularly to the venture capital and mining industries. I draw that to the attention of the chamber and I hope that that will be reflected in the vote on the Labor amendments that we will get to shortly.
Coming back to Minister Brough who devised this $100 million cap, I hope that the Treasurer has his eye on the ball on this occasion and will overrule Minister Brough on this issue and listen to industry concerns on the bill. If the Treasurer has his eye on the ball on this particular tax measure, it will be very welcome if he overrules Minister Brough. We know that he is somewhat distracted at the moment because of the Gerard affair, but this is an important issue and he should get in there and overrule the Assistant Treasurer, Minister Brough, on this occasion.
Conduit foreign income is currently only non-portfolio, directly owned and operated investments by nonresidents investing in offshore activities through Australian companies avoiding dividend withholding tax, which is normally set at 30 per cent but can be lowered due to double tax treaties or activities in tax-sheltered countries. This bill extends this exemption from dividend withholding to portfolio investments where the nonresident is just a shareholder in the Australian company undertaking the foreign activity. The change removes this non-neutral treatment and will encourage Australian firms as a base for such investment, particularly in offshore banking and offshore petroleum investments. It has been called for by the Board of Taxation. The extension of the withholding tax exemption applies in the case of conduit income where the income is passed on to non-resident shareholders. This is where the company is a conduit to shareholders, hence the term ‘conduit income’. If schedule 2 were to be opposed, the savings would currently be $70 million over the forward estimates.
The third area is denial of deductions for illegal activities. The bill changes current law which allows deductions on illegal activities. The income from illegal activities is assessable, so deductions are allowed. This has led to some notorious abuses by convicted criminals. Labor will support the change but we do criticise the government for not acting in this area earlier and making an obviously needed change to the tax law.
Schedule 4 deals with copyright in film to be included in effective life depreciation. Current law specifies a statutory life of usually 25 years for the assets of investment in film copyright, but with more concessional rules in certain circumstances. This is an immediate deduction for capital expenditure for qualifying Australian films, where there is an initial interest in the copyright. The statutory rate method is typical for intangible assets. The bill will allow the commissioner to specify an effective life in an independent way following normal treatment of more tangible assets. It can be argued that this copyright is a more tangible asset and the effective economic life of these assets is less than 25 years. This means a significant bringing forward of deductible capital expenditure for those projects that do not enjoy immediate deductibility. This measure will clearly assist the sector and has tax policy merit.
Schedule 5 addresses relief for employee share scheme participants in the event of a corporate restructure. A capital gains tax event can occur when there is a corporate restructure. This means that capital losses might need to be realised, with a negative impact on employees in share ownership schemes, or tax might be payable which would otherwise be deferred. This measure supports the regime and encourages employee share ownership.
Schedule 6 allows the offset of a late payment of SG contributions against an employer’s superannuation guarantee charge. Current rules can lead to a double payment. Late payment of an SG contribution incurs a penalty tax, ensuring the actual benefit is passed on to the employee. That is appropriate and is retained under the bill, but it is not clear that this absolves the employer of the original obligation. This measure removes this uncertainty.
Schedule 7 deals with applying superannuation guarantee obligations to the back payment of wages. This measure also clarifies superannuation guarantee issues by ensuring that SG payments must be made for back pay in the event of termination of employment. In my capacity as shadow minister responsible for superannuation, I obviously welcome these particular changes.
I might say that there are still some significant difficulties in the collection of superannuation guarantee. Of the complaints that I receive in my office from constituents, not just from Tasmania but referred to me by other members and senators, the payment of SG is an ongoing problem in a small number of employers, but important nonetheless to the individuals who miss out. I think the average liability to employees tops just over $100 million a year, with about 10,000 employees not being paid their money in any one year, so that is significant to those employees.
One other problem is that when employees complain to the tax office and want to find out what is happening with their superannuation guarantee payments, the secrecy provision precludes the tax office from actually informing the complainant of what action has been taken. A scheme of arrangement may have been entered into with the employer to collect the back superannuation. This leads to a great deal of frustration and anger from some complainants because they simply cannot find out what is actually going on. I have raised this issue with the former tax commissioner, Mr Carmody, and he agreed with my suggestion that the removal of the secrecy provision in this area would at least help to inform the complainant who should be receiving their money. The employee could then at least find out what is happening in terms of any sort of scheme of arrangement.
The other defect in this area that I would highlight is that unpaid superannuation where an employer goes into receivership—and bear in mind that this is a statutory obligation—is not covered by the government employee entitlement protection scheme. Other statutory entitlements are. Unpaid superannuation in the event of the bankruptcy of an employer is not covered under the government employee entitlement protection scheme, and this is a concern to Labor. It is a statutory entitlement. Often the outstanding statutory superannuation contributions exceed the other statutory entitlements that are paid by GEERS. So this is another hole. But we are pleased that the two measures here will improve the situation for employees with respect to superannuation.
As I indicated, we have a significant number of amendments in committee, which we are co-sponsoring with Senator Murray, on behalf of the Democrats. They all go to the issue of the $100 million threshold. I put out a challenge publicly—we are on the broadcast—to Senator Brandis and Senator Watson in particular, who were members of the committee. Those two senators unanimously agreed with the Labor senators and, in this case, Senator Murray from the Democrats that the $100 million threshold should be removed. Labor’s amendments in committee will go to that one issue. We are not moving a second reading amendment but we are moving specific amendments to this effect in the committee stage.
In respect of the Senate committee’s examination of this legislation—whilst I was not at the hearings, I have glanced at the report—I think that all of the senators at the hearings did a fine job in drawing out the particular issues and concerns around the $100 million threshold. It is a matter of significant concern to some sectors of business—for example, the mining industry.
Certainly on this occasion the Labor Party believe that there is strong merit in the submissions of business on this issue. We are just a little perturbed, perplexed and indeed concerned at the antibusiness approach of the Liberal government minister, Minister Brough, the Assistant Treasurer, on this occasion. We are quite puzzled at that, to be honest. We think that the amendments we will come to are reasonable in the circumstances. We do not agree with business on everything, as we do not agree with our friends and colleagues in the trade union movement on everything, but on this occasion the merits of the issue require an amendment to be passed to alleviate the threat that is hanging over some businesses and the concern that they have. Labor are determined to press our amendments and ensure in respect of the merits of this issue a pro-business, investment friendly outcome, which would be to the benefit of not just the individual businesses affected but also investment and the overall strength of the economy.
As I said, I hope that Senator Brandis and Senator Watson make a contribution on this legislation. Certainly Senator Watson’s technical knowledge is well known in this area. We do not always agree, but he is a very knowledgeable senator. I notice that they are not here. In fact, there is no-one on the government benches at the moment.
—They’ve all disappeared.
—They have all disappeared. I just hope they are not here for the vote, if that is their attitude. It is another example of the arrogance of this government that there is no-one on the government benches whatsoever. Now there is one. Senator Ferguson is just crossing to the government back benches.
—I have been doing some whip’s work.
—He is whipping. I do not know what he is whipping when there is no-one on the government side to whip. It is another example of the arrogance and contempt that this Liberal government shows for the Senate. Time and again this week we have had the government coming in—
—You must have run out of things to say.
—We have to highlight this ongoing arrogance of the government and the contempt they have for the processes of the Australian parliament. They have the numbers in the Senate. When it suits them they are in here to vote. As I said, the government benches were absolutely empty earlier on in my contribution in this debate. I have never seen that before. It is certainly not a reflection on what I have to say. The government benches are empty, but the government do come in here for a guillotine motion. We have seen that a couple of times this week. This is their arrogance. They are determined to push legislation through without due consideration. They are here for the guillotine votes to force through legislation. They will guillotine anything, including an antibusiness measure, which will be a consequence of the bill that we are considering.
—You’ve got a free rein!
—I will take your interjection, but you should go and talk to Senator Brandis and Senator Watson, who agree with the Labor Party on this particular issue, which we will be debating in the committee stage. I would urge the Senate to support the amendments that go to the removal of the $100 million threshold.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (LOSS RECOUPMENT RULES AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-12-07,"—I think the shadow minister was right to commence by noting the importance of the unanimous report on this bill and, in doing so, to give credit to the chair. He rightly, in my view, described Senator Watson as esteemed. Members of the chamber know that he is now the father of the Senate, having served so long, so consistently and so well. It is also a reflection, I might suggest, of his sometimes underestimated political skills. He is much more of a wily politician than people give him credit for when they first see him. It also was a worthy remark because Senator Watson does indeed know his oats in this field of law. I would suggest that in superannuation matters he and Senator Sherry between them share pre-eminence.
In passing, the shadow minister was kind enough to refer to me, at least for this moment, as ‘esteemed’. In fact I might have misheard him. He might have meant: ‘He is steamed,’ because steamed I have been over these last few sitting days at the gags and guillotines that have prevented the full exploration of the amendments that were before the Senate with respect to the three bills dealing with Work Choices, terror and Welfare to Work. I know the importance of second reading debate speeches to people, because they enable them to express opinions, and often strong opinions, that they have, but I think it is in the exploration of amendments to bills that the really thorny issues are often fleshed out. I do not think it is to the credit of the government to have exercised the guillotine and the gag on those bills. I for one would have been prepared to sit for longer if it meant that those bills could have been properly examined.
I will turn to the Tax Laws Amendment (Loss Recoupment Rules and Other Measures) Bill 2005. I am fond in these tax matters of referring to the length of bills. This is another 114 pages to add to the tax act, but I should recognise that the Treasurer has announced that a large swag of the tax act which is redundant will now be repealed. I look forward to that day because, whilst it is just housekeeping, we all know a clean house is often a better house. The bill is a conglomeration of amendments, contained in seven schedules, addressing a number of disparate omnibus topics ranging from changes to the loss recoupment rules for companies through to the depreciation treatment of copyright in film production.
Attention to this bill, at least for our part, has focused on the first two schedules covering the loss recoupment rules and conduit foreign income. Schedule 1 of this bill can only be described as a pragmatic, if a little uninspired, attempt by the government to make palatable to the business community its current policy quandary on loss recoupment rules for companies. It is easy to get lost in the technical nature of the rules and regulations that define the loss recoupment legislation, so I will try to contextualise a little the problem and the current and proposed remedies.
From as early as 1944, I understand, loss recoupment rules have been imposed on companies seeking to claim various kinds of tax losses and deductions. The first such rule was the continuity of ownership test, introduced as far back as 1944, I am told, and later supplemented with the same business test in 1965. Both tests have been subsequently amended and both have continued to fail in many respects in addressing the true nature of the problem and have resulted in administrative complexities of their own. The problem that these tests were designed to address was a legitimate one, and that was the potential for illegitimate loss trafficking in corporate mergers and acquisitions.
In essence, loss trafficking refers to one corporation purchasing another corporation purely because of attractive taxation benefits resulting from accrued losses. This is considered detrimental from a national productivity and efficiency standpoint and is also divergent from accepted economic and business norms. The purpose of business is to provide a good or service at a profit, and the pursuit of tax losses as an attraction in their own right is obviously a kind of diverted business activity.
With reference to the continuity of ownership test, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia have stated that in its current form it is:
... almost impossible for widely held companies to satisfy the existing COT rules.
COT is the continuity of ownership test and ‘widely held’ is a classification of companies with 50 or more shareholders. They have also said:
... the proposed changes merely restore the operation of the COT to widely held companies in the manner that various governments always intended and the way it operated prior to the 1997 revision of these rules under the Tax Laws Improvement Project ...
Implicit in that, of course, is a criticism of the 1997 Tax Laws Improvements Project, which was supported by my party, amongst others—a sign that even when you are supporting things you still can end up with difficulties as a result. These sentiments that I have quoted are echoed by Ernst and Young, the Minerals Council of Australia and the Corporate Tax Association of Australia. The two latter groups, the Minerals Council of Australia and the Corporate Tax Association of Australia, have stated:
The existing COT rules in practice have been quite unworkable, which has created enormous compliance costs and uncertainty for large listed corporate groups ...
As a result, corporations have almost exclusively relied on the same business test compliance for access to loss recoupment benefits.
The proposed changes to the COT, as its acronym is, will make tracing of ownership a much simpler task and they are in fact welcomed by the corporate sector. However, in simplifying the COT the government has unnecessarily complicated access to the same business test by introducing this upper income threshold of $100 million, which itself is difficult to determine, because if you start to try to trace your way through entities and trusts and the way in which corporate entities are structured it can be a difficult test to satisfy. If it is a difficult test to satisfy it will result in litigation. If it results in litigation you will get uncertainty and unnecessary costs. Thus, in terms of actually ameliorating the level of overall complexity in loss recoupment legislation, the government is merely shuffling the complexity from one test to another.
The Minerals Council of Australia and the Corporate Tax Association of Australia have inferred that the reasoning behind this complexity shuffle is an attempt by the government to ensure that its changes are revenue neutral. That may be so, but I suspect that what I warned would happen at the time of the extensive series of loss consolidation bills has happened. As complex as they were, the Democrats strongly supported those loss consolidation measures because their intention was a positive policy one—to free up companies from the artificial constraints resulting from the need to structure themselves so that their accumulated losses were protected as an asset. That meant that the market was less free in terms of the ability of corporate organisations to restructure, to realise losses and to engage in takeovers, mergers and acquisitions. I did warn that the effect of freeing up the realisation of losses would see considerably greater effects on revenue than the government were forecasting.
I think the problem is that the government have a sense of what is coming but they have not advised the parliament what that sense is. You cannot expect us to operate with respect to a policy proposal if you do not tell us what the dangers are. We would therefore need to examine this in terms of a policy integrity measure, and, as has been said, quite clearly the committee found that the policy measure was an unattractive one. So this cap is an arbitrary and artificial method for addressing a revenue danger, but it is done without quantifying what that danger is. Yet this is challenged by both the organisations I mentioned earlier who state that removing same business test eligibility for large corporations is likely to ‘have a significantly positive impact on revenue over time’.
Loss recoupment provisions play a vital role in supporting and stimulating innovation and development in corporate Australia. They contribute to a market-responsive and fluid mergers, acquisitions and takeovers environment. Imagine a typical junior mining exploration company. Such companies are typically capital intensive, entrepreneurial and risk taking, but they require heavy investment up front and they experience high start-up costs. Those expenses are not met with an accompanying income stream and the effect is heavy losses in the early years of those ventures. Sometimes, of course, the ventures themselves fail.
This cash burn phase cannot be avoided in the quest for new and unproven resource finds, and considering the importance of Australia’s resource sector you would imagine that every effort is made to support this vital task. Knowing that it would be difficult to exit such a project in the future without the ability to market the tax deductibility of losses would contribute to a continued weakness in exploration spending in Australia, and particularly in my state of Western Australia. There is little incentive for financiers to prop up explorers knowing that buyers are usually operators with income in excess of $100 million a year and operators who therefore cannot access legitimate start-up losses in a number of circumstances.
From the Democrats’ perspective, limiting the same business test to companies with incomes of less than $100 million will have the effect of substantially limiting the outcomes this bill could achieve if the same business test were uncapped. Removing the cap will add a cost to the government revenue, but the changes to our tax losses regime need to be carried through and washed through the system so that the distorting overhang of artificially constrained and unrealised losses is finally normalised. That was behind the policy intent of the government with the tax consolidation losses measures.
Does the potential upside of stimulating market activity, innovation and development offset an unknown additional cost? Quantitatively, this cannot be easily assessed, certainly not by me, although I am sure Treasury could have a reasonable crack at it. But what I do know is that innovation and removing structural impediments is the source of new and better means of productive and corporate activity, and that is the spring from which real and lasting economic growth can well forth.
Turning back to the findings of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiry into the provisions of the bill in question, which focused on the proposed $100 million income cap to the same business test, the committee found that there are not reasonable grounds to limit access to the same business test to companies with incomes exceeding $100 million and recommended that the bill be amended to this end. This forms the substance of the amendments that the Democrats and Labor jointly propose for this bill. I put on record our appreciation for the Labor Party’s sense of policy integrity here. They are as aware as we are that there is the potential for an additional revenue cost, but the policy benefits of the unanimous proposal of the committee are understood by both of our parties. So we—and I can use the word ‘we’ in this case—urge the government to vote for this much needed amendment and to support the findings of the committee. In so doing, it will better satisfy the original intention behind the loss recoupment provisions. It will help to secure Australia’s innovative and productive future and finally put to rest a poorly designed remedy that has troubled corporate Australia for at least 60 years. However, given my understanding of the world, I doubt that it will cure all ills.
Schedule 2 to this bill provides tax relief for conduit foreign income. Conduit foreign income is generally foreign income received by a foreign resident via an Australian corporate tax entity. This measure ensures those amounts are not taxed in Australia when distributed by the Australian corporate tax entity to its foreign owners. Generally, the measure only applies to foreign income that is ordinarily sheltered from Australian tax when it is received by the Australian corporate tax entity. This reform is consistent with the government’s policy on increasing the attractiveness of Australia as a location for business and investment and improves the consistency of treatment between direct and indirect investments.
The idea behind schedule 2 is to allow for a consistent treatment and uninterrupted flow of funds for dividends to foreign owners to ensure that the flow of foreign income from foreign entities to foreign owners will not attract taxation when flowing through the Australian company. It is a tax ethical proposition, in other words. I note that all submissions received by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee that inquired into the provisions of this bill welcomed and supported the introduction of the proposals contained in this schedule.
Schedule 3 introduces denial of deductions for illegal activities. It amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to deny deductions for losses and outgoings to the extent that they are incurred in the furtherance of, or directly in relation to, activities in respect of which the taxpayer has been convicted of an indictable offence. That strikes me as a great idea. Similarly, the capital gains tax provisions will be amended so that losses and outgoings incurred in relation to illegal activities in respect of which the taxpayer was convicted of an indictable offence do not form part of the cost base or reduced cost base for capital gains purposes. This will ensure that no capital loss or reduced capital gain can arise from such expenditure. This amendment closes a loophole that has previously allowed for deductions to be made against illegally derived income. I congratulate the government on introducing it.
It is required that the individual be convicted of the offence, which is only fair, and only income expenses derived from illegal activity apply to the nondeductability clause. This is a commonsense approach and, if I may say so, should have been introduced long ago, but it is a good integrity measure. I note that this measure stems from the findings from the full Federal Court decision in Commissioner of Taxation v La Rosa, where La Rosa, a convicted drug dealer, was able to successfully claim tax deductions related to his illegal business activity as a drug dealer. That this situation was able to arise in the first place almost beggared public belief, and the government is to be congratulated in addressing the issue in this way.
Schedule 4 to this bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to include copyright in a film in the general effective life depreciation of the uniform capital allowances provisions in the income tax law. These provisions apply to films that fail to qualify as Australian films and that receive beneficial tax treatment and seek to adjust the effective write-off period. Copyright is currently listed in the general category of deductions allowing for a 25-year write-off period. This amendment suggests two options. Firstly, the commissioner may make a determination for the length of the effective life. Alternatively, a producer may wish to choose between the commissioner’s determination or a self-determination for the effective life of the copyright. The government’s preference is the second option as this allows for greater flexibility in determining the economic life of the asset.
Schedule 5 provides relief for employee share scheme participants in the event of a corporate restructure. This bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to allow employee share scheme participants who acquire shares in a scheme for the acquisition of shares by employees who are assessed under section 26AAC of the ITAA 1936 to treat the new shares or rights they are issued because of a corporate restructure as a continuation of their old shares or rights. These amendments ensure that the new shares or rights issued to employee share scheme participants in the event of a corporate restructure are treated as a continuation of the old shares or rights they previously held—it is a fairness measure. This is a sensible approach to a complicated issue, which would currently tax the restructured holdings as new equity capital gains and thus liable to higher taxation in the event of sale. Tax concessions created by this bill counteract the effect of increased capital gains tax.
Schedule 6 to this bill amends the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 to allow the offsetting of a late payment of contributions against an employer’s superannuation guarantee charge. A new offsetting rule is created so employers that make a late contribution to a complying super fund after the due date but before the 28th day of the second late month are able to reduce the penalties associated with late payment. Currently no offsetting rule applies and employers are liable for the entire superannuation guarantee charge, even though the late contribution has been subsequently paid. The new rules provide greater flexibility for employers but maintain the integrity of the system as the amounts paid and used in the offset cannot be used as a tax deduction to ensure that employers making payments on time are not disadvantaged.
Schedule 7 of this bill seeks to apply superannuation guarantees to back payments of wages. It amends the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 to clarify that mandatory employer contributions under the superannuation guarantee arrangements are payable on wages or salary paid in a quarter following the termination of an employment relationship. This amendment closes a loophole that potentially excluded former employees from benefiting from due protection under that act because the former employee may not fit the definition of the employee-employer relationship. This enforces the obligation of employers to pay the superannuation that applies to back wages.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (LOSS RECOUPMENT RULES AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2005-12-07,"—I will now sum up on behalf of the government the debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (Loss Recoupment Rules and Other Measures) Bill 2005. To begin with, I thank senators who have taken part in the debate for their contributions. The introduction of the consolidation regime highlighted longstanding issues for large companies with applying the loss recoupment rules. This has been addressed by the first measure of this bill. The amendments improve the loss recruitment rules for companies by, among other things, introducing a new modified continuity of ownership test. Through those amendments the range of companies that are eligible to use the modified continuity of ownership test will be extended to include all widely held companies and eligible subsidiaries. The amendments make it easier and more certain for those companies to apply the modified continuity of ownership test by relaxing the rules for tracing ownership under the test and by specifying the times at which these companies will need to test for continuity of ownership.
This schedule will also remove the same business test for companies whose income is more than $100 million in the year of recoupment. The Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer stated in his media release on 14 September this year that the government would continue to consult with stakeholders to find a workable solution to concerns they raised about applying the continuity of ownership test to companies that have issued more than one class of share. The second measure in this bill will provide tax relief for foreign income received by a foreign resident through an Australian corporate tax entity. This measure replaces the existing foreign dividend account provisions. These rules will allow Australian companies that receive foreign income on which no Australian tax is payable to pay dividends to foreign shareholders that are also free of Australian withholding tax. This is an important measure which will make Australia a more attractive base for multinationals looking to establish regional headquarters. It is also of benefit to Australian based multinationals in that it enhances their ability and capacity to compete for foreign capital.
The third measure in the bill denies deductions for losses and outgoings to the extent that they are incurred in the furtherance of or directly in relation to activities in respect of which a taxpayer has been convicted of an offence punishable by imprisonment for at least 12 months. This was just alluded to by Senator Murray. In situations where a taxpayer is conducting a lawful business but is convicted of an illegal activity whilst carrying on that business, only the expenditure that is incurred in relation to the illegal activity will be denied. Expenditure that is incurred in undertaking the underlying lawful activity and that would have been incurred regardless of the illegal activity will, of course, continue to be deductible.
The fourth measure of the bill provides that copyright in a film will be included in the general effective life depreciation of the uniform capital allowance provisions. Under effective life depreciation, taxpayers will have a choice of either using the Commissioner of Taxation’s ‘safe harbour’ effective life determination or self-assessing the effective life of their copyright in a film. Taxpayers will also be able to choose between the diminishing value method and the prime cost method when depreciating their asset. This amendment will apply to a copyright in a film acquired on or after 1 July 2004.
The fifth measure provides tax relief in certain circumstances for employees who participate in employee share schemes. The result of these amendments is that, when an employee is issued with new shares or rights as a result of a corporate restructure or a 100 per cent takeover, they will be able to treat their new shares or rights as a continuation of their old shares or rights. These amendments ensure that a taxing point does not arise for employee share scheme participants in the event of a corporate restructure. Furthermore, the amendments make sure that there is continuity of treatment for capital gains tax purposes. This measure was originally due to take effect from royal assent. However, following the introduction of the bill into the House of Representatives, the government was made aware of taxpayers who would be unable to benefit from these changes if the date of effect remained the date of royal assent. Accordingly, the government has amended the date of effect to 1 July 2004. This will enable more taxpayers to benefit from the changes and also align the start date of other changes to the employee share scheme provisions relating to corporate restructures. In this manner the amendments further support the development of employee share schemes and the alignment of employer and employee interests.
Lastly, measures 6 and 7 of this bill change the law to enhance the operation of the superannuation guarantee arrangements. Measure 6 reduces the disproportionate penalty on employers who make late superannuation contributions in an attempt to honour their superannuation guarantee obligations to employees. The amendment will allow late employer superannuation contributions to be offset against the superannuation guarantee charge where they have been made within a month of the superannuation guarantee due date. This provides relief for employers who would otherwise effectively be making a double payment of superannuation contributions. This measure improves the financial situation for those employers while maintaining the integrity of the superannuation guarantee compliance requirements.
Measure 7 clarifies that mandatory employer contributions under the superannuation guarantee arrangements are payable on wages or salary paid in a quarter following the termination of an employment relationship. This removes any doubt about whether the superannuation guarantee law imposes an obligation on employers for former employees and ensures employees do not lose their superannuation guarantee entitlements as a result of being underpaid during their employment. These changes demonstrate the government’s ongoing commitment to improving Australia’s superannuation system and easing burdens on employers. I join with earlier speakers in saying that these measures will be welcomed. They are measured and appropriate. For the reasons I have outlined, I commend the bill to the Senate.
Question agreed to.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (LOSS RECOUPMENT RULES AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Crossin, Senator Trish",ALP,2005-12-07,"—The Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2005 characterises the absolute abuse of power that has quickly become routine since the coalition won control of the Senate and it highlights the arrogance of a government that has been around for nine long years. The management of this country’s radioactive waste remains a highly contentious issue. We accept the need for a facility to manage the radioactive waste produced by the Lucas Heights reactor and from other sources, yet the ineptitude and incompetence of this government in attempting to store Commonwealth radioactive waste in South Australia, and now the Northern Territory, show a lack of leadership and a preference for political expediency.
In July 2004—only last year—the Prime Minister abandoned the attempt to impose a national low-level waste dump in South Australia, in the face of opposition from the South Australian government and the community. Then, in the lead-up to the 2004 election, the member for Solomon, Mr Tollner, let the cat out of the bag by suggesting that the Northern Territory might host the dump. On Territory radio on 13 July last year, he said:
... what I’ve always advocated ... Nuclear waste should be stored in the safest possible location. Now if that location was to be in the Northern Territory we would have a responsibility ... to allow the storage for it ...
Solomon was the most marginal seat at the 2004 election, so the Howard government swiftly went into damage control. In the search for a national waste dump, on ABC radio in the Territory just two days later, the Prime Minister said:
... the rights of the Territory will be no less respected than the rights of Australians in other parts of the country. We’re not going to treat the Territory in a disrespectful fashion ...
This bill is before the Senate because the Territory is not a state. The Prime Minister has gone back on his word to people in the Territory. The whole purpose of the bill is to exploit the Northern Territory because it has fewer rights than a state. Even those rights are about to be trampled by a federal government in a way never seen before in the history of this parliament. Page 5 of the submission of the Northern Territory government to the Senate inquiry says:
The provisions ... set aside specific existing laws made by the democratically elected Legislative Assembly of the self-governing Northern Territory ...
It goes on to say:
a serious erosion of the democratic rights of Territorians, and are contrary to the concept of self-government
                  …         …           …
are contrary to the principles of good governance.
It is mischievous at best to suggest that, because Territorians voted against Shane Stone’s ‘mean and tricky’ statehood model, we should give the green light for the federal government to impose this dump on the Northern Territory. In the lead-up to the last federal election, even Senator Ian Campbell, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, was called on to protect the election prospects of Mr Tollner. Speaking to ABC radio in the Northern Territory on 30 August 2004, he said:
... what we have said quite clearly and unequivocally many months ago is that the Commonwealth is not pursuing any options anywhere on the mainland ... It’s going to be an Australian offshore island. Northern Territorians can take that as an absolute categorical assurance.
It is interesting that the member for Solomon prominently displayed Senator Ian Campbell’s interview on his home page for months after. Strangely, it is not on there now, though. Mr Tollner’s inconsistency on this matter has been breathtaking. On ABC radio on 29 September, he said:
I am not going to sit around and watch a nuclear waste dump be put in the NT.
On 1 October on the radio, he said:
I won’t see the federal government overturn any Territory legislation to situate a national waste repository here ...
On the same day, he said:
There’s never been any plans to locate a national nuclear waste repository in the Northern Territory.
Even until June this year, just prior to the Northern Territory election on 18 June, Senator Scullion was falling over himself to assure Territorians that the government was not going to dump its radioactive waste in the Northern Territory. A week before the election, on 9 June on ABC radio, he said:
There’s not going to be a nuclear waste dump in the Northern Territory.
On the same day, on the radio, he said:
The people of the Northern Territory doesn’t want anybody else’s nuclear waste in the Northern Territory, I represent them and so, ‘not on my watch’.
Territorians have been categorically lied to through the introduction of the bill and are quite rightly outraged by Senator Scullion’s ‘radioactive dump on the road to Damascus’ conversion to supporting the bill. On 15 July this year, less than a month after the Northern Territory election—with no consultation, no scientific study and no explanation for the lies—Dr Nelson announced the three possible sites in the Northern Territory for this waste, with a stunt: sitting on a barrel of low-level waste with gloves, a coat, the works.
The low-level waste repository is a permanent facility likely to house waste needing protection for 100 to 300 years. The intermediate waste stored at the site will need management for thousands of years. This material will be hazardous and dangerous if not stored correctly. But let us be very clear about the implications of this decision. The Territory will also receive Australia’s most toxic long-lived intermediate-level waste: the reprocessed fuel rods from France and Scotland needing management for thousands of years. This intermediate waste, although smaller in volume, will account for 99 per cent of the radioactivity of the waste going to the national dump.
In making this announcement, Dr Nelson further insults Territorians by asking, ‘Why can’t people in the middle of nowhere host the dump?’ People who live at Harts Range, one of the three proposed sites, do not believe it is in the middle of nowhere; it is their home. This government have the view ‘out of sight, out of mind, so let us dump it in the outback’. This bill is designed to frustrate any opposition to the dump. It is heavy-handed and an undemocratic imposition of Commonwealth power. The Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, during the Senate’s public hearing into the bill, pointed out:
It is the adoption of a process that has been described as ‘decide, announce, defend’. It is about backroom decisions being made without consultation and without discussion. It is about the imposition of the nation’s radioactive waste on Territorians without their or their representatives’ involvement in any shape or form.
The sites nominated in this dump site bill were short listed from suggestions by—wait for it—the Department of Defence. Officers from DEST in the Senate hearings admitted that criteria were applied such as proximity to infrastructure, proximity to population centres where you might get some infrastructure support for the facilities, Defence’s plans for the future of the site, and the likely growth constraints on sites. Far from choosing the best sites in Australia, these sites selected have one startling fact in common—they are surplus defence land in the Territory, and that is all.
The National Stores Project was set up by the Commonwealth in 2001 to find a place to store intermediate waste until a better permanent solution was found for it. The two Central Australian sites proposed for the dump in this bill did not even make it to the list, and the Katherine site was marked as less suitable and subject to flooding. The Katherine site is in the middle of Val and Barry Utley’s cattle property. The Little Roper River runs through it on one side and the King River on the other. As Val Utley said at the Senate hearings:
How could anyone choose this place for such a facility? This is a drainage system for an immense area. ... the water sources are sometimes very close to the surface and these areas are like giant sponges, even in the late dry season.
                  …         …           …
Sink holes suddenly appear in the wet season. ... This country is too unstable for such plans, for such a risk, which will be there forever.
In a trip to Katherine less than two weeks ago, I was taken to one of these sinkholes which is just less than five kilometres from the proposed site, and it is the size of this Senate chamber. Numerous fully grown trees have disappeared into its pit, and the locals are baffled about why this site has even seen the light of day when it comes to storing radioactive waste.
There is some suggestion that this bill should be passed because it has support from a wide range of groups. I find that to be an interesting and misleading statement. The only organisation that has publicly expressed total support for this has been the Northern Territory Minerals Council, and that should come as no surprise. In fact, I have found the complete opposite to be the case. From personal emails or submissions to the Senate inquiry, I will give a snapshot of remarks that have been received. The Katherine Horticultural Association said:
This facility will be a negative mark against Katherine products.
Ms Renee Lees said:
Alice Springs has absolutely nothing to gain from a radioactive waste dump and everything to lose.
Gecko Canoeing, a tourist venture in Katherine, said:
NT—Nuclear Territory rather than Nature Territory.
Judith Burke, from Katherine, said:
I am disillusioned and disheartened with the present government and the release of the ... bill.
Bill Daw, from Katherine, said:
There is a fine line between strong leadership and arrogance, and it would seem that this line is about to be crossed on this issue by a mile.
Even the traditional owners of the two sites in Central Australia are opposed to the dump and have said they are concerned about safety and the future security of a nuclear waste dump, the waste being transported on the roads that they use every day, the negative impact on businesses like Alcoota Aboriginal Corporation’s cattle company, the impact on their traditional country and the ability to hunt and get bush tucker. Lindsay Bookie runs a tourist business further east along the Plenty Highway and said that a waste dump would impact heavily on him. He said:
I have talked to the tourists who come to my camp and they say they wouldn’t come anymore because it would spoil the area. I am really worried about all those trucks along that road too. There are so many accidents along there—it wouldn’t be at all safe.
Steven McCormack, who lives close to the Mount Everard site, just 30 kilometres north of Alice Springs, said that a nuclear waste dump would be devastating for him and his family. He said:
This land is not empty—people live right nearby. We hunt and collect bush tucker here and I am the custodian of a sacred site within the boundaries of the defence land. We don’t want this poison here.
The bush tucker issue is particularly concerning for traditional owners, as is the health of species that are part of their environment. The CEO of ARPANSA, when issuing the OPAL reactor construction licence, noted this view of the International Commission on Radiological Protection:
The commission believes that the standard of environmental control needed to protect man to the degree currently thought desirable will ensure that other species are not put at risk. Occasionally, individual members of non-human species might be harmed, but not to the extent of endangering whole species.
Given these views from ARPANSA, it makes you wonder how Senator Scullion could come to this conclusion about the dump on ABC Radio on 8 November:
People are still peddling to a fairly naïve community, complete evil misinformation to make people so afraid ...
That is not an accusation that I would make of Dr John Loy from ARPANSA. He continued:
Anybody that suggests that this is at all dangerous to anything—it is entirely wrong.
The risks of radiation are powerfully expressed in the United Nations Environment Program’s position statement on nuclear risks:
Radiation, by its very nature, is harmful to life. At low doses it can set off only partially understood chains of events which lead to cancer or genetic damage. So, no level of exposure to radiation can be described as safe.
It is particularly concerning that the views of traditional landowners who have title to much of the Northern Territory have been disregarded in this process. The Central Land Council was particularly strong in its rejection of the dump proposal and this bill. It is clear from the submissions of both the Central and Northern land councils that the traditional owners they represent want to retain a right to veto specific sites on environmental or sacred site grounds. The CLC regards the amended provisions of the bill allowing for a land council to propose a site as unworkable. However, the CLC submission also notes:
Until an area is nominated not even the Commonwealth will know what needs to be done for the purpose of selecting a site, in relation to that specific area. It may not even know what needs to be done until some time after it accepts a nomination. Yet the traditional landowners are required to know all of that before they make a nomination.
The Northern Land Council has won some concessions from the Commonwealth in this bill and further amendments will be before us today. But if you examine the evidence that the NLC gave before the Senate committee, you will see that more amendments are needed, especially in relation to the protection of sacred sites. The NLC detailed their problems with the bill both in their submission to the Senate inquiry and in the evidence they gave to the committee. They said:
The Northern Land Council also considers that the Northern Territory Aboriginal Sacred Sites Act, which is administered by a body that is independent of the Northern Territory government, should continue to apply, particularly regarding sites which may be nominated by a land council or the Chief Minister.
In the Senate committee’s hearings I asked the Northern Land Council:
So the bill, as it stands now, still does not satisfy the council’s decision of October, does it?
Mr Norman Fry, the CEO, said:
No. That is why in relation to non-Aboriginal land, and also to the Northern Territory Aboriginal Sacred Sites Act, we say that if this were to be included in the amendment bill then it would be positively appreciated by all and sundry. So we agree with what you are saying.
I then said:
If this bill goes before the Senate in its current form, it would not comply with your council decision of October. Is that correct?
His response was:
That is correct.
The views of the Northern Land Council have been incorrectly reflected. To say that support for this bill is warranted because it has the support of the Northern Land Council is not accurate and, furthermore, the views of the Central Land Council have been ignored.
The second bill in the package, the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management (Related Amendments) Bill 2005, exempts the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Act 2005 from the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. What does that mean? That means that, once the minister can exercise absolute discretion to declare a site as the future site for the nuclear dump, no-one has any redress if they believe the decision to be unfair.
It is also most unfortunate that the plight of cancer patients has been used as an emotive excuse for pushing this draconian legislation on the dump. Again, in a media release on 13 October, Senator Scullion said:
A decision on the final site for the waste management facility must be made by April and a Territory Government legal challenge would take us well beyond that time.
He went on to say:
If a decision is not made within a matter of months Australia will no longer be allowed to produce radioactive isotopes used in hospitals throughout the country.
This is patent nonsense. Medical isotopes will continue to be produced in Australia and imported as needed. Senator Scullion’s scaremongering, in claiming a need for a decision by April on a site for the radioactive waste dump, was exposed in a Senate estimates hearing in November. I asked Dr Ron Cameron from ANSTO about any April deadline for the dump decision affecting production of medical isotopes. He said the only relevance of April next year was the projected date for the licensing of the new reactor. However, ANSTO’s current reactor at Lucas Heights, which produces medical isotopes, is capable of operating for years to come. It has the option to extend its operating licence, which lasts until December 2006.
In conclusion, this bill overrides the rights of Territorians simply because we are not a state. There has been no science in the selection process for the sites nominated in this legislation. There has been no consultation with the Northern Territory government, the communities of Alice Springs or Katherine, and certainly not with the Northern Land Council, the Central Land Council or the traditional owners who will be affected by this decision. If this bill is passed then you may as well rip up the Northern Territory Self Government Act because it makes it irrelevant. This legislation will ensure that any laws created by the Northern Territory government will be overturned by this federal government at any time for politically expediency.
To quote Senator Scullion, who at least got one thing right during this whole abysmal saga, ‘Territorians don’t like having this sort of stuff shoved down our throat because we’re not a state.’ He is damned right. That is the view of people in the Territory. When the euthanasia debate was before this chamber some years ago, a former senator for the Territory, whom I proudly replaced in this chamber, despite not personally supporting the euthanasia debate and not personally supporting the issue of euthanasia, set aside his personal beliefs and stood up for the Territory. He took a stand to protect the legislation that was created by the Northern Territory government. He wanted to ensure at the time that the legitimate rights of Territorians to create their own laws was protected.
Senator Scullion, I urge you today to take 10 steps across this chamber and to stand up for the Territory. This legislation is seriously and deeply flawed. The best interests of the Northern Territory and the Australian community would be better served if this government commenced a rigorous site selection process that is inclusive of the affected communities. This government has not made a compelling case for the urgency or the heavy-handedness of this legislation. These bills are a display of arrogance on the Commonwealth government’s part and they must be scrapped in favour of proper consultative, scientific and inclusive processes for a national nuclear waste facility in this country.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,8,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2005-12-07,"—I also rise to speak on the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2005 and the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management (Related Amendments) Bill 2005. Radioactive waste is a serious problem that requires responsible and prudent management, but this legislation forces the Northern Territory to accept the nuclear waste generated elsewhere and is symptomatic of the failure of governments, state and federal, to work together to find an acceptable solution. No state government has offered to host this repository; indeed, most have specifically prohibited nuclear waste from entering their state. The federal government has had to abandon one proposed national repository site after the next. The search for politically and environmentally acceptable storage solutions for nuclear waste remains a major international problem and a key preoccupation for the nuclear industry and its regulators.
One reason for this might be the mixed messages put out by governments. On the one hand they say that storage methods are safe and there is nothing to be afraid of, and on the other hand they say that storage must be as far away from people and cities as possible. So the people of the Northern Territory rightly ask, ‘Why not put it in your backyard instead of mine, if it is so harmless?’ Perhaps they know better. Perhaps they understand that, according to the United Nations Environment Program, by its very nature radiation is harmful to life. At low doses it can set off only partially understood chains of events which lead to cancer or genetic damage. At high doses it can kill cells, damage organs and cause rapid death. Radiation doses have to reach a certain level to produce acute injury but to cause cancer or genetic damage, in theory at least, just the smallest dose can be sufficient. So no level of exposure to radiation can be described as safe.
It should be stressed that the federal government is looking for a site to store not only low-level waste but also the highest level radioactive waste produced in Australia. Fifty cubic metres of highly radioactive preprocessed waste from over 1,000 existing and future spent fuel rods from Lucas Heights reactor will return to Australia over the next 40 years. This waste is a Commonwealth responsibility, as are the huge quantities of low-level waste from Lucas Heights, including hundreds of tonnes of non-compatible radioactive material from the decommissioned old reactor; 2,000 litres of radioactive contaminated charcoal; 5,000 drums of assorted radioactive waste; 800 drums of thorium, beryllium and uranium; and 2,000 cubic metres of contaminated soil currently stored at Woomera.
It will also accommodate reprocessed spent fuel rods that contain plutonium—a dangerous, long-lived radioactive substance that is difficult to store safely. There are 20 drums of solidified radioactive sludge and 130 drums a year of compactable lower level solid waste—all of it a Commonwealth responsibility and all of it from Lucas Heights. The Lucas Heights reactor will continue to be responsible for the vast majority of radioactive waste generated in this country. While the Commonwealth bleats about the states not doing the right thing by offering up a suitable site, it is worth noting that the New South Wales government considers that Lucas Heights should continue to act as a waste facility rather than transporting waste across that state and others. That was the conclusion of its inquiry into the transportation and storage of nuclear waste early last year.
The inquiry also challenged the need for the new reactor and asked the federal government to look for alternative technologies and sources for radioisotope provision for medical use. The questions that have not been satisfactorily asked or answered are why we need a single national repository for all waste and why low-level waste cannot be stored by each state in one or more above-ground repositories built to the standards required to reduce or eliminate the risk of exposure, and we monitor the effectiveness of that protection.
The Medical Association for the Prevention of War note that long-term security of radioactive waste is essential, but this does not necessarily imply centralised remote geological disposal. They argue, and the Democrats agree:
Centralised remote geological disposal is a political strategy, not a health imperative.
The Democrats argue that it is imperative to manage Australia’s radioactive waste in a responsible, scientifically robust and transparent manner. The proposal that is set out in this bill does not meet this criterion. We have serious concerns about the lack of consultation with and impact on the democratic rights of Territorians and the will of the Northern Territory parliament.
We have concerns about: overriding the rights and interests of local communities and local government authorities along proposed transport routes across Australia; the disregard for the rights and interests of the traditional owners of the proposed dump site areas; the lack of comparative and quantified community risk analysis of continued on-site storage versus risks in the transport of waste to a centralised facility; lack of quantified analysis of the claimed reduction in a number of Commonwealth waste storage sites if the proposed Northern Territory dump facility were to go ahead; lack of comparative costings for enhancing on-site storage facilities for Commonwealth organisations generating radioactive wastes versus the Northern Territory nuclear dump plan, with the continuation of on-site storage facilities for existing users in any case; lack of studies of siting and design for the above-ground option and of comparative analysis of above-ground burial options; and the long-term strategy to reduce and minimise waste generation.
I want to stress that there is no urgency for this legislation. The CEO of the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency has confirmed that there is no urgency. In his 2002 decision on the application to construct the replacement research reactor at Lucas Heights, Mr Loy stated:
Should it come about that the national approach to a waste repository not proceed, it will be necessary for the Commonwealth to devise an approach to final disposal of LLW from Lucas Heights, including LLW generated by operation of the RRR. In the meantime, this waste will have to be continued to be handled properly on the Lucas Heights site. I am satisfied, on the basis of my assessment of the present waste management plan, including the licence and conditions applying to the waste operations on site, that it can be.
This view was recently confirmed at the hearing into the bill, when Dr Loy told the committee:
The material is safely managed at Lucas Heights. In relation to the low-level waste, if the intention is for there to be a repository—that is, for the waste to be disposed of—while it is conceivable that you could put forward Lucas Heights as a site for a repository, it is likely that there are better sites in Australia for a repository for low-level waste; that is, dealing with it by disposal. Lucas Heights certainly can continue to store its low-level waste for a period of time—no question. On the intermediate-level waste, I guess that the issue is one of judgment. It can be stored on the Lucas Heights site. There is no technical reason why it could not be stored on that site for a period of 50 years or whatever. The issue is that, if you are creating a repository co-location of a store, it might seem convenient, useful and appropriate.
Hardly compelling words.
While a repository is theoretically possible, I think there would be better sites; therefore, the argument would be to move it from Lucas Heights to a better site.
Senator Crossin then asked Dr Loy about whether there had not been a determination to have a repository as yet. She said:
... at the end of the day the government decides not to have a repository, it could be possible to amend the ANSTO Act to allow all of the waste to be stored at Lucas Heights?
Dr Loy replied:
Yes.
Further, low-level waste can continue to be safely stored at their respective sites.
The Democrats’ greatest concern is that Canberra’s push for radioactive dumps and stores is not an attempt to genuinely address a growing environmental issue but a move to facilitate an industry expansion that would result in the creation of even more radioactive waste. Our fear has been further fuelled by calls from Minister Brendan Nelson to spend $1 million on research to create a nuclear power industry in Australia. The Democrats believe that the facts are very clear and that a nuclear power industry in Australia would be dangerous and costly and would contribute to greenhouse emissions. We believe it is unnecessary when renewable energies are safer, cheaper and more greenhouse friendly. We believe that this government should be working on a long-term strategy to minimise waste generation in Australia.
We are also concerned that the government is arguing that expansion of Australian nuclear production is necessary for medical purposes, when this is clearly not true. In a press release, Northern Territory Liberal MP David Tollner and Senator Nigel Scullion argued:
A delay would severely limit the availability of life-saving radiopharmaceuticals used in the treatment of cardiovascular disease and early intervention against cancer, particularly breast cancer.
This statement shows ignorance of medical procedures, and it is also misleading. Medical experts argue that the future direction of nuclear medicine lies with cyclotron produced products already being produced in Australia and with accelerators. They argue that Australia can have a secure supply of medical isotopes for cancer treatment, medical research and other applications without another nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights. Australia imports this material on a regular basis when the Lucas Heights reactor is shut down for maintenance. The Medical Association for Prevention of War was scathing of Mr Tollner’s and Senator Scullion’s claims and said:
The “medical necessity” claim is worse than fallacious: it is deliberately misleading. It is a particularly contemptible manipulation of the emotions of the sick and the dying. In the real world of patient care, therapeutic isotopes make only a small contribution to the overall management.
So, given that there is no urgency for a waste dump, proper consultation and exploration of appropriate sites should, we say, be undertaken.
The International Atomic Energy Agency has said that recent experience suggests that broad public acceptance will enhance the likelihood of project approval, that an inclusive approach to public involvement should be adopted from the beginning of the planning process and that providing open access to accurate and understandable information about the development program was critical for trust and acceptance. We have seen the opposite in this process. The government has shown no such courtesy, let alone good sense. The inquiry into the bill heard evidence that the Northern Territory Chief Minister heard about the government’s decision because it was in a press release from the minister. Similarly, Alice Springs Town Council first heard of the proposal on local radio. Property owners adjacent to one of the sites found out about it through a friend.
The pastoral industry have expressed concern that dumping radioactive waste could damage community perceptions of the quality of Northern Territory beef. Similarly, the Northern Territory Agricultural Association argued:
The placement of the facility in close proximity to the region’s Tindal, Oolloo and Jinduckin aquifer system is fraught with danger.
This system supports the Northern Territory’s premier agricultural and horticultural production sites that generate crop commodities worth in excess of $80 million a year.
The government has shown total disregard for the views of traditional landowners in this process. Traditional landowners of the two proposed dump sites in Central Australia have made an absolute statement of opposition to the dump plan and have vowed to actively resist this proposal. They say:
We do not want your nuclear waste dumped on our country.
You and others in Canberra might think that our country is an empty place, that no people live here. We are telling you that there are communities and outstations close to the proposed sites—this is our home and unlike you we cannot move to another place.
                  …         …           …
Our country is alive—there are sacred sites and our law and ceremonies are strong.
We don’t believe that this poisonous waste can be kept safely for thousands of years. You will be gone but our grandchildren will be left to worry.
                  …         …         …
We will not let you turn our country into a waste land.
Despite the Northern Land Council supporting the government’s plans, the committee received a submission from the Djapu clan, one of the largest of the 13 Yolgnu clans in north-east Arnhem Land, arguing that not only had they not been consulted by the government but they had not been consulted by the Northern Land Council. They argued that the NLC cannot speak on this issue on their behalf. In their submission that group said that their people, the clan leaders, not the communities, had not been consulted on this issue by anyone—not the Australian government, not the Territory government, not the Northern Land Council. The clan representative said:
As the senior traditional owner of the Djapu Clan, I say I do not want such a facility anywhere that might affect our land, rivers or sea country. We are very concerned about the safety and environmental impacts of such a facility and the transport of waste. We are also concerned about how the security and surveillance that must accompany such a facility may impact on our lives and region.
The government’s lack of interest in consultation with, and in concerns expressed by, local communities was clearly enunciated by the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Brendan Nelson, when he said on ABC TV:
... why on earth can’t people in the middle of nowhere have low level and intermediate level waste?
One submitter to the inquiry into the bills said in response to the lack of consultation:
There is a fine line between strong leadership and arrogance, and it would seem that this line is about to be crossed on this issue by a mile.
The lack of consultation has been exacerbated by concerns that the nominated sites were selected without any independent expert advice and could potentially have significant environmental consequences. The 92 site selection criteria included factors such as the need to have low rainfall, a site free from flooding, away from ground water that is potable or suitable for agriculture that can be contaminated and away from known tectonic, seismic or volcanic activity. It is clear from evidence that these criteria have not been taken into account, as the sites nominated by the government are prone to flooding and one site is over a major aquifer.
I note that there is a view in the environment sector that burial is increasingly regarded as an inappropriate, out of sight, out of mind, cheap and nasty management option. There is also a view that waste management and storage should be done on site or close to the sites to minimise transportation issues. Dr Loy told the committee inquiry into the bill:
... there is a lot of transport of radioactive material that goes on in Australia and in the world through all sorts of areas. The issues of the containers that are used for transport have been long studied and are well understood. Provided the rules of the code of practice on transport are followed, I believe it can be undertaken safely.
Yet, according to the ACF web site, the federal government’s own figures show that there is a 23 per cent probability of one of the trucks that pass your door having an accident—not good odds when you think about how difficult it is to control or clean up a radioactive spill. Accidents can and do happen on the road, whether it is a collision, a spill, a dangerous fire, a successful terrorist attack, a tyre blow-out or a sleepy driver. The New South Wales parliamentary inquiry found that there was widespread local government and community concern and opposition to the proposed transport of Lucas Heights reactor waste across New South Wales.
The Democrats recognise that radioactive waste is a reality and a serious issue. We are not against a centralised facility and acknowledge that a centralised facility could increase security, efficiency and safety. However, we believe that this needs to be achieved in a responsible, scientifically robust and transparent manner. These bills provide the Commonwealth government with unprecedented power to not only overturn Territory laws specifically established to prevent this scenario but also remove any procedural fairness in the site selection process. We think this is arrogant and yet another display of an undemocratic government drunk on power.
The Democrats support the strategy advocated by the Medical Association for Prevention of War, the ACF and Friends of the Earth. First, the government must minimise waste generation. This can be achieved by terminating the nuclear reactor program at Lucas Heights. Australia’s world-class nuclear medicine capability can be sustained by a combination of importation and local isotope generation, increased research and development of non-nuclear technologies for the production of medical isotopes and safer imaging technologies, MRI, advanced CT, ultrasound and positron emission tomography.
Second, the government should minimise the risk of transportation. Waste management is preferably done on site in a retrievable and secure fashion. Third, the government should focus on establishing a secure, monitored, above-ground storage repository which responsibly addresses the need to maximise long-term safety and does not preclude any improved storage option which becomes available in the future. Fourth, the government should gain community acceptance of the management system based on the principles promoted by the International Atomic Energy Agency. This does not simply mean consultation; the community must give informed consent to the facility.
I will conclude with a quote from the ACF that argues:
Playing politics with the source of a permanent pollution is unacceptable and no politician has a mandate to waste.
The Democrats will not be supporting this legislation.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,8,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2005-12-07,"—The Commonwealth government sees a real necessity for the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2005 and the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management (Related Amendments) Bill 2005 to be passed. Radioactive waste is currently stored in a large number of locations around the country. Commonwealth nuclear waste, as distinct from state government and other waste, is stored at 30 different locations. While those present locations are undoubtedly safe, the storage of waste in this way has long been recognised by state and Commonwealth governments as suboptimal and certainly not world’s best practice. As a result, federal governments of both persuasions have been endeavouring for many years to find a suitable site for radioactive waste management.
This decision has been taken partly in absolute frustration at the level of determination by state governments to block any site that has previously been chosen by the Commonwealth government as a suitable waste site. I refer to efforts from 1992 onwards, even though this process began in 1979. Shortly before 15 November 2000, eight regions were identified as likely to contain suitable sites for a repository. There were, even then, very good criteria established for the choice of those sites. As a result of that announcement of eight regions, the South Australian parliament passed a bill prohibiting the establishment of a storage facility in South Australia. In 2001 the Commonwealth government announced that a site near Woomera was to be the site for a repository for low-level and intermediate-level radioactive waste.
It is important to recognise that all the radioactive waste in Australia is intermediate- or low-level waste. Compared with overseas countries, we hold and produce very little radioactive waste. For instance, at present we hold around 500 cubic metres, equivalent to about eight large shipping containers, of long-lived, intermediate-level radioactive waste. Every year we produce a low amount of low- and intermediate-level, short-lived waste which is also low by international standards—less than the volume of one shipping container. The amounts we are talking about are quite small.
To continue on the issue of the choice of a site: following controversy about the Woomera site which was announced in 2001 the Commonwealth announced that another site on a pastoral property in South Australia would be the location of the repository, which was to take low-level waste only. The South Australian government sought to pre-empt this decision by declaring the site a national park. Although we were successful in acquiring the land, action in the Federal Court followed, culminating in a ruling in 2004 setting aside the compulsory acquisition of the land.
On 14 July 2005 the government announced it was abandoning that repository project and issued the media release announcing the decision to examine the three sites in the Northern Territory. This had previously been noted by the Northern Territory government, which passed a bill in 2004 for the Northern Territory Nuclear Waste Transport, Storage and Disposal (Prohibition) Act 2004 with the specific intention of preventing the Commonwealth from establishing a radioactive waste management facility in the Northern Territory. The Department of Education, Science and Training explained to the Senate committee at the hearing that the reasons for these bills and the necessity to include several provisions in these bills was that the states and territories had made it very clear they would do everything possible to frustrate the Commonwealth’s intentions. Specifically, the Northern Territory government had made it clear it would do everything possible to halt or frustrate the Commonwealth’s actions.
We need a Commonwealth waste repository. The waste that we have and that we produce in this country must be stored safely—not in 30 locations around the country. In addition to that, Australia has contracts to receive reprocessed nuclear waste back from overseas countries in the year 2011. It is imperative that we have a site ready and safely built to take that reprocessed waste.

Needless to say, the scrutiny of the processes to establish the waste repository will take a long time. In fact, we were informed by Dr Loy from the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency that one process in the scrutiny will take up to two years. So we must start now. Senator Allison quoted Dr Loy as saying in 2002 that there was no urgency about a site. I point out to Senator Allison that that is now nearly four years ago, and time has moved on. If we have that deadline of 2011 we must move now. This is why the Commonwealth government have decided to put through this legislation, and I can certainly understand their frustration.
Many of the submissions that the Senate committee received and much of the public comment on this has been about the level of safety and the way in which this will be managed. We could only assume from many of the submissions that we received and much of the comment that has been made that there is a good deal of fear and scaremongering on this issue. Dr Loy, who surely would be regarded as one of Australia’s most eminent scientists, said:
In making a decision as to whether to issue any such facility licence, the CEO—
the chief executive officer—
of ARPANSA is required to take into account, amongst other things: international best practice in relation to radiation protection and nuclear safety; whether the proposed conduct can be carried out without undue risk to the health and safety of people and to the environment; whether the applicant has shown that there is a net benefit from the conduct; whether the applicant has shown that the radiation doses arising are as low as is reasonably achievable ... whether the applicant has shown a capacity to comply with the licence ...
And so on. In the same comment he also said that the acceptable doses that would be allowed for members of the public or workers at the facility would be very low. I am quoting here from his Hansard record, where he said:
So you are looking to see that, during the operation of the repository, the public and the workers receive no more radiation dose from the operations of the repository than they would from any other facility that uses radioactive material. There are well-known dose limits and dose constraints, as they are called in the trade, set down in the international literature to ensure that only very small doses can be received by the public and the workers in the operation of a repository.
Obviously when the CEO was looking at a licence for a repository the applicant would need to demonstrate that the arrangements in a repository make sure that, in the long term—and I am quoting again from his statement—‘the risks arising from accidental exposure are very small’.
Certainly we have recognised in the other place in the debate on this subject that, if these three sites are not suitable, the amendments we have introduced enable the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory and the land council to nominate other sites which they may think are suitable. I would like to congratulate two colleagues from the Liberal-National Party—Senator Scullion and Mr Tollner—on the far-sighted and objective way in which they have looked at this question. They know that Australia as a nation needs a radioactive waste management repository. They have taken a a very courageous decision, but they have also been very far-sighted and very objective about it. I congratulate them on their attitude.
I note with interest that Senator Siewert will be making some remarks on this subject later in the debate. It was very interesting that the Australian Greens did not appear at the hearing. They did not hear the remarks of the stakeholders which contributed to the debate on this topic. You would think that if they were going to make a contribution to the debate then the least they could have done was to appear at the Senate committee hearing on this. I believe that this legislation is important in the national interest. I believe that it should be passed. I am satisfied that the safeguards which will be put in place guarantee that this will be a suitable process to be carried out.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,8,1,speech
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2005-12-07,"—I say at the outset that Labor will be opposing the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2005 and the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management (Related Amendments) Bill 2005—and how ironic it is that the person who has had so much to say on the public record about these bills and the proposal to locate the radioactive waste repository in the Northern Territory and who represents the Territory is not even in the chamber to engage in the debate. These bills are heavy-handed, extreme and unnecessary. Labor oppose this draconian approach because we respect the right of the community, including Indigenous communities, to be consulted about the radioactive waste that will be dumped on their lands and trucked through their highways and byways.
These bills will have three major impacts. First, they allow the government to impose a waste dump on one of three sites in the Northern Territory—Defence department properties at Mount Everard, Harts Range and Fishers Ridge. Second, they give the government total power to site, construct and operate the Commonwealth radioactive waste dump at one of the three sites in the Northern Territory. And, in order to achieve this, these bills allow the government to override all existing and future state and territory law or regulation that prohibits or interferes with the selection of one of these proposed sites or with the establishment of a waste dump and the transportation of waste across the highways and byways of Australia.
The legislation overrides many federal legal protections, including the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984, the Native Title Act 1993 and the Lands Acquisition Act 1989. Notwithstanding any state or territory legislation, the bills give the Howard government the power to do anything necessary for, or incidental to, establishing or operating a Commonwealth waste dump at the chosen site and transporting radioactive waste to it. And, finally, they enable the government to acquire or extinguish all interests in the chosen site.
The third impact is that these bills destroy any recourse to procedural fairness provisions for anyone wishing to challenge the minister’s decision to put a waste dump in the Northern Territory. The Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management (Related Amendments) Bill 2005 puts the nail in the coffin of accountability by making the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 inapplicable to the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2005 once it becomes law. This last extraordinary step means that no-one will be able to hold the government to account for its actions in selecting a site for the waste dump. What if the government trips up yet again? They have already admitted that they put a tax evader on the board of the Reserve Bank. Under these bills, there is absolutely no recourse available to ordinary Australians. No access to the courts is possible.
The most extreme impact of these bills is that they silence local communities. They are an oppressive government campaign to impose a waste dump on the Northern Territory. But the silence is deafening, judging by the 231 submissions received by the one-day farcical Senate inquiry that the government deigned to hold. The government has done its best to sabotage Labor’s and the wider community’s attempts to ensure genuine consultation and debate on these heavy-handed bills. Not only do the bills shut down consultation and dissent but this government’s behaviour with the Senate inquiry has been nothing short of disgraceful.
Labor senators wanted to hold a proper Senate inquiry into the bills to allow Northern Territorians and the broader community to have their say on the nuclear waste dump. But the government senators declared that they were not in the mood to travel to the Northern Territory. Never mind that the government broke its promise not to site a waste dump in the Northern Territory, and never mind that these bills override every single Northern Territory law that gets in the way of the dump—the government has made up its mind. It does not feel like being accountable for its actions and it is certainly not in the mood to brook discussion.
The broken promise on the nuclear waste dump is breathtaking in itself. On 30 September 2004, just before the last federal election, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage ruled out the Northern Territory for a dump site. He said:
The Commonwealth is not pursuing any options anywhere on the mainland, so we can be quite categorical about that, because the Northern Territory is on the mainland.
Next we had the Minister for Education, Science and Training supporting this claim on 24 January 2005 when he stated that the Commonwealth would prioritise an offshore site for the waste dump. He said:
So the Australian Government will be looking at an offshore facility, that is our clear preference. We are determined that it will be an offshore facility, but we are also concurrently looking at a ‘remote’ area, a long way away facility, to store intermediate and low level waste should the offshore site not be available.
The member for Solomon was happy to rule out the Northern Territory as a host for the Commonwealth waste dump as late as 7 June this year. He said:
There’s not going to be a national nuclear waste dump in the Northern Territory ... That was the commitment undertaken in the lead up to the federal election and I haven’t heard anything apart from that view expressed since that election.
The government were happy to promise the world and say whatever it took then, when they were contesting the election. But, after the election, this government were more than happy to sell out the people of the Northern Territory.
Despite the government’s attempts to silence the community and sabotage the Senate inquiry, we saw a flood of submissions from people concerned about the environment, tourism, agriculture and Indigenous heritage. The strength of feeling about the government riding roughshod over the Northern Territory was such that even that token committee had to recognise the huge number of submissions that, as the report said, ‘protested strongly at the Commonwealth’s decision to include in the bills provisions that override existing and future Territory laws’. The government senators went further and rebuked the Department of Education, Science and Training for failing to gain widespread community support. Their group, they said, ‘calls on DEST to be more proactive in adequately informing community groups about the proposal’.
This subversion of the Senate’s democratic processes and effective law-making reflects the Commonwealth’s intentions in this bill. As the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, the Hon. Clare Martin MLA, said at the hearing:
Had the hearing been conducted in the Territory, either in Darwin or in the regional centres closest to the proposed sites of Katherine and Alice Springs, I can assure the committee there would be significantly more Territorians in the room today.
These bills are the abandonment of a transparent, open and inclusive process of rigorous scientific assessment. As the Chief Minister continued:
It is the adoption of a process that has been described as ‘decide, announce, defend’. It is about backroom decisions being made without consultation and without discussion. It is about the imposition of the nation’s radioactive waste on Territorians without their or their representatives’ involvement in any shape or form.
Although the Chief Minister is right about the lack of involvement of Territorians or their representatives, it seems that the Territory’s coalition representatives did not want to be involved. Where was Senator Nigel Scullion in the Senate inquiry? Senator Nigel Scullion was missing in action while his coalition colleagues rode roughshod over the wishes of the Northern Territory.

Senator Scullion interjecting—

—I am very pleased to see that he has now joined us in the chamber. He refused to serve on the Senate committee considering bills that affect his constituents directly. He then did nothing when coalition members refused to travel to the Northern Territory for a committee hearing. Stopping this legislation is Senator Scullion’s last chance to stand up for Territorians before they are trampled by this extreme and arrogant Howard government. If the senator decided to represent the real interests and wishes of his constituents for once, he would find plenty of company on his side. On the side of communities’ rights to have a say in matters that affect them are the Labor Party; the people of the Northern Territory; the Northern Territory government and many state governments; Indigenous land councils and prominent Indigenous leaders like the senior Djapu clan leader in the Northern Territory; and environment groups.
The Central Land Council opposed the waste dump in the Northern Territory, but the government is even willing to trample over Indigenous heritage to establish a waste dump in this country. The Central Land Council, the traditional owners of two of the three possible sites, inform us that they are strongly opposed to the Commonwealth radioactive waste management facility being located at either site or on any part of their country. They go on to say that their primary concern is the need to keep their country safe and healthy for present and future generations so that they are able to continue to use their country for hunting and getting bush tucker.
Perhaps most surprising of our allies in this debate is the cross-party Senate Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. The Senate Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills has expressed serious concerns that the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2005 overrides all state and territory legislation that gets in the way of the nuclear waste dump. The committee said:
The Committee draws Senators’ attention to the provisions, as they may be considered to trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties, in breach of the principle 1(a)(i) of the Committee’s terms of reference.
Principle 1(a)(i) asks the committee to examine all bills before the parliament and report to the Senate whether such bills ‘trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties’. The Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills is also concerned that the bill removes people’s rights, because it gives the minister total power over selecting a site for the waste dump. The committee has demanded that the Minister for Education, Science and Training justify:
... the inclusion of this absolute ministerial discretion and for the abrogation of procedural fairness.
This is extreme and excessive legislation and cannot be justified by a democratic government. This report of the Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills is a further blow to the legitimacy of the waste dump legislation, and the government should drop these extraordinary bills immediately.
The government should dump the dump bills, not only because they are an extraordinary power grab for any democracy but because the government’s proposed sites were picked for political reasons. The Department of Education, Science and Training made an incredible admission over the proposed sites. They admitted that they had sought no independent expert advice whatsoever to aid site selection. The department has said:
No, we did not have a panel of external advisers. There was nothing like the store committee, for instance.
No geologist, no environmental scientist, no nuclear scientist and no health expert—just officials from the department and the minister for education.
The minister has politicised every single project and grant that he has touched; from flagpoles to research grants, everything has the minister’s grubby, partisan hands on it. How then can we have any faith in the integrity of this minister? How can we believe that there is any objective scientific basis for the suitability of these particular sites apart from the minister’s own firm belief that he can trample all over the Northern Territory?
There is certainly enough suggestion of the unsuitability of these three sites. The original site selection criteria, established after the search for a site recommenced in 1992, included: low rainfall, freedom from flooding, good surface drainage, stable geomorphology, a generally stable hydrogeological setting and a water table at least five metres below the buried waste. They also recommended geology and hydrogeology amenable to modelling ground water and radionuclide movements; that it be away from known or anticipated tectonic, seismic or volcanic activity that could destabilise disposal structures or affect the containment of the waste; and that no ground water that is potable or suitable for agriculture can be contaminated. As well, they recommended low population density with little prospect for increase or development, and geochemical and geotechnical properties that inhibit radionuclide migration and facilitate repository operations.
Environmental considerations were paramount to site selection but were nonexistent in the three sites proposed by the minister. The Fishers Ridge site is particularly worrying, as it is in the highest rainfall zone in the Northern Territory and is over a major aquifer, the Tindal aquifer. This aquifer is important in providing water for several local horticultural developments. Flooding and wildfire are also serious issues in Katherine. As the Chief Minister said:
The location of a radioactive waste facility at Fishers Ridge raises concerns for the town’s water supply, the environment and tourism. These issues should immediately have removed Fishers Ridge from contemplation on even the most cursory scientific analysis.
Ground water and flooding are also major concerns in the Harts Range site near Alice Springs and, as the Chief Minister pointed out, the underground water beneath this area can make the sediment highly permeable. She said:
Looking at the second site, Harts Range, the underground water beneath this area has sediments that are likely to be highly permeable. There is significant ground water in the area which feeds into surrounding creeks. The site is between two very active waterways, the Ongeva and the Anamarra creeks, and a rare megaflood has the potential to damage any radioactive storage facility. Again, a scientific analysis would probably have removed Harts Range from consideration at a very early stage.
I point out that these are the kinds of concerns which the local residents would have raised at DEST’s so-called consultations in the Northern Territory, and that should have set off warning signs for the department and the minister.
It is unacceptable for the department to front up to the Senate committee, shrug their shoulders and say, ‘She’ll be right,’ when they have used no independent scientific expertise whatsoever. The minister is asking us to trust him while he leads a blindfolded Australian public into one of the many giant sinkholes in the Katherine area. Senator Crossin described that sinkhole, which she visited a few weeks ago. The government’s case for rushing this legislation through this year, and for overriding community dissent and any territory, state or federal laws that get in the way, is a house of cards. Labor accepts the need for a national waste dump, but we will not ride roughshod over the wishes of Territorians or any other local communities that will have radioactive waste transported along their streets and highways. Labor believes that we must bring the community with us on a waste dump—something the government seems to have not understood in its nine long years of trampling over the Australian community.
Community consent and consultation are not avant-garde concepts. The National Energy Agency of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development insists:
In order to build confidence in the process of establishing a waste dump it is important that it can be explained and, even more important, that it can be understood as being open, transparent, fair and broadly participatory.
To achieve openness and transparency there must be appropriate procedures in which stakeholders and the public can participate and validate claims of trust, legitimacy and authenticity ... Actions and decisions must be justified.
In its radioactive waste management status and trends update, the International Atomic Energy Agency advises:
It is now widely believed that an important element in establishing public confidence in a particular waste management strategy is the perceived trust and credibility of the implementing organization and of the regulatory authority. Establishing trust can be enhanced when an inclusive approach to public involvement is adopted from the beginning of the planning process to help ensure that all those who wish to take part in the process have an opportunity to express their views and have access to information on how public comments have been considered and addressed.
Those words—trust, credibility and inclusiveness—might as well be in Swahili for this government. It has absolutely no idea of what these words mean or why they might be important in the process of selecting a site for a nuclear waste dump. This government cannot engender trust when it shuts out the public’s ability to question and to know. It cannot have any credibility left as it overrides the major environmental and Indigenous heritage legislation. It cannot be inclusive if it peddles untruths about the waste dump and refuses to hear the concerns of Territorians. For all of these reasons, Labor will oppose these bills, and I will now move an amendment standing in my name on behalf of the opposition. I move:
At the end of the motion, add:
“but the Senate condemns the Government for:
              (a)    its extreme, arrogant and unnecessary approach to the nuclear waste dump;
              (b)    misleading Australians about the necessity of the bill despite believing that the Government already has the power under existing laws to site and establish a waste dump;
              (c)    breaking its promise not to locate a waste dump in the Northern Territory;
              (d)    overriding many federal legal protections including the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984, the Native Title Act 1993, and the Lands Acquisition Act 1989;
              (e)    destroying existing or possible rights of indigenous people to the proposed waste dump sites in the Northern Territory;
               (f)    trampling over Northern Territorians and other communities by overriding any existing or future State or Territory law or regulation that prohibits or interferes with the selection of Commonwealth land as a site, the establishment of a waste dump, and the transportation of waste across the highways and by-ways of Australia;
              (g)    refusing to hear the concerns of Northern Territorians and imposing nuclear waste on local communities without consultation or building trust and inclusiveness;
              (h)    misleading Australians by falsely claiming that unless the waste dump site is selected urgently, medical isotope production will cease;
               (j)    destroying any recourse to procedural fairness provisions for anyone wishing to challenge the Minister’s decision to put a waste dump in the Northern Territory; and
              (k)    disregarding the International Atomic Energy Commission’s recommendations on good social practices like consultation and transparency in relation to nuclear waste”.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,8,1,speech
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2005-12-07,"—‘Dinna bwino,’ Mr Acting Deputy President Barnett—that is ‘good morning’ in Swahili! Whilst I am very pleased to speak to the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2005 and the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management (Related Amendments) Bill 2005, I have to reflect my disappointment about the degradation of the currency in this debate since it started in 1992. The last six months of this debate have been an absolute disgrace. It is a disgrace because those on the other side have decided to change the currency. It should be a currency of this place not only to debate and pass legislation but also to inform Australians. It has gone from informed, factual, scientifically assessed and validated information for people to consume, to misinformation, untruths, complete lies and scaremongering. That is what the debate has come to on that side. I am very proud that we on this side have continued to be reasoned and clear and use scientific facts in regard to the debate on this matter—and it is not a new debate; it is not something that has never been done before.
The process that we are following in establishing a radioactive management facility has in fact been done in many countries around the world, where it is not even notable because this is simply a responsibility that those nations have taken on seriously. Ironically, the process started here in 1992 when Simon Crean, the member for Hotham—very responsibly at that time, I have to say—noted that you have to recognise the need to deal with an existing and potentially ongoing inventory of radioactive waste. That was what the Labor Party said in 1992. Labor are the people who throw around lines like ‘trust, credibility and inclusiveness’. They started the process and said: ‘There’s the process. Let’s move into the future. We’re going to have a scientific based process to establish exactly where this facility is going to go.’ It was a very long process, it was expensive and it was all very inclusive. In fact, it was inclusive to the extent that every state and territory agreed that that would be the process—every state and territory, which represented every person who lived in that state and territory—which obviously includes, for your benefit, Senator Stephens, every Australian. So one would have thought that your process was inclusive.
It is extremely disappointing to hear that, after that process has been gone through—and it was a reasonable process; good on you, member for Hotham: it was reasonable stuff, and the Howard government supported it and then implemented it—it now gets shafted by those on the other side of this place and by Mike Rann and the South Australian branch of the Labor Party. So I take umbrage at your use of words like ‘trust’ and ‘credibility’. Do not come to this place with that sort of garbage unless you have something to back it up. This was a process—a responsible process—started by your side of government, but suddenly you want to politicise it because it is not handy to support the government at the moment. So it is just another rant in this place that has absolutely no basis in science or any argument at all. You should be supporting this legislation, and so should Clare Martin, the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory.
Some time ago, when you started talking about this process, saying that it has to be based on the best science, a lot of pundits around the place started commenting on it. I note that recently one of our rocket scientists on the other side, the member for Lingiari, said, ‘Why don’t we just leave it at Lucas Heights?’ I know those on the other side are a bit ashamed about their history in almost every aspect of politics, but I would very much commend them to look at the processes in 1995, when your government moved the entire repository to Woomera. I have some facts for the member for Lingiari. He said, ‘Why don’t we leave it at Lucas Heights?’ I am sorry, Mr Snowdon, we cannot because it is on the other side of the world. It is not at Lucas Heights. It is at Dounreay in Scotland and COGEMA in France. Just a cursory look at the facts of this matter would make Mr Snowdon informed, and then he could enter the debate as an informed individual instead of as someone who is just thrashing around the place trying to frighten people and skew the facts to show that somehow Labor have done the right thing when it is patently obvious to anybody who understands any history about this matter that that is not the fact.
A number of issues have been brought up today in this debate. One of them is about the timing. People have said: ‘What’s the rush? We can hang around forever. It’s okay. We’ll consult some more.’ In fact, some people have said: ‘I know what we’ll do. Let’s have some more science. That’s what we’ll do. We’ll have a rigorous process that looks at the science of this process.’ We have just had one of those. Unfortunately, you have to have some trust, credibility and inclusiveness in that—they were the words you used. After the Labor Party sit down this time, will they breach their word in 12 years time? Who would know? But I can tell you that this is a process that, because of history, this side of government do not have a lot of faith in.
In August 2000, the CEO of ARPANSA, Dr John Loy, stated:
With regard to the intermediate-level waste store, there would need to be substantial and evident progress, such as the features of the design settled, citing criteria established and a strategy and timeline in place for sites ... that it was moving forward clear paths to its future establishment and I would be satisfied that a store will exist.
That is the single reason that the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2005 has been introduced. It has been introduced because the Northern Territory government have sought to put in place delays. They have sought to put in place impediments to this happening. And they have sought to put in place delays to ensure that it confuses government. While they are doing that, they have had very little thought for Australians, because they also know that by April the same Dr Loy and his organisation will make an assessment. Around April they will ask, ‘About how far have we got to go?’ It is going to take about six years to go through the whole process—a very short time to build a facility. Those six years are almost committed to because this is a very rigorous, scientific process.
Again, this government bases such decisions on facts and science—very rigorous. We have to convince the Minister for the Environment and Heritage—although we do not actually have to convince a person; we have to convince one of the largest omnibus bills ever brought into this place, the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Those on the other side who have an interest in these things, and I know some do, will understand that the rigour of that act, as supported effectively by them, is not easy to get around. Then we have to convince ARPANSA that all the safety processes in terms of storage are met. We then have to go on to say that the Australian Safeguards and Non-Proliferation Office has been satisfied. That is going to take much time. If ARPANSA and Dr Loy are not convinced by April next year then it is unlikely that he is going to say that we have met our international obligations.
After having used radiopharmaceuticals for 48 years, we have the capacity in this country to make a decision in Australia’s interest and say, ‘We are going to do this,’ and that is what is happening here today. We have said we are introducing this bill to remove any doubt about the Commonwealth’s capacity to deliver something in the national interest. We need a single, purpose-built facility, and of course we look to science and good scientists. In September this year, Professor Snow Barlow, who was the President of the Federation of Australia Scientific and Technological Societies, said:
Dispersed storage of radioactive waste is not a viable long-term strategy and is potentially hazardous, inefficient and impossible to completely secure.
Good science? There are no problems about that. He is somebody of absolutely reliable reputation who continues to write papers in the area. We know we can trust this man. We know that we are doing the right thing, based not on rhetoric but on science.
Another issue is the reliability of supply. I have to say that there are some people with declared agendas—the Greens, effectively. I do not want to pre-empt what the Greens will say, but I know, by simply reading their web site, that they are not particularly keen on uranium after it is out of the ground. I can understand that and I respect that. The Democrats are of a similar ilk. Certainly, Senator Allison is, and I respect that, because that is her agenda. But there are those on the other side who say, ‘It is okay; we can mine and use uranium,’ but who all the same will not accept good science. If you look at the movement of these radiopharmaceuticals internationally you see some call: ‘It is okay; we will import it. Don’t worry; we do not need Lucas Heights. We can import it. There is no concern at all. We will make a fundamental part of our health system reliant on another country. It is okay; nothing will happen.’ But, again, we have to rely on some science. In September this year the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, told the IAEA general conference:
The Secretariat has continued to meet with commercial carriers, regulatory authorities and modal organisations of the United Nations to determine how to address the increasing denial of shipments of medical radioactive materials.
There is a bit of a surprise—we could be importing from another country and suddenly find out that the transportation people say, ‘We do not really want to carry this material.’ What better scientific evidence is there that we need a reactor here, we need to continue to have the benefits of radiopharmaceuticals for our health system and we need to ensure that the processes to meet our international obligations are met? That is why it is essential to support the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Bill.
The government needed to act and they have acted. They proposed three sites in the Northern Territory. They did not act by going to the Northern Territory because they thought they were the best places. Some in DEST and the minister will probably assert that there was a good scientific basis for it but I have always said that that is just rubbish. The level of amenity in the three places selected is (a) they are Commonwealth land and (b) they were not being used. That is all the choice they had. The choice was taken from them by the Labor Party. Mike Rann said, ‘I am breaching the agreement; it is not going in section 40a in Woomera,’ which is where the very best scientific process in Australia said it should go. He breached his word and so the Commonwealth had no choice. Territorians, believe me, none of us are putting us in this situation. The South Australian branch of the Labor Party did. And when I pleaded with the chief minister as recently as last night to pick up the phone and ring her mate she declined and she did not indicate whether she had done that previously. I had to write to Mr Rann last week and I am still waiting for a reply. But I think it is absolutely outrageous hypocrisy.
—What did that South Australian leader of the opposition say?
—Let me tell you about absolute hypocrisy. She does not want to ring him to say, ‘Will you put the site where it should go?’ but she is happy to say, ‘G’day, Mike, old mate—what about I do a deal taking your yellowcake through Alice Springs, Tennant Creek, Katherine and Darwin? That is okay.’ You should be careful about the interjections from the other side because you have no moral high road left on this issue. During the phone call would it not have been easier to say, ‘Mike, if you want to bring your yellowcake through the centre of this country, what about consulting with the Central Land Council?’ They were in my office the other day saying, ‘Nigel, we do not want this.’ I said, ‘But Clare is bringing yellowcake through your country,’ and they said, ‘We did not know that.’ Consultation, truth, transparency—they have to rub both ways.
The Labor Party have completely misrepresented the situation and have outrageously exaggerated the claims. Lyn Allison mentioned turning the land into a wasteland. I have spoken to Aboriginal people who are really upset. They have said: ‘All the wallabies are going to die, Nigel. It is going to poison our water.’ I am suspicious about who has provided those lies to those people. No-one on the other side has said, ‘No, that is not the case.’ I do not hear that. Yet they know in their hearts and they should know in their minds that that is wrong. It is particularly wrong to provide that sort of misinformation to naive communities that do not have the opportunities and sometimes the education to understand exactly what is going on with this issue.
They have a responsibility to ensure that the Northern Territory are well represented and informed, rather than spreading the absolutely outrageous claims we have had, including from Minister Vaskalis. He said that we are going to ruin the clean green image of the Northern Territory. Only the activities, the misinformation and the grubby lies spread by a number of people in the Northern Territory are going to impact on the clean green image of the Northern Territory. If you had a reasonable debate you would know that there would be no threat to any of those things.
I know that they are aware that French champagne and camembert are produced adjacent to some of the largest low-level and intermediate repositories in the world. Do I like champagne? I prefer Australian sparkling wine, but champagne is sold throughout the world. I do not mind a bit of camembert—though I prefer my Tasmanian cheeses—but I think that it is a pretty spurious claim to make. Again, it is scaremongering. Let’s frighten the people—an age-old ploy.
I did listen to the concerns of Territorians, as I said I would. I listened very carefully. I fronted a number of information sessions and opportunities to interact and I carefully guided and looked at what the concerns of Territorians were. The Country Liberal Party, David Tollner and I decided to reflect those concerns in a series of amendments in the other place. Those amendments that are now contained in this bill deal with ensuring that we have a prohibition on high-level waste and on international waste. We have indemnified the Northern Territory against any costs and damages associated with this process. We have ensured that it is legislated that the Northern Territory repository—currently in the basement of the hospital, but we do not want to talk about that too much—is stored for free in this new facility. We have another person put on the Radiation Health and Safety Advisory Council, a better level of amenity for Territorians with the Territory government.
Most importantly, instead of saying that they are the three sites, we have expanded the sites by ensuring that there are extensions to schedule 1 that allow the Northern Territory government, the Central Land Council and the Northern Land Council to be able to provide a nomination should they choose. I have had many pastoralists and landowners ringing me, saying: ‘Why did you have to make the Northern Territory government do this? Why couldn’t we have nominated ourselves? We think that we have got a great level of amenity.’ I said that I did not want to disempower the Territory government in this matter. Governments of that nature are responsible for land. It is up to them and it will be up to Clare Martin to deal with those issues. The Central Land Council have made their views clear, particularly the traditional owners from Mount Everard and Harts Range, and I have spoken to them at length. They have made it very clear that they are not happy with it going there and I respect those wishes. For those reasons we now have an opportunity to spread that right out.
The behaviour of the Northern Land Council in this matter shows integrity and leadership and it deals with the national interest. I commend John Daly and the secretariat, particularly Norm Fry and Ron Levy, on their work in this matter. It is very difficult to provide an entire council, go away to Bynoe Harbour with no-one else there, and then provide advice from independent scientists and from ANSTO and to go and ask any questions they liked. They did that and unanimously decided that they wanted to do something. Their press release said:
The Full Council of the Northern Land Council has called for an amendment to the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2005 so that a Land Council can nominate an alternative site in the Northern Territory for a waste facility provided that the traditional owners agree and sacred sites and environmental issues continue to be protected under current legislation.
They went on to say:
The storage of radioactive waste from medical treatment is clearly a matter of national importance.
Leadership! It is great to see that. They are tremendous Australians—good on you, John Daly. The press release made a couple of comments about the Chief Minister. It said:
The Chief Minister knows full well that a waste facility may be safely built in some parts of the Northern Territory—but carefully says nothing about this issue.
She is silent on those things. Is it a balanced debate? Is it a balanced discussion? No. So when we are talking about those iconic processes of truth and integrity, Senator Stephens, I think your side in the Northern Territory leaves a lot lacking. John Daly went on to say:
The Chief Minister also knows full well that 400,000 Australians receive radioactive medical treatment every year, and the small amount of waste generated should be stored safely in a secure national repository—not in hospital basements or shipping containers in over 100 different locations in Australia.
He continued:
This dismal performance—
referring to the Chief Minister—
can only damage the position of traditional owners in remote locations who may welcome development and seek outcomes which benefit all Australians.
This government would have preferred to act in cooperation with the states and territories. You cannot go to sleep in the Commonwealth; it has to be a state or territory. Life saving benefits go to those people in the states and territories. We are not getting the cooperation of the states and territories because they are Labor states and territories. This is an act of bastardry against the Australian people. I am proud to be part of a government that will not shy away from our responsibilities and I commend the bills to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,8,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2005-12-07,"—Before I commence my comments I would like to address the rather cheap shot that Senator Troeth had at the Greens for not attending hearings of the Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee. It is outrageous and a hide when they called so many committee meetings that week. I was in another committee hearing, welfare to work, so could not attend two places at once, as much as I would have liked to. I also missed out on going to the native title committee hearings and the environment committee meetings on salinity—issues very dear to my heart. I think that it is outrageous that the government takes this cheap shot.
They called the one-day committee hearing on a day that the other member of the Greens, Senator Milne, who would have attended, could not make. It is outrageous that they level cheap shots at the Greens for not being able to attend committee meetings, when they call the meeting for one day, not really intending for the committee hearing to have any genuine outcomes. I am extremely concerned that the government, after putting the Senate through those dreadful two weeks, would deign to take such a cheap shot.
I believe that at any normal time the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2005 would be one of the more offensive pieces of legislation in this chamber for a while—probably by a clear margin. However, given the extraordinary fortnight we have just had, I suppose it is just one of a crowd of pieces of appalling legislation. We have before us now a bill that purports to manage the most dangerous waste material produced by any Australian industry. Whether we like it or not and whatever we choose to do with it, this waste will still be dangerous to our children’s descendants in thousands of years.
While there are a few people in the community who are so blase about this material that they suggest it can be treated like any other waste, the Australian government has gone to great lengths to assure us that it recognises the intrinsic hazards involved. The government believes that this waste is so dangerous that it needs to be evacuated from Sydney and placed as far from human habitation as possible. Extensive site selection studies for a dump site were undertaken in 1992 and have been continuing in some form ever since. These studies produced a shortlist of eight sites in July 1994. The maps from this period feature a bold heading that says:
No areas were considered within the Murray-Darling Basin or the Great Artesian Basin because of their important water and agricultural resources.
According to the Commonwealth government, this waste is so dangerous that it should not reside in such areas. In all of the studies undertaken until last year, when it was clear that the government was intent on dumping this stuff in South Australia, the final resting place for the nation’s high-level waste was to be not in some outback, isolated shed, but in a deep geological repository hundreds of metres or more below the surface. Whatever the Greens think of the safety of this plan, it is a measure of the government’s apparent respect for the hazardous nature of this waste that the plan has always been to dump it as far from human beings as possible, deep underground, in an area where inevitable contamination will not ruin resources of importance to future populations. The question of whose backyard it ends up in and how it gets there are problems I will turn to in a moment.
Contrast this with the approach embodied in the bill which the government has placed before the Senate. In essence, the bill is a ‘get out of jail free’ card for the Howard government. It bypasses the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act for the entire site selection process, kicking in after the site has been selected and allowing government officials and contractors to do whatever they like without regard to Australia’s most significant piece of environmental legislation. This strikes at Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage protection, extinguishes native title, pushes aside the unique protections of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act and dismisses any entitlements to procedural fairness in relation to the minister’s declarations. The government has rammed this through with minimal scrutiny—it gave a Senate committee, as I articulated earlier, one whole day to examine the consequences—and picked on a politically vulnerable territory without the rights of a state and with only a handful of coalition MPs, who have comprehensively hung it out to dry.
It is hard to imagine a more ruthless approach to dealing with this waste or a sharper contrast with what we might fondly imagine to be best practice. When the government was forcing the stuff on South Australia, at least there was some pretence of scientific vigour. Geological surveys were done, communities were told what to expect and sites were narrowed down according to a complex, multicriteria model. All of those are things of the past. The Howard approach in 2005 is to simply choose a handful of convenient sites on Commonwealth land in the Territory and pass a piece of legislation putting any form of due process permanently out of reach.
This has moved beyond science and of course is now into the realm of pure politics. If the science minister had taken the time, he could have sat down with traditional owners from Central Australia who visited Parliament House in early November. He would have heard that there are 5,000 people living in close proximity to the two proposed sites in Alice Springs. He would have discovered that the sites in the catchment area are every bit as important to the local residents as the Great Artesian Basin and the Murray-Darling Basin. He would have been reminded that there is nowhere truly out of sight and out of mind where this material can be dumped and forgotten. Anywhere in Australia is someone’s backyard. To target from Canberra someone else’s land and so easily extinguish their rights is reprehensible—particularly when this is done by senators opposite who call themselves champions of private property rights. The concept of terra nullius, which was rejected by the High Court in 1992, is clearly still alive and well in this country.
In discussions with government, the Northern Land Council took a different approach to that of the Central Land Council and suggested that Indigenous communities wanted the right to nominate a site, rather than having one forced on them. With this came the demand for the right of veto—something you would think a government that spends a lot of time talking about private property rights and private rights would support—but the land council got done over. They have been given the right to nominate a site but no-one has the right to reject one.
While we are told that this is all about responsible management of existing waste, in reality we are just clearing the decks so that more of the stuff can be produced. The government and ANSTO are determined to proceed with their plan for a new reactor that will generate another 1,600 spent fuel rods, which will, according to ANSTO documents, result in a 12-fold increase in annual production of intermediate-level fluids and a four-fold increase in the annual production of all other waste categories. I remind senators that the facility producing this waste is subject to contention by the very people whom the government uses to justify its very existence. A 2004 report by health professionals under the banner of the Medical Association for Prevention of War concluded:
The new nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights in Sydney is not required for medical purposes
                  …         …           …
Like most other comparable countries, Australia can have world-leading nuclear medicine care without a reactor by importing reactor-produced isotopes and producing many other isotopes here in cyclotrons.
This morning, a statement by 18 prominent medical professionals was released, in part noting:
As doctors we are professionally and personally committed to preventing disease and promoting health, today and into the future. We have become increasingly alarmed at proposals for expansion of the nuclear industry in Australia.
These are professionals the government is relying on to justify the existence of the reactor that is the source of this waste. They do not want it. Talk within government circles about a commercial nuclear power industry in Australia is equally worrying. There are no prizes for guessing where the waste from Australian nuclear power stations will end up if they are ever built. We do not need the research reactor that is producing this material. We need to take a good hard look at the waste that already exists and deal with that.
The Greens are frequently accused of opposing but not proposing, so here are a couple of propositions that go to the heart of this matter. I recognise that this government has inherited a headache dating back to February 1954 which has been poorly dealt with by successive governments for over half a century. I propose that we phase out the production of this waste, the first stage of which is to cancel any further expenditure on a replacement reactor in Sydney. I propose to move an amendment which clearly outlaws the import of nuclear waste from overseas. We have been told that this dump is intended for Commonwealth waste only, and this should be made clear in the government’s bill. Territorians are rightly concerned that, on the heels of thousands of tonnes of Canberra’s nuclear waste, thousands of tonnes of radioactive waste from other parts of the world will follow. I urge the government to clarify its intentions in this regard and support this amendment.
I propose that, by way of the most basic due process, Indigenous people should be given the power to oppose a waste dump site as well as to propose one. I also propose that we pay attention to experts around the world who suggest that moving this waste may in fact be the most dangerous strategy in some cases, and that moving it while it is exempt from the laws which have been specifically put in place to protect people and the environment is a recipe for disaster.
This document comprising 144 pages and titled Let the facts speak articulates over 50 years worth of accidents in the nuclear industry. No matter what the process for choosing a site is, the transport of waste still represents a formidable obstacle to safe management, and this document articulates hundreds of accidents involving transport of nuclear waste. We are talking about shipments of reprocessed nuclear fuel passing through Darwin harbour for trucking to Central Australia along public highways, and several shipments per year from Sutherland Shire by road, halfway across the continent, through many communities along the way. It will be the largest movement of hazardous waste in Australian history, and it is wholly unnecessary.
The way in which this legislation is drafted to override state and territory laws gives rise to huge concerns that corners will be cut. I will move amendments during the committee stage to address this transport factor and ensure that the relevant state and territory legislation is not overridden. In an Australian context, this means rationalising nuclear waste management in this country so that states move to safeguard the waste in secure storage, while the considerable expertise present here and overseas is turned to the question of dealing safely with the more hazardous material that has been piling up at Lucas Heights for half a century.
High- and intermediate-level nuclear waste, which looks so intractable to 21st century eyes, may yield to promising technologies such as transmutation or synroc—potential solutions in which Australian researchers have played no small part. But this could take decades, and the waste needs to be safeguarded rigorously in the meantime. The very existence of these promising lines of research make it obvious that the very last thing we should be doing with this waste is trucking it to a remote location and tipping it into a hole in the ground.
In pushing so aggressively for a dump of this kind, the government forecloses options that may bear fruit in the future. The Australian Greens recognise that this waste exists and that there are no easy solutions before us. We are prepared to work with those that are ready to look at alternative approaches to this issue with a clear sense of long-term responsibility. There is no reason why nuclear waste management needs to assume the kind of hostility to environmental protection, land rights and public health for which it is notorious. But the government’s current approach is unacceptable to us. For this reason, we do not support the legislation.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,8,1,speech
"Trood, Sen Russell",LP,2005-12-07,"—It is a great pleasure to participate in this debate on the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2005 and the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management (Related Amendments) Bill 2005. This is another example of the Howard government proceeding with matters on the nation’s agenda which are of considerable importance. This matter is certainly of that character. It is a matter that goes back a very long way. It is a matter that has been unresolved for a very long period of time, and it needs resolution.
The early stages of consultation between the Commonwealth, the states and the territories on this matter go back at least to the 1970s, when there was a process in place which was designed to resolve the problem of where Australia’s low- and medium-level waste would be stored. That process proceeded essentially on a bipartisan basis for a long period of time. By the time we got to about 1992, there was a paper which provided a set of criteria as to the requirements for a storage facility. It was a paper which was agreed amongst the Commonwealth, the states and territories. Various regions were identified in the context of this paper, and eventually a site in South Australia was identified as the most desirable site.
One could go through the full detail of this matter, but I do not think it serves any particular purpose, other than to say that by the time we got to 2004-05, when we had a site identified, the South Australian government, like all the other state governments, had decided that it was going to do everything in its power to prevent the establishment of this site in South Australia. Of course, this represents a problem. It represents a syndrome which is all too redolent around the country at the moment. It is a shameful syndrome because it reflects the fact that no state was prepared to take responsibility to cooperate with the Commonwealth to provide a facility in which to store this low- and medium-level waste. It is a ‘not in my backyard’ syndrome. No state or territory was prepared to take leadership on the issue and say, ‘This is a national responsibility. We all need to contribute to it; we all need to take some responsibility for the problem.’
So we found ourselves, at the end of 2004-05, with no facility. We also had at that time a statement by the Northern Territory government that, if any attempt was made to try and site material in the Northern Territory, it would be opposed by the Northern Territory government. So the outlines of this debate were clear from the very beginning: the Northern Territory government was opposed to it.
What was the Commonwealth to do in those circumstances? The opportunities for consultation with the Northern Territory government were very clearly foreclosed. There was no likelihood that the Northern Territory government was going to be rational, sensible, accommodating or in any way cooperative with the Commonwealth on this matter. So the Commonwealth did what it was essentially forced to do by the position taken up by the Northern Territory government. It said that the facility would be established in the Northern Territory.
There has been a charge made in this debate that the Commonwealth has acted in a very heavy-handed way and shown contempt for the processes of the Northern Territory government, has overridden the legislative rights of the Northern Territory government, has essentially ignored all of the processes and will create a situation where all of the checks and balances which would normally be created and used to site a facility of this kind will be overridden. Of course, nothing of the kind was ever intended.
Once this decision had been announced by the Commonwealth, the Northern Territory government decided not only that it was going to oppose the decision but also that it would delay, prevent, obstruct and do every single thing in its power to preclude the siting of this facility on its territory. Not only did it make a rhetorical claim about this but it also produced a document headed, What you need to know about Canberra’s proposed nuclear dump. This document purported to provide Territorians with information about the dump. It is a document which—if one is being generous—at the very least contains a series of half-truths and misrepresentations about the nature of this dump. It asserts that Australia’s highest grade nuclear waste is to be stored in the facility. That was never the intention. It makes accusations about the fact that nuclear waste poses a serious danger to humans and the environment for many thousands of years. It may be toxic in certain senses but, of course, we all know that it can be stored safely. That was always the intention. It makes representations about a range of terminal and debilitating medical conditions that have been directly linked to exposure to nuclear waste. There was no evidence provided for that proposition and, indeed, in all the evidence that we received in the committee—on which I was privileged to sit—there was little of that kind as well. This document purported to inform Territorians about the new dump; what it did was whip up a great deal of sentiment against the siting of the facility in the Northern Territory.
When giving evidence before the committee, the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory sought to make the point that it was no business of hers, and no business of her government, to provide the case for the dump. I have sympathy for that proposition, but I do think that the Northern Territory government has the responsibility to provide balanced information and, at the very least, not to represent the case as it was inclined to do in this particular document. It set out as best it could to prey on the fears that people have about nuclear facilities. Of course, those fears are widespread in the community. There are a large number of anxieties about nuclear waste, so a responsible government would have, perhaps, said: ‘This matter needs to be resolved; we ought to show some leadership and try to encourage people to recognise that there are some dangers, certainly, but that they can be overcome.’ That was never the position of the Northern Territory government.
What is more distressing is the hypocrisy of the Northern Territory government’s position about this particular matter, because the Northern Territory government, when it came to the committee, asserted the proposition that the politics be taken out of the issue and the focus be on the science. But evidence from the Northern Territory at the committee was that the Northern Territory government had not taken one step and had made absolutely no effort to try to inform itself of the science. Not only did it take no steps to try to inform itself of the science but it also made no attempt to try and inform Territorians of the science. The hypocrisy of this position was absolutely astounding. The Chief Minister was exhorting the committee to concentrate on the science at precisely the same time that she was determined to ignore the science and to play the politics of this matter. It was a disgraceful performance and I am not surprised that there are people in the Territory who are distressed about it.
Once this bill has passed, as I trust it will be during the course of the day, then we have to move on to the future. We have to confront the reality that a site has to be found for this waste. We heard evidence in relation to three sites. My sense is that the Fishers Ridge site will probably prove to be unsuitable, but an exhaustive process of investigation will take place to determine whether or not any of the three sites will be suitable. There is an opportunity here for the Northern Territory government to redeem itself and to take a constructive view in relation to this matter, because the bill offers the Territory government an opportunity to nominate a site. I sincerely hope that the Northern Territory government avails itself of that opportunity. Having been unconstructive all along, I hope that it will take the opportunity to be cooperative in relation to this particular issue.
Before we get too troubled about the implications of the siting process, I would encourage Territorians to pay attention to the evidence and, in particular, to the evidence of Dr Loy, the chief executive officer of ARPANSA, to the inquiry. He made it very clear in his evidence that the process of authorising the site was a rigorous and exhaustive one and that there would be a great deal of investigation done in relation to buildings, ecology, transportation, the geology of the site, the storage relationship and the matter of Aboriginal land rights. All of these things would be taken into account when the investigation process was under way and the authorisation process was taking place. This will be a rigorous process, and I would encourage Territorians to pay attention to that. I have confidence that that process will deliver a site which will be safe to those people who happen to live nearby. (Time expired)

"Nash, Sen Fiona",NATS,2005-12-07,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

I am pleased to speak to the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2005 and the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management (Related Amendment) Bill 2005
Since the days of the Hawke Labor Government successive Australian governments have sought to put in place responsible arrangements for the management of this nation’s low and intermediate radioactive wastes.
Despite best efforts they have been defeated by the NIMBY (Not in my back yard) attitudes of State and Territory Governments. The very same State and Territory Governments who agree that there is a need for radioactive waste management facilities in Australia—as long as they are “not in their backyard”.
The myopic views of these State and Territory Governments forced this Government—a Government that was willing to work with the States and Territories—to consider other options for the management of low and intermediate level radioactive waste produced by Australian Government agencies.
There would be few in this place that would not be aware that three Department of Defence sites owned by the Commonwealth in the Northern Territory were identified by this Government for further consideration as prospective waste sites.
a site called Fishers Ridge, about 43 kilometres southeast of Katherine.
another site near Harts Range, 100 kilometres directly northeast of Alice Springs, and
a third site at Mt Everard, about 27 kilometres directly northwest of Alice Springs.
It is clearly evident that the radioactive waste management facility site will go somewhere in the Northern Territory—despite the NIMBY scare campaign that was mounted by the Martin Territory Labor Government. A campaign that was discredited during the last senate estimates process as a campaign that was not only misleading, but just plain wrong!
Senators may recall that officials from the Department of Education Science and Training told the Employment Workplace Relations and Education Estimates committee—a committee which included Senator Crossin, that the NT Government’s publication “What you need to know about Canberra’s Proposed Nuclear Waste Dump” which was promoted on the NT Government’s website, was incorrect and misleading.
DEST officials said statements in the flyer, which claimed the nuclear waste to be stored at the facility “poses a serious danger to humans and the environment for many thousands of years”, were completely untrue.
The same officials told the committee that communities residing near a radioactive waste management facility were in no way at risk of “a range of terminal and debilitating medical conditions” as implied in the NT Government publication.
Now my good friend from the Northern Territory’s Country Liberal Party and coalition colleague, Senator Scullion and his CLP colleague in the other place, the member for Solomon did the right thing, because they recognised that the radioactive waste management facility was destined for the Northern Territory.
They worked within the Howard-Vaile government to secure the best outcome for Territorians. They were successful in having the legislation amended to give Land Councils and the NT Labor government greater involvement in nominating a suitable site.
This means that this Government’s radioactive waste management facility could well go to a site, other than a Defence site, where somebody actually wants it, rather than to a site where somebody doesn’t want it.
Senator Scullion and the Member for Solomon did the right thing!
Unlike the Martin Territory Labor Government, Senator Scullion and the member for Solomon knew they couldn’t walk away just because the Territory Labor Government said they should.
Senator Scullion and the Member for Solomon knew the Territory was going to get a radioactive waste management facility—it was a fact—so they went about to make sure that the Territory was going to get the best, the safest, the cleanest and the greenest low and intermediate radioactive waste management facility in the entire world.
Without a suitable radioactive waste management facility in this country no Australian could reasonably expect to receive the benefits of nuclear-sourced radioisotopes. Why, because where would we dispose of them?
On average throughout life, every single one of us—not just in this place, but right across the nation, will benefit from a medical procedure to either diagnose or treat a cancer or other disease using a radio-pharmaceutical sourced from Australia’s only nuclear reactor at some time or other.
Every year around 400,000 Australians undergo medical procedures that use the isotopes produced by Australia’s only nuclear reactor, saving lives every day.
There are also a host of applications of radioactive materials that we rely upon in areas as diverse as sterilisation of bandages, syringes and women’s hygiene products, minerals exploration and processing, ensuring the safety of oil and gas pipelines and the accurate filling of bottles and cans containing food and beverages.
If we are to ensure that these medical and industrial procedures and products are available in the future, we must as a nation provide the facilities needed to manage the small quantity of radioactive waste that arise in their production and use.
Government senators recognise that passage of the bill is essential if Australians are to continue to realise the benefits of the wide range of uses of radioactive materials in our daily lives.
Let us not forget that successful passage of this Bill is also necessary for the Commonwealth to fulfil its responsibilities under international conventions for the safe and secure management of radioactive waste.
These include our obligations under the Joint Convention for the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management.
I remind the Senate that Australia is obliged to take back its radioactive waste currently stored in Scotland and France.
Now those opposite say the Bill is unduly coercive and unjust in overriding the Northern Territory Nuclear Waste Transport, Storage and Disposal (Prohibition) Act 2004. This is simply not the case.
Labor does not come from a position of strength on the issue to site, construct and operate a facility for the safe and secure management of Australian government agencies radioactive waste
Labor failed to construct suitable radioactive waste management facilities during its 13 years in office.
Labor may well have tried to start the process back in 1992 but let us not forget one important thing! They failed. They failed because the then existing Commonwealth legislation proved to be inadequate in the face of the opportunism and parochialism of the South Australian Labor Premier, Premier Rann.
As events in the Federal Court in 2004 demonstrated, the Australian Government did not have the power to complete the then Labor Government’s siting process.
And let us not forget the Northern Territory Nuclear Waste Transport, Storage and Disposal (Prohibition) Act 2004. This Bill was nothing more than a political stunt by the Martin Government, knowing there was existing Commonwealth legislation that could authorise operation of a Commonwealth radioactive waste management facility in the Northern Territory.
The Northern Territory Government is in no position to criticise the Commonwealth in responsibly managing its radioactive wastes given its own failure to control radioactive waste in the Territory.
The Martin Territory Labor Government does not even have a clear understanding of where all of its radioactive waste is actually held in the Northern Territory—apart from material which is inappropriately stored under stairwells in the basement within the Royal Darwin Hospital, and some out at Mount Todd.
It is also important to acknowledge the hypocrisy of the Martin Territory Labor Government and its double standard on the transport of yellowcake from South Australia and the transport of radioactive waste to a Commonwealth facility in the Territory.
Yellowcake from Olympic Dam is currently safely transported by rail to Darwin and shipped from the port of Darwin with the full participation of the Northern Territory Government authorities.
Yet this substance is more radioactive than any of the low level radioactive waste held by the Commonwealth which comprises 90% by volume of the entire inventory.
For the past 50 years Australia has operated a small, but significant, research reactor, soon to be replaced by the new research reactor, the Open Pool Australian Lightwater (OPAL) reactor.
As a nation we must deal with an existing inventory of radioactive waste, about 4,000 cubic metres, and the small quantities that will arise from the continued need to produce radioisotopes for use in medicine, industry and research.
It makes no sense to run public scare campaigns that completely blow out of proportion the risks and hazards associated with this low level and intermediate level radioactive waste. The sort of waste we are talking about is all solid waste—it is not a liquid that can spill or leak, it cannot explode, and it is not readily combustible.
Australia does not produce high level radioactive waste and existing Commonwealth law as well as a long standing policy prohibits its importation.
Now the Opposition inaccurately refers to this highly managed, highly regulated facility as a “dump”.
This Facility will not be like a municipal tip where material is dumped off the back of a truck into a pile and then buried into the earth. It will be placed there carefully and precisely with the contents recorded and monitored.
The material will either be stored above ground in a purpose built building where the containers can be monitored and checked at any time or, if a burial option is available, low level waste will be disposed of by burial—in a very precise manner that allows for monitoring and recovery of buried material if that is ever necessary.
The Howard-Vaile Government is taking it’s responsibilities for radioactive waste management seriously. This Government has a plan! Those opposite and their state and territory Labor cronies with the NIMBY attitudes have nothing—nicht—nothing!
Only this government can give confidence to the Australian people that they will continue to realise the benefits of the wide range of uses of radioactive materials in our daily lives. Because only this government is doing something about putting in place a low to medium level radioactive waste management facility.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,8,1,speech
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2005-12-07,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

The Senate is debating the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2005, which clarifies the Commonwealth’s role in the siting of a waste dump facility in the Northern Territory.
The reason this bill is before the Senate is because of the actions of two Labor leaders, Premier Mike Rann in South Australia and Clare Martin, of the Northern Territory.
Both have failed to insist that the original plan for the best site proceed.
Scientific investigations found that Woomera in South Australia was the most suitable site for the storage of low and medium level radioactive waste.
Had the South Australian Premier lived up to his obligations and recognised science as the only appropriate judge when you’re talking about radioactive waste, the Northern Territory would not be having this radioactive waste facility and we wouldn’t be debating this bill.
Had the Northern Territory Chief Minister, Clare Martin, stood up to her South Australian Labor colleague and insisted he act on the science, we would not be debating these bills.
Had Clare Martin withheld permission for South Australian yellowcake to travel by rail throughout the Territory, she could have put heat on the South Australian government to revisit the issue of the waste facility site.
Instead, Clare Martin caved in to the wrong people and is now left to flounder helplessly as the waste dump goes into the Northern Territory following her colleague’s cowardly cop-out over Woomera.
Rather than take on a fellow Labor Premier, Clare Martin actually rewarded Mike Rann by allowing his yellowcake onto the rail transport network of the Territory.
The Coalition government’s position is that we are committed to safe and responsible storage of radioactive waste. We strongly believe that a single, dedicated facility is preferable to storing waste at a number of locations around Australia.
The South Australian government’s actions are directly responsible for the search for an alternate radioactive waste site in the Northern Territory—and for this bill currently under consideration by the Senate.
My CLP colleague, Senator Scullion, has been attacked for pointing out these and other facts relating to the radioactive waste facility.
Let me point out that Senator Scullion always puts the Territory first —always.
He is an articulate and powerful advocate for the Territory’s interests. He is opposed to a waste dump in the NT —like this government—but once South Australia turned its back on its responsibilities by ruling out Woomera, the only alternative was to look in the Territory for an appropriate site.
Seeing that Labor had scuttled the best site, Senator Scullion went in to fight to make this Commonwealth legislation provide the safest, cleanest, greenest waste facility in the world because it was going to be sited in the Northern Territory.
He never walked away from looking after the Territory’s interests. How easy it would have been to do a Clare Martin and rant from the sidelines, once she had sold Territorians out to Mike Rann.
Martin sold out by not taking on Rann and by allowing, hypocritically, the transport of yellowcake through the Territory.
The South Australian Labor government ended more than a decade of bi-partisan support to establishment a national waste facility.
The federal government had no choice but to consider other options for Commonwealth waste.
To commission the new Lucas Heights research reactor, there must be substantial progress made in the establishment of a waste facility for Commonwealth waste. Without substantial action, a licence will not be granted to operate the new reactor.
There are also time restrictions. Under an international agreement, Australia has to take back recycled spent fuel rods from the UK by 2012. The rigorous process that has to be undertaken to establish the waste facility will take until 2011.
Once the South Australian Labor government said `No!’ to the best site at Woomera, it effectively pushed the radioactive waste facility onto Territorians.
But Senator Scullion did not walk away from the mess left by the Labor State and Territory governments. He acted to get amendments to this bill to make it the best possible situation for the Territory. These amendments include the unique ability of the Territory to store its waste in the Commonwealth facility.
Senator Scullion brokered an arrangement for Territory waste to be stored at the Commonwealth site at no charge, forever.
Together with his Lower House CLP colleague David Tollner, Senator Scullion amended the legislation to give Land Councils and the NT Labor government greater involvement in nominating a suitable site. The Northern Land Council gave us their full support for these amendments. The site decision will incorporate the best scientific criteria.
Given that this situation was forced on Senator Scullion, with time running out, he did the only honourable thing—he worked within the Coalition government to secure the best outcome for Territorians.
He couldn’t walk away because the waste dump issue went belly up. Senator Scullion is no quitter. The Territory was going to get a waste dump, it was a fact, so he was going to make sure the Territory got the best, the safest, the cleanest and the greenest facility in the entire world.
The scientists responsible for the waste facility were asked detailed questions in Senate Estimates hearings in Canberra in November. They refuted many of the false and misleading claims made by the NT Labor government and their Federal colleagues.
The facts are that this facility will not hurt the surrounding flora or fauna, it will not be dangerous for millions of years.
It will not damage our tourism industry and it will not hurt our exports.
The facts are that the Territory has stockpiles of low and intermediate radioactive waste that needs safer storage than in the basement of hospitals or the Kakadu and Katherine regions.
The fact is that the Chief Minister recently approved the rail transportation of radioactive yellowcake from South Australia through the Alice, Tennant Creek, Katherine and on to Darwin, without any qualms.
Let’s not forget that all Australians, Territorians included, benefit in many ways from the work done at Lucas Heights.
Our society relies on the radioisotopes, radiopharmaceuticals, elements for smoke detectors and environmental measuring equipment that are produced there. Territorians benefit from this work and research.
We also produce and export uranium. Much of the Commonwealth waste around the country was produced originally here in the Northern Territory.
As a Senator for the NT, Senator Scullion takes his responsibility for representing Territorians in Canberra very, very seriously. He has worked very hard to make sure that the facility will be state-of-the-art, completely safe and that the transportation of waste to the facility will not pose any health issues.
Histrionics aside, the Federal Labor Party has given no assurance that they would not force this waste facility on the NT should they ever be elected.
What use is a Chief Minister who can’t stop her South Australian colleagues from foisting a dump on Territorians, and then can’t even get her federal ALP colleagues to rule out a dump? (meanwhile happily giving the green light to yellowcake on the Northern territory’s main rail routes!)
This Bill would never have been necessary had the Labor Premier of South Australia done the right thing and ticked off on the best scientific site, at Woomera.
Debate interrupted.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,8,1,speech
"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2005-12-07,"—I rise to speak today on a number of key health issues, not just national but global, that will require some very serious undertakings from the international community to deal with and manage into the future and maximise outcomes for those facing these separate and individual challenges. The first health issue to wish I refer is the HIV-AIDS pandemic—most particularly its impact in the Asia-Pacific region and also its impact on women. In fact, last Thursday was World AIDS Day, which is an international day of recognition that has taken place annually on 1 December since 1988. Some members and senators may have chosen to mark their noting of that day by wearing a red ribbon, which is of course a recognised and compelling symbol.
In late November, the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS and the World Health Organisation reported that the worldwide number of people suffering from HIV has now exceeded 40 million. Indeed, the number is estimated at 40.3 million in total. Further, their figures indicate that 2.6 million adults and 600,000 children have died from HIV-AIDS in the last 12 months. That same report indicates that there will be an estimated five million infections globally this year.
Interestingly, that combined report also indicates that there has been some decrease in adult HIV infection rates in some countries and that changes in behaviour to prevent infection—which include increased use of condoms, delaying the first sexual experience and having fewer sexual partners—have played a key part in the declines. It is very much the case that a multifaceted approach to dealing with the challenge in a range of countries brings about that result. Overall, though, the indicators remain disturbing: that trends in HIV transmission are still increasing and that we will need far greater prevention efforts to slow the epidemic.
The AIDS epidemic update 2005 has noted recent developments in the Caribbean region. In fact, it has expressed some cause for guarded optimism in that regard. It notes HIV prevalence declines marked amongst pregnant women, for example, and an expansion of voluntary HIV testing and counselling. In some ways, that is a very important aspect of this report to note. Also, according to the report, the steepest increases in HIV infections have occurred in Eastern Europe and in Central Asia—a 25 per cent increase in infections, to 1.6 million—and for us in East Asia. Sub-Saharan Africa continues to be the most affected area globally. Sixty-four per cent of new infections still occur there—that is, over three million people.
Just for a moment, on the question of the Asia-Pacific region, of the 40 million-plus people in the world who live with HIV-AIDS, 8.2 million live in Asia and in the Pacific—and in some of the most challenged and difficult nations in the world, in development terms. In 2004, the new infections in Asia totalled 1.2 million. So, unless we can turn the tide on HIV-AIDS, as AusAID said last week in recognition of World AIDS Day, it is estimated that by 2010 an additional 12 million people in the Asia-Pacific region will be infected with HIV.
It is important to place on the record the contribution of the Australian government, in this region particularly, and the commitment that we have made through AusAID, matching concern with action and resources, culminating in a $600 million commitment over 10 years to 2010 to battle against HIV, most particularly in this region. I meet regularly with representatives of organisations such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and representatives of UNAIDS, and visit Australian programs in the region particularly, whenever I have the opportunity. These interventions are very important; they are a very important aspect of Australia’s overseas development assistance.
I turn to Australia—and it would be remiss of me not to make some comments in that regard. The National Centre in HIV Epidemiology and Clinical Research released some figures in their 2005 annual surveillance report of HIV-AIDS in Australia which are also disturbing. In fact, the main finding of the report is that the actual number of fresh HIV diagnoses has been gradually increasing in Australia over the past five years. In some areas those increases are more significant than in others. So we need to ensure that raising awareness of the dangers of HIV remains a government priority if we are to effectively combat this growing threat to public health. I congratulate the MACASHH, chaired by Dr Michael Wooldridge, and its subcommittees on HIV and other areas, on the work they are doing in that regard. In fact, the Minister for Health and Ageing, Tony Abbott, launched the fifth National HIV-AIDS Strategy for 2005-08 in June this year. It is about partnership between government, researchers, effective communities, service providers, their support organisations and a raft of other individuals and groups who work in this particularly challenging area.
The national strategy undertakes to maintain Australia’s commitment to reduce transmission and to minimise the impact of HIV-AIDS infection on the community. They are very important markers in the sand for Australia to draw. I had some small part to play in the review of the previous strategy, and I was very grateful for the invitation to do that. I think that as we move forward it is important to be vigilant about the key aspects of HIV-AIDS in Australia and, more broadly, those that the strategy marks.
In this parliament some years ago there was established, by then minister Neal Blewett, a parliamentary liaison group on HIV-AIDS, in the eighties, when the epidemic was hitting with great force and a clearly nonpartisan and partnership based response was necessary. It is a very important instrument for, in the parliament, maintaining a nonpartisan and whole-of-government approach to the issues which surround HIV. It enables members of parliament who are interested to be kept up to date with issues that impact on their local communities—and that is a broad range of issues.
The parliamentary liaison group, as it is currently constituted, has a very diverse range of members. I am particularly pleased that Tony Abbott, the Minister for Health and Ageing, invited me to take up the role of chair of the parliamentary liaison group on HIV-AIDS. I thank him very much for that appointment and for what I regard as a very significant responsibility. I think the group has an important role in the parliament. I hope that as well as focusing on matters in Australia and working with MACASHH and its subcommittees and other key organisations we can also bring a focus on Asia-Pacific regional issues. I know that the foreign minister, Alexander Downer, has displayed a long-term and particular commitment in this area and is very committed to the work that Australia does in that regard.
I want to give one example of one new piece of information about infection rates in our region which really shows why we have to be as concerned as we are. In Thailand recently the Thai Ministry of Public Health and the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention collaboration follow-up study, which is a consequence of previous investigations they made, found a seroprevalence rate of 28 per cent amongst the MSM population in Bangkok. That is an extraordinary rate. It indicates an annual HIV incidence rate of about five to six per cent. I know there are very serious concerns held here about what that means more broadly and most particularly in Thailand. There is a role for Australia to play in assisting in addressing those issues in our region. This would be a very good place to do that.
I also wish to make some comments in relation to a recent event held in Parliament House which was entitled National Consumer Summit on Dementia, to move on to a different but nevertheless important area of public health. This was held in Parliament House on 5 and 6 October this year. For reasons that many of my colleagues will be aware of, I was unable to support or participate in the summit. I congratulate Alzheimer’s Australia on bringing the summit together in the parliament. I co-chair Parliamentary Friends of Dementia with Sharon Grierson, the member for Newcastle, and we have found, since we established that group some few years ago now, an increasing interest amongst our colleagues in how to assist their constituents, both those who are facing the challenge of dealing with dementia personally and, even more importantly in some ways, their carers, the people who will have to bear the load of caring for people who are suffering from dementia in ever-increasing numbers.
It is important to note that last year, during the federal election campaign and afterwards, dementia was declared a national health priority. That was an aim that Alzheimer’s Australia and other groups in the area had been pursuing for some time. It gives a very important badge to this particular condition and to the importance of dealing with it.
The consumer summit was attended by the Minister for Ageing, the Hon. Julie Bishop, and others of our parliamentary colleagues, including shadow ministers. I was assisted by Senator Judith Troeth on that occasion, when I was unable to attend. The consumer summit meant that people with dementia and their carers were able to come right into this building, which is perhaps not, in its private areas, regarded as the most accessible building—I know we do very well in the public areas—into the Main Committee room, for example, to sit in that magnificent environment and talk about the issues which impact so significantly on their daily lives. They came from all states and territories. There were 50 consumers in all, and they wanted to talk about their priorities for research and service delivery. They presented a communique at the conclusion of that summit. Both Sharon Grierson and I have distributed that communique to all of our colleagues.
Most importantly, the communique identified a number of priorities and a seven-point action plan for change. I want to enumerate those points this afternoon so that they are on the record here in the chamber and so that we understand some of the challenges that individuals dealing with dementia, in particular, face. The first action point is to improve the assessment and diagnosis of dementia. Clearly, that is aimed at interaction with the medical profession and management of the condition. The second point is to improve the responsiveness of acute care so that it better meets the needs of people with dementia. The third point is to ensure easy access to quality community care services. The fourth is to provide more flexible responses to supported accommodation in the home and also in residential care facilities. The fifth is to increase the recognition and understanding of the financial cost and legal implications of dementia. Action point 6 is to promote and ensure greater public awareness and understanding of dementia and risk reduction. Action point 7 is to increase investment in dementia research.
Those action points are spelt out in greater detail in the summit communique. The one I really want to come to in my remarks today is the promotion of greater public awareness and understanding of dementia and risk reduction. There are some parallels with how we deal with those people in our community who suffer from mental health difficulties. I think that step 1, overwhelmingly, whether we are talking about young people or older people, is about understanding, and removing stigma. It is about realising that these conditions are an illness, like any other. It is not necessarily physically obvious at the time, but when you are the person who is dealing with the challenges that dementia brings to your life it is as profound as any other illness you can possibly imagine.
What the consumers who attended the summit said in relation to this action point was: ‘We want our community to better understand dementia. We need to increase public and community awareness about dementia, not only for those diagnosed with dementia but also for those who will be diagnosed with dementia in the future. We must break down the stereotypes about dementia that result in discrimination and isolation of individuals within the community.’
Those last remarks about discrimination and isolation are very telling. You can be discriminated against anywhere. You can feel isolated in a big city or in a country town. We have a very important role to play in this chamber in assisting to remove those levels of discrimination and stigmatisation and in ensuring that people are well looked after.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>HIV-AIDS</title>,Matters of Public Interest,9,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2005-12-07,"—My question is to Senator Kemp, Minister for the Arts and Sport. Is the minister concerned that the government’s voluntary student unionism laws will effectively strip $30 million from sport and jeopardise the viability of more than $600 million worth of university sporting infrastructure? Doesn’t this mean that the proposed laws will simultaneously destroy university services and reduce Australia’s ability to compete at future sporting events like the Olympics and the Paralympics? What is the minister’s response to concerns raised by more than 40 prominent sporting identities, including John Coates, Liz Ellis, Rob de Castella, Shane Gould, Johnny Lewis and Phil Kearns, who have called for the introduction of a sports facilities and activities fee to enable universities to continue delivering sporting services in the future?

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2005-12-07,"—It is very frustrating. Mr President, I ask a supplementary question but I am tempted to re-ask my first question as well. Can the minister confirm that the VSU legislation will directly affect more than 500,000 Australians, from Olympians to schoolchildren, who currently use university sporting services through the massive reduction in facilities and maintenance budgets that will result from the bill? Won’t the legislation also place at risk up to 1,400 sports scholarships awarded by universities? Can the minister now provide an absolute assurance that all university sporting facilities, both metropolitan and regional, will maintain their real funding under any government legislative changes?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Voluntary Student Unionism</title>,Questions Without Notice,10,1,question
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2005-12-07,"—I thank Senator Lundy for that, I have to say, entirely predictable question. If ever there was a predictable question it is Senator Lundy’s question today. Let me give you an answer which may not be entirely predictable, Senator Lundy. The first thing you should know, Senator Lundy, is that no government has provided more funding for arts and sport than the Howard government. If you discuss this with the arts community and the sports community, as I do, and as you know—I say this somewhat modestly—I am a very accessible minister—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—I think you will find that the arts community and the sports community believe that this government has delivered real gains in both those areas—real and positive gains, Senator Lundy.
—Minister, could you address your remarks through the chair and ignore the interjections?
—In recent months I have lacked experience in answering questions from Senator Lundy so I may have strayed briefly from the standing orders, Mr President. I apologise for that. The other point I would make is this: not only have we delivered more funding for arts and sport than any other government in Australian history, and we have been rightly complimented on those initiatives by those two areas, equally this government is absolutely opposed to compulsorily acquired student funds being used by the junior roosters of the Labor Party to pursue their political objectives. Over a long period of time we have seen a serious misuse—

Senator Lundy interjecting—

—Order! Senator Lundy, you have asked your question.
—of student funds, typically by the Left of Australian politics. This is going to stop. This will not happen. The community expects this government to take action in this area and this government has my strong support in taking action to—
—What about the price paid by sport?
—It is well known, Senator Lundy—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order, senators on my left!
—I am shocked by the reaction of the Labor Party. The only point I have made is that their junior roosters will not be able to acquire funds from students to pursue their political objectives.
—Mr President, I raise a point of order going to relevance. I know that Senator Kemp, as he said, was prepared for the question. The question went to his response to the concerns raised by a range of prominent sporting identities. I ask you to bring him back to the question rather than indulge in the ongoing student politics debate that he seems so fond of.
—I hear your point of order, Senator Evans. The minister has one minute and 20 seconds left and I am sure he will be coming to that particular matter.
—As distinct from Senator Evans’s comments, student politics are entirely relevant to this question. This question is about voluntary student unionism. I have indicated to you, Senator, and it will be no surprise to you, that I am a strong supporter of VSU and I have been for a very long period of time. It will equally be of no surprise to you that there are discussions at present. Senator Lundy, you would be aware of that. They have been reported in the press, undoubtedly, over the course of the day. Those discussions are continuing and we will see what the outcome of those discussions is.
Having said that, I want it to be absolutely clear to this chamber that this government is second to none in its commitment to Australian sport and to the arts community. We have delivered, as distinct from the Labor Party and, I might say, as distinct from the very ordinary policies that you in this role put forward in the last election.
—What are you doing to defend sport?
—Senator Lundy—
—Minister, ignore the interjections and address your remarks through the chair.
—Senator Lundy continues to shout at me across the chamber and it is very distracting indeed. (Time expired)

Is the minister aware of any alternative policies?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Disaster Relief Arrangements</title>,Questions Without Notice,12,1,question
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2005-12-07,"—I thank Senator Ferguson for his question. It is an important question as we approach the one-year anniversary of the devastating Asian tsunami. All Australians, I am sure, were overwhelmed by the appalling tragedy that claimed the lives of not only Australian citizens but also thousands of people from other countries and nations. Further tragedies continued this year, with the London and Bali bombings. In those cases, the Australian government assisted those Australians affected by meeting reasonable costs not covered by insurance. The packages of assistance included medical costs, including all reasonable out-of-pocket health care expenses for Australians who were injured in the bombings and reasonable costs of counselling and psychological care for families of those affected. In addition, reasonable costs of counselling and psychological care for Australians who lost non-Australian family members and funeral costs for immediate family members or next of kin, where those costs were not met by a third party, were also paid for. In Bali the government also assisted with the medical evacuation and the reasonable travel costs for the return of people to Australia where they had no other means to pay for their travel.
Given the realities of the world in which we live, in which tragedies have recently occurred, I am putting in place new streamlined arrangements to provide rapid assistance to Australians directly affected by disasters here or overseas. These improved arrangements will deliver recovery assistance as fast as possible to those who need help. Australia’s response to events such as the Indian Ocean tsunami and the Bali and London bombings showed great cooperation across government. Having formally agreed plans in place will further enhance that responsiveness.
I will be introducing a bill next year to amend the social security laws to introduce a new Australian government disaster recovery payment. This payment will be $1,000 per adult and $400 per child. The payment will help people who are affected by domestic and overseas events. It will become one of a set of options available to the government when determining what assistance would best meet the needs and circumstances of people affected by a disaster. This payment may then also be complemented by a broader response, including case management and counselling support, travel assistance, medical care, assistance with funerals and associated costs and assistance with management of estates. The Australian government’s broader response to domestic and overseas disasters will be determined based on several factors, including the magnitude of the event, the number of Australians affected and the level of continued threat.
The Howard government’s assistance following a disaster is meant to complement, not replace, personal travel and other insurance. I encourage people to make sure they continue to take out adequate insurance, particularly before they travel. But, as we know, in some circumstances that insurance is negated. The Howard government is improving arrangements to support people who are affected by disasters to ensure that people have all the necessary assistance when they need it. The new measures will streamline this, and reduce the number of processes we have to go through to make sure that we respond as quickly as possible to assist those people who are facing trauma, including the victims, their families and close friends. It is a very important measure and I will commend it to the Senate next year. I am looking forward to bipartisan support for the measures.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Disaster Relief Arrangements</title>,Questions Without Notice,12,1,answer
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2005-12-07,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for the Arts and Sport (Senator Kemp) to a question without notice asked by Senator Lundy today relating to sport and voluntary student unionism laws.
I wish to refer to the answer provided by Senator Kemp today in relation to a question about the negative impact of the Howard government’s VSU legislation, particularly on sport but also on all of the student services that are likely to be effectively removed as a result of VSU.
I will start by reflecting on the perennial ideology of the rabid former student activists of the Liberal Party. It is clear from today’s media that these ideologues are out of control in the coalition party room. Evidence of this can be found in the detailed accounts in this morning’s media of their petulant sprays. The fact that these accounts appear in every paper this morning shows that this is no mere spat. I have to say that you know things are bad when Senator Heffernan starts to be reported as some form of mediator. And you know things are bad when Senator Kemp responds to my question by saying, ‘Gee, that was predictable,’ and then does not answer the question but spends four minutes—five minutes, including the answer to the supplementary question—waffling and obfuscating and trying to avoid the problem.
It seems that this blue is about the ideologues and the VSU talisman that they have carried next to their hearts from their naïve early days as activists in student politics, where ideology far outweighed any practical reality, no matter what the debate was. It seems that there are only one or two on the other side of the chamber who realise the grave implications for young people and their families of this ideologically driven piece of legislation. The only problem is that the pack of adolescents that felt this way as young student activists never grew up. They are here now and they are still getting their kicks by bullying their colleagues in their own party room, and we end up reading about it. But like spoilt brats beating up on the wets, they want only their way, with no interest in compromise or common sense or the harm that VSU will cause for normal people going about their normal business of trying to get a decent university education.
It was the Labor Party that flushed them out. It was the Labor Party that, by moving our amendment, took the cover away from them on VSU, which was supposed to be about political campaigning by students. That was the big complaint. By moving an amendment to preserve a compulsory fee for student services, we flushed out those for whom it was about power and not practicalities. It was Labor that flushed out those for whom VSU was about ego, not an egalitarian educational experience for university students. They know, like we know, that the commonsense compromise for this divided rabble would be to support Labor’s amendment.
The Labor amendment introduces tough new accountability and reporting requirements to make sure that money collected through a student amenities fee is appropriately spent within the law. Our amendment also provides for a fair system of fee collection and for it to be on a pro rata basis for part-time, external and distance education. In other words, our amendment removes every single complaint that these ideologues have ever made. So let us forget about the pathetic pork that seems to be back on the table to try to solve this.
I say to those opposite: any pork barrelling will no doubt favour regional and rural universities—and I do agree that they are at a special disadvantage. But all the universities stand to be dramatically affected. And what about all the country kids who go to city universities? Arguably, they are the ones most in need of those services to be put in place as they orientate themselves around the campus and the city in which they are living. It is not good enough to offer subsidies to regional campuses. Universities are diverse communities, with rural students landing in the city for the first time and many from the city arriving in regional campuses for the first time. So student services are necessary no matter where the university is located. It is not good enough for those on the other side of the chamber, who represent young people from rural Australia, to allow support services and activities on any campus to be undermined.
What are we fighting for? A whole raft of student services, including clubs of common interest. I have played a special role in trying to highlight the damage to sport but it is also about the damage to health and medical services, accommodation and housing assistance, cultural and religious groups, counselling, dental care, orientation information, employment assistance—practical stuff.

"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2005-12-07,"—On three occasions this parliament has had legislation introduced to give effect to freedom of choice and freedom of association, to end the practice whereby universities, student unions, student guilds or student associations can compel someone to join an organisation against their will and pay a fee for services that they may not want. At the heart of this bill is the principle of freedom of association. No-one should be compelled to join an organisation against their will. The classic instance of where institutions will embrace the technicality of freedom of association but not embrace the principle of freedom of association takes place in Victoria. Under the Victorian legislation you do not have to join a student union against your will, you can opt out of a student union but you have to pay exactly the same fee. That is a con and a sham. It is time for universities and student associations to embrace the principle of freedom of choice.
What is the fear? The fear is that we cannot trust students. We can trust students to choose their university, their course and their subjects but their critical faculties depart them when it comes to the decision of whether or not to join a student union or association. If you can choose your course, your subjects and your institution, you should have the capacity and good judgment to decide whether you want to join a student union or association and whether you value the services that are paid for by those fees.
Those opposite have an incredibly pessimistic view of today’s students. I do not know if students have changed since I was at university, but I will let Senator Lundy in on a little secret: if you put a couple of thousand 18- to 23-year-olds together who are curious, frisky and energetic, you are going to have a vibrant campus life. You do not need a compulsory fee to generate a vibrant campus life. The onus should be on student organisations to convince students of the value of the services they provide. Motorist organisations like the NRMA and the RACV do not have the capacity to compel motorists to pay their fees; they have to convince motorists of the value of the services that they provide. It should be the same on university campuses. University unions and associations have the capacity to convince students of the value of the services they provide, and students have the capacity to determine for themselves whether they think that is value for money.
Senator Troeth and I took part in the Senate inquiry into the voluntary student unionism legislation, and what I found incredibly disheartening were the attitudes of some of the vice-chancellors. There was a very paternalistic attitude towards university students. In particular, the vice-chancellor of Swinburne University of Technology, Professor Ian Young, said:
This is a rather condescending comment, I am afraid, but when you have a group of 18- to 22-year-olds the reality is that their focus is very short term. They are interested in the here and now.
My response to the vice-chancellor was, ‘Yes, Vice-Chancellor, that is very condescending.’
Students have the capacity to determine what is in their interests. If as a year 12 student you are capable of deciding that you want to study medicine and that you want to become a medical specialist, you are taking a long-term view about your future. If you are capable of making those sorts of decisions as a year 12 student, surely you have the ability when you are at university to decide if you want to join a student union and whether you value the services that they provide. Students should have the right to decide.
We know why the ALP supports the sort of legislation that exists in Victoria; it is because we see things like the National Union of Students spending $250,000 of compulsorily acquired student funds at the last election on a party political campaign to put the coalition last. That is why senators opposite support a limited services fee model, because they know that money is fungible. Money collected compulsorily from students for one purpose will ultimately end up being spent on another purpose. It might be put into the amenities account but $1 in one account is the same as $1 in another account. (Time expired)

"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2005-12-07,"—I also want to take note of the answer by Senator Kemp on voluntary student unionism. Like Senator Fifield, I took part in the inquiry.

Senator Ferguson interjecting—

—I will have you know, Senator Ferguson, I did not go to university.
—Neither did I.
—I left school at 13. I do not regard myself as being any less intelligent than any of you that did go to university. Senator Fifield says that at the heart of this bill is freedom of association. At the heart of this bill is pure ideology. It is about the government silencing dissent. It is about the government attacking its opponents in the community. It is about an obsession with the battles they lost on campus 30 years ago. It is about playing student politics instead of looking after students at university.
—Rubbish!
—Do not take my word for it, Senator Ferguson. I will read you a quote from the Sydney Morning Herald on 22 June 2005. It said:
The Liberal senator Brett Mason said yesterday the right to choose whether to join a student union had been “burned into the psyches” of many Liberal MPs and voluntary unionism was an “issue of principle rather than pragmatic politics” for many.
While saying “revenge might be a little strong”, he said Liberal MPs viewed passing the bill unamended as a way of “evening the score” against their political rivals from universities of the 1970s and 80s.
If ever there was a statement about being ideologically driven, thank you very much for saying it, Senator Mason.
Let us look at some of the issues involved in this debate. If this bill passes the parliament, 4,200 jobs will be lost across the country and vital services including welfare support and advocacy will be jeopardised, as Senator Lundy has already pointed out. One of the issues that the vice-chancellors were really concerned about was the advocacy role of student unions, because they did not believe that they had the right to be judge and jury on students. They believed that students had the right to have independent advocacy in terms of their issues with the university, but that will be lost substantially as a result of this bill being passed. There are transport services, emergency financial assistance, child care, entertainment and sport. More importantly, this will add to making universities unattractive to international students.
There are two issues of importance and one was raised by the student association at the University of Southern Queensland, based in Toowoomba, who said, in evidence to the committee, that they were already taking steps to shut down the student association, because in Queensland they are incorporated and if the bill were passed they would be put in a position of trading insolvently. So they already had to take steps to shut down even before the bill was passed. Regional universities provide many facilities, including sporting facilities, which do not just service the university; they service the community. Thousands of dollars of assets are tied up in those organisations which provide effective services to the local community as well as to the student community of the university. No-one has given much regard to that aspect of the services that the universities provide to the students as well as to the community. This is all about ‘get square, get even’ for the past, in the same way that your industrial relations legislation is about ‘get square, get even’. (Time expired)

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2005-12-07,"—Senator Fifield, my friend and colleague, has given an elegant and eloquent assessment of the government’s VSU legislation. As is common in this place, I need to give a little bit of context, a bit of history to the debate.
—Just like back at university. Relive the moment, and you are, I can tell.
—Senator Lundy, a long time ago I was 17 years old and the ratbaggery that went on then still happens today. I was forced to pay compulsory union fees in the eighties, when the Left was still relevant—they are not any more—to an ANU student association that gave money to the PLO. I was 17 and I was forced to give money to a terrorist organisation. You might think, ‘Well, it’s a long time ago. So what?’ It can still happen today. Every time money is taken compulsorily from 17- and 18-year-olds by collectivists, it can be spent on any purpose. That is the problem.

Senator George Campbell interjecting—

—Money was spent then, as it can be today, on any sort of terrorist or other political organisation. We are talking about the eighties and, in those days, Senator George Campbell, you were relevant, but you are not relevant now.

Senator George Campbell interjecting—

—You’re arrogant. Don’t be arrogant.
—You talk about great wars of ideology. The problem with your ideology is that it was wrong. It did not cut the mustard.

Senator George Campbell interjecting—

—Order, Senator George Campbell and Senator Lundy!
—It is not a matter of getting square at all; it is a matter of ensuring that this sort of thing never, ever happens again. That is the point. Quite frankly, if the Australian Labor Party were in government, do you think they would pass legislation banning student unions from giving money for political causes? They never, ever would, because it suits their political purposes. If you do not believe me, in the most recent federal election, last year, the member for Solomon, Mr Tollner, again had to put up with student money being used against him in a political campaign.
It is all very well for Senator Lundy and Senator Campbell to say, ‘Money should be spent on student amenities.’ As my friend Senator Fifield said, the money is fungible. As soon it can be used for, let us say, student services, student purposes or educational purposes, some student unions say it is in the interests of the education of students to fight and campaign against the government. They use compulsorily acquired money from 17-year-olds, most of whom these days vote for the coalition, to campaign against the coalition, and they think that is okay. That is the problem with the fraud of the Australian Labor Party in the 21st century: they come into this place and say, ‘You’re misrepresenting the case.’ Over 13 years, when the Australian Labor Party were in government, they had the opportunity to ensure that money was not taken from 17-year-olds or my father, who was a mature age student, and used for political purposes, and they did nothing. Why? Because it served their political purposes. It is time that was stopped and it must never happen again.
—Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Is it in order for the senator to so aggressively point across the chamber at me and other senators? Is he allowed to do that?
—There is no point of order.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Voluntary Student Unionism</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,13,1,speech
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2005-12-07,"—I am also going to take part in this debate on voluntary student unionism, but I think I might be a little quieter than the previous speaker. In the debate Senator Fifield quoted from the report that the committee tabled. A range of opinions were brought forward in that report. One of the key aspects of the evidence that was given was the amazing link that many cities and towns have with the universities that are located within their boundaries. That was seen across the country. I will mention again the University of Southern Queensland, which is in my home town, Toowoomba. I do not think even people from Queensland could accuse that university campus of being a hotbed of political activity. I have at times thought that it would be really useful if there could be some more political activity on that campus. But they raised significant concerns from the point of view of the impact on their community of the loss of a formal, secure money base that could be used for student amenities. That was the basis of the evidence that they gave.
I have two nephews who attend that campus, and they have paid the fees that they have been asked to pay for the last couple of years. They may or may not take part in the range of activities that are offered at that campus. Nonetheless, the people who work in the student association there can plan to have a certain amount of income available to look at the kinds of things that can be offered on campus. They include the kinds of services to which Senator Lundy referred—and she concentrated on the area of sport. I know the Queensland universities better than those in the other states, and I know that so much of the funding that was available from that particular income stream went to providing really strong sporting services at the universities that were available to all students and also to other people in the community who had links to the university. Not all students took up those services. We know that. But, nonetheless, there were facilities available—football, squash, tennis and a whole range of things—that were not able to be funded in any other way.
—But they all had to pay for them whether they used them or not.
—I will mention another university service—one that is particularly dear to my heart and may well be to Senator Brandis as well—which is the fate of the Schonell theatre on the University of Queensland campus. Through you, Mr Deputy President, maybe Senator Brandis will be able to talk about that issue. That theatre and entertainment complex, which has a long history in the city of Brisbane in terms of activity, location, performance and also social activity of all kinds around that area, is under direct threat because the management will not be able to see clearly into the future if the stream of funding that is provided from student union fees is to be withdrawn. They are planning for their future, because they know that in the current environment there is the opportunity for legislation to pass that will mean the end of this formal funding. They do not see their future clearly.
In terms of the processes that occur on the campuses themselves, I do not think anyone has a lack of concern about the communications that take place. People who are asked to pay money should have knowledge of how that money is spent. No-one argues with that. In fact, one of the key components of the amendments to which both Senator Lundy and Senator George Campbell referred was to ensure that this kind of accountability process could be enhanced. There have been cases in the past where people have felt that they were not sure what was happening with the money that they were paying as part of a student contribution to the wider activities of campus life. We have heard so much about different things that have worked and not worked in universities.
I am deeply concerned that, by withdrawing the security of knowing what money is going to be available, services will have to be cut or minimised. One of my major concerns about what will happen on some campuses is that services will be outsourced. The kinds of things that people can access now at universities, such as recreational services, food and even the kind of personal counselling that is available now on many campuses, will either not exist or will be outsourced and available in some kind of capital arrangement. I am worried that everyone seems to be saying that students are aged only between 17 and the mid-20s. We know that that is not true. The student population is of all ages.
I think we need to address those issues. We need to quite seriously make sure that people know where their money is going and understand the democratic process that takes place in electing student unions so that they have ownership of what happens with the funding. I think we have to acknowledge that, if there is not that secure knowledge within the university community about how much money they are going to have, there will be a tendency to withdraw services and to pull back. That would be very sad. (Time expired)

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2005-12-07,"—I seek leave to amend business of the Senate notice of motion No. 1 standing in my name for today.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the following matter be referred to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee for inquiry and report by 30 March 2006:
The involvement of the Australian Wheat Board in the Iraq Oil-for-Food Programme between 1999 and 2003, and consequent revelations that such involvement led to payments that were directed towards the Iraqi Government, with particular reference to the conduct of Commonwealth regulators including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Wheat Export Authority and any other relevant agencies.
The AWB is the exclusive manager and marketer of all Australian bulk wheat exports, through what is known as the single desk system. It is not my purpose here to attack the structure or the make-up of the AWB. While some have taken the opportunity to call for the abolition of the single desk in response to the revelations about the oil for food program, I make it clear that this is not my intention. Over nearly seven years of the oil for food program, the Australian Wheat Board supplied nearly 12 million tonnes of wheat over 41 contracts and 285 shipments. Contracts worth $US2.3 billion were signed between 1997 and 2003 and were paid out of an escrow account operated by the United Nations from Iraqi oil revenues.
Two years on, the corruption surrounding the Iraq oil for food program is a matter of record. It has tainted the United Nations at the highest level, a situation laid bare by the independent inquiry committee into the Iraq oil for food program, chaired by Paul Volcker. The Volcker committee established that the government of Iraq sold $US64.2 billion worth of oil to 248 companies and, in turn, 3,614 companies sold $34.5 billion worth of humanitarian goods to Iraq. Along the way, Volcker estimates the Iraqi government raked off around $US1.8 billion in illegal surcharges, after sales service fees and inland transportation fees.
The AWB’s part in this epidemic of corruption, knowingly or unknowingly, was a large one. The AWB was the single largest supplier of humanitarian goods under the program. As of 1999, the Iraqi Grain Board began to demand the company pay internal transportation fees to Alia, a Jordanian trucking outfit which, it transpires, was a front company with no trucking fleet and which was partly owned by the Iraqi transport ministry. Between 1999 and 2003, without signing a contract or performing any due diligence on Alia’s background, the AWB paid Alia $US221.7 million out of the UN escrow account for trucking fees and after sales service. Ten months after this deal commenced, the AWB contacted the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to check whether what it was doing was legal. Apparently, the word back from DFAT was ‘No problem’. Why did DFAT not check with the UN?
It has now been revealed—in fact, it was in today’s paper—that DFAT officials accompanied AWB officers to Iraq to help negotiate the wheat contracts which are now under investigation. This morning the Australian reported that the then Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Warren Truss, was being given confidential briefings on the incentives that the AWB was offering to its buyers in Iraq and elsewhere. How did it happen that DFAT or the government did not start to worry about what was going on? By this time, the UN had already concluded that deals with Alia would be a breach of sanctions, but we are told that this information was not passed on to the Australian government.
As far back as January 2000, a UN customs expert warned Australian diplomats that the Iraqi government was demanding $US700,000 from the Canadian Wheat Board to cover transport costs in Iraq. The Canadians raised this a number of times, but no-one seems to have found it odd that the AWB was up to its neck in a similar arrangement. The so-called shipping costs began at around $12 per metric tonne in 1999 and were hiked to $56 per metric tonne by 2003. At a time when the Australian government was being drawn deeper into an invasion of this troubled country, Alia was transferring nearly a quarter of a billion US dollars back to the Hussein regime on behalf of an Australian company.
The AWB has been at pains to point out that the Volcker report could not conclude that the AWB was knowingly involved in this colossal scam. Nevertheless, his report provides a worrying paper trail that exposes some extreme irregularities in the deal. In a nutshell, he found that if the AWB did not know what was going on, it certainly should have. By extension, government officials surely should have been aware of what was happening. My question, which this motion goes to the heart of, is: where were the regulators?
The United Nations has submitted itself to an embarrassing but long-overdue review of the program. According to a media statement by the UN Secretary-General on 27 October 2005:
... thorough reform of the management structures and practices of the United Nations, especially those that relate to oversight, transparency and accountability, is vital.
The Attorney-General duly announced an inquiry into certain Australian companies on 10 November, following calls from the Australian Greens and the Australian Labor Party for an immediate investigation. According to the Attorney-General’s media release of the same date, the inquiry will have the powers and immunities of a royal commission. If the UN is getting its house in order and the government’s inquiry into the AWB is under way, that leaves only one stone unturned: the regulatory bodies charged with preventing this sort of behaviour.
For all we know, there may be perfectly good reasons why government officials in DFAT, the Wheat Export Authority and the former cabinet minister did not know about this and why concerns were not raised, but we will not get to find out under the terms of reference of the government’s inquiry, because they have exempted themselves from this scrutiny. AWB executives and former officials have said that they welcome this inquiry, which is in stark contrast to the deafening silence coming from the government. Yesterday in the House of Representatives, Minister Mark Vaile noted:
... the government has announced and established a commission of inquiry with significant powers as far as this issue is concerned, and that is about to begin. We should leave it to that commission of inquiry to seek out the information and the evidence ...
The minister knows full well that this commission of inquiry has no power to investigate the role played by government officials. There may be nothing to hide, but the government are certainly giving us the opposite impression.
I attempted to put these questions to the Chairman of the Wheat Export Authority and his officials during supplementary estimates hearings last month, but was told at the time by the chair of the estimates committee, Senator Bill Heffernan, that the proper time for such questions would be through the government’s inquiry. I am not having a go at the chair, because he obviously genuinely believed at the time that the inquiry, when called, would be a full inquiry. Unfortunately, that is not so. The government has specifically excluded questions about the role of Commonwealth regulators; it is strictly concerned with investigating what the AWB knew.
The points I did get to make during estimates raised more questions than answers. The WEA is in an interesting position. When the Australian Wheat Board was privatised in 1999, the WEA was hived off as its regulating body, with responsibilities under the Wheat Marketing Act of 1989 to, amongst other things, ‘monitor, examine and report on the performance of AWB’. It has a role in monitoring compliance with the conditions of export consents issued, including pricing performance, supply chain and the operating environment. I do not accept the argument that, because the Wheat Board was privatised in 1999, all government responsibility ends there. The AWB holds a unique position, entrusted in large part with the welfare of nearly all Australian wheat growers as a consequence of its collective nature. This is why it has a regulatory body solely devoted to its activities.
Somehow, a quarter of a billion US dollars flew under this supposed regulatory radar, not into the pockets of AWB or Australian wheat growers but into the bank vaults of Saddam Hussein, who was being accused at the time by our government of being on the verge of blowing up the world. During estimates hearings, Senator Heffernan, the chair of the committee, assured me that we would leave no stone unturned to get to the bottom of this scandal. In moving this motion, I direct the question to the coalition and the members opposite: why have we only half an inquiry? What role did government officers and regulators play? Why weren’t gigantic warning signals rung when it is quite obvious that DFAT officials were in Iraq at the time that these contracts were being negotiated? This motion provides the Senate and the people of Australia with an opportunity to hear the other half of the story. This motion, as amended, does not cover the ground of the inquiry about to commence under the leadership of Mr Cole; it looks at the other side of the issue that the government refused to examine in this inquiry. I commend this motion to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee</title>",Committees,30,1,speech
"McGauran, Sen Julian",NATS,2005-12-07,"—The government reject the Greens’ motion before the chamber relating to matters of the oil for food program, specifically the conduct of AWB management employees and the conduct of the Commonwealth regulators, in particular the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. We reject it out of hand. Anyone who has been listening to the presentation by the Greens senator will know that she has already made her conclusions. She ran every slur and assertion through the Senate. She has already written the report without any knowledge. I do not think she knows much about this other than what she has read in the newspaper or listened to the opposition saying. You ran that slur and allegation against Mr Truss in your dissertation, which is absolutely incorrect. Did you bother to hear the retort to that slur by Mr O’Connor? You did not.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: I did not run any slur against Mr Truss; I said he was there. I did not run a slur.
 (Senator Watson)—There is no point of order. Senator McGauran, please address your remarks through the chair.
—On that matter, Mr O’Connor suggested, as reported in today’s Australian, that Mr Truss had been provided with regular confidential reports on kickbacks on offer. Within that is the suggestion that he kept it secret, that he knew and that there was a giant cover up. There was nothing of the sort. Mr O’Connor’s comments were deliberately put down to mislead. The truth of the matter is quite different, as the current Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has said publicly. The article says:
Minister Peter McGauran said Mr O’Connor’s comments were misleading. “The incentives to which the WEA referred in its annual report are listed and they cover items such as joint ventures, export credit breaks and staff exchanges,” he said. “The incentives referred to do not relate to monetary payments to third parties in overseas markets. The WEA’s reports do not contain the sort of information alleged (by Mr O’Connor).”
That has been the modus operandi of this whole issue—that is, to throw out the allegation without any evidence because you are running a political line. That is one very good reason why this government will reject the motion before the Senate as you want to shunt it off to a references committee where the majority is held by the opposition. If you do not think it is a stunt, just look at the reporting date. The report is to come down one day before the government’s independent inquiry by Commissioner Cole. That is to run interference with, distraction and even contradiction of the independent inquiry.
The government does not in any way seek to diminish an investigation into this matter. We believe that any material suggestion of improper behaviour by Australian companies overseas—particularly with respect to what we are talking about here—is a matter of public importance, is an offence under law and is worthy of an inquiry. In the matter before us, we are dealing with the good reputation of AWB directors, Australia’s good trade reputation and the good reputation of officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. For that reason, when this matter came to light, the government quickly announced an independent inquiry with royal commission powers and immunities.
The commission was established in direct response to the United Nations’ request following the Volcker inquiry. The United Nations urged sovereign states to take action where inappropriate behaviour may have been carried out by companies falling within their sovereign jurisdiction. That is exactly what the government is doing. It is seeking to get to the truth of the matter through an independent, unbiased inquiry. The commission will be headed by New South Wales Supreme Court Judge of Appeal, the Hon. Terence Cole—who is known to all as the former royal commissioner inquiring into the building and construction industry. He is a well-respected man and a well-studied man in matters of royal commissions and getting to the bottom and to the truth of matters. We are concerned that the inquiry be conducted independently, in a timely fashion and in a comprehensive manner and should report by 31 March. The key fact here is that it is an independent inquiry—at arms-length from the government and certainly at arms-length from those opposite who seek to run their own inquiry and who have made their judgments prior to even having the reference before the committee.
It is worthy of note—and the Greens senator did say this—that the AWB welcome the federal government’s inquiry. Senator Siewert, they welcome it and, in doing so, are saying that they have nothing to hide. I will refer to their public comment. In relation to the government establishing this Cole inquiry, the AWB said on 1 November:
AWB will cooperate fully with the independent inquiry into the United Nations Oil-for-Food program announced by the Australian Federal Government yesterday.
It should be noted that the Volcker report did not find that AWB was knowingly involved in any scheme or arrangement to channel funds to the former Iraqi regime.
It is of concern to AWB that allegations are being made against the company and anticipates the inquiry to address them.
I suspect Senator O’Brien will also be speaking on this matter—
—Yes, I am. I am looking forward to it.
—No doubt he will also raise the suggestion that the terms of reference of this independent inquiry are too narrow. We reject that claim. It ought to be noted that the Volcker inquiry found absolutely no criticism of the behaviour of the Australian government. That is the reason that the terms of reference are entirely appropriate. Your claim is exactly the reason that we are rejecting this motion—because you are on a fishing expedition. This motion is political. It is a far more serious matter than that. We have at hand the good reputation of AWB, the good reputation of DFAT and the good reputation of Australia as a trading nation. Do you think we would leave that in the hands of the references committee, a highly political and charged committee which—as shown already in the debate here today—has already made up its mind?
We are not going to indulge the opposition and the Greens in a fishing expedition, because DFAT have nothing to answer for—they are completely cleared. Nevertheless, it is feasible that the commissioner would seek some information from DFAT in relation to the process, and it would be entirely appropriate for them to cooperate with that. The government fully back the integrity of the officers of DFAT with regard to this matter and reject the innuendos being perpetrated, particularly by the shadow minister for foreign affairs, who has been scurrilous in this matter in basically accusing—certainly by innuendo and suggestion—that DFAT were aware of the illegal channelling of funds to the Iraqi government.
It is worth setting out the process and the role of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in this matter so that it is properly understood what the exact role of DFAT was. I will refer to the Hansard where the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry let the lower house know of this matter. He said:
Commercial suppliers would negotiate and agree on a contract with Iraqi counterparts. DFAT was not a party to the contract. The contract would be forwarded to DFAT for submission. DFAT would examine the contract paperwork. Once satisfied that this had been properly completed and that the transaction did not appear to infringe the United Nations sanctions regime, the documentation was submitted via the Australian United Nations mission to the United Nations Office of the Iraq Program and the 661 sanctions committee in New York. United Nations customs experts in the UN Office of the Iraq Program had responsibility for evaluating the price and value of contracts. Following contract approval by the United Nations, DFAT would issue an export permit authorising the export to Iraq.
As I said earlier, the government fully cooperated with the Volcker inquiry, which found no evidence of complicity on the part of the government. In fact, there was not a skerrick of evidence or suggestion that would bring the government under inquiry—except from those opposite who seek to sling mud and to descend this matter into a political issue. We happen to think that it is far more serious than that. We have set up an independent inquiry—not a political one.
I would add that what Senator Siewert neglects to note—something which Senator O’Brien will also neglect to note—is that this matter has already faced the parliament and a litany of questions. This issue was raised at recent estimates committees, where extensive questions were asked of the department and the Wheat Export Authority by none other than the grand old inquisitor himself, Senator Faulkner. Senator Faulkner directed questions to Ms Gillian Bird, the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for possibly hours. After all that questioning, I think I would concur with the chair of the committee at that time, Senator Sandy Macdonald when he summed up the hours of questioning and said to Senator Faulkner:
You have made assertions, as is your wont. You are entitled to do that, as long as everyone understands what you do. I think the questions have been adequately addressed. You can seek further explanation, but you have had it.
You have had good explanation; that is the point he was making. There is a hell of a lot of difference between an assertion and evidence but, as Senator Macdonald said,
If you think that assertions are a way of making your case, proceed, but the questions have been fully explained.
So it is quite clear that on this matter there is no cover-up. There is no lid on this. It has been before the estimates committee and under heavy scrutiny. Of course, in the other committee to which Senator O’Brien and Senator Siewert belonged, the estimates committee on agriculture and transport, Senator Siewert also took to the Wheat Export Authority and asked her own litany of questions. So she cannot say she has been denied access on this matter at all.
But it is a little more serious when reputations are on the line, let alone the Australian market. Of course, through all your public posturing, the usual suspects, who are always trying to grab the Australian markets, in particular those in the Middle East, have taken full advantage of this, and you have succoured them.
The Australian government and the Australian Wheat Export Authority do not wish to jeopardise the integrity of the market in any way, and will not. It is worthy to quote the Volcker findings with regard to AWB Limited. And I will quote directly from those findings to put this matter in perspective and to try, in a probably hopeless attempt, to convince you to withdraw this motion—or to try at least to explain why this government will have no bar of this political exercise. I quote the Volcker inquiry in regard to AWB:
The evidence does not suffice to conclude that AWB had actual knowledge of Alia’s partial ownership by the government of Iraq, that it had actual knowledge of the fact that Alia did not actually perform trucking services for the AWB’s wheat or that it had actual knowledge of the fact that Alia remitted to the payments it received from AWB to the government of Iraq.
It went on to say:
On the other hand, it is discussed in detail below that numerous documentary and circumstantial warning signs placed at least some employees of AWB on notice that payments to Alia may have been illicitly funding the Iraqi regime.
And that is the full context of this. There is nothing to hide. And that is exactly why AWB, as I read out, welcomes this inquiry. I read the full brief. I bet Senator O’Brien thought I was going to stop a few sentences before that.
That is the full context of what Commissioner Cole will inquire into. There is no cover-up. The point is: it is an independent inquiry. We want this matter cleared up just as much as AWB does. But it is very convenient of the speakers on the other side to totally ignore the real culprits in all this.
In conclusion, let us not forget who the real culprits in this oil for food scandal are—the culprits are certainly not AWB Limited nor this government. The real culprits are the United Nations themselves, because what the Volcker inquiry really found was that there was corruption, nearly all the way to the top. Let us not put that aside—that there was a scandal involved in all this, and the corruption was very heavily weighted within the higher ranks of the United Nations itself.
The government is firm in its resolve to act upon the United Nations’ request to make this a transparent and independent inquiry, and to act upon its recommendations. This is in the interests of trade relations, in the best interests of AWB Limited and in the best interests of all involved in the oil for food program. Therefore, we reject this motion.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee</title>",Committees,30,1,speech
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2005-12-07,"—It is interesting to hear the comments from Senator McGauran—interesting that the government have chosen him to defend them on this motion. I would have perhaps expected Senator Heffernan, who knows a lot about the Wheat Export Authority and AWB to have been defending, on the basis of his in-depth knowledge, but the government have chosen not to ask him to do that.
We will be supporting this motion. We will be supporting this motion although we should not have to. We have to support this motion because the government has not done the right thing. When it devised the terms of reference for its inquiry into this matter, to be headed by Mr Cole, an inquiry by the Foreign Affairs Defence and Trade References Committee would not have been needed if those terms of reference had ensured that the actions of the Howard government and its agencies would be put under the microscope of that Cole inquiry. If the government had done that, we would not have needed an inquiry by a committee of this Senate, but it has not done that. It has given a very narrow focus through the terms of reference for the Cole inquiry which is devised to protect the government. So we can have no confidence that the Howard government’s involvement in the oil for food scandal will ever see the light of day through any actions of this government.
And who could be surprised that the government now oppose a motion that might have the effect of exposing their complicity or their knowledge in the matter. But, of course, we have heard from Senator McGauran today and he has been true to the script from this government. They are blame shifters: ‘Someone else is at fault. It was not us, it was not the AWB, it was not the Wheat Export Authority, it was the United Nations.’ The United Nations apparently were responsible for the deal for Alia to rake off $56 a tonne for trucking services they never delivered. How ridiculous.
Senator McGauran knows that is not true. He knows that it has no basis in fact, but he is prepared to put it forward as a justification for this shabby performance of the government, which is again hiding from scrutiny, using its numbers to block the scrutiny of the Senate—which the Labor Party warned the Australian people this government would do when it got the numbers in this place. This government is going to use its numbers to prevent its incompetence and its complicity in corruption from being exposed.
We know for a fact that in January 2000 the United Nations called the Australian government in New York and said: ‘We’ve got some concerns about what the Australian Wheat Board is up to in Iraq. We’ve got some concerns about the alleged use of Jordanian bank accounts.’ We now know the basis of those concerns. We know that those concerns were cabled back to Canberra from the Australian government’s mission in New York and that those concerns were distributed to various ministers’ offices at the time. Conveniently, none of that seemed to find its way into the defence by Senator McGauran. The facts, that have been well known, were not dealt with at all, because there is no answer to that. It clearly demonstrates that the government had knowledge that there were concerns at United Nations level about Jordanian bank account involvement. Where is the company that Senator McGauran referred to based? Jordan, I think.
In 2003 Colin Powell was told by US Wheat Associates that Australian wheat contracts under the UN oil for food program were inflated by millions of dollars per shipload and that the excess may have gone into accounts of Saddam Hussein’s family. That was on the public record in 2003. US Wheat Associates were trying to convince the US government to take action. I happened to be the shadow minister for agriculture at that time, and I called for the government to investigate. Mr Vaile declined to investigate. He used a shabby device to try to pretend that we had not actually called for them to investigate. He reported this matter to the House of Representatives on 9 November, but the reality was that I had called on him to investigate more than two years before that, and he had declined to investigate. Let us examine why that might be.
Before I do that, let me also touch on something that has recently been revealed by the Prime Minister. He said, ‘Of course, we had Australian government officials travelling into Iraq with the Australian Wheat Board while commercial negotiations were taking place under the oil for food program.’ So we had officials of the Australian government as part of the negotiation. They knew what was going on.
—You assert.
—The Prime Minister said that. What did successive ministers for agriculture, fisheries and forestry know, and what should they have known? As he was the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry for most of the period we are concerned with, I want to look at what the present Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Mr Truss, knew about AWB’s role in the oil for food scandal and what action, if any, he took. The Wheat Export Authority is a statutory authority, and it reports to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. It liaises with the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. As far as I am aware, that is part of the government.
It was established in 1998-99, at the time the government privatised the Australian Wheat Board and handed over Australia’s single-desk marketing arrangements for wheat to AWB Ltd and to its international arm, AWB International. The functions and powers of the Wheat Export Authority are set out in the Wheat Marketing Act. In relation to those functions, the act has this to say:
(1) The Authority has the following functions:
(a) to control the export of wheat from Australia;
(b) to monitor nominated company B’s—
that is, AWB’s—
performance in relation to the export of wheat and examine and report on the benefits to growers that result from that performance.
In relation to the Wheat Export Authority’s powers, the act says:
The Authority has power to do all things that are necessary or convenient to be done in connection with the performance of its functions.
It goes on to say:
The Authority may direct nominated company B—
That is AWB again—
or a related body corporate of nominated company B, to give to the Authority: (a) information; or (b) documents, or copies of documents, in the custody or under the control of nominated company B or the related body corporate;
The act also requires the Wheat Export Authority to prepare three reports every year on AWB’s performance. One is a report to Australian wheat growers, the second is an annual report, and, importantly, the third is a confidential report to the agriculture minister—at all material times Mr Warren Truss.
It is abundantly clear that this parliament has given the Wheat Export Authority the role of overseeing the activities of AWB Ltd and all the power it needs to carry out that function. We also know that at least once a year the Wheat Export Authority gives a confidential account of its activities to the agriculture minister and much less detailed reports to this parliament and to wheat growers. It is the authority’s 1999-2000 annual report that gives us some indication of the sorts of activities the Wheat Export Authority is interested in. The 1999-2000 annual report of the Wheat Export Authority tells us that it planned to employ a consultant in October 2000. The report also sets out the proposed duties of that consultant, and they include an examination of ‘incentives paid by AWB International compared with other competitors.’
During the recent estimates hearings that Senator McGauran spoke about, I asked a number of questions about the work of this consultant. I have to say that representatives of the Wheat Export Authority were not particularly forthcoming in relation to this matter and some of my questions were taken on notice. I look forward to getting answers to those questions. Nevertheless, the CEO of the Wheat Export Authority was able to confirm that the work undertaken by the consultant referred to in the 1999-2000 annual report is ongoing and that the results of his investigations have been included in the annual confidential report to the agriculture minister, Mr Warren Truss.
The question has to be asked: how much did the agriculture minister and the Wheat Export Authority know about the allegations made in the Age and in the Sydney Morning Herald yesterday of a culture within the AWB of providing kickbacks to authorities in a number of AWB overseas markets? The newspapers quoted former staff members of AWB as saying that substantial kickbacks went to officials in Pakistan, Indonesia and Yemen. It also beggars belief that an authority with the powers and resources of the Wheat Export Authority, with the clear role of overseeing AWB’s performance, did not know about those kickbacks and did not report them to the minister, especially since we know that the authority already had a particular interest in the ‘incentives’, as it described them, that AWB had offered to some of its customers.
It is true that, at the same estimates hearing, the chairman of the Wheat Export Authority, Mr Besley, told the committee that the authority had no particular knowledge of the payments AWB funnelled to Saddam Hussein under the oil for food program. According to Mr Besley, even the 400 per cent increase over two years in the cost of transporting wheat in Iraq did not ring alarm bells within the Wheat Export Authority. That is fabulous, isn’t it? Yet, in other evidence to the committee, Mr Taylor, CEO of the Wheat Export Authority, confirmed that contracts for the supply and delivery of wheat to Iraq were checked and crosschecked, and he went on to make the following rather curious statement:
From the material that WEA had before it, and from the assessments it had done, there had been no apparent impact on the pool of any additional services that may have been bundled with sales of wheat.
What did we just hear—a quarter of a billion dollars? A quarter of a billion dollars had ‘no apparent impact’. It appears from this that the authority was at least aware that there were so-called additional services provided for in the contract and that these additional services had been examined to determine if they had had an impact on the pool.
Mr Taylor also said that the authority compares all AWB contracts for the supply of wheat to its international customers and, in order to make the comparisons meaningful and consistent, it does so on an FOB basis. Where contracts are not made on an FOB basis, then the authority examines them in detail so that they can be converted to FOB for comparison purposes. The oil for food contracts were not FOB; they included ‘additional services’. On the basis of the evidence provided then, it would have been the Wheat Export Authority’s practice to examine them in detail in order to convert them to FOB for comparison purposes.
At the very least we can confidently say that successive agriculture ministers and the Wheat Export Authority ought to have known what was going on in relation to AWB’s dealings in Iraq under the oil for food program. The Wheat Export Authority has a statutory duty to oversee the operations of AWB Ltd. It has all the power it needs to complete that task. It was interested in the so-called incentives AWB pays to attract and retain customers. It had access to all the relevant contracts. It makes an annual confidential report to the agriculture minister. So it is clear that the WEA knew or at least ought to have known what was going on in Iraq under the oil for food program. If the authority did know and did not tell the minister, then it has failed in its duty to protect the interests of wheat growers and the Australian public. If it really did not know, that is almost as bad, given its powers and what it said it pursued and inquired into.
As I said earlier, the Howard government was warned by the United Nations back in the year 2000 of concerns raised by the Canadian Wheat Board about the operation of the oil for food program and in May 2002 of similar concerns by the US General Accounting Office. And it has been clear, since at least the 2003 invasion of Iraq, that there have been problems for Australia in the Iraqi wheat market. For example, we have been losing market share to the United States and, even before the Volcker report, US wheat interests had been making a variety of allegations about the way AWB Ltd had been doing business in Iraq.
I do not have to make any comment on the validity of these allegations, but their very existence ought to have alerted the Wheat Export Authority to problems in the Iraqi market and, as a result, it would have been reasonable to expect the authority to pay particular attention to AWB’s performance in that market. We do have some evidence that the Wheat Export Authority did just that. In its 2004 growers report, the Wheat Export Authority included a section on difficulties being experienced by AWB in the Iraq wheat market. The section on Iraq was the only section dealing with an individual country. It does not refer to the oil for food program, but its very existence indicates that the Wheat Export Authority had been keeping a watchful eye on AWB’s performance in Iraq. Given that, there remain many unanswered questions about exactly what the Wheat Export Authority did know about the AWB involvement in the oil for food scandal and the $300 million that found its way into Saddam Hussein’s coffers.
There are also unanswered questions about what the Wheat Export Authority told the agriculture minister about that involvement. But, of course, this government has drawn up the terms of reference for the Cole inquiry so the Cole inquiry cannot inquire into what the minister knew. With all of those confidential reports protected by secrecy, the minister hides behind the terms of reference this government has drawn up for itself and then says, ‘But it’s not appropriate for us to have this inquiry because we’re having a thoroughgoing inquiry’—which just happens to protect the government from the scrutiny that it so richly deserves, and that the Australian public needs, so that we can get to the truth of this matter. That is, what did the minister know and when did the minister know it? In 2000, when there were the first warning signs, what did the government do? What decisions did the government take? Why did the government not take action? Those questions will not be answered by the Cole inquiry because the Cole inquiry’s terms of reference were drawn up to shield the government from just such scrutiny. And then the government has the temerity to pretend that the Cole inquiry is a justification for this inquiry not going ahead.
We know the government has the numbers and that it will block this inquiry. We know the government will prevent the Senate from conducting the scrutiny that it ought to and that it has a responsibility to the Australian people to conduct, but the government will prevent it from doing that because this government is so arrogant in the way that it goes about its business in this place. It is making sure that the scrutiny that the parliament could apply to the executive government will not be applied. It is displaying an arrogance which I think will convey to the Australian people the fact that they made a decision that they ultimately will regret, and this government will pay for it at the next election.
In relation to Senator Siewert’s motion, I am not certain but I am given to understand that that may actually have been lodged before the government announced its terms of reference with its reporting date. So the coincidence that the reporting date for this inquiry predates the Cole inquiry reporting date by a day would be something that the government could have concocted but that Senator Siewert could not have known about and therefore could not have concocted. If that is the case, then frankly Senator McGauran owes an apology to Senator Siewert for misrepresenting the position of her motion before the Senate. Perhaps he will be man enough to give us that apology at the conclusion of this debate; perhaps he will not. Be that as it may, we will stand behind this motion because the government has not had the gumption to stand up to a proper inquiry. It has given the inquirer the power to compel and protect witnesses but it will not give it the power to ask the government the questions that need to be asked so that we know how complicit this government has been in the improprieties around AWB Ltd and the oil for food program.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee</title>",Committees,30,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2005-12-07,"—I rise briefly on behalf of the Australian Democrats in my capacity as their foreign affairs spokesperson and, indeed, as a member of the Senate committee to which this reference will go if it is successful. I indicate our support for this motion. I do not intend to rehash the arguments in favour of the reference because I think Senator O’Brien and Senator Siewert have done a comprehensive job of explaining why this inquiry is necessary. I also do not wish to pre-empt in any way the outcome of this proposed inquiry. Suffice to say that the Democrats believe that there are a number of questions that still need to be answered in relation to this particular issue. Clearly one of them is to do with the role and responsibility of the government. That is what Senator Siewert’s motion intends the committee to examine. In relation to the time frames, the Australian Democrats’ understanding is that Senator Siewert put forward her time frame for this investigation and report before the government put forward its time frame. I am informed that we are correct, so I think that those who have made adverse comments in relation to the timing or the motivation of this motion should perhaps retract their statements because they are an unfair reflection.
I indicate that I, on behalf of the Democrats, had some concerns about the initial wording of this motion, in particular the original part (a), which talked about the conduct of AWB management and employees throughout this period. As senators would know, this motion has been amended to take into account the fact that there is an inquiry—the Cole inquiry has been proposed and will be under way. This motion now deals specifically with an area that is within our purview. It is within our responsibility—that is, the conduct of Commonwealth regulators, including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Wheat Export Authority and any other relevant agencies—so it is thoroughly appropriate for the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee to examine these particular issues.
If the government and honourable senators who are members of the government in this place are so sure that there is no case to be answered and there is nothing to hide—and I am not pre-empting this in any way—then they should say that they are quite comfortable putting the department and relevant agencies up for examination. They should not be scared of this inquiry; in fact, they should welcome it. They should welcome it in the sense that it gives the government an opportunity to show their hand, to make clear what dealings they had, how those dealings were conducted and what knowledge, if any, existed.
—We welcome the royal commission.
—I do not want to respond to that interjection, but, Madam Acting Deputy President Kirk, although you have heard today arguments as to why the Cole commission is an appropriate forum for some of the issues, I think that in fact, as of today’s revelations, it is exposed as having terms of reference that are not far ranging enough. I am conscious of the Prime Minister’s argument that he believes that the commission has enough teeth, but there are some of us in this place who believe there should be broader reflection, broader investigation, specifically when it comes to the role and responsibilities of government. That is what this motion seeks to do.
It is an important motion. These are not insubstantial issues. Let’s face it: this is a huge international scandal. The Volcker report has identified AWB as violators in this program. There are issues associated with that that we should have clarified for a whole range of good governance, accountability and transparency reasons. That is what we seek to achieve here. I think also it is a reflection on government at the moment that people are actively and loudly questioning the role of departmental officers and officials. An article in the Independent Weekly from 27 November by Lee Eckermann, the national affairs writer for that newspaper, says:
AWB management, naturally enough, has claimed that the organisation was an unwitting dupe to the deception set up by others, that it was not aware of what was going on, and that the UN was to blame for AWB’s involvement in the scandal.
It goes on to say:
We are asked to believe that no one in the federal Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which sanctioned the AWB payments to the Jordanian transport company set up as the front for the kickbacks, knew anything of the affair. Nor did anyone at AWB get a sniff of anything untoward.
That is quite a reflection and raises quite a good question. It probably reflects a good deal of scepticism and concern in this chamber, let alone in the community and obviously in the fourth estate. Let’s face it—these implications and assertions need to be examined. I would have thought that good governance would dictate that we had an inquiry of this kind.
I will not go further into some of these issues, although I might say that there are a number of related issues, perhaps not germane or specific to this particular proposed reference. But the whole issue of postwar reconstruction contracts is something that is going to be under examination, not just in this country but more broadly. People have argued that this is potentially the tip of the iceberg. I am very conscious of the anticorruption watchdog Transparency International, who have indicated that, unless some steps are taken to have stricter and tighter rules for awarding those kinds of contracts, this scandal and others will just be the start. Again, that is not specific to this particular inquiry.
On the matter of process, I heard Senator O’Brien’s comments that the government had the numbers and obviously I heard Senator Julian McGauran’s contribution, which indicated the government’s ‘firm resolve’, I think it was, to oppose this motion.
—It was our firm resolve to get to the bottom of the matter.
—I am happy to take that interjection. ‘Get to the bottom of the matter’—I think that is what we are all hoping to achieve here; we just seem to have different ways of going about it. I acknowledge that. The fact that the government is not supportive of this motion is a bit of a red flag. People in the community who are observing and listening to the Senate, and members of the media, wherever they may be, should be very conscious of what is happening in the chamber today and in the last couple of weeks—the flagrant abuse and use of power and numbers in this place; the guillotines and the gagging; the way that we roll through legislation no matter how comprehensive, serious or significant—
—Which the Democrats have supported before.
—I will accept that interjection because I want to clarify a point. People in this place on all sides, including the Labor Party and the Democrats, have voted for the guillotine. I think I have voted for one in my life—on the legislation to do with research involving human embryos. There was a guillotine on that. I am not suggesting that in itself a guillotine is wrong. I am not suggesting that, when we have had days, potentially weeks, of comprehensive and satisfactory argument, or when we have debated individual amendments, or at least put them individually, as opposed to the sausage factory approach that we have seen in the last week, there are not occasions in which a guillotine is appropriate.
But I think we should make it very clear for the record that there have been very few occasions, if any, in this place where not only has a guillotine operated but it has operated so soon into the debate on a piece of legislation, without consultation, negotiation or information—particularly involving the opposition—in a way that has not only cut off the speakers list but has actually cut off debate on all or most of the amendments. It is also very rare for a guillotine to take place in this place without the support of another party. I am sure the Labor Party would be the first to admit that in most cases when we have seen the guillotine in the past they have joined with the coalition. This is what I find so interesting—the way the government conveniently ignore their history when they were in opposition, because they worked with the ALP in relation to the guillotine when the ALP were in government.
I do not want to be waylaid on this point, because I think honourable senators, the public and the media are quite conscious of what is happening in this place now. I think people have had the wake-up call. We need a check on executive power. They are not happy about what is going on. I think everyone acknowledges that a mandate to form government with a majority in the Senate is one thing but to completely erode the house of review capabilities or responsibilities of a chamber is another.
The issue I want to draw attention to, which relates to this motion and the likely outcome of this vote, is the issue of committee references. I know on this side of the chamber non-government senators are awfully conscious of the number of committee references that seem to be getting opposed or knocked off. I can see Senator Marshall champing at the bit, ready to put forward what I and the Australian Democrats think is a first-class motion to do with an inquiry involving the CSIRO. It does not look like that is going to get up. I think Senator McLucas has a committee reference as well, and there are others that have been knocked off in recent days or weeks. On today’s red we will see a number of proposed references completely knocked off.
That begs the question as to what role this government now envisages for the committee system. Certainly we have seen the role it envisages for the legislation committees—that is, to deal abruptly, inadequately and inconveniently with legislation that comes to this place; get it through; have a committee that preferably does not travel too far or take too many submissions over too long a period of time; and then see what it can do to inconvenience senators who might want to go to more than one committee. I look at you, Madam Acting Deputy President Kirk, and I refer that to Senator Siewert, who I know was feeling a bit angry about this issue today when accused of not attending the radioactive waste committee—never mind the fact that there were a few other committees on at the same time. Minor party senators certainly know better than most that when there are only, say, four of you, it is very difficult to get to every committee reference.
I think we have all seen the way this government wants its legislation committees to work, but how does it want its references committees to work—or does it want them to work? I do not think it wants them to work anymore. I think the government wants to close them down. I do not know about many of the committees that people are on in this place, but it seems to me that the references are drying up and any proposals that are coming from opposition are getting knocked off. The flimsy arguments being used to knock them off are a bit like the one we have just heard in relation to Senator Siewert’s reference to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee on the Australian Wheat Board issue.
I think it is a red flag, people. Perhaps it is something we should be keeping some interesting statistics on and checking on because I think you have seen it now. We have all seen it—the new role of the Senate: we will not do references inquiries; we will do rushed legislation inquiries. We will not do references inquiries, where, of course, the government does not have the numbers or the chair. So maybe we should be envisaging a bit of a change in the composition of those inquiries or those committees. Maybe we should be envisaging that most of the references, if any, are going to come from government. I am wondering what, if anything, they will involve.
We support this motion because it is a good motion. We are not pre-empting the outcome. We think that there are reasonable and legitimate grounds for an inquiry of this sort. The issues that we had some difficulties with in this motion have since been amended, and that is where this motion would have pre-empted the outcome of the Cole commission. It is something that we think is appropriate and we support, albeit arguing now for perhaps expanded terms of reference, particularly in light of today’s revelations. But this is a red flag: no more references inquiries, no more committee inquiries and no investigation into matters that the Senate has a responsibility to investigate. So this is the new curtailed, truncated Australian Senate. This is the new house of review provided we do not do any review. I commend the motion moved by Senator Siewert. She will have our vote, but I cannot say that it is looking too positive for the outcome.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee</title>",Committees,30,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2005-12-07,"—I wish to make a few comments to wrap up. Senator O’Brien and Senator Stott Despoja were right: I moved this motion on 8 November, which was before the government called its inquiry on 10 November. I left it on the Notice Paper because the government’s inquiry is not satisfactory. It does not fully investigate all the things that need to be investigated in this circumstance.
A very senior ex-government official, who probably would not want me to name him, once said to me—and he used vernacular which is not appropriate in this chamber, so I will try and substitute a word—‘If it ever comes to deciding whether something was a stuff-up or a conspiracy, go for the stuff-up.’ Even if I went for the stuff-up in this process, should the government not be deeply concerned that the regulation and the regulatory process have failed? They failed—$US221.7 million flew to the Iraqi regime. That is a failure in regulation. Do the government not want to get this right? Do they not want to see where the process failed? The Cole commission will not do that. It will not look at the government regulators involved. So why do they not want to get it right? Even that question has to be asked: why do they not want to see where the problems are and fix them?
The point was also made that we got a chance in estimates. We did not. In estimates Senator Milne, Senator O’Brien and I were asked to stop questioning because we were told this would come out in any government inquiry. So we only got to ask a limited number of questions to the Wheat Export Authority.
—It went on for hours.
—I am sorry: I was there. I know what I was told and I was told that this would come out in the inquiry, and it did not. We stopped asking questions. We respected the fact that we were asked to stop asking questions because it would come out in the inquiry. It will not, and that is why we need this Senate inquiry to fully investigate this side of what happened. As I said, let us look at what stuff-ups occurred. Let us try and fix it because we never want this to happen again—I am not even going to speculate on the circumstances in which this could happen again. We want to know why regulation failed. If the WEA processes are not adequate to pick this sort of thing up, it needs to be fixed. If DFAT’s processes are not adequate to fix this up, it needs to be fixed. That is why we need this inquiry, and nothing that I heard from the other side of the chamber convinced me at all that this inquiry is not needed.

Leave granted.
—I move:
That the following matter be referred to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee for inquiry and report by 30 March 2006:
The involvement of the Australian Wheat Board in the Iraq Oil-for-Food Programme between 1999 and 2003, and consequent revelations that such involvement led to payments that were directed towards the Iraqi Government, with particular reference to the conduct of Commonwealth regulators including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Wheat Export Authority and any other relevant agencies.
The AWB is the exclusive manager and marketer of all Australian bulk wheat exports, through what is known as the single desk system. It is not my purpose here to attack the structure or the make-up of the AWB. While some have taken the opportunity to call for the abolition of the single desk in response to the revelations about the oil for food program, I make it clear that this is not my intention. Over nearly seven years of the oil for food program, the Australian Wheat Board supplied nearly 12 million tonnes of wheat over 41 contracts and 285 shipments. Contracts worth $US2.3 billion were signed between 1997 and 2003 and were paid out of an escrow account operated by the United Nations from Iraqi oil revenues.
Two years on, the corruption surrounding the Iraq oil for food program is a matter of record. It has tainted the United Nations at the highest level, a situation laid bare by the independent inquiry committee into the Iraq oil for food program, chaired by Paul Volcker. The Volcker committee established that the government of Iraq sold $US64.2 billion worth of oil to 248 companies and, in turn, 3,614 companies sold $34.5 billion worth of humanitarian goods to Iraq. Along the way, Volcker estimates the Iraqi government raked off around $US1.8 billion in illegal surcharges, after sales service fees and inland transportation fees.
The AWB’s part in this epidemic of corruption, knowingly or unknowingly, was a large one. The AWB was the single largest supplier of humanitarian goods under the program. As of 1999, the Iraqi Grain Board began to demand the company pay internal transportation fees to Alia, a Jordanian trucking outfit which, it transpires, was a front company with no trucking fleet and which was partly owned by the Iraqi transport ministry. Between 1999 and 2003, without signing a contract or performing any due diligence on Alia’s background, the AWB paid Alia $US221.7 million out of the UN escrow account for trucking fees and after sales service. Ten months after this deal commenced, the AWB contacted the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to check whether what it was doing was legal. Apparently, the word back from DFAT was ‘No problem’. Why did DFAT not check with the UN?
It has now been revealed—in fact, it was in today’s paper—that DFAT officials accompanied AWB officers to Iraq to help negotiate the wheat contracts which are now under investigation. This morning the Australian reported that the then Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Warren Truss, was being given confidential briefings on the incentives that the AWB was offering to its buyers in Iraq and elsewhere. How did it happen that DFAT or the government did not start to worry about what was going on? By this time, the UN had already concluded that deals with Alia would be a breach of sanctions, but we are told that this information was not passed on to the Australian government.
As far back as January 2000, a UN customs expert warned Australian diplomats that the Iraqi government was demanding $US700,000 from the Canadian Wheat Board to cover transport costs in Iraq. The Canadians raised this a number of times, but no-one seems to have found it odd that the AWB was up to its neck in a similar arrangement. The so-called shipping costs began at around $12 per metric tonne in 1999 and were hiked to $56 per metric tonne by 2003. At a time when the Australian government was being drawn deeper into an invasion of this troubled country, Alia was transferring nearly a quarter of a billion US dollars back to the Hussein regime on behalf of an Australian company.
The AWB has been at pains to point out that the Volcker report could not conclude that the AWB was knowingly involved in this colossal scam. Nevertheless, his report provides a worrying paper trail that exposes some extreme irregularities in the deal. In a nutshell, he found that if the AWB did not know what was going on, it certainly should have. By extension, government officials surely should have been aware of what was happening. My question, which this motion goes to the heart of, is: where were the regulators?
The United Nations has submitted itself to an embarrassing but long-overdue review of the program. According to a media statement by the UN Secretary-General on 27 October 2005:
... thorough reform of the management structures and practices of the United Nations, especially those that relate to oversight, transparency and accountability, is vital.
The Attorney-General duly announced an inquiry into certain Australian companies on 10 November, following calls from the Australian Greens and the Australian Labor Party for an immediate investigation. According to the Attorney-General’s media release of the same date, the inquiry will have the powers and immunities of a royal commission. If the UN is getting its house in order and the government’s inquiry into the AWB is under way, that leaves only one stone unturned: the regulatory bodies charged with preventing this sort of behaviour.
For all we know, there may be perfectly good reasons why government officials in DFAT, the Wheat Export Authority and the former cabinet minister did not know about this and why concerns were not raised, but we will not get to find out under the terms of reference of the government’s inquiry, because they have exempted themselves from this scrutiny. AWB executives and former officials have said that they welcome this inquiry, which is in stark contrast to the deafening silence coming from the government. Yesterday in the House of Representatives, Minister Mark Vaile noted:
... the government has announced and established a commission of inquiry with significant powers as far as this issue is concerned, and that is about to begin. We should leave it to that commission of inquiry to seek out the information and the evidence ...
The minister knows full well that this commission of inquiry has no power to investigate the role played by government officials. There may be nothing to hide, but the government are certainly giving us the opposite impression.
I attempted to put these questions to the Chairman of the Wheat Export Authority and his officials during supplementary estimates hearings last month, but was told at the time by the chair of the estimates committee, Senator Bill Heffernan, that the proper time for such questions would be through the government’s inquiry. I am not having a go at the chair, because he obviously genuinely believed at the time that the inquiry, when called, would be a full inquiry. Unfortunately, that is not so. The government has specifically excluded questions about the role of Commonwealth regulators; it is strictly concerned with investigating what the AWB knew.
The points I did get to make during estimates raised more questions than answers. The WEA is in an interesting position. When the Australian Wheat Board was privatised in 1999, the WEA was hived off as its regulating body, with responsibilities under the Wheat Marketing Act of 1989 to, amongst other things, ‘monitor, examine and report on the performance of AWB’. It has a role in monitoring compliance with the conditions of export consents issued, including pricing performance, supply chain and the operating environment. I do not accept the argument that, because the Wheat Board was privatised in 1999, all government responsibility ends there. The AWB holds a unique position, entrusted in large part with the welfare of nearly all Australian wheat growers as a consequence of its collective nature. This is why it has a regulatory body solely devoted to its activities.
Somehow, a quarter of a billion US dollars flew under this supposed regulatory radar, not into the pockets of AWB or Australian wheat growers but into the bank vaults of Saddam Hussein, who was being accused at the time by our government of being on the verge of blowing up the world. During estimates hearings, Senator Heffernan, the chair of the committee, assured me that we would leave no stone unturned to get to the bottom of this scandal. In moving this motion, I direct the question to the coalition and the members opposite: why have we only half an inquiry? What role did government officers and regulators play? Why weren’t gigantic warning signals rung when it is quite obvious that DFAT officials were in Iraq at the time that these contracts were being negotiated? This motion provides the Senate and the people of Australia with an opportunity to hear the other half of the story. This motion, as amended, does not cover the ground of the inquiry about to commence under the leadership of Mr Cole; it looks at the other side of the issue that the government refused to examine in this inquiry. I commend this motion to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,30,2,speech
"McGauran, Sen Julian",NATS,2005-12-07,"—The government reject the Greens’ motion before the chamber relating to matters of the oil for food program, specifically the conduct of AWB management employees and the conduct of the Commonwealth regulators, in particular the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. We reject it out of hand. Anyone who has been listening to the presentation by the Greens senator will know that she has already made her conclusions. She ran every slur and assertion through the Senate. She has already written the report without any knowledge. I do not think she knows much about this other than what she has read in the newspaper or listened to the opposition saying. You ran that slur and allegation against Mr Truss in your dissertation, which is absolutely incorrect. Did you bother to hear the retort to that slur by Mr O’Connor? You did not.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: I did not run any slur against Mr Truss; I said he was there. I did not run a slur.
 (Senator Watson)—There is no point of order. Senator McGauran, please address your remarks through the chair.
—On that matter, Mr O’Connor suggested, as reported in today’s Australian, that Mr Truss had been provided with regular confidential reports on kickbacks on offer. Within that is the suggestion that he kept it secret, that he knew and that there was a giant cover up. There was nothing of the sort. Mr O’Connor’s comments were deliberately put down to mislead. The truth of the matter is quite different, as the current Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has said publicly. The article says:
Minister Peter McGauran said Mr O’Connor’s comments were misleading. “The incentives to which the WEA referred in its annual report are listed and they cover items such as joint ventures, export credit breaks and staff exchanges,” he said. “The incentives referred to do not relate to monetary payments to third parties in overseas markets. The WEA’s reports do not contain the sort of information alleged (by Mr O’Connor).”
That has been the modus operandi of this whole issue—that is, to throw out the allegation without any evidence because you are running a political line. That is one very good reason why this government will reject the motion before the Senate as you want to shunt it off to a references committee where the majority is held by the opposition. If you do not think it is a stunt, just look at the reporting date. The report is to come down one day before the government’s independent inquiry by Commissioner Cole. That is to run interference with, distraction and even contradiction of the independent inquiry.
The government does not in any way seek to diminish an investigation into this matter. We believe that any material suggestion of improper behaviour by Australian companies overseas—particularly with respect to what we are talking about here—is a matter of public importance, is an offence under law and is worthy of an inquiry. In the matter before us, we are dealing with the good reputation of AWB directors, Australia’s good trade reputation and the good reputation of officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. For that reason, when this matter came to light, the government quickly announced an independent inquiry with royal commission powers and immunities.
The commission was established in direct response to the United Nations’ request following the Volcker inquiry. The United Nations urged sovereign states to take action where inappropriate behaviour may have been carried out by companies falling within their sovereign jurisdiction. That is exactly what the government is doing. It is seeking to get to the truth of the matter through an independent, unbiased inquiry. The commission will be headed by New South Wales Supreme Court Judge of Appeal, the Hon. Terence Cole—who is known to all as the former royal commissioner inquiring into the building and construction industry. He is a well-respected man and a well-studied man in matters of royal commissions and getting to the bottom and to the truth of matters. We are concerned that the inquiry be conducted independently, in a timely fashion and in a comprehensive manner and should report by 31 March. The key fact here is that it is an independent inquiry—at arms-length from the government and certainly at arms-length from those opposite who seek to run their own inquiry and who have made their judgments prior to even having the reference before the committee.
It is worthy of note—and the Greens senator did say this—that the AWB welcome the federal government’s inquiry. Senator Siewert, they welcome it and, in doing so, are saying that they have nothing to hide. I will refer to their public comment. In relation to the government establishing this Cole inquiry, the AWB said on 1 November:
AWB will cooperate fully with the independent inquiry into the United Nations Oil-for-Food program announced by the Australian Federal Government yesterday.
It should be noted that the Volcker report did not find that AWB was knowingly involved in any scheme or arrangement to channel funds to the former Iraqi regime.
It is of concern to AWB that allegations are being made against the company and anticipates the inquiry to address them.
I suspect Senator O’Brien will also be speaking on this matter—
—Yes, I am. I am looking forward to it.
—No doubt he will also raise the suggestion that the terms of reference of this independent inquiry are too narrow. We reject that claim. It ought to be noted that the Volcker inquiry found absolutely no criticism of the behaviour of the Australian government. That is the reason that the terms of reference are entirely appropriate. Your claim is exactly the reason that we are rejecting this motion—because you are on a fishing expedition. This motion is political. It is a far more serious matter than that. We have at hand the good reputation of AWB, the good reputation of DFAT and the good reputation of Australia as a trading nation. Do you think we would leave that in the hands of the references committee, a highly political and charged committee which—as shown already in the debate here today—has already made up its mind?
We are not going to indulge the opposition and the Greens in a fishing expedition, because DFAT have nothing to answer for—they are completely cleared. Nevertheless, it is feasible that the commissioner would seek some information from DFAT in relation to the process, and it would be entirely appropriate for them to cooperate with that. The government fully back the integrity of the officers of DFAT with regard to this matter and reject the innuendos being perpetrated, particularly by the shadow minister for foreign affairs, who has been scurrilous in this matter in basically accusing—certainly by innuendo and suggestion—that DFAT were aware of the illegal channelling of funds to the Iraqi government.
It is worth setting out the process and the role of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in this matter so that it is properly understood what the exact role of DFAT was. I will refer to the Hansard where the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry let the lower house know of this matter. He said:
Commercial suppliers would negotiate and agree on a contract with Iraqi counterparts. DFAT was not a party to the contract. The contract would be forwarded to DFAT for submission. DFAT would examine the contract paperwork. Once satisfied that this had been properly completed and that the transaction did not appear to infringe the United Nations sanctions regime, the documentation was submitted via the Australian United Nations mission to the United Nations Office of the Iraq Program and the 661 sanctions committee in New York. United Nations customs experts in the UN Office of the Iraq Program had responsibility for evaluating the price and value of contracts. Following contract approval by the United Nations, DFAT would issue an export permit authorising the export to Iraq.
As I said earlier, the government fully cooperated with the Volcker inquiry, which found no evidence of complicity on the part of the government. In fact, there was not a skerrick of evidence or suggestion that would bring the government under inquiry—except from those opposite who seek to sling mud and to descend this matter into a political issue. We happen to think that it is far more serious than that. We have set up an independent inquiry—not a political one.
I would add that what Senator Siewert neglects to note—something which Senator O’Brien will also neglect to note—is that this matter has already faced the parliament and a litany of questions. This issue was raised at recent estimates committees, where extensive questions were asked of the department and the Wheat Export Authority by none other than the grand old inquisitor himself, Senator Faulkner. Senator Faulkner directed questions to Ms Gillian Bird, the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for possibly hours. After all that questioning, I think I would concur with the chair of the committee at that time, Senator Sandy Macdonald when he summed up the hours of questioning and said to Senator Faulkner:
You have made assertions, as is your wont. You are entitled to do that, as long as everyone understands what you do. I think the questions have been adequately addressed. You can seek further explanation, but you have had it.
You have had good explanation; that is the point he was making. There is a hell of a lot of difference between an assertion and evidence but, as Senator Macdonald said,
If you think that assertions are a way of making your case, proceed, but the questions have been fully explained.
So it is quite clear that on this matter there is no cover-up. There is no lid on this. It has been before the estimates committee and under heavy scrutiny. Of course, in the other committee to which Senator O’Brien and Senator Siewert belonged, the estimates committee on agriculture and transport, Senator Siewert also took to the Wheat Export Authority and asked her own litany of questions. So she cannot say she has been denied access on this matter at all.
But it is a little more serious when reputations are on the line, let alone the Australian market. Of course, through all your public posturing, the usual suspects, who are always trying to grab the Australian markets, in particular those in the Middle East, have taken full advantage of this, and you have succoured them.
The Australian government and the Australian Wheat Export Authority do not wish to jeopardise the integrity of the market in any way, and will not. It is worthy to quote the Volcker findings with regard to AWB Limited. And I will quote directly from those findings to put this matter in perspective and to try, in a probably hopeless attempt, to convince you to withdraw this motion—or to try at least to explain why this government will have no bar of this political exercise. I quote the Volcker inquiry in regard to AWB:
The evidence does not suffice to conclude that AWB had actual knowledge of Alia’s partial ownership by the government of Iraq, that it had actual knowledge of the fact that Alia did not actually perform trucking services for the AWB’s wheat or that it had actual knowledge of the fact that Alia remitted to the payments it received from AWB to the government of Iraq.
It went on to say:
On the other hand, it is discussed in detail below that numerous documentary and circumstantial warning signs placed at least some employees of AWB on notice that payments to Alia may have been illicitly funding the Iraqi regime.
And that is the full context of this. There is nothing to hide. And that is exactly why AWB, as I read out, welcomes this inquiry. I read the full brief. I bet Senator O’Brien thought I was going to stop a few sentences before that.
That is the full context of what Commissioner Cole will inquire into. There is no cover-up. The point is: it is an independent inquiry. We want this matter cleared up just as much as AWB does. But it is very convenient of the speakers on the other side to totally ignore the real culprits in all this.
In conclusion, let us not forget who the real culprits in this oil for food scandal are—the culprits are certainly not AWB Limited nor this government. The real culprits are the United Nations themselves, because what the Volcker inquiry really found was that there was corruption, nearly all the way to the top. Let us not put that aside—that there was a scandal involved in all this, and the corruption was very heavily weighted within the higher ranks of the United Nations itself.
The government is firm in its resolve to act upon the United Nations’ request to make this a transparent and independent inquiry, and to act upon its recommendations. This is in the interests of trade relations, in the best interests of AWB Limited and in the best interests of all involved in the oil for food program. Therefore, we reject this motion.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,30,2,speech
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2005-12-07,"—It is interesting to hear the comments from Senator McGauran—interesting that the government have chosen him to defend them on this motion. I would have perhaps expected Senator Heffernan, who knows a lot about the Wheat Export Authority and AWB to have been defending, on the basis of his in-depth knowledge, but the government have chosen not to ask him to do that.
We will be supporting this motion. We will be supporting this motion although we should not have to. We have to support this motion because the government has not done the right thing. When it devised the terms of reference for its inquiry into this matter, to be headed by Mr Cole, an inquiry by the Foreign Affairs Defence and Trade References Committee would not have been needed if those terms of reference had ensured that the actions of the Howard government and its agencies would be put under the microscope of that Cole inquiry. If the government had done that, we would not have needed an inquiry by a committee of this Senate, but it has not done that. It has given a very narrow focus through the terms of reference for the Cole inquiry which is devised to protect the government. So we can have no confidence that the Howard government’s involvement in the oil for food scandal will ever see the light of day through any actions of this government.
And who could be surprised that the government now oppose a motion that might have the effect of exposing their complicity or their knowledge in the matter. But, of course, we have heard from Senator McGauran today and he has been true to the script from this government. They are blame shifters: ‘Someone else is at fault. It was not us, it was not the AWB, it was not the Wheat Export Authority, it was the United Nations.’ The United Nations apparently were responsible for the deal for Alia to rake off $56 a tonne for trucking services they never delivered. How ridiculous.
Senator McGauran knows that is not true. He knows that it has no basis in fact, but he is prepared to put it forward as a justification for this shabby performance of the government, which is again hiding from scrutiny, using its numbers to block the scrutiny of the Senate—which the Labor Party warned the Australian people this government would do when it got the numbers in this place. This government is going to use its numbers to prevent its incompetence and its complicity in corruption from being exposed.
We know for a fact that in January 2000 the United Nations called the Australian government in New York and said: ‘We’ve got some concerns about what the Australian Wheat Board is up to in Iraq. We’ve got some concerns about the alleged use of Jordanian bank accounts.’ We now know the basis of those concerns. We know that those concerns were cabled back to Canberra from the Australian government’s mission in New York and that those concerns were distributed to various ministers’ offices at the time. Conveniently, none of that seemed to find its way into the defence by Senator McGauran. The facts, that have been well known, were not dealt with at all, because there is no answer to that. It clearly demonstrates that the government had knowledge that there were concerns at United Nations level about Jordanian bank account involvement. Where is the company that Senator McGauran referred to based? Jordan, I think.
In 2003 Colin Powell was told by US Wheat Associates that Australian wheat contracts under the UN oil for food program were inflated by millions of dollars per shipload and that the excess may have gone into accounts of Saddam Hussein’s family. That was on the public record in 2003. US Wheat Associates were trying to convince the US government to take action. I happened to be the shadow minister for agriculture at that time, and I called for the government to investigate. Mr Vaile declined to investigate. He used a shabby device to try to pretend that we had not actually called for them to investigate. He reported this matter to the House of Representatives on 9 November, but the reality was that I had called on him to investigate more than two years before that, and he had declined to investigate. Let us examine why that might be.
Before I do that, let me also touch on something that has recently been revealed by the Prime Minister. He said, ‘Of course, we had Australian government officials travelling into Iraq with the Australian Wheat Board while commercial negotiations were taking place under the oil for food program.’ So we had officials of the Australian government as part of the negotiation. They knew what was going on.
—You assert.
—The Prime Minister said that. What did successive ministers for agriculture, fisheries and forestry know, and what should they have known? As he was the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry for most of the period we are concerned with, I want to look at what the present Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Mr Truss, knew about AWB’s role in the oil for food scandal and what action, if any, he took. The Wheat Export Authority is a statutory authority, and it reports to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. It liaises with the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. As far as I am aware, that is part of the government.
It was established in 1998-99, at the time the government privatised the Australian Wheat Board and handed over Australia’s single-desk marketing arrangements for wheat to AWB Ltd and to its international arm, AWB International. The functions and powers of the Wheat Export Authority are set out in the Wheat Marketing Act. In relation to those functions, the act has this to say:
(1) The Authority has the following functions:
(a) to control the export of wheat from Australia;
(b) to monitor nominated company B’s—
that is, AWB’s—
performance in relation to the export of wheat and examine and report on the benefits to growers that result from that performance.
In relation to the Wheat Export Authority’s powers, the act says:
The Authority has power to do all things that are necessary or convenient to be done in connection with the performance of its functions.
It goes on to say:
The Authority may direct nominated company B—
That is AWB again—
or a related body corporate of nominated company B, to give to the Authority: (a) information; or (b) documents, or copies of documents, in the custody or under the control of nominated company B or the related body corporate;
The act also requires the Wheat Export Authority to prepare three reports every year on AWB’s performance. One is a report to Australian wheat growers, the second is an annual report, and, importantly, the third is a confidential report to the agriculture minister—at all material times Mr Warren Truss.
It is abundantly clear that this parliament has given the Wheat Export Authority the role of overseeing the activities of AWB Ltd and all the power it needs to carry out that function. We also know that at least once a year the Wheat Export Authority gives a confidential account of its activities to the agriculture minister and much less detailed reports to this parliament and to wheat growers. It is the authority’s 1999-2000 annual report that gives us some indication of the sorts of activities the Wheat Export Authority is interested in. The 1999-2000 annual report of the Wheat Export Authority tells us that it planned to employ a consultant in October 2000. The report also sets out the proposed duties of that consultant, and they include an examination of ‘incentives paid by AWB International compared with other competitors.’
During the recent estimates hearings that Senator McGauran spoke about, I asked a number of questions about the work of this consultant. I have to say that representatives of the Wheat Export Authority were not particularly forthcoming in relation to this matter and some of my questions were taken on notice. I look forward to getting answers to those questions. Nevertheless, the CEO of the Wheat Export Authority was able to confirm that the work undertaken by the consultant referred to in the 1999-2000 annual report is ongoing and that the results of his investigations have been included in the annual confidential report to the agriculture minister, Mr Warren Truss.
The question has to be asked: how much did the agriculture minister and the Wheat Export Authority know about the allegations made in the Age and in the Sydney Morning Herald yesterday of a culture within the AWB of providing kickbacks to authorities in a number of AWB overseas markets? The newspapers quoted former staff members of AWB as saying that substantial kickbacks went to officials in Pakistan, Indonesia and Yemen. It also beggars belief that an authority with the powers and resources of the Wheat Export Authority, with the clear role of overseeing AWB’s performance, did not know about those kickbacks and did not report them to the minister, especially since we know that the authority already had a particular interest in the ‘incentives’, as it described them, that AWB had offered to some of its customers.
It is true that, at the same estimates hearing, the chairman of the Wheat Export Authority, Mr Besley, told the committee that the authority had no particular knowledge of the payments AWB funnelled to Saddam Hussein under the oil for food program. According to Mr Besley, even the 400 per cent increase over two years in the cost of transporting wheat in Iraq did not ring alarm bells within the Wheat Export Authority. That is fabulous, isn’t it? Yet, in other evidence to the committee, Mr Taylor, CEO of the Wheat Export Authority, confirmed that contracts for the supply and delivery of wheat to Iraq were checked and crosschecked, and he went on to make the following rather curious statement:
From the material that WEA had before it, and from the assessments it had done, there had been no apparent impact on the pool of any additional services that may have been bundled with sales of wheat.
What did we just hear—a quarter of a billion dollars? A quarter of a billion dollars had ‘no apparent impact’. It appears from this that the authority was at least aware that there were so-called additional services provided for in the contract and that these additional services had been examined to determine if they had had an impact on the pool.
Mr Taylor also said that the authority compares all AWB contracts for the supply of wheat to its international customers and, in order to make the comparisons meaningful and consistent, it does so on an FOB basis. Where contracts are not made on an FOB basis, then the authority examines them in detail so that they can be converted to FOB for comparison purposes. The oil for food contracts were not FOB; they included ‘additional services’. On the basis of the evidence provided then, it would have been the Wheat Export Authority’s practice to examine them in detail in order to convert them to FOB for comparison purposes.
At the very least we can confidently say that successive agriculture ministers and the Wheat Export Authority ought to have known what was going on in relation to AWB’s dealings in Iraq under the oil for food program. The Wheat Export Authority has a statutory duty to oversee the operations of AWB Ltd. It has all the power it needs to complete that task. It was interested in the so-called incentives AWB pays to attract and retain customers. It had access to all the relevant contracts. It makes an annual confidential report to the agriculture minister. So it is clear that the WEA knew or at least ought to have known what was going on in Iraq under the oil for food program. If the authority did know and did not tell the minister, then it has failed in its duty to protect the interests of wheat growers and the Australian public. If it really did not know, that is almost as bad, given its powers and what it said it pursued and inquired into.
As I said earlier, the Howard government was warned by the United Nations back in the year 2000 of concerns raised by the Canadian Wheat Board about the operation of the oil for food program and in May 2002 of similar concerns by the US General Accounting Office. And it has been clear, since at least the 2003 invasion of Iraq, that there have been problems for Australia in the Iraqi wheat market. For example, we have been losing market share to the United States and, even before the Volcker report, US wheat interests had been making a variety of allegations about the way AWB Ltd had been doing business in Iraq.
I do not have to make any comment on the validity of these allegations, but their very existence ought to have alerted the Wheat Export Authority to problems in the Iraqi market and, as a result, it would have been reasonable to expect the authority to pay particular attention to AWB’s performance in that market. We do have some evidence that the Wheat Export Authority did just that. In its 2004 growers report, the Wheat Export Authority included a section on difficulties being experienced by AWB in the Iraq wheat market. The section on Iraq was the only section dealing with an individual country. It does not refer to the oil for food program, but its very existence indicates that the Wheat Export Authority had been keeping a watchful eye on AWB’s performance in Iraq. Given that, there remain many unanswered questions about exactly what the Wheat Export Authority did know about the AWB involvement in the oil for food scandal and the $300 million that found its way into Saddam Hussein’s coffers.
There are also unanswered questions about what the Wheat Export Authority told the agriculture minister about that involvement. But, of course, this government has drawn up the terms of reference for the Cole inquiry so the Cole inquiry cannot inquire into what the minister knew. With all of those confidential reports protected by secrecy, the minister hides behind the terms of reference this government has drawn up for itself and then says, ‘But it’s not appropriate for us to have this inquiry because we’re having a thoroughgoing inquiry’—which just happens to protect the government from the scrutiny that it so richly deserves, and that the Australian public needs, so that we can get to the truth of this matter. That is, what did the minister know and when did the minister know it? In 2000, when there were the first warning signs, what did the government do? What decisions did the government take? Why did the government not take action? Those questions will not be answered by the Cole inquiry because the Cole inquiry’s terms of reference were drawn up to shield the government from just such scrutiny. And then the government has the temerity to pretend that the Cole inquiry is a justification for this inquiry not going ahead.
We know the government has the numbers and that it will block this inquiry. We know the government will prevent the Senate from conducting the scrutiny that it ought to and that it has a responsibility to the Australian people to conduct, but the government will prevent it from doing that because this government is so arrogant in the way that it goes about its business in this place. It is making sure that the scrutiny that the parliament could apply to the executive government will not be applied. It is displaying an arrogance which I think will convey to the Australian people the fact that they made a decision that they ultimately will regret, and this government will pay for it at the next election.
In relation to Senator Siewert’s motion, I am not certain but I am given to understand that that may actually have been lodged before the government announced its terms of reference with its reporting date. So the coincidence that the reporting date for this inquiry predates the Cole inquiry reporting date by a day would be something that the government could have concocted but that Senator Siewert could not have known about and therefore could not have concocted. If that is the case, then frankly Senator McGauran owes an apology to Senator Siewert for misrepresenting the position of her motion before the Senate. Perhaps he will be man enough to give us that apology at the conclusion of this debate; perhaps he will not. Be that as it may, we will stand behind this motion because the government has not had the gumption to stand up to a proper inquiry. It has given the inquirer the power to compel and protect witnesses but it will not give it the power to ask the government the questions that need to be asked so that we know how complicit this government has been in the improprieties around AWB Ltd and the oil for food program.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,30,2,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2005-12-07,"—I rise briefly on behalf of the Australian Democrats in my capacity as their foreign affairs spokesperson and, indeed, as a member of the Senate committee to which this reference will go if it is successful. I indicate our support for this motion. I do not intend to rehash the arguments in favour of the reference because I think Senator O’Brien and Senator Siewert have done a comprehensive job of explaining why this inquiry is necessary. I also do not wish to pre-empt in any way the outcome of this proposed inquiry. Suffice to say that the Democrats believe that there are a number of questions that still need to be answered in relation to this particular issue. Clearly one of them is to do with the role and responsibility of the government. That is what Senator Siewert’s motion intends the committee to examine. In relation to the time frames, the Australian Democrats’ understanding is that Senator Siewert put forward her time frame for this investigation and report before the government put forward its time frame. I am informed that we are correct, so I think that those who have made adverse comments in relation to the timing or the motivation of this motion should perhaps retract their statements because they are an unfair reflection.
I indicate that I, on behalf of the Democrats, had some concerns about the initial wording of this motion, in particular the original part (a), which talked about the conduct of AWB management and employees throughout this period. As senators would know, this motion has been amended to take into account the fact that there is an inquiry—the Cole inquiry has been proposed and will be under way. This motion now deals specifically with an area that is within our purview. It is within our responsibility—that is, the conduct of Commonwealth regulators, including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Wheat Export Authority and any other relevant agencies—so it is thoroughly appropriate for the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee to examine these particular issues.
If the government and honourable senators who are members of the government in this place are so sure that there is no case to be answered and there is nothing to hide—and I am not pre-empting this in any way—then they should say that they are quite comfortable putting the department and relevant agencies up for examination. They should not be scared of this inquiry; in fact, they should welcome it. They should welcome it in the sense that it gives the government an opportunity to show their hand, to make clear what dealings they had, how those dealings were conducted and what knowledge, if any, existed.
—We welcome the royal commission.
—I do not want to respond to that interjection, but, Madam Acting Deputy President Kirk, although you have heard today arguments as to why the Cole commission is an appropriate forum for some of the issues, I think that in fact, as of today’s revelations, it is exposed as having terms of reference that are not far ranging enough. I am conscious of the Prime Minister’s argument that he believes that the commission has enough teeth, but there are some of us in this place who believe there should be broader reflection, broader investigation, specifically when it comes to the role and responsibilities of government. That is what this motion seeks to do.
It is an important motion. These are not insubstantial issues. Let’s face it: this is a huge international scandal. The Volcker report has identified AWB as violators in this program. There are issues associated with that that we should have clarified for a whole range of good governance, accountability and transparency reasons. That is what we seek to achieve here. I think also it is a reflection on government at the moment that people are actively and loudly questioning the role of departmental officers and officials. An article in the Independent Weekly from 27 November by Lee Eckermann, the national affairs writer for that newspaper, says:
AWB management, naturally enough, has claimed that the organisation was an unwitting dupe to the deception set up by others, that it was not aware of what was going on, and that the UN was to blame for AWB’s involvement in the scandal.
It goes on to say:
We are asked to believe that no one in the federal Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which sanctioned the AWB payments to the Jordanian transport company set up as the front for the kickbacks, knew anything of the affair. Nor did anyone at AWB get a sniff of anything untoward.
That is quite a reflection and raises quite a good question. It probably reflects a good deal of scepticism and concern in this chamber, let alone in the community and obviously in the fourth estate. Let’s face it—these implications and assertions need to be examined. I would have thought that good governance would dictate that we had an inquiry of this kind.
I will not go further into some of these issues, although I might say that there are a number of related issues, perhaps not germane or specific to this particular proposed reference. But the whole issue of postwar reconstruction contracts is something that is going to be under examination, not just in this country but more broadly. People have argued that this is potentially the tip of the iceberg. I am very conscious of the anticorruption watchdog Transparency International, who have indicated that, unless some steps are taken to have stricter and tighter rules for awarding those kinds of contracts, this scandal and others will just be the start. Again, that is not specific to this particular inquiry.
On the matter of process, I heard Senator O’Brien’s comments that the government had the numbers and obviously I heard Senator Julian McGauran’s contribution, which indicated the government’s ‘firm resolve’, I think it was, to oppose this motion.
—It was our firm resolve to get to the bottom of the matter.
—I am happy to take that interjection. ‘Get to the bottom of the matter’—I think that is what we are all hoping to achieve here; we just seem to have different ways of going about it. I acknowledge that. The fact that the government is not supportive of this motion is a bit of a red flag. People in the community who are observing and listening to the Senate, and members of the media, wherever they may be, should be very conscious of what is happening in the chamber today and in the last couple of weeks—the flagrant abuse and use of power and numbers in this place; the guillotines and the gagging; the way that we roll through legislation no matter how comprehensive, serious or significant—
—Which the Democrats have supported before.
—I will accept that interjection because I want to clarify a point. People in this place on all sides, including the Labor Party and the Democrats, have voted for the guillotine. I think I have voted for one in my life—on the legislation to do with research involving human embryos. There was a guillotine on that. I am not suggesting that in itself a guillotine is wrong. I am not suggesting that, when we have had days, potentially weeks, of comprehensive and satisfactory argument, or when we have debated individual amendments, or at least put them individually, as opposed to the sausage factory approach that we have seen in the last week, there are not occasions in which a guillotine is appropriate.
But I think we should make it very clear for the record that there have been very few occasions, if any, in this place where not only has a guillotine operated but it has operated so soon into the debate on a piece of legislation, without consultation, negotiation or information—particularly involving the opposition—in a way that has not only cut off the speakers list but has actually cut off debate on all or most of the amendments. It is also very rare for a guillotine to take place in this place without the support of another party. I am sure the Labor Party would be the first to admit that in most cases when we have seen the guillotine in the past they have joined with the coalition. This is what I find so interesting—the way the government conveniently ignore their history when they were in opposition, because they worked with the ALP in relation to the guillotine when the ALP were in government.
I do not want to be waylaid on this point, because I think honourable senators, the public and the media are quite conscious of what is happening in this place now. I think people have had the wake-up call. We need a check on executive power. They are not happy about what is going on. I think everyone acknowledges that a mandate to form government with a majority in the Senate is one thing but to completely erode the house of review capabilities or responsibilities of a chamber is another.
The issue I want to draw attention to, which relates to this motion and the likely outcome of this vote, is the issue of committee references. I know on this side of the chamber non-government senators are awfully conscious of the number of committee references that seem to be getting opposed or knocked off. I can see Senator Marshall champing at the bit, ready to put forward what I and the Australian Democrats think is a first-class motion to do with an inquiry involving the CSIRO. It does not look like that is going to get up. I think Senator McLucas has a committee reference as well, and there are others that have been knocked off in recent days or weeks. On today’s red we will see a number of proposed references completely knocked off.
That begs the question as to what role this government now envisages for the committee system. Certainly we have seen the role it envisages for the legislation committees—that is, to deal abruptly, inadequately and inconveniently with legislation that comes to this place; get it through; have a committee that preferably does not travel too far or take too many submissions over too long a period of time; and then see what it can do to inconvenience senators who might want to go to more than one committee. I look at you, Madam Acting Deputy President Kirk, and I refer that to Senator Siewert, who I know was feeling a bit angry about this issue today when accused of not attending the radioactive waste committee—never mind the fact that there were a few other committees on at the same time. Minor party senators certainly know better than most that when there are only, say, four of you, it is very difficult to get to every committee reference.
I think we have all seen the way this government wants its legislation committees to work, but how does it want its references committees to work—or does it want them to work? I do not think it wants them to work anymore. I think the government wants to close them down. I do not know about many of the committees that people are on in this place, but it seems to me that the references are drying up and any proposals that are coming from opposition are getting knocked off. The flimsy arguments being used to knock them off are a bit like the one we have just heard in relation to Senator Siewert’s reference to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee on the Australian Wheat Board issue.
I think it is a red flag, people. Perhaps it is something we should be keeping some interesting statistics on and checking on because I think you have seen it now. We have all seen it—the new role of the Senate: we will not do references inquiries; we will do rushed legislation inquiries. We will not do references inquiries, where, of course, the government does not have the numbers or the chair. So maybe we should be envisaging a bit of a change in the composition of those inquiries or those committees. Maybe we should be envisaging that most of the references, if any, are going to come from government. I am wondering what, if anything, they will involve.
We support this motion because it is a good motion. We are not pre-empting the outcome. We think that there are reasonable and legitimate grounds for an inquiry of this sort. The issues that we had some difficulties with in this motion have since been amended, and that is where this motion would have pre-empted the outcome of the Cole commission. It is something that we think is appropriate and we support, albeit arguing now for perhaps expanded terms of reference, particularly in light of today’s revelations. But this is a red flag: no more references inquiries, no more committee inquiries and no investigation into matters that the Senate has a responsibility to investigate. So this is the new curtailed, truncated Australian Senate. This is the new house of review provided we do not do any review. I commend the motion moved by Senator Siewert. She will have our vote, but I cannot say that it is looking too positive for the outcome.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,30,2,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2005-12-07,"—I wish to make a few comments to wrap up. Senator O’Brien and Senator Stott Despoja were right: I moved this motion on 8 November, which was before the government called its inquiry on 10 November. I left it on the Notice Paper because the government’s inquiry is not satisfactory. It does not fully investigate all the things that need to be investigated in this circumstance.
A very senior ex-government official, who probably would not want me to name him, once said to me—and he used vernacular which is not appropriate in this chamber, so I will try and substitute a word—‘If it ever comes to deciding whether something was a stuff-up or a conspiracy, go for the stuff-up.’ Even if I went for the stuff-up in this process, should the government not be deeply concerned that the regulation and the regulatory process have failed? They failed—$US221.7 million flew to the Iraqi regime. That is a failure in regulation. Do the government not want to get this right? Do they not want to see where the process failed? The Cole commission will not do that. It will not look at the government regulators involved. So why do they not want to get it right? Even that question has to be asked: why do they not want to see where the problems are and fix them?
The point was also made that we got a chance in estimates. We did not. In estimates Senator Milne, Senator O’Brien and I were asked to stop questioning because we were told this would come out in any government inquiry. So we only got to ask a limited number of questions to the Wheat Export Authority.
—It went on for hours.
—I am sorry: I was there. I know what I was told and I was told that this would come out in the inquiry, and it did not. We stopped asking questions. We respected the fact that we were asked to stop asking questions because it would come out in the inquiry. It will not, and that is why we need this Senate inquiry to fully investigate this side of what happened. As I said, let us look at what stuff-ups occurred. Let us try and fix it because we never want this to happen again—I am not even going to speculate on the circumstances in which this could happen again. We want to know why regulation failed. If the WEA processes are not adequate to pick this sort of thing up, it needs to be fixed. If DFAT’s processes are not adequate to fix this up, it needs to be fixed. That is why we need this inquiry, and nothing that I heard from the other side of the chamber convinced me at all that this inquiry is not needed.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-12-07,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
This document is the first of the documents that have been produced by the Commonwealth Ombudsman as assessments of detention arrangements for people who have been in detention for two years or more. As senators may recall, agreement was reached in around June about a way of trying to once and for all to examine independently the mess of people who had been stuck in immigration detention for more than two years, some of whom had been in detention for much longer than that. The Prime Minister announced that the Commonwealth Ombudsman would be tasked with conducting reports into each individual case.
This particular report, report No. 1, the first one under the new section 486O of the Migration Act, concerns a 36-year-old man from Iran who arrived in Australia in June 2000. He was in immigration detention at Curtin, Port Hedland and Baxter through to the middle of this year. He was admitted to the Glenside psychiatric hospital in Adelaide in July of this year and was released on a removal pending visa in August 2005. As the minister notes in a separately tabled document, that person was granted a removal pending visa and he departed voluntarily from Australia on 23 August 2005. I guess in that sense that case was resolved before the Ombudsman’s report was tabled. I would note a couple of other extra things, though. The Ombudsman’s report is dated 12 October 2005 and yet it was only made public and tabled yesterday, 6 December. That certainly gives me some pause for thought as to why it would take that long for it to be made public.
The second document is likewise dated 12 October. The point does need to be made that, whilst the person in this case has now voluntarily left Australia—it does not say where to, and I guess that is not particularly an issue—once all the legal processes had been gathered, this person, for the nonoffence of seeking protection, was basically jailed for five years. Towards the end of that period he was sufficiently unhealthy, almost certainly as a direct consequence, that he had to be admitted to the Glenside psychiatric hospital in Adelaide. The Ombudsman’s report details the hospitalisation requirements. He spent 32 days at Glenside and was also hospitalised in earlier periods. He suffered from severe major depression with some elements of post-traumatic stress disorder and was at risk of suicide if returned to detention. Other medical issues are detailed that I will not go through. This document does not have any identifying details, so there are no privacy issues.
I think the detail in the Ombudsman’s report clearly shows that the time in detention was a significant factor in the impact on the health of this person detailed as Mr X. I guess we did not need an Ombudsman’s report to tell us that, but, again, I think that each time these are tabled we should think why that sort of damage needs to be done to somebody purely because they are seeking protection. I believe that we need to do more to ensure that that sort of situation, a five-year imprisonment, does not occur in the future for people purely for seeking protection.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Commonwealth Ombudsman: Report 001/2005</title>,Documents,31,1,speech
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2005-12-07,"—I have recently been advised of a dispute involving a general aviation company called Polar Aviation Pty Ltd, which operates out of Port Hedland, and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, CASA, which I want to speak about today. The company has been involved in a long-running dispute with CASA, which has dragged on now for about 19 months, still with no end in sight.
Polar Aviation and its managing director, Mr Clark Butson, are a Pilbara success story. The company commenced operations in Port Hedland almost 25 years ago with just one aircraft. Today, it owns four single engine aircraft and four twin engine aircraft, which are available for charter, along with a training aeroplane. This is a company that is committed to the Pilbara, employing eight full-time people. Until its difficulties with CASA, Mr Butson had held the chief pilot and chief flying instructor positions since the inception of the company. I have to say that it would be hard to find someone with more experience and expertise. He has 18,000 hours of flying experience and 8,000 hours of instruction experience, and has held a grade 1 instructor rating for decades. Hundreds of people have learnt to fly at Polar’s flying school.
While I was on the Port Hedland town council, I was for several years the chair of the management committee of the Port Hedland International Airport and I can verify that Polar Aviation was a well-regarded general aviation company and that Mr Butson had an excellent professional reputation. Polar Aviation has a commendable safety record, clocking up in the order of 4,500 flying hours annually without any accidents whilst servicing the Pilbara and the north-west in general. Indeed, in all of the years that it has held an air operator’s certificate for its air work, charter work and flying school, there has been not a single accident and only two incidents, when just a pilot was on board.
CASA undertakes regular audits of organisations which hold air operator’s certificates, and, up until May 2004, I am advised by Polar Aviation, the outcomes of the audits were favourable. However, at the audit in May 2004, a wholly regrettable and unfortunate incident occurred, which Polar believes has coloured CASA’s attitude towards the company. According to information I have received from Polar, Mr Butson became involved in three very heated arguments with an auditor, and I am told that the audit team left the premises of Polar Aviation smarting.
Subsequent to this incident, CASA has issued Polar with eight aircraft survey reports and no less than 14 requests for corrective action and three audit observations. In responding to these demands, Polar has argued that CASA failed to take account of changes that had occurred and were continuing to occur within the company, such as the progress which had been made in converting the lessons for the general flying progress test to a web based format, the conversion of the company’s operations manual to a web format, revised procedures for the rostering of pilots and a commitment to an electronic format for internal administration.
Polar Aviation responded to the requests for corrective action by CASA and commented on the audit observations that were made. Then, on 16 July 2004, CASA issued the company with three separate show cause notices concerning the air operator’s certificate and revocation of the chief pilot and chief flying instructor positions. These corrective action requests represented a huge workload for a small company that was still trying to work its way through the previous requests for corrective action. By 7 September 2004, CASA had acquitted all but three of the RCAs, and by 2 December 2004 only one RCA remained unresolved—that pertaining to competency based training, even though Polar Aviation had developed a computer based manual for the purpose of providing CBT and is one of the five per cent of flying schools around the nation which are CBT compliant.
On 18 October 2004, there was a meeting of seven CASA personnel and two representatives from Polar. The meeting lasted 4½ hours and I am advised that Polar came away from the meeting with the distinct impression that matters would be resolved relatively quickly. Given this, as well as the substantial progress that had been made in responding to CASA’s demands, Polar Aviation was surprised when on 18 January 2005 it was advised by the regulator that its air operator’s certificate had been revoked, as had the chief pilot and chief flying instructor positions held by Mr Butson.
Polar commenced action in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal about this. Subsequently, CASA offered to issue an air operator’s certificate provided that a new chief pilot, approved by CASA, was appointed. In fact, a chief pilot acceptable to CASA was found but, in the last business hour of the day in which the air operator’s certificate was due to expire, CASA changed its mind and said it would only issue another air operator’s certificate if Polar discontinued its action in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and agreed to an enforceable voluntary undertaking, which the company refused to do.
On 2 February 2005, CASA announced that it would not renew Polar Aviation’s air operator’s certificate. However, on 11 February, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal decided to hear the company’s further complaints and restored the air operator’s certificate pending a complete hearing, which occurred in the first week of August 2005. I am advised that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal agreed that the claims that CASA made against Polar Aviation in regard to safety were not credible. I am further informed that the evidence of CASA’S WA area manager was not compelling and that when he was asked under cross-examination at the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to define the term ‘safety culture’, he was unable to do so. According to Polar Aviation, faced with the inept display by the WA area manager, CASA’s lawyers sought to arrange a compromise with the company. This was done and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ordered CASA to reinstate the authority of chief flying instructor to Mr Butson and directed CASA to issue an air operator’s certificate for Polar.
The Administrative Appeals Tribunal also directed CASA to employ its best endeavours to assist the company back to normal operations. Although CASA had told the Administrative Appeals Tribunal that it wanted the matter speedily resolved, it decided to appeal the AAT’s decision to the Federal Court. However, the court found in favour of Polar Aviation and awarded full costs against CASA.
Polar Aviation thought this brought the matter to an end, but on 2 September this year CASA decided to impose a number of unusual conditions on the company’s air operator’s certificate. Moreover, according to Polar, CASA continues to flout the orders of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal by refusing to allow the flying school to operate. Meanwhile, CASA’s actions against the company continue to take their toll, with legal costs in the order of $20,000 per month. To date, it has cost Polar Aviation in the order of $350,000 to challenge CASA’s decisions.
Mr Butson is convinced that CASA’s actions amount to a vendetta against him and his company, having its genesis in the heated argument that he had with the auditors in May 2004. Aviation sources have told me that it is customary for CASA to audit an air operator every three years. Yet, in a period of just 15 months, CASA conducted three audits on Polar Aviation. To me, Mr Butson’s claim that CASA has failed the test of an impartial regulator seems not unreasonable. It seems difficult not to conclude that the behaviour of CASA in this matter warrants further investigation.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Polar Aviation</title>,Adjournment,33,1,speech

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2005-12-07,"—The answer to the honourable senator’s question is as follows:
An announcement on the successful tenderer is anticipated early in 2006.
The time frame for the project is:
the construction period of approximately 26 months, inclusive of approximately four months of detailed design activities commencing in early to mid-2006;
the internal fit-out period is included within the construction period in (a), and the installation of the command, control, communications, computer and intelligence systems is anticipated to require four months after the construction period; and
occupation is anticipated by mid to late-2008 following the installation of the command, control, communications, computer and intelligence systems.
The original announced project cost was $200 million (2001-02, constant prices); and
the current estimated cost is $301 million (2003-04, constant prices), including (i) construction and (ii) infrastructure and internal fit-out of approximately $221 million; and (iii) procurement and installation of the command, control, communications, computer and intelligence systems of approximately $80 million.
No funding commitments have been made to local communities.
No funding estimates have been made for possible road improvements. The Project Office is waiting the completion of a Roads and Traffic Authority, New South Wales report into the section of the Kings Highway between Queanbeyan and Bungendore, which includes the four rural intersections at Weetalabah, Captains Flat Road, the Ridgeway and Regents Drive, and some other local roads in New South Wales. The report is anticipated to be available before the end of 2005.
The Project Office met with Australian Capital Territory officials on 5 May 2004, 23 November 2004 and 31 January 2005; and
Australian Capital Territory Government funding for road improvements has not been discussed as the assessment of the possible impact of the Headquarters traffic on the road systems is ongoing, and linked to the assessment currently being undertaken by the Roads and Traffic Authority, New South Wales, which is anticipated to be available before the end of 2005.
A road funding commitment has not been discussed with the New South Wales Government as the Roads and Traffic Authority, New South Wales assessment of the affected section of the Kings Highway and local roads has not been completed.
The current project cost estimate does not include funding for road improvements, transport or community assistance. Road improvements were not included, as the traffic assessment undertaken for the draft Environmental Impact Statement indicated that the Headquarters traffic could be accommodated within the current capacity of the road network. Funding for a transport service to the Headquarters site was not included as any service would be provided by a commercial provider at its risk. Funding for community assistance was not included as the vast majority of staff would occupy housing provided by the Defence Housing Authority in Canberra and Queanbeyan in already-established or newly-developed locations, or seek private housing solutions where the development approval would have included consideration of a provision for community assistance.
The new Headquarters staff structure is for an estimated 675 Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel and 75 Australian Public Service (APS) personnel to work at the new facility; and
An estimated 60 ADF and APS staff will undertake the shift component of watch keeping duties.
An estimated 650 ADF personnel would be required to relocate from the current Headquarters to the new Headquarters.
The estimated travel time by road from:
Canberra Airport to the Headquarters site is 20 minutes, and from Canberra Airport to Russell Hill is 10 minutes; and
from Russell Hill to the Headquarters site is 30 minutes.
Defence does not anticipate any significant relocation of ADF families to the Palerang Shire. The Defence Housing Authority is providing housing solutions for staff in Canberra and Queanbeyan and has no plans to purchase and/or construct housing in the shire. The small number of staff who might choose to reside in the shire would do so in already-established housing locations, in which the Palerang Council would have considered the funding of local services as part of the development approvals for those areas.
The Defence Housing Authority is providing housing solutions for staff in Canberra and Queanbeyan and has no plans to purchase and/or construct housing in Palerang Shire.
Any public transport service to the new Headquarters site would be provided by a commercial provider at its risk. The Project Office has held initial discussions with local bus companies which have expressed an interest in establishing a service, and has been approached by a developer who is assessing the economic viability of providing a railcar service using the existing railway infrastructure.
There has been no decision on the provision of allowances for the new site.
(a)   As part of the site selection activities, the University of Sydney Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope conducted a limited study, funded by Defence, where a transmitter was sited at the proposed site and measurements of the impact of increasing radio frequency interference upon observations were taken at the telescope. The University also conducted modelling on how signals dissipate with distance (path loss).
(b)   The study indicated that a transmitter of five milliwatts operating over one hour would impact significantly on the telescope’s observations. The assessment provided by the University of Sydney is that radio frequency interference generate by the headquarters would be about one tenth of the tested power level (about half of one milliwatt). Although the telescope is able to observe one half of one milliwatt of power output, advice from the University of Sydney is that this level of power should not impact significantly on the telescope’s observations.
(a)   The current landscaping activities are to:
(i) determine the types of local native plant species (fast-growing shrubs, and trees) that are suited to planting on the site by both tube stock and direct- seeding methods;
(ii) begin to establish tree screens as part of measures noted in the final Environmental Impact Statement to mitigate possible radio frequency interference on the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope and the visual impact of the site from some residents at Carwoola;
(iii) establish wildlife corridors linking ecological units of remnant vegetation; and
(iv) restore ecological values, particularly through the re-establishment of Yellow Box (Eucalyptus melliodora) habitat;
(b)   the types of plants include an understorey of Silver Wattle (Acacia dealbata), Ploughshare Wattle (Acacia gunnii) and Red-leaved Wattle (Acacia rubida); and an overstorey of Apple Box (Eucalyptus bridgesiana), Red Peppermint Stringy Bark (E. macrorhyncha), Brittle Gum (E. mannifera), Yellow Box (E. melliodora), Red Box (E. polyanthemos), Scribby Gum ((E. rossii), Candlebark (E. rubida) and Blakely’s Red Gum (E. Blakelyii);
(c)  the purpose of the tree screen is as noted in (a) above;
(d)   the contracted cost is $116,400 (less GST), which includes site preparation, temporary fencing to keep out stock, weed control, planting and maintenance; and
(e)   the cost of the landscaping is included in the overall project costs.
The current landscaping activities are associated with the establishment of a tree screen to mitigate possible radio frequency interference on the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope.     
Advice from the University of Sydney is that screen would begin to cause significant attenuation of radio frequency interference from the site after approximately two to three years when the wattles reach at least one metre in height; and
Other activities that have been undertaken include the replacement of the site boundary fence with one that meets Defence standards and the establishment of a surface and groundwater monitoring program. A small remote weather monitoring station is planned to be installed during October and November 2005.
(a)   No studies have been undertaken regarding the impact of aerial spraying by neighbouring properties.
The only aerial spraying activity advised to the Project Office, and noted in the final Environmental Impact Statement, is the aerial spreading of fertilisers (superphosphate). The activity is usually conducted from a small airstrip on the property immediately to the south of the Headquarters site that services both that property and the property immediately to the east of the Headquarters site. Advice to the Project Office is that these activities might be conducted annually, although this would depend on a number of factors, including the property owner’s paddock rotation plans, annual rainfall, stock numbers and the cost of fertiliser and aerial spreading. The landowners have indicated that they will advise the Headquarters when aerial spreading of fertilisers is planned.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Defence Headquarters Joint Operations Command</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,35,1,answer
