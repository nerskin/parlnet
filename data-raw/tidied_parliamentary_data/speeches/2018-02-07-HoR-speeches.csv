"Dutton, Peter, MP",LP,2018-02-07,"



Mr DUTTON
 (Dickson—Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Immigration and Border Protection) (09:32):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


The Identity-matching Services Bill 2018 implements the Intergovernmental Agreement on Identity Matching Services, which was agreed between the Prime Minister and the first ministers of all states and territories at the Special Meeting of the Council of Australian Governments on Counter-Terrorism of 5 October 2017.


Under this intergovernmental agreement, the Commonwealth and all states and territories agreed to preserve or introduce legislation to support the sharing of facial images and related identity information via a set of identity-matching services, for a range of national security, law enforcement, community safety and related purposes, while maintaining robust privacy safeguards.


The identity-matching services enabled by this bill will help to strengthen the integrity and security of Australia's identity infrastructure—the identity management systems of government agencies that issue the documents most commonly used by Australians to provide evidence of their identity, such as driver licences and passports.


These systems play an important role in preventing identity crime, which is one of the most common and costly crimes in our country.


By preventing identity crime, the identity-matching services enabled by this bill will help to protect the identities of everyday Australians from theft and misuse, and help those who have fallen victim to identity theft to more easily restore their compromised identities.


Identity theft is an issue that is of significant concern to many Australians—and with good reason. Around one in 20 Australians every year are the victims of identity crime, with an estimated annual cost of $2.2 billion.


In addition to financial losses, the consequences experienced by victims of identity crime can include mental health impacts, wrongful arrest, and significant emotional distress when attempting to restore a compromised identity.


Identity crime is also a key enabler of serious and organised crime, including terrorism.


Australians previously convicted of terrorism related offences are known to have used fake identities to purchase items such as ammunition, chemicals that can be used to manufacture explosives, and mobile phones to communicate anonymously to evade detection.


Identity crime is aided by the growing sophistication of criminal syndicates and the technology now able to support them in manufacturing fake identity documents. 


Organised criminal groups are now producing false driver licence and other documents in bulk, often using similar technology to that available to the government issuing agency itself. 


An operation by the joint Australian Federal Police and New South Wales Police Identity Security Strike Team found that the fraudulent identities seized from just one criminal syndicate were linked to: 


29 high profile criminals linked to historic or ongoing illicit drug investigations, 


more than $7 million in losses associated with fraud against individuals and financial institutions, and 


more than $50 million in funds that were laundered offshore and were likely to be proceeds of crime. 


These documents often have genuine biographic details, but a fraudulent photograph, and can therefore be difficult to detect. This is a particular problem for driver licences, which are the most commonly used photo identification documents in Australia and therefore are the most sought after by criminals.


For many years government agencies have been able to verify biographic information on driver licences and other identity documents such as passports by using the Document Verification Service (DVS).


However, name-based checking tools such as the DVS cannot detect documents that contain legitimate biographic details but with a substituted photo, nor can they identify an unknown person from a facial image.


The identity-matching services enabled by this bill will greatly assist our law enforcement and national security agencies by providing authorised agencies with the means to rapidly share and match facial images drawn from existing databases in order to identify unknown persons, and detect people using multiple fraudulent identities. 


This will help our agencies to more quickly identify persons involved in a range of serious criminal activities, importantly, to bring them to justice.


Beyond the national security and law enforcement benefits, these identity-matching services can make government and private sector services more secure, accessible and convenient to citizens. 


This supports the government's Digital Transformation Agenda and offers significant cost savings and greater identity assurance for private sector entities seeking to comply with anti-money-laundering and counterterrorism-financing regulations.


The identity-matching services will also help to mitigate the impact of the 'black economy' and make it more difficult to use fraudulent identities to avoid legitimate taxation and other financial obligations. 


The identity-matching services will also benefit victims of natural disasters who are seeking access to support, including those who have lost their identity documents. 


By checking the person's photo against a passport or driver licence image, government agencies will be able to assist individuals to verify their identity in order to receive disaster relief payments, and assist them in replacing their lost or damaged government documents.


The identity-matching services will also make it harder for persons to obtain driver licences in false identities in an attempt to avoid traffic fines, demerit points or licence cancellations. This will improve road safety by increasing the detection and prosecution of these offences and deterring dangerous driving activity.


The bill will help deliver these benefits by providing explicit legal authority for the Department of Home Affairs to collect, use and disclose identification information in order to operate the technical systems that will facilitate the identity-matching services envisaged by the intergovernmental agreement. 


The bill will authorise the Department of Home Affairs to operate a central interoperability hub, which is one of the technical systems that supports the identity-matching services. 


This hub is not a database and does not conduct any facial biometric matching. Rather it acts like a router, transmitting matching requests received from user agencies to facial image databases. These databases conduct the matching using facial recognition software and return a response back via the hub. 


The hub does not store any personal information, but retains certain data about transactions for auditing and oversight purposes.


This approach enables the matching of images between agencies that operate different facial recognition systems that otherwise may not be compatible. 


The passport, visa and citizenship images that are used in the identity-matching services will continue to be held separately in databases by the Department of Home Affairs and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as the agencies that issue these documents. 


Driver licence images will be made available via a National Driver Licence Facial Recognition Solution. This system will be hosted by the Department of Home Affairs on behalf of the states and territories in accordance with the intergovernmental agreement.


The system will consist of a database of driver licence images and information supplied by each state and territory, and a facial recognition system for biometric comparison of facial images against facial images in the database.


The design of the driver licence database will enable each state and territory authority to control access to its data via the identity-matching services, and it will not provide the Department of Home Affairs with the ability to view, modify or update identification information supplied by state and territory authorities.


The bill will authorise the Department of Home Affairs to collect, use and disclose identity information for the purposes of developing, operating and maintaining the identity matching services. The bill will define the scope of these services in terms of:


the types of information that may be used in the services,


the name and functions of the services,


the types of organisations that may use the services, and


the purpose for which the services may be provided.


Rather than enabling the use of any type of personal information, the bill defines, and therefore limits, the identification information that may be used in the services. In doing so, the bill excludes certain types of personal information from being used in the services, such as information about a person's political opinions or religious beliefs. This is to ensure that the department may collect, use and disclose only those types of information that are reasonably necessary in order to provide the identity-matching services.


The identity-matching services to be enabled by the bill will reflect those in the intergovernmental agreement.


These include a Face Verification Service that will help to verify a person's identity. In addition to preventing identity crime, this service will make it easier for people to prove their identity when they are applying for government services.


Use of the Face Verification Service will commence with government agencies, but the bill also enables the service to be provided to private sector organisations—for example, banks or telecommunications providers—that have regulatory customer identification requirements.


It is important to note that private sector organisations may use the Face Verification Service only with the consent of the person whose information is being verified.


The bill also provides for a Face Identification Service, which law enforcement and national security agencies will be able to use to identify unknown persons or detect persons using multiple fraudulent identities.


Recognising the increased privacy impacts of this service, its use will be constrained only to those agencies with national security, law enforcement or anti-corruption functions that are specifically listed in this bill.


The bill also provides for other identity-matching services that are designed for use by state and territory driver licensing authorities, to help improve the integrity of their data and licence-issuing processes.


In authorising the Department of Home Affairs to collect, use and disclose identification information for the purpose of providing the identity-matching services, the bill limits the department's provision of these services to certain defined 'identity or community protection activities'. These activities include:


preventing and detecting identity fraud


law enforcement


national security


protective security


community safety


road safety


verifying identity


Importantly, the bill does not provide any additional legislative authority for other agencies or organisations to collect personal information in order to use the services. These organisations will need to have a separate legal basis to support their use of the identity-matching services.


The bill provides a rule-making power to enable the Minister for Home Affairs to expand the types of identification information that may be used in the identity-matching services or to add new services in future. To ensure that the privacy and other human rights implications of these rules are taken into account, the bill requires these rules to be developed in consultation with the Information Commissioner and the Human Rights Commissioner. As legislative instruments, these rules will also be subject to parliamentary review.


To provide robust protections over the information used in the identity-matching services, the bill will provide for new criminal offences with penalties of two years imprisonment for unauthorised recording or disclosure of certain protected information. This includes identification used in the identity-matching services, as well as other information that relates to the security of the systems supporting the services.


These offences will apply to employees or other persons working on behalf of the Department of Home Affairs, defined as 'entrusted persons'. These offences will be in addition to existing offences for the misuse of personal information contained in a range of legislation which will continue to apply to the department and to the other agencies that use the identity-matching services.


The bill will also provide robust accountability and transparency measures to help maintain public confidence in the operation of the identity-matching services. These include annual reporting to parliament on the extent of use of the services by government agencies and private sector organisations, and a statutory review to be commenced within five years.


In conclusion, this bill will give effect to the commitments made by the Commonwealth in entering into the Intergovernmental Agreement on Identity Matching Services.


The identity-matching services enabled by the bill will help to reduce the impact of identity crime on the community, helping Australians to prove their identities more securely and easily.


They will also promote a range of law enforcement, national security and community safety outcomes, while providing robust privacy protections over the use of personal information.

Mr TAYLOR
 (Hume—Minister for Law Enforcement and Cybersecurity) (10:33):  I move:


Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 1) 2018.


The customs tariff proposal that I have just tabled removes the customs duty rates applied to herbicides and pesticides imported under the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement.


These amendments implement early outcomes of the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement announced by the Prime Minister and the President of Indonesia on 26 February 2017.


As a result of these amendments, eligible herbicides and pesticides imported under the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement will be subject to a 'free' rate of customs duty, as of 20 September last year.


All other parties to the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement that import significant amounts of these goods have a 'free' rate of customs duty through other trade agreements. As such Indonesia will be an important beneficiary of these amendments. Of course the other very important beneficiaries are Australian farmers, who are major users of pesticides and herbicides. As one of the most competitive nations on earth, our farmers are constantly needing to reduce their costs of production of agricultural products. This is an important initiative, as are all initiatives that reduce the costs for farmers to improve their efficiency and productivity. They, of course, will always jump on those opportunities, being an extraordinary farming sector that has always, for centuries, been effective and productive in what it does.


In exchange for this, Indonesia has agreed to reduce the tariff applied to Australian sugar to five per cent. We know how important it is for our sugar exporters to have the best possible markets. It's wonderful to have the minister for trade here at the table; he's playing an extraordinary role in helping and supporting Australian farmers access new markets. We are seeing daily the impact of this on the prices of commodities and in the benefits to farmers. I've got to say, as a farmer myself, I have been astounded at the progress that is being made in getting access to new markets for our products. This is a government that has been hugely supportive of the agricultural sector and the farming sector in Australia. The numbers are in; we are seeing it every day. This tariff proposal is just another step in that very, very important direction of giving every Australian farmer access to every possible market. I commend this tariff proposal to the House.

Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter) (10:38):  Mr Deputy Speaker, on indulgence: I wasn't able to participate in the debate reflecting on the loss of the former member for Robertson, Barry Cohen. Happily, though, I was able to attend his memorial service on Monday. I just want to place on the record my great admiration for him and his work both here and elsewhere. It was very extensive on both counts. He was a great representative of his community and he will be sadly missed.


The Imported Food Control Amendment Bill 2017 makes changes to strengthen Australia's current risk-based management approach of imported food to better protect the health of consumers. Labor supports the bill, because it recognises that, while Australia has a robust imported food safety system, it can always be improved and strengthened, especially as Australia imports greater amounts of food from other countries through our bilateral trade deals.


While we support and welcome the bill, we do lament that it hasn't arrived in this place at an earlier date, because it's a critical issue. Foodborne illnesses are serious and have major consequences when outbreaks occur. In 2010, for example, it was estimated that there were 4.1 million episodes of gastrointestinal foodborne illnesses and some 86 deaths in Australia. The economic costs of foodborne illnesses in Australia are also substantial. Doctor visits, treatments and days off work lost are reported to cost around $1.2 billion per year. The public does expect that, when foodborne illnesses occur, there are systems in place to deal with the suspected source as soon as possible and, of course, that responses can be put in place very quickly.


The outbreak of hepatitis A in 2015, which was linked to imported frozen berries at the time, exposed limitations with the current imported food regulatory system. Unfortunately, at the time, the then Minister for Agriculture, the member for New England, took aim at the importing country and indeed the importing company, and, having done that, then turned to his attention to food labelling. Food labelling is a separate issue and, I thought at the time, was somewhat of a distraction to the issue at hand. Mr Joyce said, on 18 February 2015, that he believed there should be clear country-of-origin labelling on all imported foods so consumers knew exactly where the product was coming from. He said that there was a review currently underway and he would be pushing for proper labelling to be implemented as quickly as possible and, as reported:


'We should have proper country of origin labelling,' Mr Joyce said. 'Maybe other countries are not as concerned about food safety as we are.' Mr Joyce urged Australians to seek out locally made products. He said, 'Buy Australian and save yourself a pain in the guts.'


The member for New England should have checked his facts, because the packages relating to the suspected contamination of frozen berries were clearly labelled 'Product of China', or words to that effect. Clearly, they showed the origin of those berries. He went further, claiming:


… labels were needed 'that clearly identifies unambiguously, as soon as you pick up a package, whether it is from our country with our strong … sanitary requirements'.


'That is making sure that faecal contamination, which is a very polite word for poo, is not anywhere near your food, not going to be put in your mouth,' he added.


These were really childish comments from a minister seeking to distract from the failings of his own government—a government which had been in power for a considerable time then; it must have been at least two years.


The centre of these changes, of course, relate to beyond-the-border considerations. We can't expect to meet our aspirations on food safety at our border. The real work is done in the nation from which the imports come, so the relationships with these nations are very important. You can't expect to have the architecture and the rules in place without those strong relations—and those comments don't help in any way, shape or form—not to mention how important those relationships are strategically and in export terms. Those berries came from a country which was a critical export market for Australia. Childish comments like that, made on an issue where there had not been a conclusion in any way, don't help at all. So, sadly, rather than immediately leap to strengthen our importing rules, the then minister decided to play politics.


Here we are in 2018, three years on from the event, and we're finally debating new measures—again, measures that the opposition supports—to deal with these issues. Of course, it is a natural progression from the major biosecurity reforms—biosecurity previously having been known better as quarantine. Labor began those around 2013 or earlier, and these are natural progressions—the next step. It should not have taken until 2018 to be debating this bill in this House.


The thing that is most notable about Labor's reforms is a greater focus on beyond-border work, or beyond-our-country work, recognising that by the time we get to the border the risk-based system can't assure us or meet our aspirations. While supporting the bill, we do lament the slowness in these matters being dealt with.


I certainly regret the then minister's comments, his distraction and, of course, the fact that we're still not having a conversation about the labelling laws that came into place as a result of those events. There was great fanfare about them at the time. For a number of weeks, it seemed there that country-of-origin labelling was the most important thing this parliament was doing. I haven't heard a minister of the government talk about them for some time. I would suggest there has been negative fallout. I would challenge any member of this place to talk to their constituents and ask them what they think about the new country-of-origin labelling. I don't think they'd get much of a response. I don't think too many people have noticed them much, let alone have a view about how effective they have been.


But, in the rush to put in place the distraction from the government's own inadequacies on food importation, they got a few things wrong, obviously, because there are a whole range of articles complaining about the adverse impact on small Australian agrifood businesses like Brookfarm muesli in Byron Bay. They estimate that redesigning their 70 different packages would cost them around half a million dollars.


Further, health experts from Monash University are claiming that the new labels are not giving consumers the information they want and that it doesn't actually tell us where our food comes from, which is the key point. This was supposed to be a response to the flaws in our food importation system, but it's still not even telling people accurately where the food comes from. What it does tell us is that food is from Australia, and then it leaves you to guess where the rest of the ingredients are from—unless the product is totally from another country, and then it must be labelled as coming from that country. This was the case with the suspected contaminated berries, but, as I said, that was clearly labelled already.


My criticism is qualified, because I know these aren't easy issues. Country-of-origin labelling has been a conversation in the community for a long, long time, and the reason governments haven't fixed it well is that it's very, very difficult. But the additional point to that is that on the day the government made it sound simple and declared, in response to the berries contamination issue, that it was going to do it and do it properly this time, and it clearly hasn't been the case. Again, I lament the fact that that distraction was put in place, the policy was rushed and poorly done, the outcomes have been poor and they have had a significantly adverse impact on the business community.


I formally move the second reading amendment that has been circulated in my name. It's been seconded by the member for Fenner, and I thank him for that. I move:


That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:


""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House notes that the Turnbull Government has failed to implement effective policies in a timely manner to ensure that Australian agriculture is achieving its full potential"".


The amendment seeks to make this a broader debate about the future of agricultural policy and invites us to offer some reflections on the performance of the government in this area over the course of almost the last five years now. It's not been a happy period for agriculture, in my view. I've had the great privilege of being in the portfolio since about July 2013, first as the minister, for just a short few months, and for the last four years also as the opposition spokesperson on agriculture.


I recall very vividly extending a hand of bipartisanship, both publicly and privately, to the minister of the day, the member for New England, because I could see so much opportunity but also so much challenge. I took the view that surely, if there's an area where we can establish some bipartisanship, it's in the production of our food and fibre, because the things that separate us in this area are not great, and conversation and dialogue and cooperation are the best way to close that gap. Obviously it won't happen in every aspect of public policy, but I thought there were great opportunities.


Unfortunately, that offer was never accepted by the member for New England. Rather, he decided that he'd make the best of the portfolio politically; he'd seek to divide rather than unite—in fact, try to perpetuate issues of disagreement in an attempt to, if you like, continue the war and try to paint a starker picture of the division between the opposition and the government on these issues—which was just a very, very disappointing approach, in my view. If he'd taken my extended hand of bipartisanship, I think we could have done a lot better in Australian agriculture over the last five years.


Sure, we've had some achievements in agriculture. The sector's creeping to around $60 billion in gross farm value. That's a pretty good outcome, although, if you have a look at the rate of our economic growth and measure it against other indices, it's just what you'd expect. It's what you'd expect or hope for, given the rising global demand for quality food, and of course we are a great producer of quality food. I regret, though, that Minister Joyce spent most of his time in this portfolio talking about commodity prices and taking credit for them—and beef and sheepmeat. He was always talking about the commodities that were going up, and he never mentioned the commodities that were going down. I could never quite understand that.


I think everyone in this place knows that, while government has a role, it's pretty dangerous for a minister to start taking credit for commodity price rises, because they tend to go up and down. The areas which he talked about most were, of course, going up because of drought-induced lack of supply. Demand was outstripping supply and of course, when that happens, the price rises. The problem with that, of course, is that the price rise is not sustainable, nor would you want it to be sustainable, because it's happened just by a failure in the market. So I found that somewhat lamentable.


The minister started his term as the minister for agriculture by announcing that he was going to do a white paper. In fact, he might have announced that before the election; I don't recall. We waited a long time for that white paper. I remember that at one point I was putting out a media response every week, expressing concern that another week had passed and we still hadn't seen an agriculture white paper. Of course, expectations built, as they do. The longer you wait, the better you might hope that the production of the paper might be. But, sadly, that wasn't the case.


We were waiting for a big-picture approach, a document that delivered some strategic vision and strategic guidance for the sector, some clear signals to investors about where the government was most keen to see investment flow, where it believed that our natural resources could produce the greatest possible return for both our farmers and our nation, and some big ideas about the challenges of climate, the drying continent, the allocation of our water resources and what we'd be able to do about emerging international competition as developing nations become more aggressive in our own export markets—many countries, of course, against which we find it difficult to compete. We were waiting for a document that recognises that our key competitive advantage is our reputation as a provider of clean green safe food and that if we were to lose that reputation our key competitive advantage would be gone. That would be a very difficult situation for our Australian exporters. As the global population goes to nine billion, what implications will that have for Australia? What will be the opportunities and the challenges? How might that impact on the decisions of consumers and those who set rules around consumer law around the world? We must reflect on the implications of our own population rising dramatically in the next 30 years or so, and changing consumer attitudes. There's obviously an increase in consumer choice around red meats, for example. This is a transformation that will continue exponentially in the out years. There are rising concerns about animal welfare. We have to think about what that means and how we make sure that our farm leaders are embracing that, understanding that and adapting to it.


Minister Joyce's response is to attack anyone who expresses a concern about animal welfare. You know what happens then. It's tit-for-tat and the issue becomes larger and larger and larger and more difficult to manage. Strong governments listen to people, acknowledge the concerns, recognise the concerns, identify and agree where the concerns are very valid. That is very important. You can't have a cooperative and, therefore, productive conversation if you're not recognising both sides of the debate. And then you must adjust policy in the hope of making sure that you can meet the expectations of concerned consumers without having an adverse impact on farm businesses. Of course that can be done.


When we put out our six-point plan for animal welfare before the last election, Minister Joyce attacked it—it was going to be the end of farming in this country as we know it! Unfortunately, the National Farmers' Federation rejected it too. Our farming leaders need to play a role here too. They need to look forward and see where the opportunities and challenges are. They need to recognise and observe changing consumer attitudes and work with us to adjust our practices and policies where we can to ensure that those issues are being accommodated. We thought we might have seen much more about our natural resources in the white paper—about how we allocate them to ensure we get the best possible return. Over time, it's going to become more challenging. You can have the debate about what's causing the climate to change, but it is changing. We need to mitigate climate change but also adapt to it. We need to help incentivise the embracing of and take-up of smarter land use practices. How do we use our soils and our water resources in a way that's more sustainable?


These things barely rated a mention in the white paper. Climate change, from memory, had two paragraphs—on what is possibly the biggest challenge facing our farm community! That takes me to drought. Drought got a fair mention in the white paper. It didn't say much about its causes or what's making it worse over time. But there were no big picture responses. When the pressure came on thereafter, what did we get? We got concessional loans. At a time when global interest rates are the lowest in living memory, Minister Joyce's only response was basically to give people more debt or the opportunity to transfer their debt. There's nothing wrong with concessional loans. Labor first introduced them in 2013 to deal with a serious debt problem in the farm sector. There is nothing wrong with them in isolation; but, as a total solution to such a protracted and worsening problem, they're not much of a solution at all. Of course, those farm concessional loans have been of limited success, which, of course, is what led us to the debate that we had in this place last night about the pork-barrel-boondoggle exercise with the Regional Investment Corporation. There is nothing much on those big-picture issues. 


There is a little bit research and development—one of the most important challenges we face. It's not just about spending more money. It doesn't always have to be about spending more money. Spending more money is always nice, but just as important is making sure that we spend smarter and making sure that we're getting the maximum possible return and benefit not only from the public sector investment but also from the private sector investment. When I look at our research and development system, it may still be the best in the world. We like to think it is, because Labor put it in place back in the early nineties. It is respected around the globe. Just because it is still considered a good system doesn't mean it can't be improved; it can always be improved. The 2010 Productivity Commission inquiry recommended some changes—changes which weren't in place before Labor lost office and haven't been put in place by this government. I think they're worthy of a revisit. We don't have to reinvent the whole inquiry. It was in 2010; things have changed but not that much. I think those recommendations could be revisited. 


I see a lot of siloing in our R&D system—in other words, not enough cross-sectoral work on issues. I don't see enough on biosecurity. Labor went to the last election promising to spend a significant amount of money on a biosecurity institute to give long-term sustainable planning in biosecurity. I see too many RDCs spending to their cap—that is, they spend until the public matching funds run out and then they stop spending, which is not an indicator of an optimal system. There is nothing in the white paper to address that. There is a little bit of extra money. I didn't mind the way it was spent, because the minister produced a sort of competitive arrangement. But we haven't heard much of it since, and I don't know that it's made any substantial change. 


There is nothing much about our innovation rate. We're pretty good at R&D in this country in agriculture, but in innovation we're lagging. There is nothing really to address the freefall, really, of extension—in other words, getting the outcome of research and development down onto the farm. The states have largely withdrawn from that process, and nothing has been brought in to fill the vacuum. 


We could be doing something about community concern about the various biotechnologies. Biotechnologies will be critical to us in meeting our aspirations in the agriculture sector. There is community concern around GM, in particular. We need to have that debate. Someone needs to show some leadership, acknowledge the concerns, bring people together so that people can have a conversation about them and have a better understanding of them. We need to have a debate based on the science, not the rhetoric and the ideology. But we see no leadership in that area whatsoever. 


Market access is very, very important, but it's not everything in agriculture. As a government those on the other side always go back to access—the trade deals with Korea, Japan and China. They are important, of course, but we must also focus on domestic food production. We have enormous challenges in food production in this country. Focusing on trade access is important, but we need to keep our eye on what's happening here. While we export two-thirds of everything we grow, we can't take food security in the future for granted. We don't know what the world is going to look like in 40 years, strategically. We don't want to allow our food production systems to shut down in this country. We've seen the consequences of that. We've seen what has happened with gas when we get those policy settings wrong, and it can happen in food as well. If it happens in food, arguably, it would be even more important. 


What we have seen from the government in the last five years is leadership grants to, for instance, the Cattle Council and the NFF. Taxpayers' money is being given to organisations. I don't deny them or necessarily regret the payment of these moneys, but I think there could be more transparency. We still don't know exactly who's been getting those leadership grants. We lost the secretary of the department—a highly qualified, respected public servant—because he challenged the minister when the minister doctored his Hansard. In forestry, we've only had report after report after report. We've had the boondoggle Regional Investment Corporation and the pork-barrel APVMA relocation, which has been a disaster for the agriculture sector and will continue to be a disaster. And remember the question time where the minister said he was going to destroy carp? I won't try to re-enact his performance here—and everyone will be happy about that. That was a program begun by Labor in government, and it will probably take another three decades to come to fruition. Minister Joyce had us believe it was going to happen the next day and that carp would be gone. I still don't know what that was all about. 


There have been labour issues. Remember the backpacker tax? We never used to tax backpackers in this country. One of the reason we didn't is that we have significant labour shortages in the seasonal agricultural sectors in particular. In the end, the government wanted everyone to cheer them because they didn't introduce a backpacker tax as big as the one they were going to introduce in the first place. That was their big achievement. So we can notch that up as an achievement: the backpacker tax they put in place isn't as big as they proposed it would be. What have we seen on workforce issues since then? We've seen a tightening up of work visas, and we all cheer that, if there's a strategy to replace the labour. That should be our main focus: why aren't young Australians taking up these opportunities? Why are we so dependent on imported labour? That's what we should be asking ourselves. But we should not be putting the cart before the horse—just choking off the labour supply and then not having the workforce our growers so desperately need. 


One of the minister's first acts, along with announcing his white paper, was the abolition of the COAG committee. We don't have a drought policy in this country. We don't even have an organising committee. The bulk of land management responsibility in this country rests with the states. You can't do good work in drought without the cooperation of the states. The intergovernmental agreement on drought is about to come to an end. Yet farmers are coming off farm household allowance after their three years. We don't really have anything beyond concessional loans. This is just a disaster. We've got fruit fly incursions into Tasmania for the first time. We've got white spot in prawns in Queensland for the first time. You never hear these government ministers talk about biosecurity. 


In my short time as agriculture minister I learnt that the biggest responsibility for the ag minister is biosecurity. In fact, if you were doing the portfolio title properly, 'biosecurity' would be in the title, because probably 60 per cent of the work of the minister is around biosecurity. We hear lots about commodity prices, but we never hear anything about biosecurity. We're nothing without a strong biosecurity system. In fact, one of the first acts of the former agriculture minister was to abolish the position of Inspector-General of Biosecurity. Think about that: he abolished the position of Inspector-General of Biosecurity. After a war with us over it, he finally reinstated it—although, if my memory serves me correctly, the new inspector didn't quite have all the powers he or she had under Labor's regime. I might be checked on that, but certainly there was a significant attempt to undermine that position—something I will never understand. 


So I regret the last four years or more. At a time when the challenges are so great with a changing climate and resource management issues, and the opportunities are so great with growing global food demand, agriculture should be facing golden times but, unfortunately— (Time expired)

Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter) (10:38):  Mr Deputy Speaker, on indulgence: I wasn't able to participate in the debate reflecting on the loss of the former member for Robertson, Barry Cohen. Happily, though, I was able to attend his memorial service on Monday. I just want to place on the record my great admiration for him and his work both here and elsewhere. It was very extensive on both counts. He was a great representative of his community and he will be sadly missed.


The Imported Food Control Amendment Bill 2017 makes changes to strengthen Australia's current risk-based management approach of imported food to better protect the health of consumers. Labor supports the bill, because it recognises that, while Australia has a robust imported food safety system, it can always be improved and strengthened, especially as Australia imports greater amounts of food from other countries through our bilateral trade deals.


While we support and welcome the bill, we do lament that it hasn't arrived in this place at an earlier date, because it's a critical issue. Foodborne illnesses are serious and have major consequences when outbreaks occur. In 2010, for example, it was estimated that there were 4.1 million episodes of gastrointestinal foodborne illnesses and some 86 deaths in Australia. The economic costs of foodborne illnesses in Australia are also substantial. Doctor visits, treatments and days off work lost are reported to cost around $1.2 billion per year. The public does expect that, when foodborne illnesses occur, there are systems in place to deal with the suspected source as soon as possible and, of course, that responses can be put in place very quickly.


The outbreak of hepatitis A in 2015, which was linked to imported frozen berries at the time, exposed limitations with the current imported food regulatory system. Unfortunately, at the time, the then Minister for Agriculture, the member for New England, took aim at the importing country and indeed the importing company, and, having done that, then turned to his attention to food labelling. Food labelling is a separate issue and, I thought at the time, was somewhat of a distraction to the issue at hand. Mr Joyce said, on 18 February 2015, that he believed there should be clear country-of-origin labelling on all imported foods so consumers knew exactly where the product was coming from. He said that there was a review currently underway and he would be pushing for proper labelling to be implemented as quickly as possible and, as reported:


'We should have proper country of origin labelling,' Mr Joyce said. 'Maybe other countries are not as concerned about food safety as we are.' Mr Joyce urged Australians to seek out locally made products. He said, 'Buy Australian and save yourself a pain in the guts.'


The member for New England should have checked his facts, because the packages relating to the suspected contamination of frozen berries were clearly labelled 'Product of China', or words to that effect. Clearly, they showed the origin of those berries. He went further, claiming:


… labels were needed 'that clearly identifies unambiguously, as soon as you pick up a package, whether it is from our country with our strong … sanitary requirements'.


'That is making sure that faecal contamination, which is a very polite word for poo, is not anywhere near your food, not going to be put in your mouth,' he added.


These were really childish comments from a minister seeking to distract from the failings of his own government—a government which had been in power for a considerable time then; it must have been at least two years.


The centre of these changes, of course, relate to beyond-the-border considerations. We can't expect to meet our aspirations on food safety at our border. The real work is done in the nation from which the imports come, so the relationships with these nations are very important. You can't expect to have the architecture and the rules in place without those strong relations—and those comments don't help in any way, shape or form—not to mention how important those relationships are strategically and in export terms. Those berries came from a country which was a critical export market for Australia. Childish comments like that, made on an issue where there had not been a conclusion in any way, don't help at all. So, sadly, rather than immediately leap to strengthen our importing rules, the then minister decided to play politics.


Here we are in 2018, three years on from the event, and we're finally debating new measures—again, measures that the opposition supports—to deal with these issues. Of course, it is a natural progression from the major biosecurity reforms—biosecurity previously having been known better as quarantine. Labor began those around 2013 or earlier, and these are natural progressions—the next step. It should not have taken until 2018 to be debating this bill in this House.


The thing that is most notable about Labor's reforms is a greater focus on beyond-border work, or beyond-our-country work, recognising that by the time we get to the border the risk-based system can't assure us or meet our aspirations. While supporting the bill, we do lament the slowness in these matters being dealt with.


I certainly regret the then minister's comments, his distraction and, of course, the fact that we're still not having a conversation about the labelling laws that came into place as a result of those events. There was great fanfare about them at the time. For a number of weeks, it seemed there that country-of-origin labelling was the most important thing this parliament was doing. I haven't heard a minister of the government talk about them for some time. I would suggest there has been negative fallout. I would challenge any member of this place to talk to their constituents and ask them what they think about the new country-of-origin labelling. I don't think they'd get much of a response. I don't think too many people have noticed them much, let alone have a view about how effective they have been.


But, in the rush to put in place the distraction from the government's own inadequacies on food importation, they got a few things wrong, obviously, because there are a whole range of articles complaining about the adverse impact on small Australian agrifood businesses like Brookfarm muesli in Byron Bay. They estimate that redesigning their 70 different packages would cost them around half a million dollars.


Further, health experts from Monash University are claiming that the new labels are not giving consumers the information they want and that it doesn't actually tell us where our food comes from, which is the key point. This was supposed to be a response to the flaws in our food importation system, but it's still not even telling people accurately where the food comes from. What it does tell us is that food is from Australia, and then it leaves you to guess where the rest of the ingredients are from—unless the product is totally from another country, and then it must be labelled as coming from that country. This was the case with the suspected contaminated berries, but, as I said, that was clearly labelled already.


My criticism is qualified, because I know these aren't easy issues. Country-of-origin labelling has been a conversation in the community for a long, long time, and the reason governments haven't fixed it well is that it's very, very difficult. But the additional point to that is that on the day the government made it sound simple and declared, in response to the berries contamination issue, that it was going to do it and do it properly this time, and it clearly hasn't been the case. Again, I lament the fact that that distraction was put in place, the policy was rushed and poorly done, the outcomes have been poor and they have had a significantly adverse impact on the business community.

The amendment seeks to make this a broader debate about the future of agricultural policy and invites us to offer some reflections on the performance of the government in this area over the course of almost the last five years now. It's not been a happy period for agriculture, in my view. I've had the great privilege of being in the portfolio since about July 2013, first as the minister, for just a short few months, and for the last four years also as the opposition spokesperson on agriculture.

So I found that somewhat lamentable.


The minister started his term as the minister for agriculture by announcing that he was going to do a white paper. In fact, he might have announced that before the election; I don't recall. We waited a long time for that white paper. I remember that at one point I was putting out a media response every week, expressing concern that another week had passed and we still hadn't seen an agriculture white paper. Of course, expectations built, as they do. The longer you wait, the better you might hope that the production of the paper might be. But, sadly, that wasn't the case.

We were waiting for a document that recognises that our key competitive advantage is our reputation as a provider of clean green safe food and that if we were to lose that reputation our key competitive advantage would be gone. That would be a very difficult situation for our Australian exporters. As the global population goes to nine billion, what implications will that have for Australia?

There is a little bit research and development—one of the most important challenges we face. It's not just about spending more money. It doesn't always have to be about spending more money. Spending more money is always nice, but just as important is making sure that we spend smarter and making sure that we're getting the maximum possible return and benefit not only from the public sector investment but also from the private sector investment.

There is nothing much about our innovation rate. We're pretty good at R&D in this country in agriculture, but in innovation we're lagging. There is nothing really to address the freefall, really, of extension—in other words, getting the outcome of research and development down onto the farm. The states have largely withdrawn from that process, and nothing has been brought in to fill the vacuum. 


We could be doing something about community concern about the various biotechnologies. Biotechnologies will be critical to us in meeting our aspirations in the agriculture sector. There is community concern around GM, in particular. We need to have that debate. Someone needs to show some leadership, acknowledge the concerns, bring people together so that people can have a conversation about them and have a better understanding of them. We need to have a debate based on the science, not the rhetoric and the ideology. But we see no leadership in that area whatsoever. 


Market access is very, very important, but it's not everything in agriculture. As a government those on the other side always go back to access—the trade deals with Korea, Japan and China. They are important, of course, but we must also focus on domestic food production. We have enormous challenges in food production in this country. Focusing on trade access is important, but we need to keep our eye on what's happening here. While we export two-thirds of everything we grow, we can't take food security in the future for granted. We don't know what the world is going to look like in 40 years, strategically. We don't want to allow our food production systems to shut down in this country. We've seen the consequences of that. We've seen what has happened with gas when we get those policy settings wrong, and it can happen in food as well. If it happens in food, arguably, it would be even more important. 


What we have seen from the government in the last five years is leadership grants to, for instance, the Cattle Council and the NFF. Taxpayers' money is being given to organisations. I don't deny them or necessarily regret the payment of these moneys, but I think there could be more transparency. We still don't know exactly who's been getting those leadership grants. We lost the secretary of the department—a highly qualified, respected public servant—because he challenged the minister when the minister doctored his Hansard. In forestry, we've only had report after report after report. We've had the boondoggle Regional Investment Corporation and the pork-barrel APVMA relocation, which has been a disaster for the agriculture sector and will continue to be a disaster. And remember the question time where the minister said he was going to destroy carp? I won't try to re-enact his performance here—and everyone will be happy about that. That was a program begun by Labor in government, and it will probably take another three decades to come to fruition. Minister Joyce had us believe it was going to happen the next day and that carp would be gone. I still don't know what that was all about. 


There have been labour issues. Remember the backpacker tax? We never used to tax backpackers in this country. One of the reason we didn't is that we have significant labour shortages in the seasonal agricultural sectors in particular. In the end, the government wanted everyone to cheer them because they didn't introduce a backpacker tax as big as the one they were going to introduce in the first place. That was their big achievement. So we can notch that up as an achievement: the backpacker tax they put in place isn't as big as they proposed it would be. What have we seen on workforce issues since then? We've seen a tightening up of work visas, and we all cheer that, if there's a strategy to replace the labour. That should be our main focus: why aren't young Australians taking up these opportunities? Why are we so dependent on imported labour? That's what we should be asking ourselves. But we should not be putting the cart before the horse—just choking off the labour supply and then not having the workforce our growers so desperately need. 


One of the minister's first acts, along with announcing his white paper, was the abolition of the COAG committee. We don't have a drought policy in this country. We don't even have an organising committee. The bulk of land management responsibility in this country rests with the states. You can't do good work in drought without the cooperation of the states. The intergovernmental agreement on drought is about to come to an end. Yet farmers are coming off farm household allowance after their three years. We don't really have anything beyond concessional loans. This is just a disaster. We've got fruit fly incursions into Tasmania for the first time. We've got white spot in prawns in Queensland for the first time. You never hear these government ministers talk about biosecurity. 


In my short time as agriculture minister I learnt that the biggest responsibility for the ag minister is biosecurity. In fact, if you were doing the portfolio title properly, 'biosecurity' would be in the title, because probably 60 per cent of the work of the minister is around biosecurity. We hear lots about commodity prices, but we never hear anything about biosecurity. We're nothing without a strong biosecurity system. In fact, one of the first acts of the former agriculture minister was to abolish the position of Inspector-General of Biosecurity. Think about that: he abolished the position of Inspector-General of Biosecurity. After a war with us over it, he finally reinstated it—although, if my memory serves me correctly, the new inspector didn't quite have all the powers he or she had under Labor's regime. I might be checked on that, but certainly there was a significant attempt to undermine that position—something I will never understand. 


So I regret the last four years or more. At a time when the challenges are so great with a changing climate and resource management issues, and the opportunities are so great with growing global food demand, agriculture should be facing golden times but, unfortunately— (Time expired)

Mr HILL
 (Bruce) (13:30):  I rise on a happy note. I warmly and loudly congratulate Trish Keilty on winning the City of Greater Dandenong Citizen of the Year award for her amazing work at Avocare. Some months ago I had the pleasure of touring Avocare with the member for Isaacs. It's an incredible facility. Trish in fact founded this charity over 14 years ago, in 2003. It has now been serving the people of Dandenong for over a decade, supporting local charities to provide care for struggling families, the elderly and the disenfranchised. Trish and her team have managed all this while never receiving any direct or untied government funding at any level. Their workforce includes unemployed people, who learn employability and industry based skills while also supporting the community. There is this incredible map—I wish I could table it, but that's not permitted at this time in the House—which shows 100-plus charities that Avocare provides assistance and distribution to, not just in Dandenong but across the whole south-east of Melbourne. They partner with Foodbank to provide much-needed food relief to the local community. They are the lead partner in the distribution of 421,000 kilograms of food. 


Trish's compassion and energy are palpable and shine through whenever you meet her. It is typical, when Trish received this award, that the first thing she did was acknowledge the work of others and the other volunteers, but I congratulate Trish Keilty and the team at Avocare, and urge them to keep up the work.

Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth—Prime Minister) (14:02):  I rise to acknowledge and mourn the passing of Ron Walker. Ron was a man of tremendous drive and focus, a dedicated servant of his state, his country and his city. He was a great Australian and magnificent Melburnian. He towered over us all in life, and in death his legacy will loom large over his beloved city. Ron helped Melbourne become the city it was always destined to be. We will not see his like again. There is no better reminder of his contribution to public life than Melbourne. So many of its drawcards and the vibrancy and confidence of the city itself were inspired by his energy and vision. Melbourne's status as a centre of major sporting and cultural events owes much to Ron's passion for Formula One, having famously lured the coveted grand prix back from Adelaide in the 1990s. His oversight of the building of the iconic Crown Casino and key role in winning the 2006 Commonwealth Games brought a dynamism and a depth to Melbourne, a thriving international city.


Ron was a self-made man, a true entrepreneur who began his business career washing cars. He led many lives, and his passions and interests were wide-ranging: politics, business, the arts, medical research, philanthropy. From the early days of his financial success Ron was committed to sharing his good fortune. His contribution, as honourable members—particularly members of the Liberal Party—and Victorians know, was never just financial. He always gave of himself. When he committed to something, he was all in, boots and all. You didn't just get a financial backer; you got an advocate, an ideas man, a visionary, a friend and a good counsel. His time in politics, as a Melbourne city councillor and later as lord mayor, was short, but he didn't need government office to serve his state. His commitment was woven through everything he did. He was honoured in many ways—Officer of the Order of Australia, the Centenary Medal and Companion of the Order of Australia to name just a few.


Ron was honorary federal treasurer of the Liberal Party. As his successor in that role, I can say with authority it is the worst job in politics! Ron kept the party afloat in some very tough times—including, generously, from his own resources. There was never a more effective fundraiser. He was as persuasive as he was persistent. He even persuaded me to succeed him! He led by example and when, as often happened, friends tried to escape him as election day approached—well, how could you outrun someone with a stride like Ron Walker's. Ron encouraged me at every stage of my political career. He was a wise mentor, generous to a fault, always enthusiastic and never disheartened.


When Ron was diagnosed with cancer and given months to live, he railed against that fate. 'I don't want to die. I still have things to do,' he said. He found an experimental but very costly treatment in the United States—and it worked. His refusal to lie down brought another six years in which to do all those things he had wanted to do—and one of those was to ensure that everyone had access to the same cancer treatment he did. His advocacy was tireless, right up until the drug was listed on the PBS in 2015. It revealed a side of Ron that he didn't advertise widely—an understanding that with great wealth came a duty to those who are not so fortunate. There are many, many examples of his philanthropy that the public will never know. I place on record the acknowledgement and thanks of this parliament and our nation for his lifetime of service. To his wife, Barbara, and their family, I offer the heartfelt sympathy of the parliament and the nation.

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (14:07):  Towards the end of last year I was walking through Sydney Airport, heading back to Melbourne for the day, when I got tooted by one of those little motorised carts. It was Ron Walker riding on the back. He had a half-smile on his face, a twinkle in his eyes and was probably going about 150 kilometres slower than he would have liked. By the time I boarded the plane, he was already settled in his trademark spot, '1ALPHA', right next to his beloved Barbara. I assumed he was tired, and I knew he had been in the fight of his life. I thought that, like most of us when we get on a flight, he would want to rest on the trip home. So I said hello and took my seat; I didn't give it much more thought. Soon after, the flight attendant came and said that Mr Walker was wondering if I could spare a minute to chat. We only had a brief conversation—it was politically encouraging, I acknowledge!—but I was very touched by the gesture. I thought it was a measure of the man—warm and courteous, the mind still firing with ideas, still a keen observer and an analyst of the national political contest.


Mr Speaker, like you, I am a Melburnian, born and raised. Like everyone proud to call Melbourne home, Ron Walker has been omnipresent in our lives for decades. From my earliest memories of life in Melbourne as a primary school student there was Moomba, there was World of Sports on TV and there was 'Big Ron', the Lord Mayor of Melbourne—in all his regalia, of course. Regardless of one's politics, you'd have to acknowledge the difference that Ron made to Melbourne. The Prime Minister has dealt with his accomplishments for his beloved Liberal Party. I would like to talk a little bit about the transformation his vision helped to drive in Melbourne.


Ron undoubtedly loved Melbourne and he wanted to give the world a chance to fall in love with this marvellous city. I am sure in days to come there will be a discussion about how the city can honour his contribution to its success. Perhaps it will be a plaque, a statue, a car race, a hospital—something that carries the Walker name. But I think the simple truth is that there are already monuments to Ron Walker everywhere—the Australian Grand Prix, the revitalised South Bank, the world-class facilities built for the 2006 Commonwealth Games, and the tourists who come to watch the Bledisloe Cup or the President's Cup. There are the thousands of lives that he's changed through his generosity—from saving the Walwa bush hospital to championing Keytruda for cancer sufferers and following up a call he heard on the Neil Mitchell show and chipping in some money for someone doing it tough.


But perhaps the most powerful and enduring change that Ron helped to achieve was a change in mindset. From the hard times of recession, he helped restore Melbourne's faith in itself as a global destination, a city that could boldly bid for world events, confident that we could put on a world-class show in Melbourne.


Ron's love of his home town was perhaps even bigger than his lifelong loyalty to the Liberal Party. In John Ferguson's generous tribute to Ron in The Australian,he told the story of how, within hours of Steve Bracks being sworn in as Premier in 1999, Ron Walker called. I recognise Victorian Labor has spent some years targeting Ron's support for the Victorian Liberals, so Bracksy had no idea what to expect. Ron began with a simple statement: 'I am happy to serve your government and support you.' Mr Melbourne indeed!


When Ron first fought and beat cancer in 2012, he said, 'I didn't want to die. I had things to do.' I suspect, even last week, as his valiant fight against illness drew to a close, he still had things to do. For a man with Ron's drive and energy, his zest for life and his love of family, there's always more to do.


Today we can say with certainty that he loved his family, he lived life to the full and he had done more than enough for his city, for others and for our nation. May he rest in peace.

Ms LAMB
 (Longman) (15:18):  There've been attacks on me by a number of ministers, including yesterday by the Deputy Prime Minister, during question time and on social media. These attacks go to whether I took reasonable steps to renounce my UK citizenship prior to nominating for office. I can only answer by providing the House and the Australian people a deeply personal part of my story. I'm proud to be the member for Longman. I'm also proud to be a member of the Labor Party. After I put up my hand to be a candidate at the 2016 election, I received a call letting me know that I may hold entitlement of citizenship to another country. I asked for my party's assistance, and I received it. I received it immediately. I completed the forms required by the UK Home Office and I paid the required fee. I posted this by registered post with the required supporting documents. I waited for the fee to be processed, and my payment was accepted. Then I was nominated.


The administrative process that followed requested I provide some additional documents. One request was if I had ever held a British passport. For the record, I have never held a British passport. In fact I've never been to the UK in my life. Another request was for a copy of my parents' marriage certificate. I was advised that I did not have a legal right to obtain a copy of my parents' marriage certificate. My mother has that legal entitlement, as would my dad if he were still alive, but sadly he left us far too early in life.


I want to explain to the House why I can't obtain a copy of my parents' marriage certificate. It's a complex and traumatic story—a story that I don't usually share. One day, when I was around six years old, my mum dropped me off at school and she never came back to pick me up. I don't remember every detail of what happened afterwards. I remember lots of tears. I remember lots of confusion. I remember my dad trying to explain. I remember, some time later, dad taking me to the train station late one evening to collect my mother. I thought she was going to come home. The train came, the train went and there was no sign of her. So we went home.


I remember one day going outside the front of the mill gates. We lived on the mill grounds in Mackay in North Queensland. I remember there being a small store and a petrol bowser out the front. A car turned up. I think it was a Torana. It's funny how these little things stick in your mind, isn't it? I remember that part. My mother got out, words were exchanged and then my mother drove away. My dad was now a single parent—an amazing man, whose example I try to live up to every day of my life.


My mother wasn't at my seventh birthday or the birthday after that. She wasn't there to help when I brought my fourth son home from hospital to meet his brothers. She wasn't there for my school graduation. She wasn't there last year for my youngest son's graduation when he was 17—in fact, they have never met. She wasn't there to help me campaign. She wasn't there to celebrate when we won. She wasn't there to support me when I needed it. Many years ago, we made an attempt to build a relationship, but, regrettably, that failed. I don't know what was going on in my mum's life back then. I don't know what was going on when she dropped me off and never came back. I don't know what's going on in her life now—I have no idea. The fact is that we don't have a relationship. I imagine she carries her share of pain and trauma—and, if it is anything like mine, I wouldn't wish that on anybody.


I don't speak about this trauma. So, when people ask me why I couldn't just call my mother, well, this is why, and I hope this story gives you the answer. I would rather not share this story with my closest friends, let alone the Parliament of Australia. But telling people it was deeply personal circumstances wasn't enough for the political attacks to back off. So now it's been said, and the good people of my electorate of Longman need to hear it. The fact is that my mum is not around to grant me access to her marriage certificate, and my dad passed away nearly 20 years ago and spent the decade before that unable to care for himself and needing 24-hour care.


These are not things I find easy to re-live. This is not a story to gain sympathy. I don't speak out of hatred for my mother. I carry hurt, I carry disappointment and, it would be fair to say, I still carry a fair bit of anger. This story is about explaining, as simply as I can, that that extra document that the UK Home Office requested after they received my renunciation, my parents' marriage certificate, is a document I was advised I do not have a legal entitlement to obtain.


I would simply ask those opposite: take a moment and think about the circumstances. Think about the consequences of attacks like this on my family: my family, who like so many other families are studying, who are working—working weekends and nights; my family, who work hard, pay their fair share of tax—they're single parents; my family, who are tradies and hospitality workers. My family, like every other family in my community, are good people. They are good people, and they do not deserve to have the media digging through their lives or turning up on their doorsteps. Yes, I put my hand up for public life, but they didn't.


These attacks have caused pain and opened up wounds that have never healed—wounds inflicted on a very confused six-year-old little girl. I've fought that pain my whole life, but I can tell you now that there are bigger fights I care about, and that's why I'm here, and that's the fight I want to continue on behalf of the people of Longman.


In December last year I voted yes to end uncertainty this parliament had over a number of members in this House. I did this, confident in more than 40 pages of evidence of reasonable and necessary steps I took, knowing that a letter from the UK HO advising they could not be satisfied that I'm a British citizen has been disclosed, and knowing that three independent barristers, including a retired justice of the Federal Court of Australia, have resoundingly agreed that I took all reasonable steps to renounce my citizenship and that I was validly elected to parliament and am eligible to sit in this House. I remain confident I took all reasonable steps to renounce my citizenship, and nothing will change. Everything to see has been shown, except now I've been forced to rip that bandaid off a very painful story—painful to me and painful to my family.


The simple fact is that not all families look like the Australian version of Little House on the Prairie, let me tell you. In fact, most don't. Families are complex, they face challenges and sometimes, just sometimes, for whatever reason they're just like mine. Thank you.

Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (15:28):  Of course, all of us in this place acknowledge the member for Longman and her incredibly brave speech. It's impossible to speak after her without acknowledging that.


Mr Deputy Speaker, I'm sure that you would remember, as many on this side do, when the Prime Minister and the education minister proudly unveiled their new schools funding calculator after they'd made changes to the schools funding arrangements. It didn't last very long. It got taken down quick smart, because what that schools funding calculator allowed schools to do is look up how much worse off they would be under the government's changed funding arrangements. It was down for five months. It's finally been replaced by something that doesn't really allow us to compare apples with apples. This whole exercise has been about covering up for the fact that those opposite are cutting billions of dollars from our schools.


Just this week, we've released information from the Parliamentary Budget Office and the National Catholic Education Commission that shows just how much worse off schools will be over the next two years. In fact, over the next two years alone—this year, calendar year 2018; and calendar year 2019—Australian schools will be $2.19 billion worse off than they would be under Labor's funding arrangements. The extraordinary thing about this is that the cuts don't hit every sector equally, do they? In fact, the cuts hurt the poorest kids in the poorest schools the most. If you look at the cut to public schools of $1.88 billion over the next two years, that is 86 per cent of the total value of the cuts. Guess what? Public school kids are 66 per cent of the kids, so the largest share of the cuts by far, a disproportionately large share of the cuts, hits public schools. Public schools get 86 per cent of the cuts, Catholic schools get 12 per cent of the cuts and independent schools get just two per cent of the cuts. How does that work?


In South Australia, this has been a really incredible hit to the schools budget—$210 million cut from South Australian schools over the next two years alone. Government schools losing—



Mr Tudge interjecting—




Ms PLIBERSEK:
  It's in the budget papers, you moron.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Irons
):  Order! The member for Sydney will withdraw.




Ms PLIBERSEK:
  I withdraw. I withdraw the name. One of the things that are extraordinary about this is we've got a Liberal South Australian education minister who has cut $210 million from South Australian schools, but who helped him do it? Who allowed him to do it? It was the Xenophon Team's votes in the Senate that allowed these cuts to hit South Australian schools. It wouldn't be such a surprise, because you've got an ex-Liberal and a bunch of ex-Liberals helping a Liberal government cut the budget in schools, except here is a letter from then senator Nick Xenophon firmly promising—hand on heart, no equivocation—that he would never agree to cut the schools funding package that Labor delivered. The letter states:


I write to reiterate in the strongest possible terms, the commitment of the Nick Xenophon Team in relation to the implementation of the Gonski funding model … we stand by full implementation and full funding of Gonski. In particular we support the current system of indexation—


the current system of indexation—


and will oppose any moves to change it.


Well, he didn't oppose the moves. He backed them right in through here and through the Senate, and they would not have got through the Senate without the backing of the Nick Xenophon Team. He writes to principals:


I look forward to working with you and your members to ensure Gonski funding is defended and maintained for the future of Australia's children.


This same man seeks to be the member for Hartley. What does this do to schools in the electorate of Hartley? Norwood Morialta High School will lose $1.4 million over the next two years. That is a lot of cakes he's going to have to buy at the cake stall; it's a lot of sausages at the sausage sizzle that the local member is going to have to make up for. It's a few pieces of art at the art fete they might have, as many schools do. What about East Marden Primary School? Every year, they have a fundraising effort where they sell voucher booklets to raise money. How many voucher booklets is the member for Hartley, Mr Xenophon—if he is successful—going to have to buy to replace the $640,000 cut from this school this year and next year? This year and next year, $640,000 will be cut from this school. This contrasts, of course, with the Weatherill government, which has been investing in schools, with 800 new teachers and $1 billion of infrastructure upgrades in recent years. It is the largest ever spend by a South Australian government, with Norwood Morialta High School getting an extra $30 million and East Marden an extra $7½ million.


We are absolutely committed to reversing every dollar of the funding cuts that this Liberal government, with the help of the Nick Xenophon Team, smashed through this parliament—every single dollar restored. But I have to say that this is not theoretical future funding that we are talking about; these cuts are hitting this year. The Liberal government shoved these cuts through this parliament with the help of the Nick Xenophon Team. If that money had been allowed to flow to South Australia as intended, $210 million would have paid for 280 more school support officers, 186 more speech therapists, 203 new counsellors and 505 new teachers. Imagine the difference that would make in South Australian schools if those opposite hadn't cut the original funding that the South Australian government had signed up to and expected quite rightly to receive from the federal government because they had a signed deal with the federal government.


And all this while it's not just South Australia that's being affected. Tasmania will lose $68 million over the next two years alone. Think about the difference $68 million makes in Tasmanian schools. And those are not our figures; that is what the Liberal Deputy Premier says is the cut to Tasmanian schools. Nevertheless, he's prepared to back in the cut because he'd rather suck up to his friends in Canberra than stand up for Tasmanian schoolchildren. That's why Tasmania needs a government led by Bec White to actually stand up for Tasmanian schoolchildren.


This extra funding is critical to our schools. It's this extra funding that has been cut by those opposite that means more one-on-one attention for kids who are struggling, help to identify the kids that are struggling, help to make sure they catch up, help to make sure their literacy and numeracy is first rate. It means extra investment in science and coding—making sure they have the specialist teachers to teach these specialist subjects. It means more extension activities for kids who are gifted and talented. It means more help with the basics and more help for all of the enrichment that makes a school experience a great school experience. We should expect to deliver the best education in the world to Australian schoolchildren, not rip the guts out of school kids' education as those opposite are doing.


And why are they doing it? This is the bit that really gets me. Why are they doing it? So they can give $65 billion of big business tax cuts that they hope will one day trickle down. Well, history has taught us something different, hasn't it—$65 billion of big business tax cuts straight to the pockets of overseas shareholders instead of properly funding our schools so that our kids get every assistance. We want every Australian child to get a great education. We want every Australian school to be a great school. And it is appalling that those opposite have cut $2.19 billion this year and next year from our schools. The cuts hit public schools and Catholic schools the hardest And what are those opposite doing? They are still defending it. They are not even embarrassed. They should go and face their school communities and explain themselves.

Mrs ANDREWS
 (McPherson—Assistant Minister for Vocational Education and Skills) (15:38):  Contrary to the claims of those opposite, the Turnbull government is delivering record Commonwealth investment in Australian schools. There are no cuts to school funding. Labor are well aware that there are no cuts to funding, but they continue their own special version of events. So let me say once again that there are no cuts to school funding. There are a few things that I'd like to put on the record again today. I know that I have previously put them on the record, but they do need to be said and said again so that those opposite understand exactly what is happening with school funding, which is that there are no cuts.


I believe the Minister for Education and Training, Senator Simon Birmingham, has done an outstanding job with school funding, as he has done with the entire education portfolio. The Quality Schools package is going to deliver an extra $25.3 billion in recurrent funding for Australian schools over the next 10 years from 2018 through to 2027. That's on top of the 2016-17 budget settings. This brings the total Commonwealth recurrent funding to $249.8 billion over the period 2018 to 2027. For the first time, real needs based funding is going to be provided, and that will grow from $17.5 billion in 2017 to $31.1 billion in 2027.


This government is providing record levels of funding, and we're doing that because we understand how important school education is to our young people. But also—and I have said this many times in this place—we see education as a highway from child care and preschool, through to schools and potentially into vocational education and higher education. It is a highway, a journey, that our young people undertake, and it's very important that we get school funding right. But it's also very important that we make sure the money put into education funding is used appropriately and wisely. We know that each child in Australia deserves the support and opportunity to succeed. They deserve schools that are well and fairly funded and that encourage the highest academic standards. David Gonski has agreed to lead a new inquiry into improving the results of Australian students. The review to achieve educational excellence in Australian schools will provide advice on how this extra Commonwealth funding should be used by Australian schools to improve student achievement and school performance. The review will make recommendations on the most effective teaching and learning strategies to reverse declining results and to seek to raise the performance of schools and students. David Gonski will be providing his report to government very soon.


There are two issues. One is funding, and there are probably some things that I'd like to add on that before I actually discuss a little bit more the reason why we have to make sure that we are giving students at school the opportunity to do well and succeed. I actually want to talk about the funding that is going to each of the sectors, but I'm going to clarify what appears to be some Labor confusion over the funding distribution across all sectors. Let me start by saying that states and territories are responsible for the overall quality of school education in their jurisdictions. States and territories are also the major funders of schools. While they provide the majority of funding to public schools, the Australian government is the majority funder of non-government schools. At the sector level, current government funding, both Commonwealth and state and territory, accounts for 94 per cent of funding for government schools, 73 per cent of funding for Catholic schools and 42 per cent of funding for independent schools.


In dollar figure terms for each of the sectors, the government sector will receive a total of $33.65 billion over the period 2018 to 2021, which is over $2 billion extra and growth of 27.6 per cent. Over the next decade, the government sector will receive a total of $104.5 billion, meaning an additional $5.9 billion, which is growth of 79.6 per cent. The Catholic sector will receive a total of $28.44 billion over the period 2018 to 2021, which is over $1 billion extra and growth of 15.1 per cent. Over the next decade, the Catholic sector will receive a total of $81.89 billion, meaning an additional $3.23 billion, which is growth of 48.8 per cent. The independent sector will receive a total of $21 billion over the period 2018 to 2021, which is over $1 billion extra and growth of 22.8 per cent. Over the next decade, the independent sector will receive a total of $63.42 billion, meaning an additional $3.16 billion, which is growth of 66.9 per cent. So they are significant increases, and it's clear that there are no cuts to school funding.


I indicated previously not only that it is important that we get the funding right but also that how that funding is used is important, and it's important because we want to give our young people, our school students, every opportunity to succeed and do well, so that they are able to go on to life after school—whether that's going directly into employment or following a vocational education pathway or perhaps going on to university.


If we want to talk about funding cuts, when Labor was in government they ripped $1.2 billion out of vocational education, when they did multiple cuts to employer incentives over, effectively, a 12-month period. That crippled the sector—particularly in the non-trade areas, where we had a significant decline. In fact, the single biggest decline over a 12-month period was under the last 12 months of the Labor government. So it was a significant ripping of funding out of the vocational education sector.


We are now in a position where, because of that, we have a significant issue in the vocational education sector, where—if I use apprentices as an example—we cannot attract enough people into the sector to meet our current skill needs, let alone our future skill needs. The Turnbull government, in last year's budget, announced the $1.5 billion Skilling Australians Fund. It is designed to inject much-needed funds into the apprenticeship space. When I speak about apprenticeships, I'm talking about Australian apprenticeships, so it includes apprentices and trainees. We know that a lot of work needs to be done just to start to lift us up to the levels we were at back in 2012-13 because, in some areas, we know that we are going to be experiencing high growth. The disability sector, for example, and health and ageing are some priority areas for us where we know that we need to make sure that we have people who are properly skilled for the future. So the $1.5 billion Skilling Australians Fund will put a much-needed injection of funding in there and deal with the fact that we have a shortfall in apprentices. We're looking at, over a four-year period, supporting an additional 300,000 apprentices, at the pre-apprenticeship level, the apprenticeship level and the post-apprenticeship—the higher apprenticeship—level, and that is to make sure that we will be meeting our trades and non-trades needs and our trainee needs into the future.


That is only a small snapshot of some of the work that needs to be done in vocational education, but some of that work is so needed because of the damage that the Labor Party did to vocational education when it was last in government. So the coalition government has put a lot of time, effort and resources into making sure that we look at the education system as a whole. As I indicated previously, I believe the work that Senator Birmingham has done has been truly outstanding. He has looked at education as a whole. He has done a lot of work in the school space in particular. The announcements that he has made will address the funding issues—will get rid of the 27 deals that Labor put in place that distorted the funding to the various sectors of school education. He has dealt with that. He has come up with a proposal. He has engaged with David Gonski to make sure that the funding that has been put in is going to be well used into the future.

"Rishworth, Amanda, MP",ALP,2018-02-07,"



Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston) (15:48):  It was interesting listening to the assistant minister at the table, because in one breath she said, 'There've been no cuts; there've been no changes—nothing to see here,' and then, in the next breath, she said, 'Look, we changed the system because Labor's system wasn't right.' Well, it's time the assistant minister called it for what it is. The truth is that the government ripped up the agreements with the states and territories when it came to school funding. They ripped them up. And they got into government and said, 'We will not honour this,' despite having, at the election in 2013, run with: 'We will match Labor dollar for dollar.' Of course, when they got into government they ripped it up.


What that has meant is that, coming into 2018-19, $210 million has been ripped from South Australian schools. There are so many schools in my electorate that are missing out as a result. Just in the state seat of Black, a very important state seat, Hallett Cove East Primary School is going to miss out on $340,000, while Hallett Cove school will miss out on $1 million. These are serious cuts to schools in 2018-19. No matter how many times the government says that these are not cuts, they are cuts. The funding was written into agreements, signed by states and territories, but the then opposition—now the government—said they would abide by them but, when they got in, they ripped them up. If there wasn't any change and there weren't any cuts, as the assistant minister suggested, then why did we vote in the parliament about it? Why did we actually vote to change legislation about how we fund our schools? We voted because this government ripped up the agreement to fund our schools and, as a result, it cut billions from our schools. 


Now, we are facing a state election in South Australia and, when it comes to state elections, there's always a lot of discussion about education. I'm sure the opposition leader Steven Marshall has been talking about education. Although I have not heard much about it, but what was he doing when this government was voting to rip money out of schools? He was silent. He didn't say a word—not a peep from that mouth. But I'm not surprised about that because he hasn't been very vocal in sticking up for South Australia against this government in so many areas. 


I was surprised about the way that the Nick Xenophon Team voted, because they say they are the champion of education. I wasn't surprised the Nick Xenophon Team did a deal with the Liberal Party—that was not surprising. In fact, the Nick Xenophon Team has done many deals with the Liberal Party, including the changes to child care that will leave 279,000 families worse off. In South Australia, that equates to 16,037 families worse off. That is what the Nick Xenophon Team voted for when it came to childcare changes. So I wasn't surprised that they voted and did a deal with the Liberal Party. I was surprised about the Nick Xenophon Team's vote, because of this letter which came out just before the 2016 election. He wrote it to the Australian Education Union, saying: 'I write to reiterate in the strongest possible terms the commitment of the Nick Xenophon Team in relation to the implementation of the Gonski funding model. In particular, we support the current system of indexation and will oppose any moves to change it.' Then they came into the parliament hoping that no-one in South Australia would notice, hoping that over in Canberra it wouldn't get back to South Australia, and they voted to cut money from our schools. 


This is what we are facing here. We are facing a Liberal government that teams up with the crossbench to cut money from South Australian schools. In this state election, the issue of education should come up, and voters should very clearly think about which party will be best for South Australian schools. Who will stand up to Canberra and this Liberal government to fight for South Australian schools—not come in here and cut $210 million from our schools? Every school is affected. In fact, 86 per cent of public schools will be affected. The government needs to be held to account. This cut will hurt schools, it will hurt children and it will hurt families.

"Laming, Andrew, MP",LP,2018-02-07,"



Mr LAMING
 (Bowman) (15:53):  I must confess that the federal government here feels somewhat like a third wheel in this Labor Party attack on Nick Xenophon and South Australia. All the South Australian MPs are sitting up there, like free-range eggs, popped in there so that they can be on TV tonight. You are hoping that more than five people from Adelaide are actually listening. Well, for those who are listening, if you guys have some quarrel with Nick Xenophon, why don't we surrender some additional time for you to go on with five-minute bleats about how much you hate the Xenophon party. Clearly, today's debate is only about the South Australians consuming a little bit of oxygen in Canberra in the hope of helping their state colleagues.


For anyone whose notice it might have escaped, this complete preoccupation with cuts is just an ongoing Labor Party tactic dating back to the 'Mediscare' cuts campaign. Isn't it ironic? It hasn't escaped anyone's attention on this side that the once great Labor Party, the great social policy reformers of this nation, have been reduced to being whingers about cuts. It doesn't matter what it is in the area of social policy, they've completely abdicated the quality debate and all they can talk about is cuts. That actually does this nation a great disservice. This fetish with how many dollars of funding there are while completely ignoring how it's spent lets everyone down. It lets down their voters; it lets down policymakers; it lets down the nation—because we're not improving our schools one bit as long as we're quibbling over dollars.


Let's go right back to why we say cuts are a fairytale and Labor keep talking about cuts. It's because the word 'cuts' works very well for Labor voters, and they keep saying it because it keeps revving up the troops. The reality is, of course, that in education the $17 billion we spend every year will go to $31 billion in the next 10 years. That's a 77 per cent increase, but, of course, over in Labor land, we call that a 'negative 77 per cent cut' and everyone understands what we're talking about. That's an extra $25 billion this year, amounting to $250 billion in total being spent over those 10 years.


For those who are listening and bothered by this internecine battle between South Australian Labor and Nick Xenophon, I want to point out what is self-evident. That is that, when we agreed in 2013 to your funding proposals, we did so over the four-year forward estimates. No government can be bothered with what happens in years 5 and 6 because it's not in the Treasury papers. The reality is it's called 'funny money'. The reality is it's called 'the never-never'. Five and six years in advance, the great convenience was that Julia Gillard never had to worry about that money because she never had to find it in the first place. So Labor's denominator, Labor's starting point for cuts, is imaginary amounts of money which Treasury never had to find, and they never managed to find them because they desperately wanted Wayne Swan to minimise the deficit in the 2012-13 and 2013-14 years.


The education debate is about a globalising workforce. It's about a digitally enabled workforce and how we train them and teach them. It's about the impact of our interventions on progress and growth. It's about whole-of-school initiatives that can improve graduate performance. It's about how we define success. These are the things that this great parliament should be focusing on, not these ridiculous fairytales about cuts, which, I'll confess, are initially very attractive to Labor voters. But those mums and dads out there, when they learn those cuts are imaginary numbers and, in reality, the funding's going the other way, feel deceived by that party. They feel utterly deceived when they're told about it. To honestly improve educational performance in schools, we need a focus on quality that isn't happening here. What this government has, of course, is the Teacher Education Ministerial Advisory Group, solid recommendations about setting high standards and strengthening measures for quality teacher outputs, reconstituting the Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership, overhauling the way we accredit initial teacher education programs and getting universities to really focus on evidence based pedagogical approaches.


While we have that party over there, where the only thing they know about education is when the next P&C meeting is, we will never have a debate about quality. While you're worried about the South Australian election, you'll never engage in this big picture. So listen, I urge you, to the Association of Independent Schools of New South Wales chief executive, who said it's time to stop the bickering. It's time for the Labor Party to stop egging on parts of Catholic education to complain about cuts when they know overall, when leaders within Catholic education know and independent schools know as well, as does the rest of Australia, that there are nothing but massive education funding increases for this nation.

"Champion, Nick, MP",ALP,2018-02-07,"



Mr CHAMPION
 (Wakefield) (15:59):  It was interesting listening to the previous speaker, the Liberal from Queensland, because he trotted out the exact same excuses that Nick Xenophon has been trotting out in the face of these cuts. A cut is a cut is a cut. If, in your first budget, as Mr Hockey did, you own up to these cuts, it's a bit hard to deny them years and years later. It's a $210 million cut. That is what's happening. And guess what? The government on their corflutes, without compromise, excuse or caveat, put up dollar-for-dollar matching: 'We're going to match dollar for dollar in education.'


Then they get into government and they change things. But the only reason they can change things is because the Nick Xenophon Team, and St Nick himself, broke his promise. We know what happened: he wrote to the Education Union before the election and said, 'I write to reiterate in the strongest possible terms the commitment of the Nick Xenophon Team in relation to the implementation of the Gonski funding model.' Then he talks about his colleagues—Griff, Kakoschke-Moore, Sharkie—who will stand by full implementation and full funding of Gonski. What do they do when they're elected to this place? I'll tell you: they voted 57 times to cut funding to South Australian schools and national schools. What damage did it do to schools in my local electorate? I'll tell you. At Craigmore High School, in the seat of Elizabeth, it means a cut of $880,000 over two years. At the South Downs Primary School, the school that my mum taught at many years ago, before she got pregnant with me: $116,000 over those two years. At the Mark Oliphant College: $1.2 million. That's rounded; it's actually an extra $77,000 on top of that. Parafield Gardens High School: $817,000. Virginia Primary: $290,000. I've got a whole page of cuts. So don't tell us they're not real cuts. Don't tell us they don't really make a difference. They make a difference to Craigmore High School. They make a big difference to South Downs Primary School. And they make a big difference to country schools as well. In Greenock Primary: $95,000 over those two years. At Kapunda High School, where I studied: $425,000 over those two years. 


Being raised in a country town, I can tell you something. The one thing they dislike more than people who lie—they really dislike people who don't keep their word in the country—but they don't like sanctimonious hypocrites, either. And we know that St Nick, lately of Hartley in South Australia, but who has run for every other political office in South Australia as well—is a sanctimonious hypocrite, because he goes on and on about trust in the political system. He goes on and on about 'breaking the two-party duopoly' and the new politics of centrism, and how it's going to liberate us from all of the sins of politics. But the truth is that he said one thing before an election and did another thing after the election, which had a dramatic effect not just on communities, not just on South Australians in Craigmore or South Downs, but all over. Generations of children are going to go to schools which have inadequate funding, because these cuts get locked in and they roll on. The same way higher funding, as was originally implemented in the Gonski package, would have had an upwards effect on kids' education. 


We know there's an election, and we know that a new politics is being offered by St Nick of Hartley. But let me tell you something: a vote for SA-BEST, a vote for the Nick Xenophon Team, is a worthless vote, because he'll say one thing before an election—he'll do anything: any media stunt, anything to get his head on TV; he'll say and do anything with any stakeholder—and then after the election he'll do dirty deals with the Liberal Party, because deep down he's a Liberal. He's just got a grudge against the local Liberal Party, who wouldn't let him into Adelaide's student union many moons ago.

"Sudmalis, Ann, MP",LP,2018-02-07,"



Mrs SUDMALIS
 (Gilmore) (16:04):  I want to describe a plan. It's a plan for human beings to travel to Mars and establish a new colony. It's going to cost more than several trillion dollars. It's called the Trekonian plan. But I don't actually have the money to follow this plan. I'll just tell everybody about the plan and hope they're so convinced that if I tell them often enough they'll know it's going to be true. This is exactly the same as the fantasy funding proposed by the Labor Party at the last two elections for their grandiose plan for educational change—which was unfunded, putting it in the same place as my science fiction plan to get humans to Mars. Really, I would think that, by now, this rubbish would be exactly where it belongs—in the shredding bin. There are no cuts to school funding. How can you cut something that never existed? 


The Quality Schools package will deliver an extra $25.3 billion in recurrent funding for Australian schools over the next 10 years. I am so tired of the blatant misrepresentation of information. The opposition keep bleating about cuts, cuts, cuts—but it's a cut to nothing. It was never committed. Our total Commonwealth recurrent funding is $249.8 billion over about 10 years. For the first time, real needs based funding will be provided, and it grows from $17.5 billion to $31.1 billion. Nationally, funding per student for all sectors will continue to increase. This is growing. This is an increase. This is more money for our children. By 2027, students with the same needs in the same sector will have the same level of support from the Commonwealth, regardless of the state or the territory where they live, their background or the choice of school their parents make. As a condition of funding, the states and territories have to pull their weight. They have to co-invest in education. When they say, 'Oh, the federal government's putting in money—okay, we'll take ours out,' that is not good enough. We have to fix that. 


The new funding is part of a $192 million funding boost for our regions. It's so good that this is actually going to happen. We're delivering a school system that is entirely focused on students and what they need most. This means more resources for one-on-one time with teachers and new or existing initiatives such as specialist teachers or targeted intervention programs, which have been so successful over the last four years, and which Labor and Liberal agreed to fund. 


Under our plan, we're delivering, overall, 6.4 per cent average annual growth per student, for each of our children. Our needs based funding plan has been endorsed by everyone, including David Gonski—the name that has been thrown around from one end of parliament to the other. Our needs based education funding for students includes not only those with a disability—which is fairly obvious—but also those living in regional, rural or remote locations. And there's consideration of children in lower socioeconomic communities, and also funding to help close the gap for our Indigenous and Torres Strait Islander kids. 


For students with a disability, there'll be an increase of about $22.7 million from this year through to 2027—an 83.5 per cent increase. Increase, increase—it's going up. Students in regional, rural and remote locations will again see an increased investment, from $3.9 billion to $7.2 billion. That's an increase—getting bigger—of 84.8 per cent. More than 750,000 students will be better off with this needs based funding. I mentioned Indigenous students: around 218,000 young students will be benefiting from this far better, targeted, increased investment, from $285.6 million last year to $547.9 million in 2027. That's a 91.9 per cent increase. 


Australia is now amongst the highest investors in school education in the OECD. The most important aspect of education is, of course, investment. But the most recent research is that teachers must be part of the formula for better educational outcomes. I know—I was one. The rationalisation and nationalisation of increased funding is critical for our children. That's fact, not fantasy. Making sure the states and territories commit as well—that's critical, and it's fact, not fantasy. Making sure there's money to fund the investment is essential—that's fact, not fantasy.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2018-02-07,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (16:09):  As a result of the Turnbull government's $210 million funding cut to South Australian schools, 38 schools in my electorate are going to lose $16 million over the next couple of years. That includes schools like Modbury High School, which will lose $750,000; Banksia Park International High School, which will lose $765,000; The Heights School, which will lose $1.1 million; Roma Mitchell Secondary College, which will lose $1.2 million; and Golden Grove High School, which will lose $1.2 million. I singled those five schools out of the 38 for this reason: they are all secondary schools and they are all schools that meet and deal with students with high needs. These are the schools that most of our new arrivals who live in the north-eastern suburbs will go to. They are schools that cater for children with a disability, and these are the schools that need all the support they can get, yet their funding has been cut by this government.


I could talk about the other 34 schools, but clearly time will not allow me to do so. These are the schools, like most public schools, where the lower income families send their children. Unfortunately, it's always been the ideological view of this federal government and previous coalition governments that they are not responsible for the funding of public schools in this country. Clearly, that is the attitude of the member for Boothby, the member for Grey, the member for Barker and the member for Sturt, who are not standing up to their government in respect of these cuts, which they know are being perpetrated on the schools in the areas that they represent. Rather than come into this place and say that they oppose the Turnbull government's cuts, they are simply remaining silent. It was interesting to see that they were given approval to be let off the leash to come out and oppose the GST cuts to South Australia, but they're not prepared to come in here and oppose the education funding cuts to South Australia. It's also interesting that the cuts come from a minister who comes from South Australia, and the minister previous to him was also from South Australia, yet both of them have turned their backs on South Australians. As we've heard, it wasn't just them; it was also the Nick Xenophon Team that supported those cuts when they went through this parliament—the team that claims to stand up and support the battlers of South Australia. I can tell all people in this place that the battlers are the ones who predominantly rely on the public schools of our nation.


Despite all of the denials and protestations about the increased funding that we're going to see from the Turnbull government, the reality is that the funding cuts are there. They are real, and South Australia will get $210 million less than they would otherwise have got under the agreement that was previously made between South Australia and the federal government.


It's also true that funding does matter to schools. It's not just the school itself where the funding matters. If schools are denied funding, they in turn have to put up their fees and charges for the families of the students who come to their schools. Again, we're talking about families who come mainly from low-income areas. These are families who have had to deal with living increases, health funding increases, in many cases cuts to their working hours, and stagnant wages, as we heard again in question time today. Yet they will be forced to increase the fees that they pay for their children to go to school.


Because of these funding cuts, the schools will have little choice but to increase their fees, but more insulting is that the education funding cuts that have been made by the Turnbull government are made at a time when the government says, 'We can afford $65 billion in business tax cuts.' Clearly, this is a government that has its priorities wrong, because the return on investing in education is much greater, and will always be much greater, than the return that the government will get by providing tax cuts. I think every smart country knows that, and we're seeing that. The smart countries of the world have always invested first and foremost in their education systems.


Labor will take this issue right through to the next election, because Labor members do care about education, and we oppose the position taken by this government. It's not just in schools. We go to our universities and we see billions of dollars cut there. We go to the TAFEs and we see some $3 billion cut there. Then we go to the education system more broadly and there's $17 billion of cuts there. Enough is enough, and this government's got its priorities wrong. (Time expired)

Mr EVANS
 (Brisbane) (16:14):  Well, they're still at it—or, maybe more accurately, they're at it again. The member for Sydney—apparently now fully recovered after a public shaming last year by the ABC Fact Check for her misleading statements on education funding—is back and, it appears, is as undeterred by the facts as ever.


Last year—it was only six months ago, I think—Labor was here trying on these same misleading lines about billions being cut from schools and education funding. Here's exactly what ABC Fact Check had to say regarding those claims:


RMIT ABC Fact Check takes a deep dive into the figures.




The verdict



Ms Plibersek's claim is misleading: the Government is not cutting $22 billion from schools. 


Commonwealth budgets set out spending over a four year period.


According to the 2017-18 budget handed down on May 9, Commonwealth schools funding will continue to rise every year.


So the Labor claims here are misleading, according to ABC Fact Check. It really is quite remarkable to hear the member for Sydney—and so many of her South Australian colleagues, for some reason!—coming back here today to repeat those same old discredited lines. Australians are now on high alert, sadly, when it comes to Labor misleading them: 'Mediscare', school cuts, and the list goes on. There's a pattern there of lines which have been found, again and again, to be misleading by ABC Fact Check. 


We know that those on the opposite side know nothing about business. Barely any of them have set foot inside anything other than the union movement, and even fewer of them have been into that half of Australia that exists in the small business sector. So it's going to come as news to them—



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr EVANS:
  They're getting quite exercised by this. Apparently it's alarming to hear that half of the world out there is in that small business private sector. It's going to come as big news to them to learn that, if they were engaged in trade or commerce themselves and the Australian Consumer Law applied to them, misleading claims like that would be unlawful. They would be breaking the law if they were a business engaged in trade or commerce and making claims which were found to be misleading. It's really a sign of the times. Labor are now running on empty, it appears. They are so bereft of something new to complain about that they are falling back on those lines they used to fail to deliver here last year, trying to maintain this sense of confected and unending outrage.


I'm going to take just one moment to jump into some of the state figures to prove why this is so misleading. I want to go to the Queensland numbers. I know those opposite want to talk about South Australia, but total funding to the state of Queensland under this government's schools funding increases. It goes up each and every year. For state schools it is $1.6 billion this year. That's a bigger number than last year. And the amount goes up—up, not down—each and every year from now until 2027. By that stage it will have increased by about 50 per cent, to $2.4 billion in total. The exact same logic applies to the independent and the Catholic schools sector in Queensland where the federal government, rather than the state government, is the predominant funder. So it's going up every single year, not down. 


The same is true in South Australia. Mr Deputy Speaker Irons, what can you tell me about these numbers—$1.1 billion, $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion? They're going up each year, not down. Those are the funding figures under this government's schools funding for schools in South Australia.


In conclusion, these are the same old, tired lines from Labor—'misleading', as ABC Fact Check says. The only difference now is trying to link some of those lines to minor parties in South Australia. That's the only new bit here. I wonder: is something happening in South Australia soon, perhaps? It possibly suggests how poor Labor polling is in South Australia in the lead-up to the state election. I'm sure everybody noted how many of the Labor speakers here today were indeed from the state of South Australia. Well, sorry, Labor Party. I'm going to let the minor parties defend themselves, but I suspect they'll have some views quite similar to mine. All this episode shows is why the crossbenchers shouldn't trust Labor. It shows why South Australians and Queenslanders shouldn't trust Labor. It shows why teachers, parents and students shouldn't trust Labor. Their credibility on this issue of cuts is at an all-time low, like the boy who cried wolf.

"Georganas, Steve, MP",ALP,2018-02-07,"



Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh) (16:19):  I, too, rise to join my colleagues on this very important matter of public importance. It's interesting to hear the member for Brisbane opposite talk about how this is all a scare tactic and a scare campaign. The real speech he would have loved to have made is: 'Let's privatise every single school. Let's sell them to off to multinationals and let private industry, business and commerce run them.' That's the guts of what those on the other side would really like to see.


On this side of the House, we have a long tradition of supporting education—from the Whitlam era, and even before then—and we continue to do so. We did so in 2012, when we came up with the Gonski report et cetera, and implemented a great system that would have seen fairness in every school and every school's funding based on its needs. I recall very well during the 2013 campaign how those opposite were jumping up and down saying: 'Us too! Us too! We're supporting this. This is exactly what we're going to do as well. Nothing to worry about, Australian public voters, we will be doing the exact same thing as the Labor Party.' They said this about many other things, which they also reneged on once they won the federal election in 2013.


Education is another example of where those opposite say one thing before an election and then do something completely different. In South Australia, state schools will be losing $210 million in the next two years alone—$210 million! We're here to condemn this government for reneging on this and for taking money away from some of the poorest schools in South Australia, including some in my electorate. If you have a look at the sectors nationally and compare the figures provided by the Parliamentary Budget Office—the PBO—and the National Catholic Education Commission, you will see government schools will lose $1.88 billion, Catholic schools will lose $250.6 million and independent schools will lose $53.5 million. It's a total of $2.19 billion. And 86 per cent are cuts to public schools—86 per cent. That is a shame. Some of the schools in South Australia are literally losing more than $1 million in funding. Public schools cop a massive 86 per cent of the cuts nationally.


In my electorate, there are two schools that come to mind: Glenelg Primary School is down $731,000, and Thebarton Senior College is down $863,000. These are schools that do very important work. They take in kids with disabilities; they have special programs to assist children who have learning difficulties. Taking away $731,000 from Glenelg will make a big difference to those students, and it will make a big difference to the way that school operates. As we heard the member for Makin say, the only way these schools can survive is by putting up their fees; therefore, parents who are in some of the most vulnerable areas, in some of the poorest areas, of our suburbs will be paying more for school fees. Maybe I should let that sink in.


There is another school in my electorate, the School for Vision Impaired, which does some magnificent work assisting children with vision impairment. It's getting a cut of $24,000. That lot on the other side may think that $24,000 is not a lot, but for a family and a child trying to deal with vision impairment, this could be the difference between receiving and not receiving the latest Braille books or an iPad to help them learn in already difficult circumstances. That shows how low this government will go.


Henley High School in my electorate is suffering a cut of $1.2 million—the largest cut faced by a school in the electorate of Hindmarsh, and the seventh-largest cut of 511 schools in South Australia. Henley are doing some great work with STEM. They do intense learning in STEM subjects, in science, technology et cetera, and all of that will be affected by these cuts.


Cowandilla Primary School, which I'm very proud to say is my old primary school, will have $403,000 cut from it. It's a great school. We visited there recently with the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Bill Shorten. We looked at their STEM program, and some of the great work they're doing with young students. This is a school that has had, for many years, a great tradition of working with new arrivals—from kids that had come straight off the boat in the sixties, right through to today. This cut will have a massive effect on a school that needs every single cent to help it cope with students that have difficulties with learning and with many other things. (Time expired)

"Gee, Andrew, MP",Nats,2018-02-07,"



Mr GEE
 (Calare) (16:24):  Well, wherever Nick Xenophon is this afternoon, he must be pretty chuffed and smiling, knowing that he has you people opposite so spooked about what's going on in South Australia that you've had to devote such a large part of the parliamentary day to trying to bash him up. How embarrassing is it that you could come in here and do that in our national parliament! But hypocrisy and those opposite really go hand in hand.


Those opposite have a very poor record of delivering on educational reform. Who could forget the glory days of Building the Education Revolution, for example? Remember that corker? Oh, yes. They were big on talk, but the delivery was absolutely appalling, with school halls that weren't fit for the schools that they were implemented in, overinflated prices, and building work that should have been carried out by local builders that wasn't—it was all done by out-of-town people. So, whilst they all talk a good game, in practice, the delivery always falls apart—and so it was with the Gonski reforms.


Let's have a little bit of a walk through the history pages about Gonski and how it came into being. We've had to clean up another Labor Party mess. We all know that, back in the days of Julia Gillard, when she was trying to get those states signed up, she was writing cheques that she knew she would never have to cash. She was out to save her political skin. And everyone was out there saying, 'Come in, spinner; we'll take your cheques!' But none of it was ever funded, which was very unfortunate. She was so desperate to do deals, she was stitching them up left, right and centre. She did 27 separate deals.


But the worst part of it, to my way of thinking, was that the broken system which the Gillard government implemented wasn't fair. It wasn't fair, because it valued disadvantaged students in different states differently. It didn't treat all Australians the same way. A child in one state who was suffering disadvantage was worth less to the government in terms of spending than a child suffering the same disadvantage in another state. So they, the champions of equity and equality, totally distorted and corrupted the needs based funding system. We in country Australia like it, because country schools are the biggest winners. But none of it was ever funded. It was Monopoly money. It was bouncy, rubbery cheques.


So the coalition government have had to step in, as we always do—we do it every time—to clean up the economic mess that the opposition created, with $23.5 billion in new funding over the next 10 years. It's not pie-in-the-sky stuff; the funding is kicked in straightaway and everyone's a winner, because it's properly funded and you know you're going to get your money. Over the next 10 years, recurrent funding for South Australia will total $16.7 billion and, over the next 10 years, recurrent funding per student for South Australia will grow, on average, by 4.6 per cent each year. That's real money. That's real increases in all of these schools. In my electorate, it's funding increases for every school in our electorate. Needs based funding is important. It's something that we can all get behind, and I support it. But I also support having it fully funded—not just writing cheques that a government knows it will never have to cash.


The great thing about these new reforms is they're backed by David Gonski himself. People call it Gonski 2.0. I call it 'the real Gonski', because it's real money and real funding. And it's going to flow through to all of our students, particularly in country Australia. We've got some of the most disadvantaged schools in the nation in our rural seats. Over the next decade, there's going to be an estimated $58.5 billion in Commonwealth recurrent funding for regional, rural and remote schools. Of this, an estimated $5.8 billion is provided through the location loading over this period. So you're looking at 750,000 country students benefiting from this—and it's real money and it's money that's locked in.


And it's not just rural schools; so many other schools right around Australia are benefiting from these funding reforms. For example, over the next 10 years, Commonwealth recurrent funding per student for New South Wales will grow, on average, by 4.1 per cent every year. The funding increases are real. If you look at some of the schools in my electorate you see, for example, that Canobolas Rural Technology High School is getting a funding increase over the next decade of over 50 per cent—an increase of over 50 per cent for a school that does marvellous work.

Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh) (16:29):  I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Kiribati and the Kingdom of Tonga from 25 June to 2 July 2017, and I ask leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report. 


Leave granted. 




Mr GEORGANAS:
  As I said, this was a delegation to the island of Kiribati and the Kingdom of Tonga on 25 June to 2 July 2017. The leader of the delegation was Senator Ian Macdonald. The rest of the delegation consisted of Mr Milton Dick MP, the member for Oxley; me; Senator John Williams, the senator for New South Wales; and our delegation secretary, Gerry McNally, whom I would like to thank on behalf of the committee for all his hard work in ensuring that we got to places on time and that we were organised with papers et cetera. 


This was a trip to one of the most remote islands in the world, Kiribati. The report that I have tabled will outline the key activities and observations of the delegation's visit to Kiribati and our visit to the Kingdom of Tonga, which was a few days after we went to Kiribati. We looked at many things such as stronger partnerships on economic growth and security in the region and stronger relationships between people. 


The program was intended to look at how we could assist and what we are doing to assist some of our closest neighbours. We had meetings with fisheries in Kiribati. We discussed marine security and training, tourism, culture and health. We attended family violence centres, where Australian NGOs were working. It was interesting to see the work that Australian volunteers do in these places, which is absolutely crucial to these nations. It was wonderful to see the volunteers contributing on the ground. We had one-on-one meetings in Tonga with some of our Australian aid workers, who told us about the wonderful projects there and how Australian foreign aid is assisting the nation to build itself to ensure that it becomes economically viable. 


It was also interesting to notice the connections that many people in Kiribati and in Tonga have to Australia through relatives, people-to-people contacts and the different agencies. One of the things that were highlighted in this delegation trip was the absolute necessity of the work that we do. We also saw how climate change is having a real effect there. It is affecting Kiribati today, as we speak, with rising seas. They've had to build seawalls. After a few years, those seawalls are gone and they have to build more seawalls. It was interesting to see that people were already being evacuated from Kiribati to Fiji because of climate change. One of the things that I took away from this delegation was the absolute necessity of Australian foreign aid to some of our closest neighbours. If we want a stable region, this aid is very important and should continue.

Mr DICK
 (Oxley) (19:30):  Adequate, safe and secure housing is critical to every facet of life for every Australian, but for many of our First Australians, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders living in remote communities, housing is anything but adequate, safe or secure. Next Monday the Prime Minister will stand up to deliver his annual response to the Closing the gap report. There is one thing that he absolutely must acknowledge: if you want to improve employment outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, if you want to improve educational outcomes, if you want to improve health, child safety and social outcomes, people need somewhere adequate, safe and secure to live.


For the past 10 years, the Commonwealth government has worked in partnership with state governments to build houses in these remote communities, many of which are in my home state of Queensland. The National Partnership on Remote Housing has been a remarkably successful program which includes among its many achievements reducing overcrowding in Queensland's remote communities by half. This is not simply a housing program. It is a skills, training and employment program, and it's a program that works.


Since the program's commencement in 2008, Queensland has delivered 1,150 new homes and delivered 2,640 jobs, and more than 80 per cent of those jobs are performed by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander workers. Right now, in remote communities in Queensland, there are 515 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people employed in housing construction through the national partnership. Ninety-six of these workers are trade apprentices who are learning skills that will take them into long-term careers as builders, electricians and plumbers. This is exactly the sort of outcome we need to close the gap. In fact, this is exactly the kind of outcome we need to lift people out of welfare across the board. The difference this program has made in these communities is concrete, tangible and measurable.


Earlier today in Canberra, it was a pleasure to meet with several of the delegates and mayors of these communities who have been here this week to speak to the government, members of the opposition and the crossbench, not just to impress upon them the importance of continuing this program but also to set the record straight—because the record needs to be set straight.


Yesterday during question time, the Minister for Indigenous Health stood up in this parliament and said the states would have to commit to an equal partnership with the Commonwealth and put money on the table. Well, Queensland has put money on the table and will continue to put money on the table because, unlike the Prime Minister, the Queensland state government is not walking away from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders living in remote communities.


The truth is that the National Partnership on Remote Housing does not require a capital contribution from the states. However, over the past 10 years, the Queensland government has gone above this and contributed more than $650 million towards remote Indigenous housing, including in the communities of Cherbourg and Yarrabah, which the Commonwealth refuses to include in the partnership agreement. Of the 1,150 homes built in Queensland, 199 have been built with Queensland money. Queensland has committed to the ongoing maintenance, upgrade and depreciation costs of these homes, along with the training costs associated with the training of the apprentices who actually build these homes.


There is a young man visiting us in Canberra today, His name is Lenny. He's 23 years old, and he lives with his mother and grandmother in the remote community of Hope Vale, in Far North Queensland, almost 3,000 kilometres from where we sit today. Through the national partnership agreement, Lenny became an apprentice, building homes in his own community. Lenny finished his apprenticeship just a few weeks ago. He's now a fully qualified carpenter earning a steady wage building homes in Hope Vale. His mother currently has a job in Cooktown, but that job will finish up soon, meaning that Lenny will be the sole breadwinner for his family. If the Prime Minister continues with his plan to cut the National Partnership on Remote Housing, Lenny, like many other Indigenous Australians, will be out of a job.


The Commonwealth government commissioned a review into the National Partnership on Remote Housing, which was released in December last year—not by any state government but by the Commonwealth government. That report clearly outlines that Queensland has met and exceeded set benchmarks and recommends continuing the partnership to further progress closing the gap. It even says that housing should be measured as a Closing the Gap benchmark. And what have we heard about the report from those opposite? Nothing.


I say this to the Prime Minister: on Monday, do not come in here and deliver a Closing the gap speech wanting a pat on the back. If the LNP and the coalition government are serious about closing the gap, the Prime Minister and this government cannot walk away from basic human rights like access to safe and secure housing.

Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston) (10:00):  I rise today to acknowledge and thank all of those who donated to my recent Christmas appeal. For many of us, Christmas is a very joyful time of the year—a time spent with family, catching up with friends, giving and receiving presents and eating a little bit too much food. But it is important to remember that, for those Australians who can't put food on the table or presents under the tree, Christmas is an incredibly difficult time.


Each year at Christmas I partner with local charities to try to make the festive season a little bit easier for those in our community who are struggling. My office acts as a drop-off point for donations of toys, gifts, food, toiletries and animal food. The generosity of our community truly reached new heights for this Christmas appeal. We estimate that around $20,000 worth of goods were donated by the southern Adelaide community. We were able to make multiple donations to local charities. It is amazing to think how many families would have benefited from these donations. I'd like to sincerely thank and acknowledge every person who brought in a donation. Thank you for your kindness, selflessness and generosity.


There were so many heart-warming stories during our appeal. One woman, who would like to remain nameless, spent months knitting 22 beautiful dolls for children. Another man handmade a number of wooden trucks that were just superb. The Askell-Wilson family brought in three brand-new bicycles. Imagine how happy they would've made the children on Christmas morning who had very little.


Two of our local schools organised hundreds of donations from students and families: the Seaford K-7 School, and the children's council at Southern Montessori School, led by students Hope, Flynn and Cooper. Goodstart Early Learning Sheidow Park and Goodstart Early Learning Seaford set up Christmas trees in their foyers and asked for donations from families. By the time I collected the donations, there were hundreds of brand-new toys spilling out from under the trees.


So thank you to all those organisations, community groups, businesses and individuals who donated. I would like to acknowledge Onkaparinga youth Base 10, Noarlunga SES, Christies Beach Chiropractic Centre, Woodend Children's Centre, the Ahmadiyya Muslim Women's Association, Karate-Do Goju Australia at Christie Downs, Southern Districts Midweek Ladies Tennis Club, Hallett Cove Lions Club, Morphett Vale Tennis Club and the 50-plus activity club. These were just some of the organisations which, along with individuals, made a huge contribution.


I would also like to thank the local charities I partnered with for the amazing work they do: Junction Australia Christies Beach, AnglicareSA Beach Road, The Vines Uniting Church, Vinnies SA Noarlunga conference, Salvation Army Noarlunga and the RSPCA South Australia. They work all year round to make the lives of others better. (Time expired)

Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (10:31):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Measures No. 1) Bill 2017, as one member has previously done, and I'll talk about a couple of his quotes in a minute. The Treasurer announced in last year's budget that the Turnbull government would deliver a financial system that is stronger and safer, a system with consumer oriented outcomes and with healthy competition. Yesterday the member for McMahon, the shadow Treasurer, spoke in the main chamber on this. He said that the Labor Party will be supporting this legislation. He said this is a substantial piece of legislation. We welcome the Labor Party's support. We think it's a great piece of legislation. It's part of our total system to deliver better outcomes for consumers. But he did go on to say in his speech:


On bills like this, the government always seems to have talking points—and perhaps the next honourable member to speak might go there—which say that the previous Labor government did nothing. That's often what's in the talking points.


He was referring to me, as I was in the chamber. He also suggested that I might raise it and be tempted to run the 'fallacious argument' in the chamber that the Labor government did nothing. I assure the member for McMahon that I won't run the fallacious argument that Labor did nothing. He raised it, so I will leave it in his corner. He was the one who said that the Labor government did nothing. 


Anyway, we will move on to the bill and go from there. This government was elected on a mandate to ensure the government implements the right measures for a stronger economy that benefits hardworking Australians. This government has made significant changes through the banking package measures introduced last year to ensure the financial sector is protected and to ensure that there is public trust in the stability of our financial system. This government has addressed key shortcomings that have been witnessed internationally through the global financial crisis, and it has legislated to ensure such events are limited in their capacity to damage the strength of our financial system and framework. No economy or financial system can be shielded from all risk. However, the work that this government has done will cement further protections to ensure unnecessary risk does not damage our system. 


The Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Measures No. 1) Bill 2017 continues the work that this government has done to strengthen our financial system. I applaud the Treasurer and the Prime Minister for their hard work in ensuring we have a financial system not only that is strong but where our legislation has adapted to the evolving and always-moving nature of the sector. This bill helps to ensure that APRA can mitigate risks in the non-ADI sector, which in recent years has internationally caused significant crisis in the financial markets when left unchecked, and to codify APRA's powers as a regulator.


The government announced in the 2017-18 budget that they would act to ensure that the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority is able to respond flexibly to financial and housing market developments that pose a risk to financial stability by providing APRA with new powers in respect of the provision of credit by entities that are not authorised deposit-taking institutions, which are known as non-ADI lenders, to complement APRA's existing powers in respect of ADIs. Under schedule 1 of the bill, APRA will gain a new reserve power to make rules surrounding the activities of non-bank lenders, who are referred to as non-ADI lenders. 


As a result of the actions taken by APRA, through the use of macro prudential controls, the activity of ADIs is leading to increased lending activity in the sector by non-ADI lenders. As the Treasurer has stated, these powers are purely a reserve power and not a power of continuous regulation. I will talk further on this later in my speech, as it heavily relates to schedule 2 of this bill. Schedule 2 of the bill will give powers to APRA to collect data from non-ADI lenders. This power will allow APRA to monitor the non-ADI sector. The government is of the view that non-ADI lenders are currently not contributing to any financial stability risks in our financial system, but this potential growth in lending by this sector has highlighted an area in which regulators cannot stem any financial stability risks that do appear in the sector.


The intent of this bill is not to put new regulation on non-ADI lenders when the financial sector is growing. The Treasurer highlighted in his speech on the bill that non-ADI lenders help contribute to the competition that is necessary in the lending market and do not rely on the funding sources that come from Australian depositors. It is therefore deemed appropriate to not consistently subject them to prudential supervision by APRA, given that they have no Australian depositors to protect. However, as recent financial history on the global stage has shown us, the non-ADI lending sector is not free from risks that will potentially damage the stability of the financial system. It was seen in other nations where these risks were left to play out. The costs ended up ultimately being borne by the wider community. These powers are to ensure that APRA curtails these risks should they ever arise from this sector. This is just a reserve power that gives APRA another tool in its toolbox to ensure that our financial system is stronger. It will further strengthen the non-ADI sector by signalling to top investors that the sector is stable and regulated when necessary.


The Treasurer has stated many times in the main chamber and outside the chamber that there needs to be a more delicate approach to financial stability risks. These powers give APRA the ability to effectively mitigate risks of our financial system that are particular to the non-ADI lending sector. I stated earlier that this bill is to bring our financial sector into the 21st century, and schedule 3 is one of the most apt points for the need for this bill. Currently, under the Banking Act 1953, ADIs that have capital below $50 million are unable to use the term 'bank'. Schedule 3 of this legislation will remove this frankly outdated regulation, thus allowing all banking businesses that hold an ADI licence to have access to the term 'bank'. At the moment this sets up a cycle whereby new entrants are unable to reach $50 million in capital without using the word 'bank' but are unable to grow without calling themselves a bank. This simple change will further encourage competition to continue in the sector by putting all banking businesses with an ADI licence on the same footing by allowing full use of the term 'bank'. Schedule 3 will ensure that 58 additional ADIs will now be able to use the term 'bank' when describing themselves. As all ADIs are licensed and regulated by APRA and that all depositors and ADIs are guaranteed by the financial claims FCS, it is common sense to allow all ADIs to be considered of equal stature by the community. This schedule does not change any of APRA's prudential regulation, ensuring that the community can continue to have confidence in the safety of their money and the safety of the banking sector.


As the legislation currently stands, the Banking Act does not contain an objects provision. This provision lays out the purpose and the objectives of the act. Schedule 4 of this bill will insert an objects provision into the current Banking Act, which will allow for APRA's roles and responsibilities to be clearly set out and defined. Another part of schedule 4 is to incorporate a reference in the objects provision to the importance of APRA using geographic and sectoral considerations where appropriate. This is a commonsense change, as seen with the significant diversity of our country's markets. APRA already has this power to set prudential measures on geographic or sectoral lanes. However, the government wanted to ensure that there'd be no doubt as to these capabilities that APRA holds.


Codifying APRA's ability to use geographic and sectoral regulations on our financial sectors will ensure that what the Treasurer aptly described as 'a scalpel rather than a chainsaw' is used in managing stability risks that may appear in our nation. The 'objects' provision in the Banking Act will also reflect recent changes this government has made with the introduction of our banking package measures, BEAR, crisis management and the non-ADI lender rules. This is a simple modernisation to ensure our legislation is current and reflective of the changes in the system. It is not just for this legislation but similar changes are being made to the Insurance Act 1973 and the Life Insurance Act 1995 to ensure these acts reflect where we are at. 


Schedule 5 amends the National Consumer Protection Act 2009 to implement changes that are fairer for consumers and businesses alike in the credit card market. As a result, competition amongst credit card providers will improve, as will consumer outcomes in the marketplace. At the moment, the credit card market is characterised as having inadequate competition in ongoing interest rates by providers and some consumers who are overborrowing from providers and underrepaying loans. In particular, there is a small group of consumers who frequently incur very high interest rates due to the ill-suited provision of credit cards. This can result in severe financial hardship for those who should not have received a credit card to begin with. Presently credit card providers are only required to determine whether a consumer can meet the minimum repayments when assessing if a consumer can afford a credit limit. This obviously does not take into account those who can meet the minimum repayments but cannot afford repayments significantly higher than the minimum repayment. This can create the aforementioned group of consumers who are ill suited to the provision of credit cards. Furthermore, these consumers can also face hefty barriers when attempting to switch credit cards, which further acts to reduce competition in the marketplace and makes some consumers feel as though they are trapped. In addition, the formulas used in the calculation of the credit card interest rates can be overly complex, confusing and not in line with consumer and community expectations. 


Schedule 5 addresses these problematic concerns by implementing significant reforms, including the tightening of responsible lending obligations and requirements to ensure and enshrine in law that credit card providers must assess whether a consumer can repay the full credit limit within a reasonable period of time, as determined by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. I have been the chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services since the coalition government was returned in 2016, and that particular committee has oversight of ASIC. I'll be questioning ASIC on Friday about these changes to make sure they implement them. This schedule will also prohibit all unsolicited credit limit increase invitations, including in circumstances where a consumer has previously opted in to receive the invitations. 


As I have already stated, the formulas used in the calculation of credit card interest rates can be overly complex and confusing. I am pleased that the calculation of interest rates will be simplified and practices such as the backdating of interest will be banned. The ability for consumers to cancel their credit card or lower their credit limit will now also be far easier. Instead of having to visit a physical office to carry out these tasks, we are mandating that credit card providers will have to provide online options for consumers to manage the way they use their credit cards and determine their credit limit. Consumers will benefit tremendously from these reforms, which will reduce the incidence of consumers building up excessive credit card debt and will ensure the calculation of credit card interest rates reflects the expectations the consumer and the community have. 


Furthermore, as articulated in my final point about the work schedule 5 will do, consumers will benefit from the ability to manage their credit cards through online options to lower their credit limit or request the cancellation of their card without the rigmarole of having to deal with a provider for an extended period for what is a simple process. Credit card providers are now required to comply with the prohibition of credit card limit increase invitations and have had to do so since 1 January this year. Credit card providers must comply with the other reforms by 1 January 2019. 


I'm confident these measures contained in this bill will ensure a more accountable banking system, a banking system which is strong and fair and one which hardworking Australians can rely upon. Again, I appreciate the support of those on the opposite side and look forward to hearing the member for Kingsford Smith's speech. Without further ado, I commend the bill to the House.

"Thistlethwaite, Matt, MP",ALP,2018-02-07,"



Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (10:44):  We do support this bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Measures No. 1) Bill 2017. It is a bill that amends APRA's jurisdiction and its powers to make rules with respect to non-ADI lenders, particularly to secure stability and reduce risk in the lending market in Australia. 


The importance of financial stability cannot be overestimated. It's critically important to the maintenance of strong economic growth and to the livelihoods and prosperity of all Australians. We saw, in the wake of the global financial crisis, that we did have a stable banking system, with relatively tight lending standards and rules against predatory lending, and Australia and the Australian economy weren't affected as badly as other Western economies. That has a lot to do with the stability of our banking system and the role of organisations like APRA in maintaining that stability.


Consistent with its mandate to promote financial stability, APRA has taken actions to reinforce sound residential mortgage lending practices by authorised deposit-taking institutions. We've seen that some of these actions, particularly around interest-only loans and the amount of capital that ADI lenders have to carry in their loan books, have produced some changes in lending practices throughout Australia. Under the Banking Act, a body corporate that wishes to carry on a banking business in Australia may only do so if APRA has granted an authority to the body corporate for the purposes of carrying on that business. Once authorised by APRA, the body corporate is an ADI and is subject to APRA's prudential requirements and ongoing supervision.


However, there currently exists a regulatory gap where APRA has no ability to manage the financial stability risks that might arise from lending activities of entities that are non-ADIs. Increasingly, we're seeing many Australians turn to many of these organisations through mortgage brokers to access finance, particularly housing finance, in what's been a tight lending market in recent years. The gap potentially undermines the ability of APRA to promote financial stability, as lending practices that APRA has curtailed or prohibited for ADIs may continue to be pursued by non-ADI lenders. The Banking Act will be amended by the passage of this bill to provide APRA with powers to make rules for non-ADI lenders where there is a material risk to the stability of the Australian financial system. These are intended to be reserve powers. APRA will also be able to roll out and to collect data from these entities for the purposes of monitoring risks in the non-ADI lending sector so as to determine when to use these new powers. These rules close a gap which has occurred and exist when APRA restricts the lending activities of ADIs but is unable to affect the activities and the lending practices of non-ADI institutions.


These new powers are proposed in recognition of the fact that APRA does have responsibilities in relation to the stability of the Australian financial system. It's vital for these institutions that they are well resourced to do everything they can to maintain stability in our system, particularly when the government appears to be doing its best to undermine it.


Labor's shadow Treasurer, Chris Bowen, has been working to highlight areas of our economy where there are unacceptable risks. One such area is in household debt, particularly in household debt related to housing in Australia. We've seen over the recent decade astronomical price increases in the cost of housing, particularly in the Sydney and Melbourne markets. Australians' levels of debt is now 100 per cent higher than the total earnings of all households. Australia has the most generous property tax concessions in the world when it comes particularly to investing in housing. I'm speaking here, of course, of our negative gearing regime, the ability to deduct interest payments on an investment loan for an investment property, and the capital gains tax discount that was introduced by the Howard government—the 50 per cent discount on capital gains tax being paid on the sale of an investment property. When these two reforms were introduced by the Howard government, importantly, in the budgetary context, they weren't funded. In other words, there was no revenue source that offset the reduction in revenue that came about from this additional expenditure associated with these tax concessions. Now that we've got a growing budget deficit—it's almost tripled under this government—we're seeing the folly of those decisions coming home to be borne upon this generation of Australians, because there was no funding source put in place to introduce those very generous tax concessions into the budgetary process. Therefore, it's hardly a surprise that we have one of the highest household leverage rates in the world.


For almost two years, the Labor Party has been calling on the government to bring attention to the risks associated with such high household debt. The Reserve Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Grattan Institute and the government's Financial Systems Inquiry have argued forcefully that tax concessions, such as negative gearing, distort economic decision-making and encourage leverage in the economy. The overwhelming evidence is that those who benefit from those tax concessions are the wealthiest Australians. I think it was confirmed in the newspapers most recently that the top 10 per cent of income earners in this country benefit from 80 per cent of the capital gains tax discount. So, 80 per cent of the capital gains tax discount benefits go to the top 10 per cent of income earners in Australia.


It's a similar figure when it comes to the benefits of negative gearing. It really is the wealthiest Australians who are benefiting from these tax concessions, and the average homeowner, in particular, the average first home owner, bears the cost of that. They are the ones who are paying for the wealthiest Australians to get a tax discount on the sale of investment properties and a tax deduction for the interest payments on loans associated with those investment properties. Those deductions are even available if they're bought within a self-managed super fund as an investment vehicle. This has led to the situation where first home buyers simply can't get into the market. They turn up to auctions on a Saturday, and they're priced out of the market by people who may be negatively gearing their seventh or eighth investment property. The person negatively gearing that property gets more support from the government than the first home buyer to buy their first home. That's simply unacceptable. It's unfair, and it's generating an imbalance in the operation of the housing market and in our lending practices. It's our view that the government must listen to the experts and deal with the tax concessions, such as negative gearing, that are encouraging higher and higher levels of debt and threatening the stability of our financial system.


Schedule 3 of this bill will allow smaller ADIs to use the word bank in their business name. The changes will align community expectations in respect of the use of the word bank with the fact that ADIs are now prudentially supervised by APRA and deposits are covered by the Financial Claims Scheme guarantee.


Schedule 5 of the bill amends the credit act to introduce a number of reforms to improve consumer outcomes under credit card contracts. These reforms include tightening responsible lending obligations, prohibiting credit card providers from offering unsolicited credit limit increases, simplifying the calculation of interest charges and requiring credit card contracts to allow consumers to reduce credit card limits and terminate credit card contracts, including by online means. We all know how difficult it is to cancel a credit card online. In fact, it's virtually impossible. These reforms will make it easier for consumers to do that. The purpose of these amendments is to reduce the likelihood of consumers being granted excessive credit limits, align the way interest is charged with consumers' reasonable expectations and make it easier for consumers to terminate a credit card or reduce a credit limit.


In response to the 2015 Labor-led Senate inquiry, the Treasurer promised to progress changes to credit card laws in May 2016. Unfortunately, the Treasurer appeared to forget about this promise, and it took Labor politically and publicly pushing for these reforms to force them to reannounce the measures in the 2017 budget. Nevertheless, we welcome these measures, which will improve consumer protections in relation to credit cards. They are long overdue, and it's disappointing that consumers will have to wait until 2019 to get most of these new protections in place. I pity those who have been in the debt spiral and in the situation where they couldn't get out of some of these credit contracts in the meantime. Nonetheless, Labor does support this bill and the changes it makes, particularly to the rules around non-ADI lenders and bringing them under the gambit of APRA's supervisory jurisdiction when it comes to prudential regulations and ensuring stability in our lending practices, the lending market and, indeed, the changes to credit contracts, particularly making it easier for people to get out of credit cards that they are getting into a bad situation with. I commend this bill to the chamber.

Mr HAMMOND
 (Perth) (10:55):  It is a pleasure to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Measures No. 1) Bill 2017, and I will keep my comments relatively brief. I'd like to focus on the part of the bill that seeks to improve consumer protections for banking customers and credit card holders. A government bill, purporting to strengthen consumer protections for financial services for consumers, is, indeed, very welcome, although, I have to confess, a little surprising. I regret if that sounds jaded or cynical but, in my brief time in this place, I haven't seen much evidence of them really putting the rubber to the road and caring terribly much in this area before.


Let's have a look at the time line in relation to that. Firstly, we had a Senate inquiry into credit cards in 2015, which the government finally responded to in May 2016 with a commitment to progress changes to credit card reforms. In May 2016, the government then promised to bring forward draft legislation 'in the near term', although the near term in this case took until August 2017, more than 12 months. Actually, let's go to the nearest number rounding up: it was more than a year and a half after they said they would that we actually saw the ink dry on the draft legislation, and almost three years after the Senate inquiry referral. Let's put this into context, almost three years after the initial referral—we know that many of the consumer protections that are spoken about in this bill won't come into force until 2019.


I was reflecting today that this has an eerily familiar ring to it, in relation to a glacier-like level of progress, insofar as consumer protections actually go. One doesn't need to look any further than the proposed or attempted reforms, in relation to the small amount credit contracts, to see evidence of a snail's pace approach to actually getting something meaningful done to ensure that vulnerable consumers are protected. It's a very similar time line.


The small amount credit reforms or reviews, commonly known as the SACC reforms, are more frequently known in lay terms as payday lenders or rent-to-buy scheme reforms. Whilst building upon the very good work of a former Labor government, there were still, clearly, further improvements that needed to be made as a result of an industry which is fundamentally at risk of not nearly enough regulation in order to protect vulnerable consumers. To their credit, in 2015, the federal government announced a review into the small amount credit contract industry to report back to the government in March 2016, which it did. It was then another six months before—in November 2016—the government came out with its responses in relation to the small amount credit contract review. Its responses were very measured, practical and reasonable. Credit where credit is due, pardon the pun. It just so happened that the government was very content with the recommendations that were contained within the small amount credit contract review.


The reforms went to two things. What we know in relation to payday loans is that, in the financial year 2015-16, over 650,000 people in this country were given payday loans when they could barely afford them. Over two in five of those who were in receipt of payday loans or rent-to-buy schemes were also on the welfare system. There is no doubt that the worst excesses of the onerous interest-free payments and the never-ending story in relation to repayments were hurting those who could ill afford it.


The reforms suggested in the SACC review were to put a cap on the amount that could be taken out of a pay packet or a welfare cheque at any one time and put another cap on the amount they could actually borrow to make sure that these weren't some sort of tragic, never-ending stories resulting in an inevitable debt spiral. They are very sensible, measured and pragmatic approaches to reform to protect vulnerable Australians. You might ask, 'What happened then?' If it sounds too good to be true, it normally is, and this was no exception. Quite frankly, what we saw from November 2016 until almost the present day was a big, fat nothing from this government in relation to progressing these reforms. The reforms had the approval, in principle, of the advocacy groups. The reforms weren't excessive and they represented a reasonable compromise in relation to the various interests of the various stakeholders in this area.


It was left sitting on the desk of the Minister for Revenue  and Financial Services for many, many months—around 12 months. There were some very concerning public comments made by her where she said that draft legislation was being prepared, only to be found out by Senator Gallagher, in the other place. According to the department, not a single word had been committed to any draft legislation throughout the course of 2016 and early 2017. What we finally saw in October 2017, under the then Minister for Small Business, Minister McCormack, was some proposed legislation. Again, the proposed legislation was measured. It was put out for consultation with a commitment that it would be introduced before the end of the year. That was not done and we still see, as every day goes by, vulnerable consumers being left in limbo as a result of being trapped in rent-to-buy schemes which have no ending or payday loans which they can ill afford. We see situations where consumers have entered into a contract to buy a fridge for the cost of $350 to keep the household running, only for it to cost them, in a rent-to-buy scheme, over $3,500, repaid over the course of many months, if not years. What we really see are vulnerable consumers being charged up to 800 per cent of the cost of a good in order to pay it off over time.


Just like the SACC reforms—and there'll be more said about those at a different time and in a different place—these consumer protection improvements for credit card holders are also important. Schedule 5 makes changes to credit card laws to improve consumer protections. The changes include tightening responsible lending obligations, prohibiting credit card providers from offering unsolicited credit limit increases, simplifying the calculation of interest charges and requiring credit card contracts to allow consumers to reduce credit limits and terminate credit card contracts, including by online means. I must say that, if anyone has actually attempted to go through the process of cancelling a credit card, I think they would agree—and, boy, do we need instances where we can all agree on something in this place these days—that it is a thousand times harder to cancel a credit card than it is to get one. The hoops that are required to be jumped through at the moment to simply cancel a credit card and not take up another offer really are, in our view, unreasonably burdensome. I'm pleased to say that the changes in this bill do allow consumers a much easier path to make sure that their attempts to break free from the shackle of credit leading into a debt spiral are actually rewarded.


Schedules 1 and 2 of the bill will give APRA the ability to respond to future developments in non-ADI lending, should they pose a risk to financial stability. To protect deposit takers, APRA currently regulates lenders that take in deposits, and this bill gives APRA powers to act in relation to other lenders, should practices or the size on the non-ADI lending sector pose a risk to financial stability in the future. It is important that APRA have appropriate powers to ensure that the stability of the financial system is maintained. We acknowledge the important role that non-bank lenders can also play in terms of competition, including in relation to lending to small businesses, provided those non-bank lenders are subject to appropriate regulatory restraint in order to ensure that those vulnerable businesses and consumers are not otherwise at risk of falling prey to predatory lending practices.


In relation to the credit card reforms and in response to a 2015 Labor-led Senate inquiry, the Treasurer promised in May 2016 to progress changes to credit card laws. Unfortunately, the Treasurer appeared, clearly, to forget about this promise, and it took Labor publicly pushing for these reforms to force him to re-announce the measures in the 2017 budget. We welcome the measures, which will improve consumer protections in relation to credit cards. They are clearly long overdue, and it is disappointing that consumers will have to wait even longer, until 2019, for most of these protections to come into play. What we really see—and what underpins all of the conversations in relation to the banking sector, and what we saw again as recently as today with the release of the draft report of the Productivity Commission in relation to the banking sector—is that it is completely clear that, if we form the view that the best type of disinfectant is a ray of sunshine, what we need more than ever is a robust and effective royal commission in relation to the banking sector.


In order to take the opportunity to focus on the positive parts of 2017, as opposed to those parts where we had our battlelines drawn, let's be frank. A positive part of 2017 was seeing that a royal commission into the banking sector was now up and running. Now, we can have a very robust and heated—and appropriately robust and heated—debate about the terms of reference, in relation to how wide we can cast the net to examine the practices of the banking sector and industry and the practices of the lending sector and industry. It's also an appropriate time to echo the needs of those smaller lenders who provide small amounts of credit to make sure that they are also captured by this commission of inquiry. So it is a good start.


But, quite frankly, two things remain to be seen. Firstly, one can't help but wonder, given the clear, public statements made by this Prime Minister disregarding the need for a royal commission before deciding that political expediency justified actually setting one up, whether it is going to do what it ought to do and what it has the potential to do. That's the first thing. Secondly, we need to make sure it happens as quickly as possible and that all consumers get a chance to put their case to the royal commission. The rubber looks likely to hit the road in 2018. We should be optimistic that progress will be made in relation to protecting consumers in the finance and credit sectors. There is no doubt that, while this is taking much longer than it should, it is nevertheless a good start.

"Irons, Steve, MP",LP,2018-02-07,"



Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (10:31):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Measures No. 1) Bill 2017, as one member has previously done, and I'll talk about a couple of his quotes in a minute. The Treasurer announced in last year's budget that the Turnbull government would deliver a financial system that is stronger and safer, a system with consumer oriented outcomes and with healthy competition. Yesterday the member for McMahon, the shadow Treasurer, spoke in the main chamber on this. He said that the Labor Party will be supporting this legislation. He said this is a substantial piece of legislation. We welcome the Labor Party's support. We think it's a great piece of legislation. It's part of our total system to deliver better outcomes for consumers. But he did go on to say in his speech:


On bills like this, the government always seems to have talking points—and perhaps the next honourable member to speak might go there—which say that the previous Labor government did nothing. That's often what's in the talking points.


He was referring to me, as I was in the chamber. He also suggested that I might raise it and be tempted to run the 'fallacious argument' in the chamber that the Labor government did nothing. I assure the member for McMahon that I won't run the fallacious argument that Labor did nothing. He raised it, so I will leave it in his corner. He was the one who said that the Labor government did nothing. 


Anyway, we will move on to the bill and go from there. This government was elected on a mandate to ensure the government implements the right measures for a stronger economy that benefits hardworking Australians. This government has made significant changes through the banking package measures introduced last year to ensure the financial sector is protected and to ensure that there is public trust in the stability of our financial system. This government has addressed key shortcomings that have been witnessed internationally through the global financial crisis, and it has legislated to ensure such events are limited in their capacity to damage the strength of our financial system and framework. No economy or financial system can be shielded from all risk. However, the work that this government has done will cement further protections to ensure unnecessary risk does not damage our system. 


The Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Measures No. 1) Bill 2017 continues the work that this government has done to strengthen our financial system. I applaud the Treasurer and the Prime Minister for their hard work in ensuring we have a financial system not only that is strong but where our legislation has adapted to the evolving and always-moving nature of the sector. This bill helps to ensure that APRA can mitigate risks in the non-ADI sector, which in recent years has internationally caused significant crisis in the financial markets when left unchecked, and to codify APRA's powers as a regulator.


The government announced in the 2017-18 budget that they would act to ensure that the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority is able to respond flexibly to financial and housing market developments that pose a risk to financial stability by providing APRA with new powers in respect of the provision of credit by entities that are not authorised deposit-taking institutions, which are known as non-ADI lenders, to complement APRA's existing powers in respect of ADIs. Under schedule 1 of the bill, APRA will gain a new reserve power to make rules surrounding the activities of non-bank lenders, who are referred to as non-ADI lenders. 


As a result of the actions taken by APRA, through the use of macro prudential controls, the activity of ADIs is leading to increased lending activity in the sector by non-ADI lenders. As the Treasurer has stated, these powers are purely a reserve power and not a power of continuous regulation. I will talk further on this later in my speech, as it heavily relates to schedule 2 of this bill. Schedule 2 of the bill will give powers to APRA to collect data from non-ADI lenders. This power will allow APRA to monitor the non-ADI sector. The government is of the view that non-ADI lenders are currently not contributing to any financial stability risks in our financial system, but this potential growth in lending by this sector has highlighted an area in which regulators cannot stem any financial stability risks that do appear in the sector.


The intent of this bill is not to put new regulation on non-ADI lenders when the financial sector is growing. The Treasurer highlighted in his speech on the bill that non-ADI lenders help contribute to the competition that is necessary in the lending market and do not rely on the funding sources that come from Australian depositors. It is therefore deemed appropriate to not consistently subject them to prudential supervision by APRA, given that they have no Australian depositors to protect. However, as recent financial history on the global stage has shown us, the non-ADI lending sector is not free from risks that will potentially damage the stability of the financial system. It was seen in other nations where these risks were left to play out. The costs ended up ultimately being borne by the wider community. These powers are to ensure that APRA curtails these risks should they ever arise from this sector. This is just a reserve power that gives APRA another tool in its toolbox to ensure that our financial system is stronger. It will further strengthen the non-ADI sector by signalling to top investors that the sector is stable and regulated when necessary.


The Treasurer has stated many times in the main chamber and outside the chamber that there needs to be a more delicate approach to financial stability risks. These powers give APRA the ability to effectively mitigate risks of our financial system that are particular to the non-ADI lending sector. I stated earlier that this bill is to bring our financial sector into the 21st century, and schedule 3 is one of the most apt points for the need for this bill. Currently, under the Banking Act 1953, ADIs that have capital below $50 million are unable to use the term 'bank'. Schedule 3 of this legislation will remove this frankly outdated regulation, thus allowing all banking businesses that hold an ADI licence to have access to the term 'bank'. At the moment this sets up a cycle whereby new entrants are unable to reach $50 million in capital without using the word 'bank' but are unable to grow without calling themselves a bank. This simple change will further encourage competition to continue in the sector by putting all banking businesses with an ADI licence on the same footing by allowing full use of the term 'bank'. Schedule 3 will ensure that 58 additional ADIs will now be able to use the term 'bank' when describing themselves. As all ADIs are licensed and regulated by APRA and that all depositors and ADIs are guaranteed by the financial claims FCS, it is common sense to allow all ADIs to be considered of equal stature by the community. This schedule does not change any of APRA's prudential regulation, ensuring that the community can continue to have confidence in the safety of their money and the safety of the banking sector.


As the legislation currently stands, the Banking Act does not contain an objects provision. This provision lays out the purpose and the objectives of the act. Schedule 4 of this bill will insert an objects provision into the current Banking Act, which will allow for APRA's roles and responsibilities to be clearly set out and defined. Another part of schedule 4 is to incorporate a reference in the objects provision to the importance of APRA using geographic and sectoral considerations where appropriate. This is a commonsense change, as seen with the significant diversity of our country's markets. APRA already has this power to set prudential measures on geographic or sectoral lanes. However, the government wanted to ensure that there'd be no doubt as to these capabilities that APRA holds.


Codifying APRA's ability to use geographic and sectoral regulations on our financial sectors will ensure that what the Treasurer aptly described as 'a scalpel rather than a chainsaw' is used in managing stability risks that may appear in our nation. The 'objects' provision in the Banking Act will also reflect recent changes this government has made with the introduction of our banking package measures, BEAR, crisis management and the non-ADI lender rules. This is a simple modernisation to ensure our legislation is current and reflective of the changes in the system. It is not just for this legislation but similar changes are being made to the Insurance Act 1973 and the Life Insurance Act 1995 to ensure these acts reflect where we are at. 


Schedule 5 amends the National Consumer Protection Act 2009 to implement changes that are fairer for consumers and businesses alike in the credit card market. As a result, competition amongst credit card providers will improve, as will consumer outcomes in the marketplace. At the moment, the credit card market is characterised as having inadequate competition in ongoing interest rates by providers and some consumers who are overborrowing from providers and underrepaying loans. In particular, there is a small group of consumers who frequently incur very high interest rates due to the ill-suited provision of credit cards. This can result in severe financial hardship for those who should not have received a credit card to begin with. Presently credit card providers are only required to determine whether a consumer can meet the minimum repayments when assessing if a consumer can afford a credit limit. This obviously does not take into account those who can meet the minimum repayments but cannot afford repayments significantly higher than the minimum repayment. This can create the aforementioned group of consumers who are ill suited to the provision of credit cards. Furthermore, these consumers can also face hefty barriers when attempting to switch credit cards, which further acts to reduce competition in the marketplace and makes some consumers feel as though they are trapped. In addition, the formulas used in the calculation of the credit card interest rates can be overly complex, confusing and not in line with consumer and community expectations. 


Schedule 5 addresses these problematic concerns by implementing significant reforms, including the tightening of responsible lending obligations and requirements to ensure and enshrine in law that credit card providers must assess whether a consumer can repay the full credit limit within a reasonable period of time, as determined by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. I have been the chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services since the coalition government was returned in 2016, and that particular committee has oversight of ASIC. I'll be questioning ASIC on Friday about these changes to make sure they implement them. This schedule will also prohibit all unsolicited credit limit increase invitations, including in circumstances where a consumer has previously opted in to receive the invitations. 


As I have already stated, the formulas used in the calculation of credit card interest rates can be overly complex and confusing. I am pleased that the calculation of interest rates will be simplified and practices such as the backdating of interest will be banned. The ability for consumers to cancel their credit card or lower their credit limit will now also be far easier. Instead of having to visit a physical office to carry out these tasks, we are mandating that credit card providers will have to provide online options for consumers to manage the way they use their credit cards and determine their credit limit. Consumers will benefit tremendously from these reforms, which will reduce the incidence of consumers building up excessive credit card debt and will ensure the calculation of credit card interest rates reflects the expectations the consumer and the community have. 


Furthermore, as articulated in my final point about the work schedule 5 will do, consumers will benefit from the ability to manage their credit cards through online options to lower their credit limit or request the cancellation of their card without the rigmarole of having to deal with a provider for an extended period for what is a simple process. Credit card providers are now required to comply with the prohibition of credit card limit increase invitations and have had to do so since 1 January this year. Credit card providers must comply with the other reforms by 1 January 2019. 


I'm confident these measures contained in this bill will ensure a more accountable banking system, a banking system which is strong and fair and one which hardworking Australians can rely upon. Again, I appreciate the support of those on the opposite side and look forward to hearing the member for Kingsford Smith's speech. Without further ado, I commend the bill to the House.

Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (10:44):  We do support this bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Measures No. 1) Bill 2017. It is a bill that amends APRA's jurisdiction and its powers to make rules with respect to non-ADI lenders, particularly to secure stability and reduce risk in the lending market in Australia. 


The importance of financial stability cannot be overestimated. It's critically important to the maintenance of strong economic growth and to the livelihoods and prosperity of all Australians. We saw, in the wake of the global financial crisis, that we did have a stable banking system, with relatively tight lending standards and rules against predatory lending, and Australia and the Australian economy weren't affected as badly as other Western economies. That has a lot to do with the stability of our banking system and the role of organisations like APRA in maintaining that stability.


Consistent with its mandate to promote financial stability, APRA has taken actions to reinforce sound residential mortgage lending practices by authorised deposit-taking institutions. We've seen that some of these actions, particularly around interest-only loans and the amount of capital that ADI lenders have to carry in their loan books, have produced some changes in lending practices throughout Australia. Under the Banking Act, a body corporate that wishes to carry on a banking business in Australia may only do so if APRA has granted an authority to the body corporate for the purposes of carrying on that business. Once authorised by APRA, the body corporate is an ADI and is subject to APRA's prudential requirements and ongoing supervision.


However, there currently exists a regulatory gap where APRA has no ability to manage the financial stability risks that might arise from lending activities of entities that are non-ADIs. Increasingly, we're seeing many Australians turn to many of these organisations through mortgage brokers to access finance, particularly housing finance, in what's been a tight lending market in recent years. The gap potentially undermines the ability of APRA to promote financial stability, as lending practices that APRA has curtailed or prohibited for ADIs may continue to be pursued by non-ADI lenders. The Banking Act will be amended by the passage of this bill to provide APRA with powers to make rules for non-ADI lenders where there is a material risk to the stability of the Australian financial system. These are intended to be reserve powers. APRA will also be able to roll out and to collect data from these entities for the purposes of monitoring risks in the non-ADI lending sector so as to determine when to use these new powers. These rules close a gap which has occurred and exist when APRA restricts the lending activities of ADIs but is unable to affect the activities and the lending practices of non-ADI institutions.


These new powers are proposed in recognition of the fact that APRA does have responsibilities in relation to the stability of the Australian financial system. It's vital for these institutions that they are well resourced to do everything they can to maintain stability in our system, particularly when the government appears to be doing its best to undermine it.


Labor's shadow Treasurer, Chris Bowen, has been working to highlight areas of our economy where there are unacceptable risks. One such area is in household debt, particularly in household debt related to housing in Australia. We've seen over the recent decade astronomical price increases in the cost of housing, particularly in the Sydney and Melbourne markets. Australians' levels of debt is now 100 per cent higher than the total earnings of all households. Australia has the most generous property tax concessions in the world when it comes particularly to investing in housing. I'm speaking here, of course, of our negative gearing regime, the ability to deduct interest payments on an investment loan for an investment property, and the capital gains tax discount that was introduced by the Howard government—the 50 per cent discount on capital gains tax being paid on the sale of an investment property. When these two reforms were introduced by the Howard government, importantly, in the budgetary context, they weren't funded. In other words, there was no revenue source that offset the reduction in revenue that came about from this additional expenditure associated with these tax concessions. Now that we've got a growing budget deficit—it's almost tripled under this government—we're seeing the folly of those decisions coming home to be borne upon this generation of Australians, because there was no funding source put in place to introduce those very generous tax concessions into the budgetary process. Therefore, it's hardly a surprise that we have one of the highest household leverage rates in the world.


For almost two years, the Labor Party has been calling on the government to bring attention to the risks associated with such high household debt. The Reserve Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Grattan Institute and the government's Financial Systems Inquiry have argued forcefully that tax concessions, such as negative gearing, distort economic decision-making and encourage leverage in the economy. The overwhelming evidence is that those who benefit from those tax concessions are the wealthiest Australians. I think it was confirmed in the newspapers most recently that the top 10 per cent of income earners in this country benefit from 80 per cent of the capital gains tax discount. So, 80 per cent of the capital gains tax discount benefits go to the top 10 per cent of income earners in Australia.


It's a similar figure when it comes to the benefits of negative gearing. It really is the wealthiest Australians who are benefiting from these tax concessions, and the average homeowner, in particular, the average first home owner, bears the cost of that. They are the ones who are paying for the wealthiest Australians to get a tax discount on the sale of investment properties and a tax deduction for the interest payments on loans associated with those investment properties. Those deductions are even available if they're bought within a self-managed super fund as an investment vehicle. This has led to the situation where first home buyers simply can't get into the market. They turn up to auctions on a Saturday, and they're priced out of the market by people who may be negatively gearing their seventh or eighth investment property. The person negatively gearing that property gets more support from the government than the first home buyer to buy their first home. That's simply unacceptable. It's unfair, and it's generating an imbalance in the operation of the housing market and in our lending practices. It's our view that the government must listen to the experts and deal with the tax concessions, such as negative gearing, that are encouraging higher and higher levels of debt and threatening the stability of our financial system.


Schedule 3 of this bill will allow smaller ADIs to use the word bank in their business name. The changes will align community expectations in respect of the use of the word bank with the fact that ADIs are now prudentially supervised by APRA and deposits are covered by the Financial Claims Scheme guarantee.


Schedule 5 of the bill amends the credit act to introduce a number of reforms to improve consumer outcomes under credit card contracts. These reforms include tightening responsible lending obligations, prohibiting credit card providers from offering unsolicited credit limit increases, simplifying the calculation of interest charges and requiring credit card contracts to allow consumers to reduce credit card limits and terminate credit card contracts, including by online means. We all know how difficult it is to cancel a credit card online. In fact, it's virtually impossible. These reforms will make it easier for consumers to do that. The purpose of these amendments is to reduce the likelihood of consumers being granted excessive credit limits, align the way interest is charged with consumers' reasonable expectations and make it easier for consumers to terminate a credit card or reduce a credit limit.


In response to the 2015 Labor-led Senate inquiry, the Treasurer promised to progress changes to credit card laws in May 2016. Unfortunately, the Treasurer appeared to forget about this promise, and it took Labor politically and publicly pushing for these reforms to force them to reannounce the measures in the 2017 budget. Nevertheless, we welcome these measures, which will improve consumer protections in relation to credit cards. They are long overdue, and it's disappointing that consumers will have to wait until 2019 to get most of these new protections in place. I pity those who have been in the debt spiral and in the situation where they couldn't get out of some of these credit contracts in the meantime. Nonetheless, Labor does support this bill and the changes it makes, particularly to the rules around non-ADI lenders and bringing them under the gambit of APRA's supervisory jurisdiction when it comes to prudential regulations and ensuring stability in our lending practices, the lending market and, indeed, the changes to credit contracts, particularly making it easier for people to get out of credit cards that they are getting into a bad situation with. I commend this bill to the chamber.

"Hammond, Tim, MP",ALP,2018-02-07,"



Mr HAMMOND
 (Perth) (10:55):  It is a pleasure to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Measures No. 1) Bill 2017, and I will keep my comments relatively brief. I'd like to focus on the part of the bill that seeks to improve consumer protections for banking customers and credit card holders. A government bill, purporting to strengthen consumer protections for financial services for consumers, is, indeed, very welcome, although, I have to confess, a little surprising. I regret if that sounds jaded or cynical but, in my brief time in this place, I haven't seen much evidence of them really putting the rubber to the road and caring terribly much in this area before.


Let's have a look at the time line in relation to that. Firstly, we had a Senate inquiry into credit cards in 2015, which the government finally responded to in May 2016 with a commitment to progress changes to credit card reforms. In May 2016, the government then promised to bring forward draft legislation 'in the near term', although the near term in this case took until August 2017, more than 12 months. Actually, let's go to the nearest number rounding up: it was more than a year and a half after they said they would that we actually saw the ink dry on the draft legislation, and almost three years after the Senate inquiry referral. Let's put this into context, almost three years after the initial referral—we know that many of the consumer protections that are spoken about in this bill won't come into force until 2019.


I was reflecting today that this has an eerily familiar ring to it, in relation to a glacier-like level of progress, insofar as consumer protections actually go. One doesn't need to look any further than the proposed or attempted reforms, in relation to the small amount credit contracts, to see evidence of a snail's pace approach to actually getting something meaningful done to ensure that vulnerable consumers are protected. It's a very similar time line.


The small amount credit reforms or reviews, commonly known as the SACC reforms, are more frequently known in lay terms as payday lenders or rent-to-buy scheme reforms. Whilst building upon the very good work of a former Labor government, there were still, clearly, further improvements that needed to be made as a result of an industry which is fundamentally at risk of not nearly enough regulation in order to protect vulnerable consumers. To their credit, in 2015, the federal government announced a review into the small amount credit contract industry to report back to the government in March 2016, which it did. It was then another six months before—in November 2016—the government came out with its responses in relation to the small amount credit contract review. Its responses were very measured, practical and reasonable. Credit where credit is due, pardon the pun. It just so happened that the government was very content with the recommendations that were contained within the small amount credit contract review.


The reforms went to two things. What we know in relation to payday loans is that, in the financial year 2015-16, over 650,000 people in this country were given payday loans when they could barely afford them. Over two in five of those who were in receipt of payday loans or rent-to-buy schemes were also on the welfare system. There is no doubt that the worst excesses of the onerous interest-free payments and the never-ending story in relation to repayments were hurting those who could ill afford it.


The reforms suggested in the SACC review were to put a cap on the amount that could be taken out of a pay packet or a welfare cheque at any one time and put another cap on the amount they could actually borrow to make sure that these weren't some sort of tragic, never-ending stories resulting in an inevitable debt spiral. They are very sensible, measured and pragmatic approaches to reform to protect vulnerable Australians. You might ask, 'What happened then?' If it sounds too good to be true, it normally is, and this was no exception. Quite frankly, what we saw from November 2016 until almost the present day was a big, fat nothing from this government in relation to progressing these reforms. The reforms had the approval, in principle, of the advocacy groups. The reforms weren't excessive and they represented a reasonable compromise in relation to the various interests of the various stakeholders in this area.


It was left sitting on the desk of the Minister for Revenue  and Financial Services for many, many months—around 12 months. There were some very concerning public comments made by her where she said that draft legislation was being prepared, only to be found out by Senator Gallagher, in the other place. According to the department, not a single word had been committed to any draft legislation throughout the course of 2016 and early 2017. What we finally saw in October 2017, under the then Minister for Small Business, Minister McCormack, was some proposed legislation. Again, the proposed legislation was measured. It was put out for consultation with a commitment that it would be introduced before the end of the year. That was not done and we still see, as every day goes by, vulnerable consumers being left in limbo as a result of being trapped in rent-to-buy schemes which have no ending or payday loans which they can ill afford. We see situations where consumers have entered into a contract to buy a fridge for the cost of $350 to keep the household running, only for it to cost them, in a rent-to-buy scheme, over $3,500, repaid over the course of many months, if not years. What we really see are vulnerable consumers being charged up to 800 per cent of the cost of a good in order to pay it off over time.


Just like the SACC reforms—and there'll be more said about those at a different time and in a different place—these consumer protection improvements for credit card holders are also important. Schedule 5 makes changes to credit card laws to improve consumer protections. The changes include tightening responsible lending obligations, prohibiting credit card providers from offering unsolicited credit limit increases, simplifying the calculation of interest charges and requiring credit card contracts to allow consumers to reduce credit limits and terminate credit card contracts, including by online means. I must say that, if anyone has actually attempted to go through the process of cancelling a credit card, I think they would agree—and, boy, do we need instances where we can all agree on something in this place these days—that it is a thousand times harder to cancel a credit card than it is to get one. The hoops that are required to be jumped through at the moment to simply cancel a credit card and not take up another offer really are, in our view, unreasonably burdensome. I'm pleased to say that the changes in this bill do allow consumers a much easier path to make sure that their attempts to break free from the shackle of credit leading into a debt spiral are actually rewarded.


Schedules 1 and 2 of the bill will give APRA the ability to respond to future developments in non-ADI lending, should they pose a risk to financial stability. To protect deposit takers, APRA currently regulates lenders that take in deposits, and this bill gives APRA powers to act in relation to other lenders, should practices or the size on the non-ADI lending sector pose a risk to financial stability in the future. It is important that APRA have appropriate powers to ensure that the stability of the financial system is maintained. We acknowledge the important role that non-bank lenders can also play in terms of competition, including in relation to lending to small businesses, provided those non-bank lenders are subject to appropriate regulatory restraint in order to ensure that those vulnerable businesses and consumers are not otherwise at risk of falling prey to predatory lending practices.


In relation to the credit card reforms and in response to a 2015 Labor-led Senate inquiry, the Treasurer promised in May 2016 to progress changes to credit card laws. Unfortunately, the Treasurer appeared, clearly, to forget about this promise, and it took Labor publicly pushing for these reforms to force him to re-announce the measures in the 2017 budget. We welcome the measures, which will improve consumer protections in relation to credit cards. They are clearly long overdue, and it is disappointing that consumers will have to wait even longer, until 2019, for most of these protections to come into play. What we really see—and what underpins all of the conversations in relation to the banking sector, and what we saw again as recently as today with the release of the draft report of the Productivity Commission in relation to the banking sector—is that it is completely clear that, if we form the view that the best type of disinfectant is a ray of sunshine, what we need more than ever is a robust and effective royal commission in relation to the banking sector.


In order to take the opportunity to focus on the positive parts of 2017, as opposed to those parts where we had our battlelines drawn, let's be frank. A positive part of 2017 was seeing that a royal commission into the banking sector was now up and running. Now, we can have a very robust and heated—and appropriately robust and heated—debate about the terms of reference, in relation to how wide we can cast the net to examine the practices of the banking sector and industry and the practices of the lending sector and industry. It's also an appropriate time to echo the needs of those smaller lenders who provide small amounts of credit to make sure that they are also captured by this commission of inquiry. So it is a good start.


But, quite frankly, two things remain to be seen. Firstly, one can't help but wonder, given the clear, public statements made by this Prime Minister disregarding the need for a royal commission before deciding that political expediency justified actually setting one up, whether it is going to do what it ought to do and what it has the potential to do. That's the first thing. Secondly, we need to make sure it happens as quickly as possible and that all consumers get a chance to put their case to the royal commission. The rubber looks likely to hit the road in 2018. We should be optimistic that progress will be made in relation to protecting consumers in the finance and credit sectors. There is no doubt that, while this is taking much longer than it should, it is nevertheless a good start.

"Byrne, Anthony, MP",ALP,2018-02-07,"



Mr BYRNE
 (Holt) (16:01):  I was just talking to the member for McMillan about this. The irony, if there can be irony about someone who was so beloved and that passed last Saturday, is so rich, as I said to a journalist on the day that this terrible tragedy occurred. I was talking about the fact that there was a book which I had borrowed, a book that was published in 1993, Paul Keating: A Question of Leadership, by Michael Gordon about Paul Keating. The opening chapter is about a guy called Dr Chris Higgins, who was a former Treasury official. It's an incredibly powerful opening chapter. It explains the mindset of the then Treasurer before he gave the very famous Press Club speech.


In the first chapter, in the first couple of pages, he talks about an incredibly well-loved Treasury official who was 47 who competed in an event and then collapsed and died of a heart attack. It's hard to precisely put my feelings into words when this book had such a powerful impact on me in deciding whether or not to pursue an active political career. The fact that that very first stanza talks about a beloved individual—and Keating was very moved by what had happened to Dr Higgins, and I think that powered a lot of his reaction and then the subsequent Press Club speech, the 'Placido Domingo' speech—gives Michael's passing additional context as well.


Discussing it, for me personally, it's like a chapter of your life closing. That's how it felt when I got the news, sometime after Michael's tragic passing, about Michael, because he'd been so much a part of the fabric of my political existence for such a long period of time. I didn't know him deeply well as a person, as the member for McMillan did, quite clearly, but I knew him as a profoundly ethical, moral and deep-thinking journalist and someone who, when you thought about the reportage of the media and the direction that it takes, you would look at and say, 'This guy is an example of what the best was in journalism.' Michael really did represent journalism at its finest, in my view. He was independent. He was a critical thinker. He was a warm—I think that was powered by his personality—generous, decent human being. You could have disagreements with him but, you knew at the end of those glasses when you were having a conversation about life or politics or the events of the day, there was a deeply thoughtful, profoundly intelligent human being, and a really good person.


I think for journalists that now live in the ebb and flow of the journalistic environment, particularly the current crop of journalists, they should reflect closely about how parliament and parliamentarians have universally responded with grief about the loss of Michael. I think if some of them reflected—and this is no reflection on any journalist individually—on some journalists now, I wonder what sort of reaction there would be. That's not to denigrate journalists that are here now, but Michael serves as a beacon, I think, for journalists. He serves in the proudest traditions of journalism. I think that in my dealings with him—and others will talk at far greater length than I about their dealings—you really knew what you said to the guy at the end of the phone or sitting across from you was going to be held in confidence, even if he disagreed with you.


If you read the biography of Keating, Michael's not an uncritical assessor of the former Prime Minister and Treasurer. If you look, he breathed through the gift of how he used the English language. He breathed life into a story. You could really touch it. One of the great things, I think, about this book and the quality of his journalism was he breathed life into it. We can often be seen to be as acting as caricatures, as cartoon characters or as silhouettes. What Michael did for me in terms of Paul Keating was breathe life into him. He wasn't just this saturnine figure; he was a living, breathing person. If you look at the tributes when he first wrote this book in 1993, his first iteration before Keating won the Prime Ministership in 1993, you have people like Laurie Oakes, Neville Wran, Janine Haines, John Button and Michelle Grattan singing his praises in terms of how he wrote this book.


I really do regret having to stand up here today because it's a reminder of the ephemeral, transitory nature of our lives. It also reminds us that if there are people we haven't spoken to—I saw that Michael had stepped aside and retired from The Age, and it was always one of those things where I thought he's a really interesting person to catch up. I really would have wanted to talk to him. He's one of those journalists that you wanted to. He had such depth and breadth as a human being. He was a real person, and the more I learn about him in his passing. I was watching him on Facebook—I was a Facebook friend—about the work he was doing in Africa. There was a living, breathing, decent human being you wanted to catch up with and have a coffee with. I hadn't had a chance to extend my commiserations, from my perspective, about his leaving because I think the press gallery was the poorer for him retiring from The Age, but I never did. I was always going to. In fact, without making too much of a big deal, I thought that week before—you put it on your list of things to do: 'I'll give him a call'; I should have chased him up; I wanted to say I really missed him.


When I explained to him a number of years ago about how influential the book was, it was hard to get a copy so I chanced my arm. Joking about it I asked, 'You wouldn't have a copy?' For weeks he went searching for a copy he'd had in his archive, and then he turned up one day and said, 'I got a copy for you.' No big deal, no great fuss, just the man, his normal humble self. He gave me the book—it's a different iteration to this one—and he'd signed it, 'To a true believer'. I've still got that, and I posted it on the day that I found that Michael had passed. It was just the way he did it; he didn't have to do it and there was nothing in it for him but it was just a mark of the man, the calibre of the person. Like I said, the deepest regret I have is that I didn't have the chance to tell him what I thought about him as a journalist, so I'm going to use the parliamentary record. Michael: you were an incredibly fine human being. You were the best of what journalists represent. I was incredibly sad to see that you had stepped away, stepped aside and retired. I was excited about the fact that you were going to have a new chapter of your life open, and I'm absolutely crushed that that hasn't happened, and I think we are all the worse for it.

Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong—Minister for the Environment and Energy) (16:10):  The passing of Michael Gordon saw Australia lose a first-class journalist and a first-class human being. Our thoughts go out to his wife, Robyn, his children, Scott and Sarah, son-in-law, James, and grandson, Harry.


I knew Michael through my time working in this place, both as a member and with ministers past, and he was a constituent in Kooyong. He was thoroughly decent, eternally brave, always resourceful, passionate and deeply modest. I join with my colleagues who have paid tribute in this place to his achievements as a journalist. In 2005, he was the Australian Journalist of the Year, as awarded by the Melbourne Press Club. He had a long career as a journalist, having begun at The Age as a cadet in 1973. Last year, the Walkley Foundation's Outstanding Contribution to Journalism award was made to him, and the foundation wrote:


The overwhelming impression Gordon left—with both his byline and his presence—was of decency, integrity, fairness and balance. Even when he was working at the epicentre of influence, he held himself outside the media pack.


It's that notion of independence and having his own moral compass, which he followed throughout his long career, that has left an indelible mark on all those who worked with him and met with him.


His coverage of issues reflected not only matters of public importance but those which he cared about deeply. I'm talking particularly about Indigenous issues, asylum seekers and humanitarian issues. It's fair to say that he would have had a lot of differences with members of parliament, from both the government and the opposition benches, but they respected him. Bruce Guthrie, who wrote so warmly about his long relationship with Michael Gordon, said:


It was no surprise that key players on all sides of politics talked to him willingly. His sources were impeccable because he treated them impeccably.


I think that is Michael Gordon to a tee.


He had a broad range of interests: surfing, music and, of course, the Hawthorn Football Club. I know that he has left many friends behind, and we have heard passionately from them in the House, including from the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, but also from the member for McMillan, who knew him so very well. At this time, I pay my respects to Michael Gordon for a big life, for a good life and for one in which he made a real difference to people's lives. He will be sorely missed but remembered fondly and respectfully.

Mr LEESER
 (Berowra) (16:15):  It's an honour to participate in this condolence debate for the former Age journalist Michael Gordon and to follow the contributions made by the member for Holt and my friend the minister, the member for Kooyong. It's also an honour to participate in a debate that has already been contributed to by my friend the member for McMillan, who knew Michael Gordon so well, and will be contributed to later by the member for Scullin and the member for Hotham, who I know was a family friend of many years standing of Michael Gordon.


Shakespeare wrote, 'The breaking of so great a thing should make a greater crack.' That was how I felt when I heard that Michael Gordon had died at the weekend. I didn't know Michael Gordon very well and I certainly didn't know him as well as the member for McMillan or the member for Hotham, but, in the short time I knew Michael, I had an enormous respect for him and for his writing. At a time when so many members of the fourth estate are interested only in the horserace—who's up and who's down—and not really interested in the fundamental work that we as parliamentarians do here in making policy and scrutinising that policy, Michael Gordon carved out a very different space in the press gallery of this nation. Michael's particular interests were migration policy, particularly issues to do with offshore detention and refugees, and Indigenous policy.


It was in the space of Indigenous policy that I first got to know Michael. Before I became a member of parliament in 2014, with my friend Damien Freeman I published a pamphlet called The Australian Declaration of Recognition. The declaration was launched by Noel Pearson in the Dixson Room of the State Library of New South Wales. For anyone who's been involved in publishing and trying to contribute ideas to the public debate, it can sometimes seem like a glamorous thing, but when you're a one- or two-man band, or two-person band, you end up having to do all the administrative tasks yourself. So I was setting up stands, putting up banners and the like, and I suddenly received a call on my phone about 10 minutes before we were due to start from Michael, saying that he'd heard about the publication that we had done and that he wanted to have a chat with me about it. Being perhaps too overly Sydney-centric in my views, I had failed to properly reach out to Michael and discuss the proposal with him, but, unlike a lot of journalists, he wasn't fazed that he'd been left out in some way. In fact, he wanted to follow the story. He was interested in the issue, he was interested in our take on this particular aspect of the Indigenous recognition debate and he wrote up the launch and the publication and what we were trying to do very fairly.


Later, when I came here to the parliament, he sat down with me after my maiden speech and talked about some of the issues around mental health, about which I have a very deep interest, and around suicide prevention. He was interested in those issues, as he was in Indigenous recognition. He was interested in looking for people in this place who were interested in making a contribution in the areas which aren't perhaps always the central focus of the daily argy-bargy of politics. I found him a person that one could talk to, a person that you could get a fair hearing from and a person who was genuinely interested in the details. That really marked him out as a very different sort of journalist.


Michael had a long career in journalism. In fact, he was from a distinguished family of journalists. Thirty-seven years at The Age was an incredible devotion to that newspaper. The member for Holt talked about the book that Michael Gordon wrote about Paul Keating. I remember being shocked sitting in the chamber and hearing that Michael was due to leave the parliament when the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition made speeches about him last year. I think it was at about the same time as the press gallery annual midwinter dinner. That night I had the privilege of sitting with the member for Hotham and she said to me, 'Michael speaks very well of you.' I said: 'I had no idea he was going. Do you think he's here tonight?' She said, 'He's absolutely here.' So I went over to Michael and I said: 'I'm so sorry that you're leaving. I'm so sorry the country will be the poorer for you not being here.' Michael teared up. It was very clear to me that he didn't want to necessarily leave this place and that he loved being a journalist in the Australian parliamentary press gallery. I was interested, as the member for Holt said, in catching up with Michael in Melbourne. I was interested in seeing what he would do in the next phase of his career. The events of last weekend cut that so short.


I want to finish my remarks today with a quote from the Walkley award citation for his outstanding contribution to journalism, which he won in 2017, because I think it sums up very much the legacy of this very fine Australian. The citation says:


The overwhelming impression Gordon left—with both his byline and his presence—was of decency, integrity, fairness and balance. Even when he was working at the epicentre of influence, he held himself outside the media pack. And his compassion shone through as he fought to give voice to the underdogs. He was the first Australian journalist to gain access to the detention centre on Nauru; he spent time in remote communities listening to our first peoples, and won a Walkley for his coverage of Indigenous affairs in 2003.


To his family—his wife, Robyn, his children, Scott and Sarah, his son-in-law, James, and his grandson, Harry—I offer my sincere condolences on the passing of a great Australian.

Mr GILES
 (Scullin) (16:21):  I rise to make a brief contribution to this condolence debate to pay tribute to a man I knew a little and admired a lot. It's fitting that Michael Gordon's big but all-too-brief life is honoured in our parliament. This is, as it should be—and it's fitting also that such beautiful tributes were paid to him by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in the House—a moment of kindness and decency in tribute to a man of extraordinary kindness and decency. I associate myself also with some wonderful speeches made just now, particularly those of the member for Berowra, the member for Holt, the member for Fenner and, of course, the member for Kooyong, and I look forward to hearing the contribution of the member for McMillan and also that of my friend the member for Hotham, for whom the man who is the subject of this debate means so much.


I've been reading the tributes to Michael made by those who knew him best. I can't really add to the personal stories or share the all-too-evident pain of loss. That's not my place, as it wasn't my privilege to know Michael that well. But I was privileged to know him. We shared a concern for our nation's attitude to those forced to ask us for help and we spoke often about the challenges of the politics and policy of asylum. The questions he asked me showed his compassion, his professionalism and his complete lack of cynicism. After every discussion we had, I found myself thinking at length about what he had said and whether I was doing as I should have been, and asking myself how I could do my job and discharge my responsibilities in a way that could meet the bar his expectations set. I've been thinking about that this week too, and I suspect I am not alone in asking hard questions of myself in light of these tragic events.


As a political journalist, Michael wrote a large part of our recent past into history. He told the stories of this place and many other places in a way that inspired and engaged. He brought others along with him in his evident love of his profession and what it meant and why it mattered. Matt Dawson, who works with me, told me this morning of how welcoming and encouraging Michael had been to him on arrival in the gallery—one story, one part of a legacy which is monumental. On leaving the gallery, Michael went to work in support of the McKinnon Prize in Political Leadership, amongst some other things. It strikes me that, beyond any words which are spoken today, those of us who have public office could honour him by doing our jobs more in the way he approached his—with kindness and concern for others, with generosity which is fit for our purpose, and without cynicism.


All my best thoughts go to his family and those very many people who loved him dearly. Vale.

"Broadbent, Russell, MP",LP,2018-02-07,"



Mr BROADBENT
 (McMillan) (16:24):  I thank the members who have participated in this condolence debate and recognise the unusual nature of it. I spoke to Russell Barton, a very close friend of Michael's, this morning, and he summed it up beautifully for me. He said that he and his wife were in disbelief—'in disbelief'. And I suppose—I know—a lot of us are feeling exactly that. So, in that space of disbelief, and what's happened since Saturday morning, and the tributes that have been given so wonderfully regarding Michael, I suppose my address will be directed at young Harry, who Michael was, I think, so, so excited about.


I speak today because I wanted to get out something that I had written—a tribute to Michael when he left the parliament. And I don't think the Prime Minister will mind me telling tales. I wrote this:


Have you ever been hugged by Michael? I have!


I had just delivered an address that began.




""I did not choose this path. This path chose me.""



And I walked into my office—in a state of high emotion, I might add—and Michael threw his arms around me. He must have run to my office. He was standing waiting for me.


Halfway through the hug … I realised I was being hugged by the generations of those who believed in the right, the fair, the truth.


The hug that lingers has its DNA reproduced in the articles that flow out of the pen that creates the picture and emotions that linger on after reading. Michael's best compliment.


Early AM one Sunday I was on the ride-on; the phone rings; it's Malcolm! 'Had to ring you about this announcement before Micky Gordon could get to you.' I said, 'It won't be much of an announcement then, Malcolm, will it?' Well, it wasn't much of an announcement. I was so glad that the threat was that Micky Gordon would get to me first. And then I wished Michael all the best on his adventure, which I knew it would be after he left The Age, and that was just beginning to build.


You know, I will be personal for a moment, because, with Michael, if you knew him, you knew that every contact, every greeting, was a great moment in time; every homecoming, especially to Robyn, was an event; and every personal interaction was a reason for a hug—no matter where you were, public or non-public, a hug. A light went out in Michael, from my point of view—and, yes, it's true; we did speak, probably, weekly; yes, it's true. And a light went out in him when Harry died, but it was kindled to a re-blaze when young Harry was born. Michael was beside himself with young Harry. Life was good; life was expansive. As I said the other day, he was about to work on a project with John Howard and Julia Gillard, and he was like a kid with a new toy, flying.


I learned something else from Russell Barton today that you need to know too. He said to me that, when they used to run marathons together and the marathon finished in the run-up to Parliament House, Michael would make his biggest effort in that last run-up, after all the kilometres. I said to Russell, 'Well, he'd have been competitive on Saturday. There'd have been somebody in that race that he wanted to beat—no doubt about it—and he was within sight of the shoreline, within sight of the finish, so he'd have been doing the Michael Gordon final, final push.'


When you talk about Michael's writing, which I loved, Michael's dad wrote the book about the Hawthorn Football Club The Hard Way, and Michael followed up with Playing to Win. So much has been said in the tributes on Michael, there's nothing more I can add to the brilliance of what those tributes have been. But one thing that has come to my knowledge is this. In Harry's book The Hard Way, Sandy Ferguson, who was the president and doctor of the Hawthorn Football Club, was quoted as saying, 'If you embrace Hawthorn, Hawthorn will embrace you.' Michael carried on by writing the book Playing To Win. The great Hawthorn coach, Parkin, talked the other day about his sacking and how engaging with Michael was able to bring him to a place where he got the message that he had to go at that time. So, if you embrace Hawthorn, Hawthorn will embrace you. I'd say, 'If you embraced Michael, Michael would embrace you.' He would not only embrace you but hug you in a way that you knew you couldn't let go until you got the message—the hug that resonates.


I just want to finish with this. At Harry's funeral, somebody said to me: 'You know, journalism's just a craft. You can learn it.' I said: 'I disagree. It's a gift. You've got it or you haven't got it.' Michael Gordon had it in spades. So, that's your grandfather, young Harry—he had his talent in spades.

Ms O'NEIL
 (Hotham) (16:31):  Vale Michael Gordon, a giant of Australian journalism, a father, a husband, a grandfather, a dear friend of mine and a mentor to so many of us here in Parliament House. His passing is a devastating loss to the gallery and, I believe, to our democracy. Michael was an incredible man. I can't recall knowing someone more respectful, polite, dignified and humble. It's especially noteworthy to have these qualities in someone who spent so much time around politics. Disrespect and ego are contagious diseases in this building, but Michael never fell foul of either.


I've noticed that, since his death, an incredibly large number of people have come forward saying they had a special and deep relationship with Michael. I felt that I had a special and deep relationship with him and I've been surprised and delighted to see that so many others in this building got to share in his amazing wisdom. Michael was a journalist in the old mould. His model of journalism was better for the country. I don't think you'd find anyone in the press gallery who'd disagree with that. It was the kind of journalism that stuck with a story, that genuinely held decision-makers to account and that provided deep analysis of the issues that made readers and their leaders think better and more clearly about national problems.


Journalism has moved on from there and that's a very sad thing. Many of us here saw Mickey struggle to give the qualities of courage and integrity to the story in the new media environment. He continued with the style and type of journalism that may not serve as particularly good click bait, but it was something that the public and all of us desperately needed more of: tempered, nuanced, balanced, fair and thoughtful words.


This week I sat in Labor's first nations' caucus amongst some of the leading Indigenous thinkers in our country. I'm lucky to sit with them in the Labor caucus. We were discussing what I regard as one of the most critical and important issues that our country faces: how we close the gap with our Indigenous brothers and sisters. I thought: 'Who is going to report on these issues now in the way that Michael would have reported on them? Who is going to take the time to really understand this, visit the first nations leaders and speak with their communities to understand what's actually happening on the ground? Who is going to follow this story for decades to really understand the ups and downs?' I don't think we'll ever see an Australian journalist get as across these issues as the way Michael Gordon did.


I saw Michael about two months ago. We caught up for lunch and he was entering a new phase. I heard the member for McMillan talking about how excited he was about Michael's new project. It's ironic that it was after leaving Fairfax that he looked like he was going to be able to get back to that type of journalism—the long-form type of journalism that so much sustained him.


I want Robyn, Scott and Sarah to know that much of our last conversation was about them and his excitement about what was happening in their lives and the fact that, after his retirement from The Age, for the first time he was really getting to share so much more of their lives with them—spending time with Robyn at their holiday house; Sarah having recently become a mum and all the time he was spending with little Harry; and his incredible visit to Sierra Leone with Scotty. He was so proud of his kids and he talked about them all the time.


I know I will miss his presence in the press gallery as he watched over question time. I used to look up at his face and I could see we were disappointing him every single day, but seeing him up there made me strive to do what we're trying to do better. I think others felt the same. There he sat, quietly, seriously, watching over affairs, seeing the parliament through its ups and downs over many decades and writing calm, serious, real journalism about the most important issues that confront our country. We are going to miss Michael Gordon, the man, and also his contribution to public life in this country. May he rest in peace.

We are all the beneficiaries of his work. We flatter him because his life was inviting. He was non-hostile and always seemed to be fair. I think the best way we can honour Michael is—it's so comforting to hear an accolade that we give to a journalist, but if we could have given that to him while he was here he would have blushed—maybe we can find those amongst us in the journalistic core that are also worthy of accolade and give that to them personally so they hear it.

The people who spoke on this motion were some of the best people in the parliament, in my view, including the member for McMillan and especially the member for Hotham. That is a tribute to Mickey Gordon. Given how we in this building loved him, I can only imagine what his family must be going through at this point and the scale of their loss. I just want to record my thoughts on that matter and thank the chair for that opportunity.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Buchholz
):  The chamber thanks you for your contribution. 




Mr WATTS:
  On the bill in question, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017, Labor will not be supporting this $65 billion tax cut for business. That is not news to anyone who has been following the political debate in recent times. But it is worth noting in the chamber here today the symbolic value of this bill because it highlights the Turnbull government's ideological blinkers. It's worth noting its lack of economic courage and imagination, lack of vision, lack of leadership and lack of foresight for the kind of country that we want Australia to be. This bill represents the wrong plan for Australia, the wrong plan for economic growth, the wrong plan for wages growth, the wrong plan for fighting inequality, the wrong plan for increasing Australia's competitiveness, the wrong plan for working Australians and, certainly, the wrong plan for budget repair. 


It's the wrong plan for economic growth. We know this because of the government's own figures. Since this bill was first introduced—the whole package of the bill, not just the bits that the government has been able to get through the parliament so far—the economic growth dividend of this bill is one per cent of economic growth in 20 years time. We ought to fight for every scrap of economic growth we can in this parliament. Economic growth benefits all of us—it helps us to fight inequality and helps us to increase our quality of life—but what a paltry return for a $65 billion unfunded cost to the budget. I highlight that because the opportunity cost of this bill is significant. This is $65 billion that could be invested in the education of Australia's children, something that would have a dividend for economic growth. This is $65 billion that could be invested in the skills of the Australian workforce. This is $65 billion that could be invested in infrastructure, increasing the productivity of the engines of economic growth in our nation, cities—the 0.2 per cent of Australia's landmass that currently produce around 80 per cent of Australia's economic activity.


Indeed, nearly 70 per cent of Australian GDP is generated within the cities of Sydney and Melbourne. The productivity of these areas is crucial to the success of our national economy. Despite this, we see no vision from the Turnbull government for investment in urban infrastructure. The Deputy Prime Minister, the new Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, has outlined no vision for the role of his portfolio in doing this. Certainly, the New South Wales Deputy Prime Minister, taking a similar approach to the New South Wales Prime Minister, is not allocating funding for Victoria. Victoria has 9.7 per cent of federal infrastructure budget spending despite having 25 per cent of the population and being the growth engine for Australia in both population and economic terms. Where is this government's vision for infrastructure investment in Victoria?


This bill is also the wrong plan for wages. As the Reserve Bank governor has noted, a lack of wage growth in this country is the real crisis in our economy. Over the last 10 years, real labour productivity grew by 20 per cent, while real wages grew by only six per cent. Wages share of GDP is well below the average of the last 50 years. Wages growth is the lowest since we started collecting records. If that's not bad enough, the Reserve Bank has warned workers to expect stubbornly low wage growth for some time yet. Despite the Treasurer's claims of better days to come—the cheque's in the mail—workers are not seeing that impact on the hip pocket.


There's plenty that this government could be doing to help wages growth in this country. They could be looking at boosting the minimum wage, changing the rules for enterprise bargaining or taking an aim at provisions which allow employers to terminate workplace agreements and force workers back toward minimums. There's plenty more that could be done in reducing the gender pay gap, making industrial relations more user-friendly for small businesses, bringing intractable workplace disputes and negotiations to an end, making the Fair Work Commission easier to access, providing job pathways for people with disabilities, tackling discrimination of older workers so that they stay in the workforce and earn wages for longer, and helping younger people enter it in the first place. These are things that the government could be doing to increase wages growth, not cutting company taxes.


We know that corporate tax cuts do not directly lead to wages growth. As Michael Keating AC, the former head of the departments of Employment, Industrial Relations, Finance, and Prime Minister and Cabinet of the great Labor governments of the eighties and early nineties, recently wrote:


Despite the evidence of the last few decades that 'trickle-down' economics doesn't work, big business and its apologists in the media are calling for a company tax cut to stimulate investment. The reality, however, is that increased investment is principally in response to increasing aggregate demand. The required increase in aggregate demand in turn requires less inequality and faster wage growth, not bigger business subsidies.


What Michael Keating is saying in that statement is that companies don't invest because of the scale of their profits; they invest because of the scale of their markets. They invest when they think they'll earn a quid. That's the challenge that we need to be fighting. If we want to increase the size of markets in Australia, we have to tackle inequality; we have to tackle the spending capacity of middle- and working-class Australians.


This bill is the wrong plan for tackling inequality in Australia. Inequality is at a 75-year high in Australia. Over the last four decades, real wages growth of the top 10 per cent of income earners has grown by 72 per cent, more than three times the rate of increase for real wages than that of the bottom 10 per cent of income earners.




A division having been called in the House of Representatives—





Sitting suspended from 16

Mr WATTS:
  As I was saying, inequality in Australia is at 75-year highs, and over the last decade real wages for the top 10 per cent of income earners have grown by 72 per cent, which is three times the rate of increase in real wages for the bottom 10 per cent. If we want to do something about increasing aggregate demand in the Australian economy, we need to do something about inequality. We need to do something about the spending capacity of working-class and middle-class Australians.


And it's not just me saying that. It is economic heavyweights around the world who have said that inequality has gotten so far out of kilter that it's now acting as a brake on growth around the world. Indeed, Nobel prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz has argued that we can no longer talk about rising inequality and sluggish economic recovery as separate phenomena; they are in fact intertwined. Inequality stifles, restrains and holds back growth. The IMF has agreed, finding:


If the income share of the top 20 percent increases by 1 percentage point—


and this is what's happening in Australia—


GDP growth is actually 0.08 percentage point lower in the following five years, suggesting that the benefits do not trickle down. Instead, a similar increase in the income share of the bottom 20 percent (the poor) is associated with 0.38 percentage point higher growth.


The OECD echoes these points, noting that:


Rising inequality by 3 Gini points, that is the average increase recorded in the OECD over the past two decades, would drag down economic growth by 0.35 percentage point per year for 25 years: a cumulated loss in GDP at the end of the period of 8.5 per cent.


This belies the ideological blinkers of the Prime Minister's claims that Labor is not interested in promoting economic growth. We are interested in promoting economic growth; we just have a different view. We have a clear-eyed view of the problems confronting the Australian economy and the handbrake of increasing inequality on economic growth in Australia. The Prime Minister cannot see that in the modern international economy, if you want to do something about growth, you start by doing something about inequality—a better spread of wealth, putting the middle and working class in a better position to spend and increasing aggregate demand, something that will flow through to workers' wages. We know that inequality is not inevitable. While they are macro trends, policy interventions can do something about it. The problem is that the corporate tax cuts before the House pour fuel on the fire; they make things worse. The Treasurer, noted economic expert, told AM yesterday that his corporate tax cuts would 'help resolve inequality issues' like they're some kind of magical economic elixir. It's not medicine; it's fuel for the fires of growing inequality.


To understand why this is, let's look at how economic forecasters have responded to Donald Trump's tax cuts. CNBC's Fed survey asked US forecasters how US corporations will respond to the reduction in the US corporate rate. Just 12 per cent of respondents believed that it would be spent on increased wages, the position of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. A little more, 23 per cent, thought that it would be spent on capex, investing in the capital of companies; 13 per cent thought it would be spent on debt recovery, ultimately increasing the profit take; and 36 per cent thought it would be spent on share buybacks and special dividends. These forecasters believe that the bulk of that tax cut will go to increasing returns on capital. I'll give you a tip: that won't make inequality any better. Overall, just eight per cent of the 40 respondents, who include economists, strategists and fund managers, say that workers would benefit the most from Donald Trump's tax cuts. Fifty-four per cent said that it would be shareholders and executives. That is the impact of these bills on inequality.


At the same time, we note that the government is increasing the Medicare levy for seven million Australian workers. The Prime Minister will increase taxes for everyone earning over $21,000 a year—of course, that won't be the case for millionaires, though; they lost their deficit reduction levy, meaning that they will get a tax cut of about $21,000 a year, but let's just park that. These measures mean that tax increases under this government will be worn by police, firemen, tradesmen and teachers, while there will be tax cuts for millionaires, multinational corporations and our banks.


One of the refrains that we've heard is that these measures are necessary because we need to follow Donald Trump's America. Because they have reduced their corporate tax cut, the competitiveness of the Australian economy demands that we follow suit. Let's look at our competitiveness as an investment destination. We know that company tax is far from a determinative factor in investment decisions, otherwise you wouldn't be seeing the volume of investment in Australia from jurisdictions with lower corporate tax rates than we have in Australia today. It would not make sense if it was a determinative factor that jurisdictions with lower corporate tax rates invested in Australia, with a higher corporate tax rate. We know that company tax is just one of a range of considerations that drive investment decisions. Corporates want to know whether they can make a return, and that depends on the location of resources needed to make a return, natural and people resources, the strength of institutions to protect returns, security of investment, the skills of the domestic population, macroeconomic conditions and stability of the policy and regulatory environment. You can imagine the kinds of policy interventions that the government might be considering, taking those elements into consideration, to attract more foreign investment to Australia. A competent government would be a good start. A government that wasn't constantly flip-flopping and backflipping, as is characteristic of the Turnbull government, would probably help. A stable energy policy that wasn't driven by the troglodytes on the coalition back bench would also make a contribution.


But, even if we take tax alone, let's look at how Australia compares with the US. The US Congressional Budget Office prepared analysis to inform debate in the United States in March 2017 titled International comparisons of corporate income tax rates. They noted that the corporate statutory tax rate is one of many features in the tax system that influence corporate behaviour but, importantly, noted:


Because of their broader scope, average and effective corporate tax rates are better indicators of a company's incentives to invest in a particular country than is the statutory corporate tax rate.


This report didn't just look at the nominal rate; it also looked at what was actually paid. That analysis, which is free for everyone to see, put Australia's rate in the lower half of the G20. The paper pointed out that, while the headline rate was 30 per cent in 2012, the average rate for Australia was 17 per cent and the effective rate was 10.4 per cent. Indeed, the report used Australia as an example of why the US needed to cut its corporate tax rate. Finally, this bill before the chamber is the wrong plan for budget repair in Australia. 


The provisions in this bill represent a significant structural deterioration of the budget over the medium term. Remember the glory days of the Abbott opposition when they had a shadow minister for debt reduction? On the watch of the current Deputy Prime Minister and former member Andrew Robb—remember the debt and deficit disaster, the budget emergency and the debt truck?—the deficit has blown out and debt has crashed through the half-a-trillion-dollar tax mark. They like to say we need to cut corporate taxes because that's what the Keating government did. Well, the Keating government didn't do unfunded corporate tax rate cuts. They did the hard work of funding it. One of the more annoying features of being a Labor MP these days is being lectured about the legacy of the Hawke-Keating government by people who have no idea what that legacy is. 


We should recall that when the Hawke-Keating government reduced corporate taxes they introduced a fringe benefits tax, they introduced a capital gains tax and they put an end to the bottom-of-the-harbour lurks and perks. They funded the corporate tax cut. In response to that, an editorial in The Australian in 1985 attacked Labor for class warfare and said the tax package which cut corporate taxes represented a bias against business. The Business Council of Australia labelled that government 'anti-business'. The more things change, the more they stay the same. Labor are committed to a taxation policy that doesn't do unfunded corporate tax cuts. We've looked at whether there are inefficiencies in the taxation system—negative gearing, super concessions and the taxation treatment of trusts—and we've acted responsibly on those fronts. We have a plan for the Australian economy, not an ideological blinker.

"Wilson, Josh, MP",ALP,2018-02-07,"



Mr JOSH WILSON
 (Fremantle) (17:16):  I'm glad to speak on this bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017, and I oppose the tax cuts for big business. Labor oppose the tax cuts to big business because they are irresponsible. In doing that we are trying to save the government from itself. We're trying to save Australian households, especially low- and middle-income Australians, from bearing the burden of this revenue giveaway. That is what it is. I agree with everything the member for Gellibrand just said. The government is proposing to give away $65 billion. It's going to create a structural hole in the budget. It hasn't done anything to repair that. It's not part of some comprehensive set of tax measures that produces some sort of fiscal balance or some balance in terms of its effect across the broader economy—the real economy and its effect on households. That point was made on Q&A the other night by Heather Ridout in saying that this is really a crude tax giveaway. It does not fit into any kind of larger plan for the Australian economy. 


These tax cuts will result in current and future revenue burdens falling elsewhere. That's been the case whenever these things have been done. The OECD has observed that, where corporate tax rates have been cut, consumption taxes, VATs and GSTs inevitably go up to make up for the hole that's created in taking away revenue that is rightly, fairly and equitably derived from big businesses. Those taxes—VATs, GSTs and consumption taxes—are regressive taxes, and they fall hardest on the poor; they fall hardest on those who have the least. I note that the Tax Justice Network has said in relation to corporate tax cuts, particularly for big business and multinationals, that:


Governments make up shortfalls [from corporation tax cuts] by levying higher taxes on other, less wealthy sections of society, or by cutting back on essential public services, so tax 'competition' boosts inequality and deprivation.


A number of Labor speakers have made that point. 


If you look at the proposed tax cuts, if you were a person sitting at their kitchen table or driving their car or in their workplace and you were looking at the issue of giving away corporate tax cuts, particularly to big business and multinationals, you would be sensible to back up a step. You'd be sensible to ask: what exactly is the problem that a massive and unprecedented tax giveaway to big business is trying to address? What is the burning need to take $65 billion of revenue, to create that kind of structural hole in the budget, to create that burden that will fall elsewhere in Australian society?


I think most people have a sense of the challenges we face. We know that workers' share of national income is at a record low. We have falling real wages. We have rising inequality. Just to give a sense of how bad inequality in Australia has become, the top one per cent of Australians in terms of wealth and assets now own more than the bottom 70 per cent altogether. There's no way you can look at that kind of outcome and say that this is a system that's working, that this is a system that is delivering outcomes as it was designed to or as would be fair. That kind of outcome is not the result of a fair system; it's not even the result of a meritocracy. It is a grossly distorted system in which one per cent of Australians can own more than the bottom 70 per cent put together. Yet this kind of measure will only exacerbate that.


So, we have rising inequality. We have record underemployment. And under this government—despite, as the member for Gellibrand pointed out, making their run for government on the basis of an apparent debt emergency—debt has more than doubled, to now more than $500 billion. What's more, there's evidence of significant tax avoidance, especially for large multinationals. If you take all those challenges together, how on earth would any reasonable person think that the solution would be to cut corporate taxes for the biggest and most profitable companies in Australia, including a significant number of foreign multinational companies? How on earth could you think that giving away $65 billion of precious revenue, which we need for essential services, at a time when the budget is already significantly in the red, and cutting penalty rates to low-income workers and increasing the tax for people under $87,000 could possibly be regarded as the way to address those challenges?


Any sensible person knows that when you forgo taxes it's the same from a budgetary position as spending money. Any time you give up revenue, you want to do so on the basis that there's a very sound reason for doing that. You're giving away public funds, and in this case you're creating a hole that will endure into the future. The government has said that they have good reason for doing that, and I think that's the kind of thing everyone who comes and participates in this debate ought to consider. What we already know about the $65 billion giveaway is that it will increase government debt. We know that when you give away $65 billion to big companies—multinationals—that is funding that cannot be used for health and education, for crisis housing and homelessness support services, or for the social safety welfare net.


That's the first thing. That's a given. But the government said, 'We've got to do this, because it's the only way we can stimulate economic growth, it's the only way we can create jobs and it's the only way we can get a higher investment flow into Australia.' There is no basis for any of those three arguments. The government hasn't put anything forward on that front. There is no independent economic analysis. There are no economic commentators who will back in those claims.


Are big businesses struggling under the existing tax burden? Is there any evidence that big businesses in Australia are at the point of collapse? There isn't. We're living at a time when large businesses are making record profits. There is no evidence of widespread business struggles or difficulties. There's in fact the reverse. There's evidence that large companies in particular are doing very well. They're not sharing that success. There's no flowthrough to wages. But they're certainly recording record profits. We know from the 2015 ATO data in relation to this question of whether business is labouring under some inordinate tax burden that one in three private companies paid no tax in that relevant tax year. One in four public corporate entities paid no tax, one in three private companies and one in four public companies paid no tax and fully half of the foreign companies operating in Australia, by some accounting method or other, had no taxable income.


We also know, as the member for Gellibrand and a number of other Labor people in this debate have pointed out, that companies in Australia couldn't possibly complain about the tax burden they face if they had regard for the tax burden that exists in comparable economies. The relevant comparator group is the G20. We are the 13th-largest economy in the world. We sit in that group of developed economies that make up the 20 largest economies. When the US Congressional Budget Office undertook its analysis, it showed that Australia is average or even below average in terms of tax burden. That judgement does not take account of the impact of our innovative dividend imputation arrangements, which are calculated to have the effect of removing taxable burden by about a third. So there's no case to be made that the Australian taxation position with respect to companies is unduly or comparatively burdensome. There's no evidence that companies are desperate for a tax cut. There's just nothing of that kind.


That obviously goes to the question about whether or not making this kind of tax giveaway is necessary or even assists in relation to investor flows. Again, there's no evidence of that. Companies invest in Australia for a whole range of reasons. In some cases, if you think about the resources that Australia holds, they invest here because we have those resources. Someone doesn't come here to look at an LNG play or to consider developing an iron ore resource because of the tax position. They come here because we are blessed to have a lot of natural riches in those ways. A more responsible government would be ensuring that the general economic framework in this country supports new kinds of investment in the future—investment in things like renewable energy. That would be a much more prudent way of spending scarce government funds than giving away $65 billion at a stroke.


There's no evidence that tax cuts, particularly tax cuts of this exorbitant magnitude, do anything much for growth. The government's own numbers indicate that the tax cuts would deliver about one per cent of growth over 20 years. When you break that down to the benefit for individual households, it's about 0.1 per cent for households. A 0.1 per cent increase in the position of households is about the same as what happens on a monthly basis in the economy as it is. These tax cuts will not deliver growth. It is a sad indictment of a government whose mantra was jobs and growth that the best they can do, the only thing they can do, is to give $65 billion away to big multinationals that are making record profits and doing very well, thank you. There's certainly no evidence that tax cuts lead to jobs, and since this proposition was put forward I haven't read a single thing about this. I've read countless articles and pieces of analysis that say the opposite. There is simply no evidence that tax cuts, in and of themselves, create jobs. Lots of things do create jobs. Investment in infrastructure creates jobs. Investment in education creates jobs. Investment in health services creates jobs. Those things are all demonstrably true. Giving away a huge tax cut to large businesses that are already performing quite well and are quite profitable does not flow through to jobs and does not flow through to wages.


The truth is that there is no rationale for $65 billion in tax cuts for big business. It can't be justified on the basis of delivering economic growth. It can't be justified on the basis of creating jobs. It's got nothing to do with investor flows. My old woodwork teacher used to say to me, 'Before you start any job, measure twice and cut once.' This government is going to create an enormous hole in the budget going into the future. Once you give money away it's very difficult and unlikely that you'll ever get it back. This government and previous coalition governments have form in this space. They cast a long shadow. The Howard government lived through very sunny economic times. It acted with  extraordinary profligacy towards the end of its time. We are living with the structural impact of that profligacy even now. 


This is a further act of profligacy. It probably goes one step further. This $65 billion giveaway will be a savage blow to the ability of this and future Australian governments to do their job, which is to look after the broad economic and social welfare of the Australian people. On that basis, it is grossly irresponsible. It creates a massive structural hole in future budgets. It will prevent us from supporting essential services, from investing in health and education, public infrastructure, in our precious environment, in the good working of the social safety net. It answers no demonstrated need whatsoever. It has no demonstrated benefits. The very, very marginal benefits that the Parliamentary Budget Office has found are pathetically minimal. It will shift the tax burden from companies to households as sure as night follows day. It will put the needs of future Australian governments to derive revenue to pay for essential services on households and take them from large companies, particularly multinational companies that are already profitable and already have countless ways of avoiding the tax they have to pay. I'm glad to oppose it.

Mr WATTS
 (Gellibrand) (16:37):  Before I begin on the bill in question, I want to associate myself with the remarks from the chair just now. I know that's the feeling of members across this parliament. The people who spoke on this motion were some of the best people in the parliament, in my view, including the member for McMillan and especially the member for Hotham. That is a tribute to Mickey Gordon. Given how we in this building loved him, I can only imagine what his family must be going through at this point and the scale of their loss. I just want to record my thoughts on that matter and thank the chair for that opportunity.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Buchholz
):  The chamber thanks you for your contribution. 




Mr WATTS:
  On the bill in question, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017, Labor will not be supporting this $65 billion tax cut for business. That is not news to anyone who has been following the political debate in recent times. But it is worth noting in the chamber here today the symbolic value of this bill because it highlights the Turnbull government's ideological blinkers. It's worth noting its lack of economic courage and imagination, lack of vision, lack of leadership and lack of foresight for the kind of country that we want Australia to be. This bill represents the wrong plan for Australia, the wrong plan for economic growth, the wrong plan for wages growth, the wrong plan for fighting inequality, the wrong plan for increasing Australia's competitiveness, the wrong plan for working Australians and, certainly, the wrong plan for budget repair. 


It's the wrong plan for economic growth. We know this because of the government's own figures. Since this bill was first introduced—the whole package of the bill, not just the bits that the government has been able to get through the parliament so far—the economic growth dividend of this bill is one per cent of economic growth in 20 years time. We ought to fight for every scrap of economic growth we can in this parliament. Economic growth benefits all of us—it helps us to fight inequality and helps us to increase our quality of life—but what a paltry return for a $65 billion unfunded cost to the budget. I highlight that because the opportunity cost of this bill is significant. This is $65 billion that could be invested in the education of Australia's children, something that would have a dividend for economic growth. This is $65 billion that could be invested in the skills of the Australian workforce. This is $65 billion that could be invested in infrastructure, increasing the productivity of the engines of economic growth in our nation, cities—the 0.2 per cent of Australia's landmass that currently produce around 80 per cent of Australia's economic activity.


Indeed, nearly 70 per cent of Australian GDP is generated within the cities of Sydney and Melbourne. The productivity of these areas is crucial to the success of our national economy. Despite this, we see no vision from the Turnbull government for investment in urban infrastructure. The Deputy Prime Minister, the new Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, has outlined no vision for the role of his portfolio in doing this. Certainly, the New South Wales Deputy Prime Minister, taking a similar approach to the New South Wales Prime Minister, is not allocating funding for Victoria. Victoria has 9.7 per cent of federal infrastructure budget spending despite having 25 per cent of the population and being the growth engine for Australia in both population and economic terms. Where is this government's vision for infrastructure investment in Victoria?


This bill is also the wrong plan for wages. As the Reserve Bank governor has noted, a lack of wage growth in this country is the real crisis in our economy. Over the last 10 years, real labour productivity grew by 20 per cent, while real wages grew by only six per cent. Wages share of GDP is well below the average of the last 50 years. Wages growth is the lowest since we started collecting records. If that's not bad enough, the Reserve Bank has warned workers to expect stubbornly low wage growth for some time yet. Despite the Treasurer's claims of better days to come—the cheque's in the mail—workers are not seeing that impact on the hip pocket.


There's plenty that this government could be doing to help wages growth in this country. They could be looking at boosting the minimum wage, changing the rules for enterprise bargaining or taking an aim at provisions which allow employers to terminate workplace agreements and force workers back toward minimums. There's plenty more that could be done in reducing the gender pay gap, making industrial relations more user-friendly for small businesses, bringing intractable workplace disputes and negotiations to an end, making the Fair Work Commission easier to access, providing job pathways for people with disabilities, tackling discrimination of older workers so that they stay in the workforce and earn wages for longer, and helping younger people enter it in the first place. These are things that the government could be doing to increase wages growth, not cutting company taxes.


We know that corporate tax cuts do not directly lead to wages growth. As Michael Keating AC, the former head of the departments of Employment, Industrial Relations, Finance, and Prime Minister and Cabinet of the great Labor governments of the eighties and early nineties, recently wrote:


Despite the evidence of the last few decades that 'trickle-down' economics doesn't work, big business and its apologists in the media are calling for a company tax cut to stimulate investment. The reality, however, is that increased investment is principally in response to increasing aggregate demand. The required increase in aggregate demand in turn requires less inequality and faster wage growth, not bigger business subsidies.


What Michael Keating is saying in that statement is that companies don't invest because of the scale of their profits; they invest because of the scale of their markets. They invest when they think they'll earn a quid. That's the challenge that we need to be fighting. If we want to increase the size of markets in Australia, we have to tackle inequality; we have to tackle the spending capacity of middle- and working-class Australians.


This bill is the wrong plan for tackling inequality in Australia. Inequality is at a 75-year high in Australia. Over the last four decades, real wages growth of the top 10 per cent of income earners has grown by 72 per cent, more than three times the rate of increase for real wages than that of the bottom 10 per cent of income earners.




A division having been called in the House of Representatives—





Sitting suspended from 16

Mr WATTS:
  As I was saying, inequality in Australia is at 75-year highs, and over the last decade real wages for the top 10 per cent of income earners have grown by 72 per cent, which is three times the rate of increase in real wages for the bottom 10 per cent. If we want to do something about increasing aggregate demand in the Australian economy, we need to do something about inequality. We need to do something about the spending capacity of working-class and middle-class Australians.


And it's not just me saying that. It is economic heavyweights around the world who have said that inequality has gotten so far out of kilter that it's now acting as a brake on growth around the world. Indeed, Nobel prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz has argued that we can no longer talk about rising inequality and sluggish economic recovery as separate phenomena; they are in fact intertwined. Inequality stifles, restrains and holds back growth. The IMF has agreed, finding:


If the income share of the top 20 percent increases by 1 percentage point—


and this is what's happening in Australia—


GDP growth is actually 0.08 percentage point lower in the following five years, suggesting that the benefits do not trickle down. Instead, a similar increase in the income share of the bottom 20 percent (the poor) is associated with 0.38 percentage point higher growth.


The OECD echoes these points, noting that:


Rising inequality by 3 Gini points, that is the average increase recorded in the OECD over the past two decades, would drag down economic growth by 0.35 percentage point per year for 25 years: a cumulated loss in GDP at the end of the period of 8.5 per cent.


This belies the ideological blinkers of the Prime Minister's claims that Labor is not interested in promoting economic growth. We are interested in promoting economic growth; we just have a different view. We have a clear-eyed view of the problems confronting the Australian economy and the handbrake of increasing inequality on economic growth in Australia. The Prime Minister cannot see that in the modern international economy, if you want to do something about growth, you start by doing something about inequality—a better spread of wealth, putting the middle and working class in a better position to spend and increasing aggregate demand, something that will flow through to workers' wages. We know that inequality is not inevitable. While they are macro trends, policy interventions can do something about it. The problem is that the corporate tax cuts before the House pour fuel on the fire; they make things worse. The Treasurer, noted economic expert, told AM yesterday that his corporate tax cuts would 'help resolve inequality issues' like they're some kind of magical economic elixir. It's not medicine; it's fuel for the fires of growing inequality.


To understand why this is, let's look at how economic forecasters have responded to Donald Trump's tax cuts. CNBC's Fed survey asked US forecasters how US corporations will respond to the reduction in the US corporate rate. Just 12 per cent of respondents believed that it would be spent on increased wages, the position of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. A little more, 23 per cent, thought that it would be spent on capex, investing in the capital of companies; 13 per cent thought it would be spent on debt recovery, ultimately increasing the profit take; and 36 per cent thought it would be spent on share buybacks and special dividends. These forecasters believe that the bulk of that tax cut will go to increasing returns on capital. I'll give you a tip: that won't make inequality any better. Overall, just eight per cent of the 40 respondents, who include economists, strategists and fund managers, say that workers would benefit the most from Donald Trump's tax cuts. Fifty-four per cent said that it would be shareholders and executives. That is the impact of these bills on inequality.


At the same time, we note that the government is increasing the Medicare levy for seven million Australian workers. The Prime Minister will increase taxes for everyone earning over $21,000 a year—of course, that won't be the case for millionaires, though; they lost their deficit reduction levy, meaning that they will get a tax cut of about $21,000 a year, but let's just park that. These measures mean that tax increases under this government will be worn by police, firemen, tradesmen and teachers, while there will be tax cuts for millionaires, multinational corporations and our banks.


One of the refrains that we've heard is that these measures are necessary because we need to follow Donald Trump's America. Because they have reduced their corporate tax cut, the competitiveness of the Australian economy demands that we follow suit. Let's look at our competitiveness as an investment destination. We know that company tax is far from a determinative factor in investment decisions, otherwise you wouldn't be seeing the volume of investment in Australia from jurisdictions with lower corporate tax rates than we have in Australia today. It would not make sense if it was a determinative factor that jurisdictions with lower corporate tax rates invested in Australia, with a higher corporate tax rate. We know that company tax is just one of a range of considerations that drive investment decisions. Corporates want to know whether they can make a return, and that depends on the location of resources needed to make a return, natural and people resources, the strength of institutions to protect returns, security of investment, the skills of the domestic population, macroeconomic conditions and stability of the policy and regulatory environment. You can imagine the kinds of policy interventions that the government might be considering, taking those elements into consideration, to attract more foreign investment to Australia. A competent government would be a good start. A government that wasn't constantly flip-flopping and backflipping, as is characteristic of the Turnbull government, would probably help. A stable energy policy that wasn't driven by the troglodytes on the coalition back bench would also make a contribution.


But, even if we take tax alone, let's look at how Australia compares with the US. The US Congressional Budget Office prepared analysis to inform debate in the United States in March 2017 titled International comparisons of corporate income tax rates. They noted that the corporate statutory tax rate is one of many features in the tax system that influence corporate behaviour but, importantly, noted:


Because of their broader scope, average and effective corporate tax rates are better indicators of a company's incentives to invest in a particular country than is the statutory corporate tax rate.


This report didn't just look at the nominal rate; it also looked at what was actually paid. That analysis, which is free for everyone to see, put Australia's rate in the lower half of the G20. The paper pointed out that, while the headline rate was 30 per cent in 2012, the average rate for Australia was 17 per cent and the effective rate was 10.4 per cent. Indeed, the report used Australia as an example of why the US needed to cut its corporate tax rate. Finally, this bill before the chamber is the wrong plan for budget repair in Australia. 


The provisions in this bill represent a significant structural deterioration of the budget over the medium term. Remember the glory days of the Abbott opposition when they had a shadow minister for debt reduction? On the watch of the current Deputy Prime Minister and former member Andrew Robb—remember the debt and deficit disaster, the budget emergency and the debt truck?—the deficit has blown out and debt has crashed through the half-a-trillion-dollar tax mark. They like to say we need to cut corporate taxes because that's what the Keating government did. Well, the Keating government didn't do unfunded corporate tax rate cuts. They did the hard work of funding it. One of the more annoying features of being a Labor MP these days is being lectured about the legacy of the Hawke-Keating government by people who have no idea what that legacy is. 


We should recall that when the Hawke-Keating government reduced corporate taxes they introduced a fringe benefits tax, they introduced a capital gains tax and they put an end to the bottom-of-the-harbour lurks and perks. They funded the corporate tax cut. In response to that, an editorial in The Australian in 1985 attacked Labor for class warfare and said the tax package which cut corporate taxes represented a bias against business. The Business Council of Australia labelled that government 'anti-business'. The more things change, the more they stay the same. Labor are committed to a taxation policy that doesn't do unfunded corporate tax cuts. We've looked at whether there are inefficiencies in the taxation system—negative gearing, super concessions and the taxation treatment of trusts—and we've acted responsibly on those fronts. We have a plan for the Australian economy, not an ideological blinker.

Mr JOSH WILSON
 (Fremantle) (17:16):  I'm glad to speak on this bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017, and I oppose the tax cuts for big business. Labor oppose the tax cuts to big business because they are irresponsible. In doing that we are trying to save the government from itself. We're trying to save Australian households, especially low- and middle-income Australians, from bearing the burden of this revenue giveaway. That is what it is. I agree with everything the member for Gellibrand just said. The government is proposing to give away $65 billion. It's going to create a structural hole in the budget. It hasn't done anything to repair that. It's not part of some comprehensive set of tax measures that produces some sort of fiscal balance or some balance in terms of its effect across the broader economy—the real economy and its effect on households. That point was made on Q&A the other night by Heather Ridout in saying that this is really a crude tax giveaway. It does not fit into any kind of larger plan for the Australian economy. 


These tax cuts will result in current and future revenue burdens falling elsewhere. That's been the case whenever these things have been done. The OECD has observed that, where corporate tax rates have been cut, consumption taxes, VATs and GSTs inevitably go up to make up for the hole that's created in taking away revenue that is rightly, fairly and equitably derived from big businesses. Those taxes—VATs, GSTs and consumption taxes—are regressive taxes, and they fall hardest on the poor; they fall hardest on those who have the least. I note that the Tax Justice Network has said in relation to corporate tax cuts, particularly for big business and multinationals, that:


Governments make up shortfalls [from corporation tax cuts] by levying higher taxes on other, less wealthy sections of society, or by cutting back on essential public services, so tax 'competition' boosts inequality and deprivation.


A number of Labor speakers have made that point. 


If you look at the proposed tax cuts, if you were a person sitting at their kitchen table or driving their car or in their workplace and you were looking at the issue of giving away corporate tax cuts, particularly to big business and multinationals, you would be sensible to back up a step. You'd be sensible to ask: what exactly is the problem that a massive and unprecedented tax giveaway to big business is trying to address? What is the burning need to take $65 billion of revenue, to create that kind of structural hole in the budget, to create that burden that will fall elsewhere in Australian society?


I think most people have a sense of the challenges we face. We know that workers' share of national income is at a record low. We have falling real wages. We have rising inequality. Just to give a sense of how bad inequality in Australia has become, the top one per cent of Australians in terms of wealth and assets now own more than the bottom 70 per cent altogether. There's no way you can look at that kind of outcome and say that this is a system that's working, that this is a system that is delivering outcomes as it was designed to or as would be fair. That kind of outcome is not the result of a fair system; it's not even the result of a meritocracy. It is a grossly distorted system in which one per cent of Australians can own more than the bottom 70 per cent put together. Yet this kind of measure will only exacerbate that.


So, we have rising inequality. We have record underemployment. And under this government—despite, as the member for Gellibrand pointed out, making their run for government on the basis of an apparent debt emergency—debt has more than doubled, to now more than $500 billion. What's more, there's evidence of significant tax avoidance, especially for large multinationals. If you take all those challenges together, how on earth would any reasonable person think that the solution would be to cut corporate taxes for the biggest and most profitable companies in Australia, including a significant number of foreign multinational companies? How on earth could you think that giving away $65 billion of precious revenue, which we need for essential services, at a time when the budget is already significantly in the red, and cutting penalty rates to low-income workers and increasing the tax for people under $87,000 could possibly be regarded as the way to address those challenges?


Any sensible person knows that when you forgo taxes it's the same from a budgetary position as spending money. Any time you give up revenue, you want to do so on the basis that there's a very sound reason for doing that. You're giving away public funds, and in this case you're creating a hole that will endure into the future. The government has said that they have good reason for doing that, and I think that's the kind of thing everyone who comes and participates in this debate ought to consider. What we already know about the $65 billion giveaway is that it will increase government debt. We know that when you give away $65 billion to big companies—multinationals—that is funding that cannot be used for health and education, for crisis housing and homelessness support services, or for the social safety welfare net.


That's the first thing. That's a given. But the government said, 'We've got to do this, because it's the only way we can stimulate economic growth, it's the only way we can create jobs and it's the only way we can get a higher investment flow into Australia.' There is no basis for any of those three arguments. The government hasn't put anything forward on that front. There is no independent economic analysis. There are no economic commentators who will back in those claims.


Are big businesses struggling under the existing tax burden? Is there any evidence that big businesses in Australia are at the point of collapse? There isn't. We're living at a time when large businesses are making record profits. There is no evidence of widespread business struggles or difficulties. There's in fact the reverse. There's evidence that large companies in particular are doing very well. They're not sharing that success. There's no flowthrough to wages. But they're certainly recording record profits. We know from the 2015 ATO data in relation to this question of whether business is labouring under some inordinate tax burden that one in three private companies paid no tax in that relevant tax year. One in four public corporate entities paid no tax, one in three private companies and one in four public companies paid no tax and fully half of the foreign companies operating in Australia, by some accounting method or other, had no taxable income.


We also know, as the member for Gellibrand and a number of other Labor people in this debate have pointed out, that companies in Australia couldn't possibly complain about the tax burden they face if they had regard for the tax burden that exists in comparable economies. The relevant comparator group is the G20. We are the 13th-largest economy in the world. We sit in that group of developed economies that make up the 20 largest economies. When the US Congressional Budget Office undertook its analysis, it showed that Australia is average or even below average in terms of tax burden. That judgement does not take account of the impact of our innovative dividend imputation arrangements, which are calculated to have the effect of removing taxable burden by about a third. So there's no case to be made that the Australian taxation position with respect to companies is unduly or comparatively burdensome. There's no evidence that companies are desperate for a tax cut. There's just nothing of that kind.


That obviously goes to the question about whether or not making this kind of tax giveaway is necessary or even assists in relation to investor flows. Again, there's no evidence of that. Companies invest in Australia for a whole range of reasons. In some cases, if you think about the resources that Australia holds, they invest here because we have those resources. Someone doesn't come here to look at an LNG play or to consider developing an iron ore resource because of the tax position. They come here because we are blessed to have a lot of natural riches in those ways. A more responsible government would be ensuring that the general economic framework in this country supports new kinds of investment in the future—investment in things like renewable energy. That would be a much more prudent way of spending scarce government funds than giving away $65 billion at a stroke.


There's no evidence that tax cuts, particularly tax cuts of this exorbitant magnitude, do anything much for growth. The government's own numbers indicate that the tax cuts would deliver about one per cent of growth over 20 years.

It will put the needs of future Australian governments to derive revenue to pay for essential services on households and take them from large companies, particularly multinational companies that are already profitable and already have countless ways of avoiding the tax they have to pay. I'm glad to oppose it.
