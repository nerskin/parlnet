1 Mr Nikolic: To move:


That this House notes:


(1) with concern that Tasmania has the lowest gross state product per capita in Australia, the nation's highest unemployment rate, the lowest proportion of adults in the nation who have attained a year 12 qualification, one of the lowest retention rates to year 12, the lowest population growth, and the highest proportion of Australians without superannuation coverage;


(2) that Tasmania has enormous potential with productive land, a skilled and willing work force and people with a strong commitment to improve the state's economy by endeavour and hard work; and


(3) that the Federal Coalition's Economic Growth Plan for Tasmania, promised in the election campaign and reiterated in Her Excellency the Governor-General's speech opening the 44th Parliament, will provide the architecture to help turn Tasmania's economy around and encourage long term, sustainable employment.

2 Mr S. P. Jones: To move:


That this House notes that:


(1) as identified by Infrastructure Australia, we are an urban nation with four-fifths of our population and economic activity occurring in our cities;


(2) Australia's growing cities have a strategic need for greater public transport capacity to meet the growing transport task, ease urban road congestion and ensure improved national productivity;


(3) this urban transport task is a joint Australian and state government responsibility;


(4) recognising this, Labor in government invested $13 billion—more Commonwealth funding for public transport than all other governments since Federation—and this investment in urban transport projects, put forward and assessed through Infrastructure Australia, resulted in a significant boost to the strategic development of Australia's public transport network; and


(5) urban public transport projects including the Brisbane Cross River Rail project, the Perth Public Transport Package and the Tansley Park Public Transport Package in Adelaide are nationally significant projects and are not guaranteed to proceed without Australian Government funding.

That this House:


(1) celebrates the success of Rural Clinical Schools (RCS) around Australia, commenced in 1999 by the then Minister for Health, the Hon. Dr Michael Wooldridge MP, and continued by his successor, the Hon. Tony Abbott MP;


(2) notes that:


(a) RCS were designed to overcome the maldistribution of all doctors including general practitioners across Australia, which left country regions short of general practitioners and other specialty doctors;


(b) students undertaking training in rural locations have academic results that are equal to or better than their metropolitan counterparts;


(c) published data from public universities show high rates of RCS graduates working in, or intending to work in rural areas; and 


(d) the information gathered through an independent project tracking all Australian and New Zealand medical students—Medical Schools Outcomes Database—demonstrates that long term placements in a rural setting through RCS have a significant impact on the vocational choice and intention to practice in a rural or remote setting as well as future career specialty focus; and


(3) calls on the Government to:


(a) continue its support for these excellent initiatives; and


(b) examine opportunities to increase intern and postgraduate training places in rural locations to enhance the future of specialty medical service delivery with a focus on general practitioners in rural and regional Australia. (Notice given 20November 2013.)

"Nikolic, Andrew, MP",LP,2013-12-02,"




Mr NIKOLIC
 (Bass) (10:02):  I move:


That this House notes:


(1) with concern that Tasmania has the lowest gross state product per capita in Australia, the nation's highest unemployment rate, the lowest proportion of adults in the nation who have attained a year 12 qualification, one of the lowest retention rates to year 12, the lowest population growth, and the highest proportion of Australians without superannuation coverage;


(2) that Tasmania has enormous potential with productive land, a skilled and willing work force and people with a strong commitment to improve the state's economy by endeavour and hard work; and


(3) that the Federal Coalition's Economic Growth Plan for Tasmania, promised in the election campaign and reiterated in Her Excellency the Governor-General's speech opening the 44th Parliament, will provide the architecture to help tum Tasmania's economy around and encourage long term, sustainable employment.


As I reflected on the Governor-General's speech to open the 44th Parliament, I did so with mixed feelings when Tasmania was mentioned—mixed feelings because, although it was important to highlight Tasmania's dire situation, I was sad at the fact that we are in such a predicament that urgent action is needed. As the motion makes clear, Tasmania lags behind the nation on almost every objective indicator that measures growth in the federation. Our unemployment rate is the highest. Our participation rate is the lowest. The figures are even worse when fly-in fly-out workers are considered.


Since 2010 11,000 full-time jobs have been lost in Tasmania—coincidentally, the year of the last state election and the year Labor and the Greens began their political alliance. We have the lowest proportion of private-sector employment compared with public-sector employment, and that balance must change with the creation of more private-sector jobs. We also have the lowest life expectancy, the longest elective surgery waiting times and the highest proportion of people without superannuation accounts.


Tasmania is desperate for policy coherence between the state and federal governments to respond to these challenges, but that has rarely occurred during the last six years. I recall, for example, my predecessor in this parliament standing up to talk about a new $1 million building at the Ringarooma primary school that he had opened—at precisely the same time that the state Labor government and the Greens education minister within the Labor cabinet were planning to close the Ringarooma primary school. I recall former health minister Nicola Roxon in Launceston announcing new beds for northern Tasmanian hospitals—at precisely the same time that the Launceston General Hospital was closing two wards because the state government had ripped $39 million out of the health budget. These are clear cases of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing. Despite Labor promises over 15 years at state level and six years at the federal level, major policy problems continue.


It is no surprise, therefore, that Tasmanians resoundingly voted for change on 7 September. The Labor Party now only hold one House of Representatives seat, whereas just three years ago they held all five. As King John said, 'We cannot paint the lily.' Economically and on social measures, Tasmania is in decline. The Greens party tell us that niche industries are the answer—woodcraft, movie making and electric cars. Even the state MHA for Bass talked about a blueberry led recovery for Tasmania's economy. There is nothing wrong with any of those activities, but none of them will provide significant long-term sustainable jobs for Tasmanians. I am yet to meet one young person in Tasmania who aspires to a career as a solar polisher or a wind farm attendant.


There used to be agreement across this chamber that Greens policies are disconnected from economic reality. But with Greens ministers in the Labor cabinet in Hobart we can no longer say that. Labor in Tasmania are captive to the Greens, divided amongst themselves and fixated on trendy social issues rather than on the economy. The Labor-Greens government has strangled industries such as forestry, with approximately half the state locked up, yet every year Australia imports $2 billion in forestry products. And, if you add paper to that equation, we import $4 billion from countries where the environmental practices are nowhere near as sustainable as ours. Yet the Greens clamour for even more preservation. Their definition of 'preservation' is 'no use at all'.


There is of course a world of difference between preservation and conservation, the latter allowing natural resources to be used in a sustainable way. As Bill Gammage wrote, 'Unmanaged forests are dirty forests.' He points out that Aboriginals regenerated the land through fire. The Greens' dogmatic policies to lock up forests vastly increase the fire hazard and, ironically, the potential damage to flora and fauna. Tasmania needs less Greens dogma; it needs a strong, stable majority government with a long-term plan for jobs and growth.


The state Liberals under Will Hodgman have a plan to build a modern economy based on our competitive strengths, to create jobs, fix the budget mess, encourage investment, rebuild essential services and cut the red and green tape. It also means no more deals with the Greens, much less with Greens party members in cabinet. Liberal leader Will Hodgman is the only leader who has made that pledge.


By comparison, Labor Premier Lara Giddings was asked if she would welcome Greens MPs back into the cabinet if she won the election next year. Her reply was unambiguous: 'Absolutely.' Even Labor politicians in Tasmania deplore her approach, with Premier Lara Giddings's own parliamentary secretary calling for her to resign and for Labor never again to enter into a deal with the Greens.


Many good, hardworking Tasmanians who grew up as Labor supporters have shaken their head at Labor's betrayal. Well, the electorate did not forget on 7 September and they will not forget in March, when Lara Giddings finally faces the verdict of the Tasmanian electorate.


I have painted a bleak but accurate picture of the current Tasmanian political and economic scene. The next Tasmanian state election will confront voters with a stark choice: do they want four more years at the bottom of the national economic and social tables—four more years of young Tasmanians literally crying as they pack their belongings onto the ferry at Devonport, simply because they cannot get a local job?


Tasmania needs a business-friendly government committed to reducing red and green tape in both Canberra and Tasmania; the regeneration of value-adding industries, such as forestry, mining and agriculture; and the extraction of greater value from the things that we produce, particularly timber and agricultural commodities. We only retain approximately 25 per cent of the value of primary industry production. Wouldn't it be wonderful to have local markets in Tasmania for our agricultural products where we can value-add and export?


One particular opportunity, about which I have written in the past, is enhancing the DSTO facility at Scottsdale. It is a small but innovative centre, looking at rations and nutrition for our Defence Force, but I believe there are great opportunities to expand its potential. Australia has always been a first responder in terms of providing emergency aid in our region. We are good at this because of the ready cooperation between the ADF and civilian organisations, including aid groups. But one area where we could do more is in providing non-perishable food aid as one of Australia's response options. That is an often immediate need, as we have seen recently in the Philippines. The DSTO facility has the expertise and is located in an area that is renowned for food production, and I believe there is great capacity for a well-targeted expansion of DSTO Scottsdale to respond to this humanitarian need.


The coalition's economic growth plan for Tasmania was announced by the now Prime Minister on 15 August 2013. Elements of that plan include the establishment of a Tasmanian major projects approval agency in Launceston as a one-stop shop; incentives for employers to take on the long-term unemployed; and a joint Commonwealth and Tasmanian economic council. The plan includes a joint Productivity Commission and ACCC review into Tasmania's shipping costs, the competitiveness of our freight industry structure, and improving the equity of the Tasmanian freight and passenger vehicle equalisation schemes. I am prompted to ask rhetorically, why is it that it takes a coalition federal government to recognise the economic barrier of Bass Strait? It is simple: it was the Fraser government that introduced the Tasmanian freight equalisation scheme. The member for Franklin shakes her head, but that is a fact. It was the Howard government that established the passenger vehicle equalisation scheme, and it has taken the election of the Abbott government to commission this important review.


The regions of Australia contribute so much to our national economy. They always have, and they continue to do so in the 21st century. With a population that has shifted massively to the larger cities over the last 50 years, we tend to forget the contribution our regional based industries—forestry, mining, agriculture and a significant portion of manufacturing—makes to the national account. Well, we on this side of the House will never forget them. I am proud to be part of a government for all of Australia, and I thank the House for this opportunity to highlight Tasmania's needs.

WYATT ROY
 (Longman) (10:11):  It is a great honour to second this motion from the member for Bass. In seconding this motion, I welcome the new member to this chamber and say that the electors of Bass are incredibly lucky to have a member who brings an enormous amount of professional experience to this place and somebody who brings an enormous amount of dedication, perseverance and energy. They are very lucky to have the new member in this place representing their interests. And I think this motion goes to that point. As the member for Bass pointed out, Tasmania is a great state with great opportunity. And as the motion itself says, Tasmania has enormous potential, with productive land, a skilled and willing workforce and people with a strong commitment to improve the state's economy by endeavour and hard work.


It does have a bright future, but unfortunately the people of Tasmania have suffered, as have the people of Australia, over the last few years under the awful concoction of a Labor-Greens government. As the member for Bass pointed out in his speech, there was a time in this place when there was agreement across the chamber that the major political parties would reject the insane economic policies of the Greens. Tasmania, unfortunately, has not seen the Labor Party reject those bad economic policies and those disastrous idealistic views that have a real impact on people's lives. Instead, they have seen the Labor-Greens government come to fruition in Tasmania by embracing those disastrous economic policies, and this has had a real impact on the people of Tasmania.


Perhaps I can take a moment to go through what this actually means for the people of Tasmania, because it is very stark and it is appropriate to remind the House and the rest of Australia what happens when Labor and the Greens jump into bed with each other on the Treasury benches. Tasmania has the lowest life expectancy of any state. It has the highest underemployment rate of any state. It has the lowest workforce participation rate in Australia, approximately four to five percentage points below the national average. It has the lowest proportion of private sector employment compared with public sector employment, and that clearly demonstrates the ideological divide between the two sides of politics.


Tasmania has the lowest gross state product per capita in Australia, about 20 per cent below the national average. Private business investment in Tasmania is only 1.3 per cent of Australia's total private business investment. Tasmania has the highest proportion of the population with a low-income card receiving an age pension, a disability support pension, Newstart allowance, parenting payment single, parenting payment partnered or youth allowance. It has the highest proportion of dwellings provided for housing owned by either the state or federal government of any other state. And it has the highest proportion of people without superannuation coverage.


In short, what has happened since the election of the Labor-Greens government in 2010 is the loss of approximately 10,000 jobs, a shrinking economy and a declining population. What Tasmania needs is a government with a cohesive, clear and direct economic plan. And that is exactly what the coalition government here in Canberra is prepared to deliver. With, hopefully, the election of a majority Liberal government in Hobart we will see the two levels of government working to correct the course that the Labor-Greens government has set in Tasmania.


We understand that great creators of wealth and prosperity in our nation are not the bureaucrats in Canberra and not the people pulling the strings of the bureaucracy in Hobart. The Australian people are the great creators of wealth and prosperity. The wealth creators are the small business owners, the family enterprises, the corner shops—people prepared to take on some risk, to go out there and have a go and to try and achieve something. And they will not be helped to achieve that through higher taxes or greater regulation. And whenever the Labor Party and the Greens get into bed with each other, that is exactly what we see.


Our economic plan for Tasmania will result in higher growth, more jobs and rising living standards. It is really important that, in a state like Tasmania, we re-engage those valued industries rather than victimise them—industries like forestry, mining and agriculture. That is why you are seeing a very strong commitment from the coalition government to invest in that productivity capacity and increase infrastructure by creating a one-stop shop in Launceston. I am really proud to be part of a government that understands that less government is the solution, not more government.

Ms COLLINS
 (Franklin) (10:17):  I rise to speak on this motion, moved by the member for Bass. I agree with previous speakers that Tasmania does indeed have some challenges. But we need to be working together on those challenges not bagging the state of Tasmania, not talking down the state, not talking about all the problems in Tasmania, but actually looking at the opportunities that Tasmania has as a unique place, which other members from Tasmania would know. We have some great industries in which we can invest.


It was interesting that the first eight minutes of the 10-minute speech from the member for Bass were all about the state government and not about what his new federal Liberal government was going to do for Tasmania. He got to that in the last two minutes. But the reason that he cannot talk about that is that they are ripping hundreds of millions of dollars out of our state. They are ripping it out in infrastructure funding. They are ripping it out in rail funding. They are ripping it out in freight funding. We know that. Road funding to Tasmania almost doubled under the previous government, the federal Labor government. It went from around $400 million over the five years of the funding cycle to $810 million. That created jobs and constructed roads to increase our productivity.


We also had a package to deal with the freight situation in Tasmania. That was worth $40 million, $25 million to be delivered before Christmas, to allow some of those bigger and expanding industries to become more productive and get stuff across Bass Strait, because we know what an impediment that is. But the new government's solution, as we have heard, is a Productivity Commission inquiry. The last Productivity Commission inquiry said to scrap the trade equalisation scheme—




Mr Nikolic:
  Madam Speaker, I ask the member to yield and explain which industries are expanding in Tasmania.



The SPEAKER:  Do you accept the question, member for Franklin?




Ms COLLINS:
  No, I do not. But I am happy to talk about expanding industries: industries like the salmon industry and agriculture, which are expanding in our state. We have been investing in the salmon industry and it is expanding. It will grow to be a billion-dollar industry for Tasmania. Does your laughter indicate that you do not support the salmon industry in Tasmania? Is that what it means?


We do support the salmon industry in Tasmania. We invested in it and it is creating jobs in Tasmania now.


Because of the jobs situation in Tasmania, we announced a $100 million jobs and growth package to support 2,500 jobs in 31 projects right across the state. What have we seen from the new government? They will not say if they are going to put that money in—$25 million a year over four years—like we said we would. There has been no indication of when or how that money will be delivered. Two and a half thousand Tasmanian jobs are relying on that money. It is very important to Tasmanians and they want to know when that money will be delivered, and they should be told when it is going to be delivered, because those jobs are so important for Tasmanians.


We did not hear from them any discussion about the NBN in Tasmania—the National Broadband Network. The National Broadband Network has been rolling out in Tasmania, and Tasmania was going to be the first state to have the NBN connected to the majority of premises in the state—200,000 premises were to have the NBN connected. It was, of course, slowed down due to asbestos, and we needed to be safe. But for the last three months under this government we have seen it almost halt. There has been virtually no construction at all, and we know what is coming next. Next, the NBN will not be going to people's premises; it will only be going to nodes in the street. You will not deliver on your commitment to deliver fibre to the premises in Tasmania. I hope I am wrong, but I certainly do not think that is the case.


We also saw other investments in Tasmania by the previous government, like the Midland Highway. We made a commitment of $500 million over 10 years. What have we had from those opposite? Only $400 million. There is $100 million missing from the Midland Highway funding.


I will now turn to two projects in my electorate, both of which are very important for safety. One in particular is the Summerleas Road/Huon Highway intersection—$17 million. It is very important for my community. It was promised by the Liberal candidate in the 2010 campaign, but now it looks like it will not be delivered. We cannot get an answer on whether or not it is happening, because I do not think the government knows.


They have also announced ripping out the SchoolKids Bonus to Tasmanians. It is very important for the Tasmanian economy. Next year 34,000 Tasmanian families will have children going to school and they do not know whether they are going to be getting that funding. They do not know whether they are going to be able to afford to pay for their kids' uniforms, because the new government wants to rip out the SchoolKids Bonus—34,000 families at an average of $15,000 per family over the life of their schooling. It is very important for the Tasmanian economy, and here the new government is ripping it away.


In recent days we have also seen confusion over Gonski funding—the funding for our schools. It is very important to have a good education. If you want good jobs, a good economy, and productivity in the state, you need children to be educated, and educated well. It is important money going into our state and the new government wants to take it away from Tasmanian schools and Tasmanian students. Are the new members for Bass, Braddon and Lyons going to stand up and tell Tasmanian families that they are going to rip money out from schools, as well as the SchoolKids Bonus? That's right, some of the government schools in Tasmania really rely on this funding. Students in low socioeconomic areas who rely on this funding want to know what is happening with their education funding—kids who are going to school in February next year. Some of the schools do not know what is going to be happening. They have been told, 'Yes, just 12 months, not four years.' How on earth are families supposed to plan for their children's schooling.


Then there is crime-prevention funding—some of the diversionary programs for kids at risk of not being in the workforce and kids at risk of not going to school. The crime-prevention funds are there. They were announced—a program that happens regularly. Community organisations, including in the electorate of Bass, are relying on that funding for diversionary projects for kids who are really struggling and need that support.




Mr Nikolic:
  Shameful.




Ms COLLINS:
  Yes, it is shameful, member for Bass. It is shameful that you are ripping that money out. It is shameful that you are ripping hundreds of millions of dollars out of the state of Tasmania and you are not being honest with the Tasmanian people about what you are doing.



Government members interjecting—




Ms COLLINS:
  They keep talking about the state government. Yes, the state government and the state have some challenges. But they are the new federal government and instead of investing in Tasmania they are ripping money out. Regarding this economic development plan, I have had a look at the funding for this. They are putting in $2 million in the current financial year. They are ripping out hundreds of millions of dollars and putting in $2 million. That is it: $2 million in the current financial year from their economic development plan.


What else have we heard about their economic development plan? The one-stop shop: I hate to tell them but it already exists. The state government already has one. It is called the Economic Diversification Task. It already works with major projects and proponents to actually invest in Tasmania. It already exits. Your wage subsidy? It already exists—$5,900. It is called Wage Connect. It is already there. We have had no comment from the other side about how many Tasmanians they expect to employ with their wage subsidy or whether it is in addition to the former government's subsidy or is instead of it—because, of course, it is much lower.


Who would know what is going to happen? Who would know the new government is not being honest with the Tasmanian people about its plans? The economic diversification plan does not actually detail what it is going to do—as I said, only $2 million is committed in the current financial year, ripping out hundreds of millions of dollars in road funding, freight funding, rail funding, crime prevention funding, school funding and the SchoolKids Bonus.




Mr Nikolic:
  You're just making it up.




Ms COLLINS:
  I am not making this up, Member for Bass. This is real. This is what you are ripping out of our state of Tasmania. This is money coming out of the state of Tasmania, along with the NBN not being delivered. Tasmanians deserve better. I will hold you to account on your commitments to increase funding in Tasmania, and I really hope that happens.


We have had some interesting comments from our state government recently, which has announced some stimulus to turn the Tasmanian economy around, which already is showing some green shoots coming through. There are great opportunities, as I said at the beginning of my speech, and we should be talking together about what we can do for our state. We should be talking about how we can improve the state of Tasmania, not talking about how dire it is or the problems that exist. Rather than talking about all the issues that Tasmania has we should be looking at the opportunities of those industries that are growing, such as the salmon industry and the aquaculture industry. I have plenty of them in my electorate and I visit them regularly. There are great plans for expansion underway in Macquarie Harbour, in the member for Braddon's electorate. Industry does continue to grow in Tasmania and there are industries that are thriving. What we need to do is work together to invest in them. We need to be investing in the state of Tasmania, not ripping money out or being dishonest with the Tasmanian people, as we have seen from the new government, about what is going on in Tasmania and what will happen to the Tasmanian people under the current government.

"Hendy, Peter, MP",LP,2013-12-02,"



Dr HENDY
 (Eden-Monaro) (10:26):  I rise to support the motion of the member for Bass. Honourable members will know that I am not from Tasmania myself, but, indeed, my electorate of Eden-Monaro is in the great state of New South Wales. However, I am supporting the motion for two reasons: firstly, while the member for Bass would have preferred for either the member for Lyons or the member for Braddon to be in a position to speak today about the motion and second the motion, the traditions of this House, whereby they are to refrain from speaking on substantive motions prior to giving their first speeches, have prevented them from doing so. I know they were keen to speak on the motion and I am sure that they will have an opportunity in the future.



Government members interjecting—




Dr HENDY:
  They should buy tickets for the future!



A government member:  Buy tickets tomorrow, Julie!




Dr HENDY:
  Secondly, I am also very happy to speak to the issues at hand because, as a member also representing a rural and regional electorate in this parliament, I know that there are particular problems that Tasmania faces that the coalition is committed to dealing with.


As the motion states, the House notes:


(1) with concern that Tasmania has the lowest gross state product per capita in Australia, the nation's highest unemployment rate, the lowest proportion of adults in the nation who have attained a year 12 qualification, one of the lowest retention rates to year 12, the lowest population growth, and the highest proportion of Australians without superannuation coverage;


Further, despite this record, 'Tasmania has enormous potential'. Because of this potential, the motion notes:


(3) that the Federal Coalition's Economic Growth Plan for Tasmania … will provide the architecture to help turn Tasmania's economy around and encourage long term, sustainable employment.


In my own first speech, I turned my attention to regional disadvantage. In that speech I spoke of the need to do the right thing by all people who live in regional areas. I said:


I hope to be a strong advocate in this parliament who can support both good economic policy and the regions. I certainly believe in economic reform, but let me say that I also believe that what I call the country-city compact, … that existed for the best part of 100 years in Australia, was a tragic victim of the reform agenda of the eighties, nineties and 2000s.


…   …   …


The country regions—


including those in Tasmania—


need a fair go. The compact recognised that there was an inextricable interdependence between the country and the city. It acknowledged that there was a mutual obligation that recognised the costs of living in the country. This has basically gone, and yet country regions remain vital to the nation.


In the case of Tasmania, the coalition has a specific plan to address the regional disadvantage. The coalition's economic growth plan for Tasmania will reset Tasmania's course to one of growth, new jobs and rising living standards. It is only through building a stronger economy that we can deliver the better future that Tasmania deserves—a future with more jobs, higher wages and better services.


The combination of Labor/Green minority governments in Canberra and Hobart has done enormous damage to the Tasmanian economy. Under Labor, no additional new jobs have been created. In fact, almost one in 10 full-time jobs have been lost under the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government. Tasmania needs real action to create jobs. 


The new coalition government plans to restore confidence in and change the economic trajectory of Tasmania. The coalition's economic growth plan for Tasmania will create a Tasmanian major projects approval agency, expand Hobart International Airport, secure Hobart as a world centre for Antarctic and Southern Ocean research, establish a joint Commonwealth and Tasmanian economic council, upgrade the Midland Highway, review the equity and effectiveness of the Tasmanian freight equalisation and Bass Strait passenger vehicle equalisation schemes, and create a fruit and vegetable industry task force, amongst other policies.


This is a strong plan for growth and jobs that builds on the discussion paper that was developed by the Liberal Tasmanian senators and candidates, including the member for Bass, following extensive consultations across Tasmania. At the last election, the coalition offered the people of Tasmania a plan to build a strong, prosperous economy and a better future for all. The election of the members for Bass, Braddon and Lyons indicates that the electorate heard that message and want the coalition's plan to be implemented. So, in conclusion, I commend this motion to the House.

"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2013-12-02,"



Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR
 (Gorton) (10:31):  I rise to speak to this motion. I do also acknowledge the fact that the member for Bass is moving the motion, for the very first time. Clearly he denied the opportunity for the members for Braddon and Lyons to speak on this, because he is aware that they have not given their first speech yet. It would have been, I think, more appropriate and more collegial if he had waited until next Monday to move this motion, because what he has done is to deny his own side's representatives in Tasmania the opportunity to speak on the Tasmanian economy. I would say to the members for Lyons and Braddon, 'Watch out for the member for Bass; obviously he is not what you would call a team player.' 


I have heard a few things already in this chamber in relation to this matter, but let us just go through some of the things that have actually happened rather than the speculation that has been articulated by those opposite. Firstly, it was Labor that put forward a $100 million jobs and growth plan for Tasmania, not the Liberals. It was Labor that invested in the $17 million North West and Northern Tasmania Innovation and Investment Fund. That fund leveraged millions of dollars, and not only sustained businesses across the state, particularly in the north and north-west, but allowed them to ensure that they could provide support for businesses in that area. It was Labor that actually—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Mitchell
):  Order!




Mr Nikolic:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask if the member for Gorton would yield and tell me: which industries and businesses specifically have had a growth in jobs in Tasmania?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Just to give you some advice, questions are only permitted on orders of the day. This is not an order of the day.



An honourable member:  You're an L-plater!



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Do not reflect on the chair. Member for Gorton, continue.




Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR:
  You have been in the place for a short time, and I give you that, but, really, you have had 10 minutes on this. You have denied your own Tasmanian colleagues, by not allowing it for next Monday, and you are actually now denying me the call because of your own inability to understand the standing orders.


The fact is that the Tasmanian economy does have some challenges; there is no doubt about that. But it does not help when you talk down your own state's economy. What is really needed here is constructive proposals about how we can provide support for Tasmanians.


I note that the motion that was authored by the member for Bass goes to a number of issues that I think are significant and genuine challenges for the Tasmanian people, one of which is the lowest proportion of adults in the nation who have obtained a year 12 qualification. That is a very serious matter that needs to be addressed. That seems to fly in the face of the recent comments by the Minister for Education and the Prime Minister to deny support to the Tasmanian education system to ensure we see an increase in the accreditation of year 12 students in Tasmania. The fact is there was the Gonski plan in place and a so-called 'unity ticket', as explained by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Education prior to the last election, and they have reneged on that promise. They have completely and utterly contradicted what they said before the election. The facts are these. We have a Prime Minister who has lied to the Australian people. He has lied to the Australian people on education. I quote Phil Coorey today in the Australian Financial Review: 'Like a slippery lawyer—




Mr Keenan:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It is a longstanding convention that we do not accuse each other of lying in this chamber. If the shadow minister wishes to do that, there are other forms in the House he can take advantage of. I call on him to withdraw.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Mitchell
):  Shadow minister?




Mr Brendan O'Connor:
  I am happy to withdraw. As Phil Coorey said in the Australian Financial Review today:


Like a slippery lawyer pointing to the fine print after the client had signed on the bottom line—




Mr Tudge:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. I do not know how this is relevant to the motion at hand in relation to the Tasmanian—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Aston will resume his seat. The member for Gorton may continue.




Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR:
  Phil Coorey wrote:


Like a slippery lawyer pointing to the fine print after the client had signed on the bottom line, the government is maintaining everyone else has got it wrong—the states, the journalists and a great deal of the education sector.


The fact is that the Prime Minister has completely and utterly contradicted the commitments he made before the election on 7 September. That is going to hurt the Tasmanian economy. It is going to hurt every student in Tasmania and you should hang your heads in shame.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2013-12-02,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (10:37):  It is a pleasure to rise on this important motion discussing the state of the Tasmanian economy. As has been outlined by other speakers in the debate, there are important systemic reasons the Tasmanian economy has struggled over recent decades. Tasmania has been excessively reliant, as Saul Eslake points out, on the production of essentially undifferentiated commodities seeking to compete solely on the basis of price. Saul Eslake talks about the difference in productivity. He points out that the output of goods and services per hour worked is about 8½ per cent lower in Tasmania than on the mainland, which translates into a $3,600 difference in annual per capita gross state product between Tasmania and the rest of Australia. Mr Eslake also points out that there has been a longstanding assumption in some policy circles that Tasmania's problems can be solved by a single big project, such as another pulp mill. He describes this as 'a cargo-cult mentality, not an economic development policy'.


One of the real challenges for Tasmania is in boosting quality and quantity in the education system. Far too few Tasmanians receive a complete school education, up to year 12. If you are looking for a reason Tasmanian productivity is 8½ per cent below mainland productivity, educational attainment is a big part of that. How do you achieve higher levels of educational attainment? One way is to make sure that parents have a bit of extra money on the first day of school. The SchoolKids Bonus provides precisely that—a means tested payment that assists parents with the cost of school. For someone living on the poverty line that $400 or $800—depending on whether your child is in primary or secondary school—is important in making sure that they are able to meet expenses; and it can, in some instances, make the difference between a child staying on at school or dropping out of school. But unfortunately those opposite are cutting the SchoolKids Bonus so they can give a large tax break to mining billionaires. I am not sure how many mining billionaires there are in Tasmania but I would hazard a guess that there are not many.


The abolition of the carbon price and the mining tax will cost $17 billion over the forward estimates. In order to make up for that hole in the budget, those opposite have to cut into services which are important for Tasmanians. They will have to get rid of the SchoolKids Bonus, which matters to Tasmania, and cut back on school funding. We have seen the Prime Minister's toing and froing on the weekend. When you are getting beaten up by your state premier mates and Andrew Bolt, you know you are in serious trouble—and that is where the Prime Minister found himself over the weekend. Of course, his pledge that no school would be worse off meant all Tasmanian schools. But we are not going to see that; we are going to see Tasmanian schools worse off, Tasmania being one of the jurisdictions that signed up under Labor to commit to not take state spending out of their education system as the federal government put money in.


There are important challenges for Tasmania and I do not think anyone wants to underplay those challenges—lower productivity, slower population growth over recent decades and, as Mr Eslake describes it, a mix of industrial composition which has not been good for growth over recent years. There are more sectors that have lost out from a strong Australian dollar and fewer sectors that have benefited from a mining boom. That presents important challenges for Tasmania which we need to address in a bipartisan manner.


The carbon price has been good for the Tasmanian state budget and Tasmanians have been beneficiaries of the carbon price. Getting rid of the carbon price is a mistake for Tasmania as it is for Australia's kids in the future. We want to focus on those challenges of the future for the benefit of all Australians.


Debate adjourned.

"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2013-12-02,"



Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Government Whip) (11:43):  I am very pleased to second this motion by the member for Murray. Rural clinical schools are often, as the member for Murray knows well, quite critical in providing the graduates so desperately needed in regional, rural and remote communities to deliver the services that are generally accepted as being standard in an urban or metropolitan environment. But in many parts of regional Australia the services that those communities need are not locally available. Specialist services are generally provided in areas of high population, but it is essential to get specialists as well out into major regional centres, including Bunbury in the south-west of WA. Even basic services are often in short supply in regional areas. Many country towns still struggle to retain services as basic as simply having a general practitioner on call. That is why the rural clinical school training program is so vital.


As the member said, it was designed in the late 1990s and introduced by the Howard government in the early 2000s to address the shortage of medical practitioners within rural, regional and remote Australia. In fact, I would argue that it is perhaps the only evidence based intervention developed to date that has had a measurable impact on the urban and rural maldistribution of doctors in Australia. The rural clinical school initiative is working and, as the member for Murray rightly pointed out, there is further work to do. It is a very practical response that works on the ground, and it does need continued support to do so.


We know that the aim of the program is to ensure effective medical student training, to be maintained in rural Australia. We hope that this continues to ensure the development and retention of that local medical workforce. The 25 per cent rate also ensures that we get young people—people of all ages—in the program. We want to recruit more students from rural regions to go back and stay in those areas to practise.


The rural clinical school is important, too, for students from urban backgrounds who have not had an experience in a regional area. They can find out just how rewarding it is to be any form of medical practitioner. But a GP in a small regional community is critical. I said to one group of people at the rural clinical school, 'In a regional community, the local GP is akin to God to families.' Where you go for the most critical thing for your family is medical treatment. Local communities, small communities, which do not have any medical support have absolute respect for their doctor. You have to feel it to actually understand it—and I understand it very well, as does the member for Murray. This positive experience is important, which is what the rural clinical school provides. 


In 2008, the rural clinical school in my part of WA won a national university teaching award for innovative curriculum and the Premier's Award for strengthening the state. That is how good it is. The program includes two cities in my electorate: Bunbury and Busselton. The Edith Cowan campus, which is in the same block, includes the South West Health Campus and the St John of God private hospital. It offers three fully-furnished homes. Accommodation is so important for the students who come out to rural and regional areas. They are just a walk away from the university and the hospitals. The Busselton office is located in Gale Street, which is only a five-minute walk from the Busselton Hospital and is fully furnished as well. A really important part of what this program delivers is the capacity for these students to enjoy their time and to form an affinity, a connection, to the community as well as an understanding of how important they are.


I commend the member for Murray for her motion. This is a practical approach. I understand the specific issues that she has raised in the second part of the motion regarding intern and specialty training places. This is a program that we who represent rural, regional and remote Australia understand as being critical to our local communities. There is very little that is more important than the health of families and individuals in our communities. It is the presence of local GPs, doctors and specialists across the board which helps our communities to function and keeps the members of our community safe and healthy. I commend the member for this motion. (Time expired)

"Chesters, Lisa, MP",ALP,2013-12-02,"



Ms CHESTERS
 (Bendigo) (11:48):  I wish to make a few comments in relation to this motion on rural clinical schools. When I saw the motion, I thought it was a great opportunity to highlight some of the opportunities that we have in Bendigo in relation to this issue. Access to health services in rural areas—as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker—is always a challenge. Whether it be health services or medical shortages, they are amongst the top issues facing our rural and regional communities.


We need to acknowledge the historic difficulties for Australians in rural and regional areas in accessing adequate health care, compared to our city counterparts. An example of this is clearly demonstrated when we look at our GP levels: 200 doctors per 100,000 people in regional Australia compared to 370 doctors in major cities. In other words, there is almost half the number of GPs in regional areas for a larger geographical area.


I only have to take a quick drive out of Bendigo to hit a small township where these issues are occurring in my electorate. So the question, of course, is: how do we fix this? I note the comments on the data from public universities that show higher rates of RCS graduates working or intending to work in rural areas. This is encouraging, but I believe that we can do better than 'intending to work' by looking at the medical places that we have and at new initiatives.


I take on board the comments that we do not need more medical students, but perhaps it is where we have our medical students in training that we need to address. Many in this chamber would know that La Trobe Bendigo is part of the Murray-Darling Medical School, which is an innovative new model of medical education in rural Australia. It is a joint initiative between La Trobe University and Charles Sturt University, and basically takes in the area in its name: the Murray-Darling. It is a new medical school and offers medical training in a regional campus from year 1 to year 5, which currently does not exist in Victoria. Under the model, it is basically 'grow your own', as we have just discussed here today. It is about taking regional students and training them in a regional setting in the hope and with the aim that these students will have careers in their regional towns and communities.


La Trobe Bendigo is already having this success. Under Labor, $40 million was spent on building the Rural School of Health. As another speaker referred to, we cannot talk about medicine and clinical placement for GPs alone; we need to consider the whole health profession. La Trobe is already training nurses, psychologists, dentists—in fact, every area of allied health—but the one area it does not have is medicine. Therefore, it is the missing jewel in the crown.


How successful have they been? La Trobe Bendigo is seeing more than 80 per cent of their health graduates go on to work in rural employment. So the model works. In the model to recruit in the regions, train in the regions, in every aspect of their training, and stay in the regions, so it is already working. This is by having the School of Rural Health. We have the facilities ready to train these extra doctors.


This is an astounding statistic, because we know, when we compare it to domestic students graduating from medical programs, fewer than 10 per cent are actually ending up in our regional communities. Some stay and some go. The ones that come from Monash to Bendigo describe their trip to Bendigo as being like a rural exchange. The word 'exchange' suggests that they are not there for long haul, and, whilst some may stay, many return to the city for their final year or for further clinical placement.


I agree with the comments in the media and the community that medical graduates cannot fix the rural workforce shortages if there are no jobs to go to. I agree with the statement that we need to expand our rural training capacity so that new doctors are not forced to return to the cities for their internships or specialty training. This is where Bendigo offers a unique opportunity with the building of its new hospital. This hospital does provide the opportunity for a larger workforce. It is doubling the number of beds that it has and therefore the number of patients that it will receive and therefore the workforce. (Time expired)

Mr BROADBENT
 (McMillan) (11:53):  The first thing I would like to do is congratulate the member for Murray in her continuing efforts to fight the good fight on behalf of regional Australia, particularly in regard to her own constituents, in that she has always put their health, wellbeing and future at the forefront of all her activity. I commend her for that and thank her for bringing this very important motion to the floor of the chamber.


Also I thank the member for Forrest, who never gives up in her pursuit of policies that benefit rural, regional and remote Australia. There are a number of us in this House, and I was pleased to hear the new member for Bendigo speak on behalf of rural and regional people. We cannot ever lose sight of the fact that the whole of Australia does not live on the eastern seaboard of this nation; in fact, they live in rural and remote places.


The best part about what the member for Murray has presented for us today is that—and I hope the people in the gallery hear this and those listening to this hear it—we are looking right now at and talking about something that has been a success. It has been supported by both sides of the House. It has been supported by two governments and now three governments in a row. It has worked. It has taken rural students—and if I get a chance I will quote three here—from a rural background, from rural activity and from rural, remote and regional areas and educated those people through our medical schools, and they have gone back into regional areas.


Every health minister in the past three governments has supported this proposal. In fact, it goes right back to Michael Wooldridge. Every health minister has supported this proposal, and it has been a success. What a pleasure it is to stand in the House of Representatives in this great nation, in this great south land, which has so much that is rural and remote about it. Our image of ourselves is about the rural and remote. The story we tell to the world is about the rural and remote. It is about the adventure that Australia is.


This particular program, in its essence, has delivered services to people in rural and remote areas through their GPs. It has been successful. We had people marrying—or partnering, as we might like to say these days—somebody in the city and never returning to the country after being educated in the city. We know they are lost to us completely. They are not lost to the nation, but they are lost to our country areas. This education program that the member for Murray has highlighted, in its success, has taken people out of the city. In one story here—which I probably will not get to now because the time has gone—the young lady actually went from the city to a regional medical school, then she thought, 'I'd really like to do my internship in a regional hospital.' That doctor has every chance of the fulfilling the dreams, the aspirations and the energy behind what the member for Murray is highlighting today, even if it is one person and it is one doctor. There will be plenty of doctors for city people.


I know this city of Canberra has plenty of doctors. They do not particularly want to come and service us out in our regional areas, because out in regional areas we are not as well as the rest of the community. We still play up pretty badly and have a terrible reputation for health, but it is improving. I just heard a debate in the Federation Chamber on lung cancer, which was most enlightening—and most embarrassing for some of us too. Having said that, it is important that the subject of this motion before the House is recognised as a very, very important initiative that has been successful.


We are not arguing with anybody. The member for Murray is simply saying: 'Here is a process that has worked. Here is an opportunity for future generations of young people coming out of our secondary schools, right across regional Australia, to enter into these rural health schools.' It is very important to us, it is important to this nation and it is very important to rural and regional people that they get the same opportunities for health care as people do in outer Melbourne or in the city centres. I commend the member for Murray and especially the member for Forrest for their continuing efforts on behalf of people right across rural and regional Australia.

Ms KING
 (Ballarat) (11:58):  I too commend the member for Murray for bringing this motion here before the House. As the former Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing in a previous life and then a minister for regional affairs, I think I have a fairly unique perspective on this very important issue before the chamber. I want to pay tribute to the work of previous health ministers, particularly Michael Wooldridge and Tony Abbott, through to Nicola Roxon and Tanya Plibersek, who all have supported the continuation of the clinical rural medical schools, some 17 schools managed by 16 universities, providing critical opportunities not only for rural kids but also for the many patients in those regional areas who are desperately trying to access those services.


I particularly want to recognise two of those schools, at Deakin University and the University of Melbourne—and I know the member for Murray has a very long association with Melbourne university's rural clinic. They both run rural clinical schools in my own electorate of Ballarat, and I have met many of those fantastic students and I know the many opportunities that are being provided to them. I also particularly want to mention the clinicians who are training these young people. GPs' and specialists' lives are incredibly busy, and the fact that they are making a commitment through the rural clinical schools to continue training really is a tribute to them and to their communities.


I am very proud of the work that Labor did in expanding accommodation as part of the Rural Clinical Schools program and across a range of other programs within the Health portfolio. That has brought many more opportunities to students in our regions, and I certainly want to commend the member for Murray for bringing this motion before the chamber.


One of the things that I was delighted to see was the opening of one of the accommodation facilities in the small town of Daylesford, which has struggled to get a doctor. Again, I am very proud that Labor was able to initiate some 32-bed accommodation facilities being provided for rural clinical students. We know that rural kids want to stay in rural communities as much as they possibly can and are more likely to do so, and these rural clinical schools really have been a success story. Of course, we have a long way to go to continue to make sure that the inequality in health is done away with, but certainly the work of the rural clinical schools and the motion before the House are a good start.


Debate interrupted.

"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2013-12-02,"



Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter) (12:01):  Saying the names of these bills is a mouthful, Deputy Speaker Scott, if you will excuse the pun. I believe this is my first opportunity at the dispatch box to congratulate you on your re-election as Deputy Speaker—well deserved, and we look forward to working with you. As I travel the world, like all members of this place I am asked specifically where I come from in Australia, and I very quickly and boastfully tell people I represent the world's finest wine region. Now, there will be some in this place that will challenge that proposition, no doubt—and justifiably so, because Australia is a great producer of wine. Indeed, it is the fourth largest wine-exporting country in the world. For a country our size, with rather limited land, water and people resources, that is a very, very significant achievement. So people will not be surprised to see me as the member for Hunter talking on the Grape and Wine Legislation Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013, but on this occasion I do so as the opposition spokesperson for agriculture and therefore the person responsible for speaking on these issues on behalf of the Labor Party. This bill was one introduced into the parliament by the former Labor government. I believe it passed the House of Representatives in the 43rd Parliament but did not fully run the gauntlet of the Senate, and it has now been introduced by the new Minister for Agriculture—and I again congratulate him on his appointment.


The Grape and Wine Legislation Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013 creates the Australian Grape and Wine Authority. The new authority will commence its operations on 1 July 2014. It will take the roles and functions of the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation and the Wine Australia Corporation. The former Labor government agreed to merge the two wine statutory corporations following a proposal from the Winemakers' Federation of Australia and Wine Grape Growers Australia. The proposed merger, I am advised, is widely supported by the industry and has really been a long time in the making. A single wine industry statutory authority will support the industry by providing links between the investment initiatives and functions of the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation and the Wine Australia Corporation. The merger will provide further benefits by improving administrative efficiency and service delivery to the industry. The merger aligns with the then Australian government's 2012 Rural Research and Development Policy Statement. In particular, the statement noted that combining research and development and marketing functions in one organisation can lead to administrative savings as well as important synergies.


On 19 June 2013, the then government introduced the Rural Research and Development Legislation Amendment Bill 2013 to implement the policy statement. Once this bill has been considered by the parliament, the government will amend the Grape and Wine Legislation Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill to ensure consistency between the two pieces of legislation. The merger of the two statutory authorities is also in accordance with a broader policy goal to reduce the number of government statutory corporations. This bill proposes amendments to the Wine Australia Corporation Act 1980 to establish the new authority and renames the act as the Australian Grape and Wine Authority Act 2013. The amendments to the Wine Australia Corporation Act are significant, but the merger is not a takeover of the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation by Wine Australia; this is a strategic merger of the two statutory corporations.


This bill is divided into two schedules. Schedule 1 amends the Wine Australia Corporation Act to create the authority itself. Schedule 2 covers matters arising from the transition from two statutory corporations to the authority. It covers matters such as the transfer of staff to the authority. Schedule 1 is divided into two parts. Part 1 of schedule 1 commences on the day after royal assent. This part amends the Wine Australia Corporation Act 1980 to establish a selection committee to select and nominate to the Minister for Agriculture possible members of the board of the authority. The bill gives the Minister for Agriculture an alternative option of appointing a board of the authority for a 12-month period without reference to the selection committee. Part 2 of schedule 1 commences on 1 July 2014. This part provides amendments to the Freedom of Information Act 1982 and the Wine Australia Corporation Act 1980. This part establishes the authority and provides the governance framework for its operation.


Schedule 1 also provides the research and development functions, including provisions for the Commonwealth to match research and development levy funding dollar for dollar. The authority will be required to spend research and development levy money and government matching funds on research and development activity. Industry has highlighted the importance of this issue for the new authority. It is also important to the government to ensure that Australian government money appropriated for research and development is used for this purpose. Importantly, the bill does not include any changes to the structure, to the amounts of the levies which currently fund both statutory corporations or to the existing regulatory, marketing and compliance roles of the Wine Australia Corporation.


The bill transfers definitions of research and development from the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1981. It establishes an authority with a skills based board of five to seven directors, selected and nominated by a statutory selection committee and appointed by the minister. The board is led by a chair appointed by the minister following consultation with industry. The authority is required to prepare a five-year corporate plan to outline the authority's strategies, policies and priorities to achieve the objectives. The authority is also required to prepare an annual operation plan, but, unlike those of the two statutory corporations, this plan is not required to have ministerial approval.


Schedule 2 provides for the transition of the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation and Wine Australia to the authority, including operations, assets, liabilities and staffing conditions. Of particular note is that schedule 2 provides that the minister may engage consultants to assist with preparations for establishing the authority and for appointing the chief executive officer.


The bill allows the Minister for Agriculture to reappoint the first board after royal assent. The board will commence on 1 July 2014. Between the date of appointment and 1 July 2014, the minister can engage future board directors as consultants to prepare for the authority's commencement and to assist it in becoming fully operational on 1 July 2014. Before 1 July 2014 the future directors, in their roles as consultants, may not make decisions that would bind the authority into the future. However, it can be expected that any recommendations they make would be ratified by the board at its first meeting. The costs of the consultants will be met by the Commonwealth through the Department of Agriculture.


Once the authority commences, any and all Commonwealth funding provided for the purpose of engaging consultants will be refunded by the authority. As the consultants are the future board directors acting in the interests of the authority, it is reasonable for the authority to reimburse the Commonwealth for the costs of the consultants. The bill ensures that all employees of the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation and Wine Australia are transferred to the Australian Grape and Wine Authority, along with all employee entitlements.


The bill also provides for a number of amendments to be made to outdated sections of the Wine Australia Corporation Act 1980. It introduces modernised language to bring it up to date with current terms. The wine industry has a unique regulatory structure, with the Wine Australia Corporation enforcing the Label Integrity Program, licensing exporters and maintaining Australia's wine geographical indication system. These important roles are not affected by the merger.


The Australian Grape and Wine Authority will therefore have a strong focus on controlling exports and developing domestic and international markets for Australian grape products, along with investigating, coordinating and funding grape and wine research and development. The authority will be responsible for reporting these to the parliament or to the minister and to representative organisations. The government has introduced amendments to the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 and to the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997.


The merger of the wine industry statutory corporations is being undertaken at the request of industry and continues to have the support of the industry. This reform will help the industry to function better. It will improve linkages between marketing and research and development and achieve these benefits at no additional cost to winemakers and grape growers. Two companion bills are being introduced alongside this bill, proposing minor amendments to various relevant other acts.


In boasting my representation of the Hunter wine region, can I say that this is a very small step in assisting a wine industry which is under significant challenge from a stubbornly high Australian dollar affecting our competitiveness, coming off the back of the global financial crisis—which had a chilling impact on consumption in some of our key export markets—further consolidation and growing market power in the retail sector, and drought, all combining to produce some very significant challenges for those operating in the wine market, be they growers, winemakers, exporters or distributors.


This industry also faces some wonderful opportunities. I am very fond of talking about the dining boom, which will lead to significant increases in consumption in South-East Asia and China as the middle class emerges along with a growing desire for quality wine. From the Hunter to Margaret River, from the Yarra to the Barossa, from the Tamar to the Clare Valley, winemakers and growers are combining to make the most of those very significant opportunities. They will need government help in a range of areas. Obviously in future we will need to increase our yields of wine production if we are to capitalise fully on the opportunities in Asia. Research and development will be critical to lifting our production output capacity in this country. This bill takes a small step in that area by making as efficient as possible what we are doing in research and development in particular.


One of the big challenges the wine industry face at the moment is what they see as a threat from coal seam gas, much of which is being extracted in the wine region I represent. I want to put on record what I have said many times before. We need coal seam gas in New South Wales. Our energy prices will climb very steeply if we do not find new sources of gas for our state, as we become more dependent on other states and as demand begins to outstrip supply. What I have also always said is that we cannot afford to have our sustainable industries threatened by industries which might be with us for only 10, 20 or even 100 years—I put coalmining in that category.


My view is that we need these gas resources, but I am concerned about the demonisation of the industry. I think each of these projects should be considered on its merits. Some projects will certainly be able to progress without any threat to water tables or, more generally, to the sustainability of local industries. But some may not. We should rely on the science and allow those that are safe to proceed to proceed, while making sure that there is no threat to the sustainability of viticulture or, more generally, to our agricultural sector. 


This is just one of the many challenges the industry faces, some of which I have already mentioned—the Australian dollar, the wake of the global financial crisis and the consolidation of market power in the retailing sector. These are all combining to put enormous pressure on what is a very important industry for this country. As the local member for Hunter, no-one understands that better than I do. Three of our children have worked in the hospitality sector, which of course feeds off the wine sector. It is really the jewel in the crown for Hunter tourism. It is a very important industry, which enjoys my very strong support and the support of all members of this place. This bill is a very small first step in helping it along and I wish it the very best for the future.

 (McMahon) (13:45):  Yesterday, the member for Chifley, the member for Greenway, who joins us in the chamber, and I hosted a fundraising day for victims of Typhoon Haiyan—or Typhoon Yolanda, as it is known in the Philippines—in which so many people lost their lives and many people were made homeless. I am very pleased to report to the House that around 400 people came to our fundraising day. We believe we raised approximately $10,000 for Caritas and the work that they are doing for the victims of Typhoon Haiyan. It was a very good day. I want to place on record my thanks to the staff of the member for Chifley, the member for Greenway and my staff, as well as the many volunteers who helped out on the day. It was a bittersweet moment. We had a great day, with jumping castles, face painting and lots of fun activities, but we remembered the thousands of people who lost their lives in Typhoon Haiyan. In a very real sense it made our contribution not just a remembrance but a rebuilding. 


The Philippines is a wonderful nation with many challenges on its hands. It did not need the extra challenge of this worst ever landfall typhoon that they had to experience in recent weeks. A terrible crisis, a terrible tragedy often takes the world's attention and then we move on very quickly. The world moves on because there is so much to grab our attention. But we need to remain focused on the victims of Typhoon Haiyan and, as we said yesterday at the community day, they will always remain in our thoughts, and our actions and support will always be with them.

 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (14:50):  I seek leave to move a motion that this House censures the Prime Minister for breaking his promise to parents and children across Australia that no school would be worse off under his government.


Leave not granted.




Mr SHORTEN:
  I move:


That so much of standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Maribyrnong moving immediately:


That this House censures the Prime Minister for breaking his promise to parents and children across Australia that no school would be worse off under his Government.


Those opposite dislike being told that they have broken promises. But I can tell you something: Australians dislike being told that promises that they were told by the coalition on education before the election—



The SPEAKER:  I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that this is a suspension motion, and what he has to establish is suspension, and speak to the suspension.




Mr SHORTEN:
  Madam Speaker, I remain in constant gratitude for your counsel. Standing orders must be suspended—



The SPEAKER:  I am grateful that you are grateful, and perhaps you would like to demonstrate that you are grateful.




Mr SHORTEN:
  I will endeavour to do my best. Standing orders must be suspended, because Australians dislike being told that promises about the educational opportunities for their children in the schools of Australia are then broken after an election. What a circus this last few weeks in education history in Australia has been. We know, and every fair-minded observer knows, that for the last three years those opposite, when they were in opposition, did not want to have a bar of reforming education. We know that those opposite were not interested in changing to needs-based funding. We know that there was the mindless opposition of those opposite—I think they said that Gonski was a 'conski'. In fact, they said that—not last year, not the year before—on 1 August and on the morning of 2 August this year. But someone—probably the notorious Mark Textor—must have told them: 'Do you know what?—on education, Labor is more credible than the conservatives. It is Labor who has worked with parents. It is Labor who has worked with educational experts to try and get a better deal.' But those opposite are so blinded in their hatred of Labor, and they were so blinded in their hatred of former Prime Minister Gillard, that they were determined to say, 'There's no way that we would ever have the needs-based reforms which Labor introduced'. 


But, demonstrating the cynical administration that they are, and their desperate desire to get into power, no doubt their planners and their pollsters said in early August, 'Education is one issue where Labor is leading over the conservatives.' Those opposite are quiet, and do you know why they are quiet? They are quiet because they know the truth when they hear it. They know that no-one trusts them on education. Christopher Pyne, member for Sturt, well-known education reformer—not!—on Thursday calls it 'conski' and then on the Friday, in what can only be described as a road-to-Damascus miracle says, 'Actually, we support these changes in education.' I remember very clearly what they were saying and when they were saying it, because I was in negotiations with the conservative government in Victoria on these education reforms. This is why we must suspend standing orders—because this government has different policies before an election to those they have when they get elected. 


Then they tried desperately to tell their Victorian colleagues, in a flurry of phone calls: 'Please don't do a deal with Labor. You can trust us.' They came up with that beautifully precise, conservative form of language—the 'no-strings-attached deal'. I have never seen a deal such as this, where they put up a truckload of money and no strings attached, so they could persuade the Liberals in Victoria not to sign a Labor deal. But there is a peril with the no-strings-attached approach, which the Prime Minister has endorsed again today. They have been against this for years and, on the basis that they believe a leopard can change its spots, they said just before the election: 'Well, we've changed our spots. I know we are the conservatives. I know we've bagged needs-based education.' In fact, most of the electorate knows that the member for Sturt does not like government schools; his dream is to turn every government school into a private school! And then what happened—and this is why we should suspend standing orders, Madam Speaker—after the election was that we started to see that well-known government tactic of the backslide. They never go down a slide forwards this crew; they always go down backwards. What a circus!


They have tried to take down from their website their speeches of before the election: 'Let's not talk about what we know.' We have had these golden lines from those opposite, including the Prime Minister, 'We want to end the uncertainty.' What a statement of optimism over experience—'uncertainty'! These people opposite were boasting today, 'We've changed our view from yesterday.' Education in this country has become a circus of funding. Those opposite have been in damage control ever since—the moose is loose—the member for Sturt has been conclusively confusing everyone. I love what the Prime Minister said when he was the opposition leader. He said, 'No school is worse off.' What a mischievous, deceptive comment that is in light of today's comments. And they are boasting; the mob opposite have never been shy about shouting their ignorance to the world, and what they are saying today is: 'How clever are we? We are going to give money to the Queensland government, to the Northern Territory government, and to the Western Australian government—no strings attached!' 


They say that a fool and his money are soon parted—those opposite are evidence. Did these clever education reformers even stop to ask those notorious cutters and slashers, the conservative Newman government? Did those opposite ever say: 'Here comes the Commonwealth truck, the Armaguard truck driven by Tony Abbott and his truck jockey, the member for Sturt. We have got the cash, Campbell Newman, quick, get it out the back and get it into the schools! Oh, and by the way, Mr Newman, you can borrow the empty cash truck we're taking. You can bring it around to the back door of the school because you can take the money out of your schools.' These educational vandals, these educational dilettantes, these people too lazy to do their policy in opposition—then turn up at the exam and copy our exam answers. They have made no guarantees to stop Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia from cutting their budgets.

Mrs Prentice:

The SPEAKER:  The Leader of the Opposition.




Mr SHORTEN:
  The standing orders must be suspended because in education in this country we have seen those opposite say, 'You can have Labor or Liberal; you will get the same deal'. That is not true. Those opposite are now boasting—and it is a different position to the position they had yesterday and the position they had on Friday—to Australia: 'We will hand Commonwealth money to the states, but we will not require that they do not cut their funding.' The difference between Labor's model on education is that we would seek to give two dollars for every one dollar that the states—



The SPEAKER:  The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. I call the Chief Government Whip—he has sat down again. The Leader of the Opposition has the call.




Mr SHORTEN:
  This is not the government that was promised to Australians at the election. Those opposite said, 'There will be no surprises and no excuses.' What a joke! Every day under Christopher Pyne is surprise day in education. Every day in 'Abbott-land' and 'Prime-Minister-land' is excuse day. Before the election they said, 'In education, we will make sure that no school is worse off.' I have the quote for the member for New England. They said:


We will honour the agreements … We will match the offers that Labor has made. 


They also said that 'no school would be worse off'. They cannot keep that promise with the deals they are talking about doing with the states. The Northern Territory has been closing schools; Queensland has been closing schools. 


We see needs-based funding as being fundamental to the improvement of Australian education. We in Labor understand that what is important is giving kids the best start in life. We believe in needs-based funding. We believe there should be a loading based on children's disabilities and learning difficulties. We believe there should be funding based on whether or not kids live regionally. We believe there should be funding based on the postcodes and the lower socio-economic status of the areas in which parents are sending their kids. We believe fundamentally in giving children needs-based funding. We are a party and an opposition that will back public schools. We are a party and an opposition that will never give up on state education, unlike those opposite. (Time expired)

Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Leader of the House, Minister for Education) (15:00):  Madam Speaker, I move:


That all words after ""That"" (first occurring) be omitted and the following words be substituted: ""this House condemns the Leader of the Opposition for cutting funding to schools in Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory by $1.2 billion in the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook, and for failing to achieve a national, fair and needs based school funding model when Minister for Education.""


I move that as an amendment to the suspension of standing orders.


Madam Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition has turned up today with last week's questions pack. It is as if he has turned up to the set of Mad Max to play a small role in it but insists that it is really Alice in Wonderland, and everybody has to run around with a clock saying, 'I'm running behind time.' The Leader of the Opposition reminds me he is one of the worst leaders of the opposition that I have experienced in my 21 years in parliament. He has turned up for question time; he has last week's questions pack. He has decided that the way to solve this problem—because the opposition is being killed in the social media verse that I am not part of—is to shout and bellow at the dispatch box at members of the government and the press gallery, almost to insist that the press gallery accepts that he has had a great day in spite of the fact that at half past one today his house of cards came falling down around him. Unfortunately for the Leader of the Opposition, he is shattered that we are putting $1.2 billion into school funding that he ripped out of the school funding model before the election in the pre-election fiscal outlook, rather than standing up to congratulate the government for putting more money into the Northern Territory, Queensland or Western Australia so that there are no second-class students under this government. He did not stand up to praise the government—to seek indulgence to praise the Prime Minister—for putting money in that the Leader of the Opposition took out. Instead, they are going to insist that that has simply has not happened. They are going to say that the questions pack stands, 'We do not have time to change it.' As I said in question time, Madam Speaker, Ataturk said that when the battle changes, a good general changes his tactics. Sadly, on that side of the House, with Mr Albanese away in Italy, they are short of their good generals. And didn't it show today, Madam Speaker? The reason the Leader of the Opposition should be censured, and the reason the amendment should be carried for the suspension of standing orders, is that when he was the Minister for Education he left an absolute wreckage when he departed the scene after the election. He had cut $1.2 billion out of the school—




Mr Burke:
  On a point of order, Madam Speaker. I will try to be brief. The Leader of the House said that his amendment was to the suspension.



The SPEAKER:  Correct.




Mr Burke:
  We now have a written copy. He has said that all words after 'that' and he has added 'first occurring'. That means his amendment ceases to make this a suspension of standing orders and we have an amendment, which, if valid, means we cannot continue with the debate. He meant to say 'second occurring'. If he wants to change his amendment, we will give him leave to do so. But this amendment is actually impossible to be carried.



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr PYNE:
  Any proposition is open to amendment, and that is exactly what I have done. I have moved an amendment to the Leader of the Opposition's proposition. That is why it is in order. Sadly, they will do anything other than debate the facts about today's education debate. A $1.2 billion cut, and the Leader of the Opposition left a model that was not a national model. Queensland was not in it; the Northern Territory was not in it; Western Australia was not in it. He was prepared to take $1.2 billion— 



The SPEAKER:  I rule on the point of order that there is no point of order.




Mr PYNE:
  When we came to government, what did we find? We found that the Leader of the Opposition had left us $1.2 billion short in PEFO on school funding. We found that he had never signed Victoria and Tasmania to contracts for the new school funding model. He had claimed that the National Catholic Education Commission had made an agreement with the government, but they had done no such thing—nothing was signed. We found that three states could properly be regarded as signatory states, and two states and one territory were entirely left out of the school funding model. So, it was not national. We found that he tried to introduce a heavily-regulated model dripping with red tape—with new institutes, new government spending, new bureaucracies—that infantilised the states and territories and treated them not as adult governments, but as children.


We said before the election that we would keep the same funding level as Labor. We have not only done that, madam Speaker, we have gone even further. We have bettered that commitment by putting $1.2 billion more into school funding than Labor would have if they had been re-elected. That is why they are so embarrassed. They are embarrassed that it is the coalition that is delivering more money for students so that we can get on with the real debate in education about quality and standards. That is what parents care about. They care about teacher quality; they care about engaging with their children in a genuine way about their studies; they care about local decision making and principal autonomy that is working so well in places like Western Australia. They want a robust curriculum that does produce students that can read and write, and that does rely on orthodox teaching methods that actually do not see us slipping down the rankings all the time internationally, even against other English-speaking countries.


We also said that we would take away the command-and-control features inherent in the act, and that is exactly what we will do. We will remove regulation; we will remove red tape. It will be a better model. We said we would deliver a national scheme, and, much to the embarrassment of the opposition, I have delivered a national scheme that the Leader of the Opposition was never capable of delivering. We now have a national scheme that applies to every student equally in Australia, because we did not want any second-class citizens in the way that the Leader of the Opposition was prepared to leave it. 


The Leader of the Opposition in his address talked about 'no strings attached', as though the previous Labor government had a handle on controlling state spending. We all know that the states and territories make their own decisions about spending, about their own budgets, as they should, because they are sovereign governments. What the Leader of the Opposition did not tell us was that last month in the South Australian state parliament's Budget and Finance Committee of the education department—which I assume is similar to our estimates—it was confirmed that Premier Jay Weatherill has demanded $230 million of cuts to the department of education between now and 2017, and $180 million of them are yet to be identified. So on the one hand we have Labor trying to claim the mantle of putting more funds into schools, and on the other hand we find out that they have cut funding by $1.2 billion nationally. In South Australia, the only mainland state Labor government left, last month it was revealed that they were cutting $230 million from the South Australian education budget. Shame on them.


On top of that, as the Prime Minister said in question time, not only has the Leader of the Opposition failed to change his tactics in question time but he has also forgotten—a bit like the rabbit in Alice in Wonderland—that it was his government that cut the computers in schools program in the last budget. It was his government that cut spending and funding to trades traineeships and apprenticeships in MYEFO last year, in the PEFO and in the budget last year. It was his government that took a scythe to higher education before the election, cutting $2.8 billion from universities, ostensibly to pay for schools, when we knew they were also cutting $1.2 billion from schools. And it took this government to recognise that the cap on self-education expenses was such a bad policy that we would remove that cap and scrap that measure.


The Leader of the Opposition should be censured. He should be censured for ripping $1.2 billion out of schools before the election and he should be censured because he did not leave a national model; in fact, he was prepared to short-change the Northern Territory, Queensland and Western Australia.

"Burke, Tony, MP",ALP,2013-12-02,"



Mr BURKE
 (Watson—Manager of Opposition Business) (15:10):  The need to suspend standing orders to deal with the matter before the chair is more urgent than ever. Since the time this motion was first moved in this chamber, the following words have been said by Senator Abetz in the other place: 'You might actually find some schools are worse off courtesy of various state government decisions.' They are the words that those in this chamber wanted to avoid, but everybody who has a relationship with a school, everybody who cares about a child's education around Australia, knows exactly what is going on with the weasel words that were used by the Prime Minister immediately before question time today.


The guarantees that were given—and this is why it is so urgent—time and time again prior to the election were guarantees that no school would be worse off. They were guarantees that did not say, 'not worse off because of us, but we'll let the states do what they want'. At the exact same time that you have state governments in places like the Northern Territory and Queensland firing teachers and closing down schools, the games that will be played as a result of the announcements made today by the Prime Minister are not lost on anyone—not anyone at all—and it is urgent that we bring this issue on. For a government that promised to be a government of no surprises and no excuses, we have seen the exact opposite.


It takes a very special Liberal Prime Minister to have a bad interview on Andrew Bolt's program—not many people can achieve that. Yesterday we heard from the Prime Minister, 'I think Christopher said schools would get the same amount of money—'schools', plural—will get the same amount of money.' Let us have a look at that little word game and see that it is indeed urgent for us to bring this debate on now within the parliament, because it was not the Leader of the House, the Minister for Education, who was using Leader of the Opposition letterhead before the election. When that statement was made we had the words: 'We want to end the uncertainty by guaranteeing that no school will be worse off over the forward estimates period.' So maybe he can say to Andrew Bolt, 'Well, that's what Christopher meant,' but everybody knows what the Prime Minister meant. Everybody knows the guarantee that the Prime Minister was giving and everybody knows now that the Prime Minister did not mean a word of it when he said that to the Australian people.


We then had, from the Leader of the House, the Minister for Education, on his own letterhead, in a media release: 'Every single school'—that is an unusual way to describe a plural, I have to say—'in Australia will receive exactly the same Commonwealth funding over the next four years whether there is a Liberal or Labor government after September 7.'


We then go back to letterhead that came out from the Prime Minister when he was Leader of the Opposition, when he did a joint media conference with Barry O'Farrell—hasn't that relationship gone well!—and the Leader of the House, where the Leader of the House, now Minister for Education, said, 'You can vote Liberal or Labor and you will get exactly the same amount of funding for your school.' There is no line there saying, 'Oh, but if the states make the cut it won't be our fault.' There is no line there saying, 'Oh, but we are going to give them permission to do exactly what they want.' As published in TheSydney Morning Herald, the then shadow minister for education and now Minister for Education said:


… no school will be worse off, whether it is a Liberal or Labor government in the next term.


This issue needs to be brought on urgently not only because of the dishonesty we have seen from those who now occupy the treasury bench in the commitments they made and promises they have now broken but also because there is no issue that drives both productivity and equity harder than decent, fair investment in the schools of the nation.


The Better Schools plan, a proud legacy of the former Labor government which at the election the coalition wanted to sidle up to so closely, actually guaranteed for the first time that we would end the debate between independent, Catholic and government systems—a debate that those opposite would love to drag us straight back to. The Australian public know the dishonesty that they are hearing from those opposite, and there should be a free vote and a free debate on that here on the floor of the parliament.



The SPEAKER:  The original question was that the motion be agreed to, to which the honourable member for Sturt has moved an amendment. So the immediate question is that the amendment be agreed to.

That so much of standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Maribyrnong moving immediately:


That this House censures the Prime Minister for breaking his promise to parents and children across Australia that no school would be worse off under his Government.


Those opposite dislike being told that they have broken promises. But I can tell you something: Australians dislike being told that promises that they were told by the coalition on education before the election—



The SPEAKER:  I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that this is a suspension motion, and what he has to establish is suspension, and speak to the suspension.




Mr SHORTEN:
  Madam Speaker, I remain in constant gratitude for your counsel. Standing orders must be suspended—



The SPEAKER:  I am grateful that you are grateful, and perhaps you would like to demonstrate that you are grateful.

  I will endeavour to do my best. Standing orders must be suspended, because Australians dislike being told that promises about the educational opportunities for their children in the schools of Australia are then broken after an election.

Queensland was not in it; the Northern Territory was not in it; Western Australia was not in it. He was prepared to take $1.2 billion— 



The SPEAKER:  I rule on the point of order that there is no point of order.




Mr PYNE:
  When we came to government, what did we find? We found that the Leader of the Opposition had left us $1.2 billion short in PEFO on school funding. We found that he had never signed Victoria and Tasmania to contracts for the new school funding model. He had claimed that the National Catholic Education Commission had made an agreement with the government, but they had done no such thing—nothing was signed. We found that three states could properly be regarded as signatory states, and two states and one territory were entirely left out of the school funding model. So, it was not national. We found that he tried to introduce a heavily-regulated model dripping with red tape—with new institutes, new government spending, new bureaucracies—that infantilised the states and territories and treated them not as adult governments, but as children.


We said before the election that we would keep the same funding level as Labor. We have not only done that, madam Speaker, we have gone even further. We have bettered that commitment by putting $1.2 billion more into school funding than Labor would have if they had been re-elected. That is why they are so embarrassed. They are embarrassed that it is the coalition that is delivering more money for students so that we can get on with the real debate in education about quality and standards. That is what parents care about. They care about teacher quality; they care about engaging with their children in a genuine way about their studies; they care about local decision making and principal autonomy that is working so well in places like Western Australia. They want a robust curriculum that does produce students that can read and write, and that does rely on orthodox teaching methods that actually do not see us slipping down the rankings all the time internationally, even against other English-speaking countries.


We also said that we would take away the command-and-control features inherent in the act, and that is exactly what we will do. We will remove regulation; we will remove red tape. It will be a better model. We said we would deliver a national scheme, and, much to the embarrassment of the opposition, I have delivered a national scheme that the Leader of the Opposition was never capable of delivering. We now have a national scheme that applies to every student equally in Australia, because we did not want any second-class citizens in the way that the Leader of the Opposition was prepared to leave it. 


The Leader of the Opposition in his address talked about 'no strings attached', as though the previous Labor government had a handle on controlling state spending. We all know that the states and territories make their own decisions about spending, about their own budgets, as they should, because they are sovereign governments. What the Leader of the Opposition did not tell us was that last month in the South Australian state parliament's Budget and Finance Committee of the education department—which I assume is similar to our estimates—it was confirmed that Premier Jay Weatherill has demanded $230 million of cuts to the department of education between now and 2017, and $180 million of them are yet to be identified. So on the one hand we have Labor trying to claim the mantle of putting more funds into schools, and on the other hand we find out that they have cut funding by $1.2 billion nationally. In South Australia, the only mainland state Labor government left, last month it was revealed that they were cutting $230 million from the South Australian education budget. Shame on them.


On top of that, as the Prime Minister said in question time, not only has the Leader of the Opposition failed to change his tactics in question time but he has also forgotten—a bit like the rabbit in Alice in Wonderland—that it was his government that cut the computers in schools program in the last budget. It was his government that cut spending and funding to trades traineeships and apprenticeships in MYEFO last year, in the PEFO and in the budget last year. It was his government that took a scythe to higher education before the election, cutting $2.8 billion from universities, ostensibly to pay for schools, when we knew they were also cutting $1.2 billion from schools. And it took this government to recognise that the cap on self-education expenses was such a bad policy that we would remove that cap and scrap that measure.


The Leader of the Opposition should be censured. He should be censured for ripping $1.2 billion out of schools before the election and he should be censured because he did not leave a national model; in fact, he was prepared to short-change the Northern Territory, Queensland and Western Australia.

"Burke, Tony, MP",ALP,2013-12-02,"



Mr BURKE
 (Watson—Manager of Opposition Business) (15:10):  The need to suspend standing orders to deal with the matter before the chair is more urgent than ever. Since the time this motion was first moved in this chamber, the following words have been said by Senator Abetz in the other place: 'You might actually find some schools are worse off courtesy of various state government decisions.' They are the words that those in this chamber wanted to avoid, but everybody who has a relationship with a school, everybody who cares about a child's education around Australia, knows exactly what is going on with the weasel words that were used by the Prime Minister immediately before question time today.


The guarantees that were given—and this is why it is so urgent—time and time again prior to the election were guarantees that no school would be worse off. They were guarantees that did not say, 'not worse off because of us, but we'll let the states do what they want'. At the exact same time that you have state governments in places like the Northern Territory and Queensland firing teachers and closing down schools, the games that will be played as a result of the announcements made today by the Prime Minister are not lost on anyone—not anyone at all—and it is urgent that we bring this issue on. For a government that promised to be a government of no surprises and no excuses, we have seen the exact opposite.


It takes a very special Liberal Prime Minister to have a bad interview on Andrew Bolt's program—not many people can achieve that. Yesterday we heard from the Prime Minister, 'I think Christopher said schools would get the same amount of money—'schools', plural—will get the same amount of money.' Let us have a look at that little word game and see that it is indeed urgent for us to bring this debate on now within the parliament, because it was not the Leader of the House, the Minister for Education, who was using Leader of the Opposition letterhead before the election. When that statement was made we had the words: 'We want to end the uncertainty by guaranteeing that no school will be worse off over the forward estimates period.' So maybe he can say to Andrew Bolt, 'Well, that's what Christopher meant,' but everybody knows what the Prime Minister meant. Everybody knows the guarantee that the Prime Minister was giving and everybody knows now that the Prime Minister did not mean a word of it when he said that to the Australian people.


We then had, from the Leader of the House, the Minister for Education, on his own letterhead, in a media release: 'Every single school'—that is an unusual way to describe a plural, I have to say—'in Australia will receive exactly the same Commonwealth funding over the next four years whether there is a Liberal or Labor government after September 7.'


We then go back to letterhead that came out from the Prime Minister when he was Leader of the Opposition, when he did a joint media conference with Barry O'Farrell—hasn't that relationship gone well!—and the Leader of the House, where the Leader of the House, now Minister for Education, said, 'You can vote Liberal or Labor and you will get exactly the same amount of funding for your school.' There is no line there saying, 'Oh, but if the states make the cut it won't be our fault.' There is no line there saying, 'Oh, but we are going to give them permission to do exactly what they want.' As published in TheSydney Morning Herald, the then shadow minister for education and now Minister for Education said:


… no school will be worse off, whether it is a Liberal or Labor government in the next term.


This issue needs to be brought on urgently not only because of the dishonesty we have seen from those who now occupy the treasury bench in the commitments they made and promises they have now broken but also because there is no issue that drives both productivity and equity harder than decent, fair investment in the schools of the nation.


The Better Schools plan, a proud legacy of the former Labor government which at the election the coalition wanted to sidle up to so closely, actually guaranteed for the first time that we would end the debate between independent, Catholic and government systems—a debate that those opposite would love to drag us straight back to. The Australian public know the dishonesty that they are hearing from those opposite, and there should be a free vote and a free debate on that here on the floor of the parliament.



The SPEAKER:  The original question was that the motion be agreed to, to which the honourable member for Sturt has moved an amendment. So the immediate question is that the amendment be agreed to.

"Wilson, Rick, MP",LP,2013-12-02,"



Mr WILSON
 (O'Connor) (15:31):  I rise for the first time in this House with enormous pride and a real sense of honour to be representing the electors of O'Connor. To be their voice in federal parliament is a responsibility I will take very seriously indeed, and I thank them for their vote of confidence in me.


Madam Speaker, let me take this opportunity to add my congratulations on your elevation to the Speaker's chair, a role I know that you will fill with distinction.


I begin by acknowledging the efforts of the previous member for O'Connor, Tony Crook. Though we came from opposite ends of the conservative political spectrum, I always understood and respected the challenges that Tony faced in representing a massive electorate, such a long way from our national capital.


I am only the third member for O'Connor. Tony served for one term. His predecessor served 11 terms in parliament over 30 years and his name is instantly recognisable in Australian politics. Wilson Tuckey has been a friend and supporter for many years, and I take this opportunity to acknowledge his distinguished service to the O'Connor community.


My home town of Katanning is in the geographic centre of O'Connor. It is in the heart of the agricultural region, and I grew up on the family farm that was carved out of the bush by my great-grandfather in 1867. So my roots are firmly entrenched in the rich soil of my electorate.


My great-grandparents William and Bridget Grover were real pioneers, and their stories of hardship and endeavour have been passed down through the family. Bridget gave birth to 11 children in a mud-daubed hut and, remarkably for the time, all of her children survived to adulthood. Raising and educating a large family in remote Western Australian in the late 19th century inevitably meant great adventures but also trials and tribulations. Bridget recorded them all in her diaries, which we are proud to say reside here, in Canberra, at the National Library. They are a testament to the grit and determination shown by so many of our pioneer families.


A family that has lived nearly 150 years in the same location has, of necessity, developed very strong community bonds. My parents and my grandparents taught my siblings and me the value of community service. They taught us about commitment and dedication, about loyalty and reliability, about kindness and compassion. They showed by their deeds that self-reliance and hard work do bring rewards. They taught us that the greatest reward and the greatest responsibility is family and community.


My 87-year-old mother, Mary, who is in the gallery today, epitomises all that is good about family and community. She was a child of the Depression whose family suffered financial ruin. She educated herself via correspondence lessons and became a much-loved and respected nursing sister. She has spent her life giving of herself for others. Even today, she still works tirelessly for many community organisations. She is an adored mother, grandmother and now, to her delight, great-grandmother. Her selflessness has been an inspiration to all her family, and we strive to live up to her example.


I am the youngest of six children. I am a farmer. For the past 25 years, I have farmed in partnership with my brother Allan. When our father, Archie, died suddenly, I was just 14 and Allan was 17. Circumstances forced us to accept the enormous responsibility of maintaining the family business from a very young age and, while there were many difficult times, we have succeeded in developing an outstanding farm operation.


I am proud of my hardworking, salt-of-the-earth ancestors. I am a social conservative and an economic liberal. I believe family is the primary social unit of society, just as small business is the primary economic unit of our economy. Marriage is the cornerstone of family life, and I strongly believe that marriage is and should remain the union of a man and a woman.


I believe the institutions that have formed the basis of our government for the past 112 years have served us well. We should not tamper with our system of government without compelling evidence that the system is broken. It is not broken. In fact, I stand here today as a proud Australian, a citizen of undoubtedly the best country in the world.


I stand proudly for the Liberal philosophy of free markets, vigorous competition, small government and individual responsibility. These are the principles that guide me in my life and in this place. My track record in public life shows clearly that I am prepared to stand up for those principles.


As a member, deputy chair and then chair of Western Grain Growers, I helped lead the campaign to deregulate the Australian wheat industry and end the Australian Wheat Board's monopoly. Many farmers saw the AWB single-desk monopoly as a bastion against what they saw as the evils of free markets. A very small group of us saw it as a system that stifled innovation and investment, distorted market signals through cross-subsidisation and reduced returns for Western Australian growers.


My personal battle to effect this major reform to our industry lasted 11 years, from 1997 until its deregulation in 2008. For others, it had been a lifelong battle. Leon Bradley, the chairman and leader of our organisation through this period, was one such individual. A humble and unassuming farmer with a towering intellect and unimpeachable principles, Leon stared down an organized campaign of denigration and derision. That campaign was led by a billion-dollar ASX 200 company, almost every major farm organisation in the nation and powerful political interests at both state and federal levels. It was Leon's simple dictum that 'truth and logic will always win out' that sustained us when it seemed that politics and patronage would triumph.


Two others who were part of that wonderful team are here today in the gallery. Gary McGill, a great friend and supporter, is a truly fearless advocate for the free-market principles that underpinned our philosophy, and Slade Brockman's outstanding policy work meant that we were never bettered in the economic argument. We had very few friends in this place at that time. The former member for O'Connor Wilson Tuckey was one. At great political cost to himself, he stood firm for his principles and for what he believed was in the best interests of his electorate. So, too, did the late Senator Judith Adams, a much-loved friend to me and my family and to many others in O'Connor. She is greatly missed.


As we now know, the wheat market was deregulated in 2008 and the impact on Western Australian wheat growers was immediate. A sustained price rise of between $20 to $30 per tonne has been achieved, which equates to around $50,000 per annum for an average-sized farm business. Simple maths tells us that an extra $1 billion has found its way into the pockets of Western Australian wheat growers since deregulation. The supporting role that I played in this major economic reform of one of our key export industries is my signature achievement, and I am very proud of my part in that success.


During the deregulation debate, Leon, Gary and I spent many long hours in this place, lobbying senior ministers and shadow ministers on both sides of the House. I saw firsthand that many of the important decisions that impact on my industry and my community were made right here. That was when I first started to think about a career in politics. Five years later, I stand here representing the electors of O'Connor. I will fight hard for the principles I believe in and for the good of my electorate. I will fight hard to deliver to O'Connor what all Australians have a right to expect: an opportunity to succeed, to raise a family, to not be burdened by unnecessary laws and regulations, to take a risk and to keep the rewards of their hard work.


O'Connor is a vast and diverse electorate. In this season, we will produce an estimated seven to eight million tonnes of grain, almost a quarter of the nation's crop production. We are also a major woolgrowing electorate. Over the past 150 years, my family has made a small contribution to both industries. I have a great sense of optimism for the future of our agricultural industries. We are well positioned to take advantage of the rapidly growing markets in the Asian region. I believe my children will have a great opportunity to follow in their forefathers' footsteps in pursuing a career in agriculture, if they choose to do so.


O'Connor also has significant viticulture and horticultural industries, along with timber, tourism and fishing. We have major mining operations across the electorate, including—among others—gold, nickel and iron ore. We have thousands of small manufacturers and service industries in our towns and cities. Small business is the beating heart of O'Connor. It is our small business that provides the jobs and opportunities for the future.


Our agricultural industries are predominantly based in the central Great Southern region, where I live. As well as agriculture, it is where we find spectacular wildflowers in spring, remarkable bird life, the beautiful Stirling Ranges and the lovely heritage buildings that remind us of our pioneer past. O'Connor also encompasses the Warren Blackwood region, based around the towns of Manjimup, Pemberton and Bridgetown. It supports a timber industry, and the quality of its horticulture, viticulture and dairy produce has earned it the title of the food bowl of Western Australia. From apples and potatoes to truffles and cherries, as well as its prime beef, the Warren Blackwood produces a wonderful variety of produce.


Albany is the biggest population centre in the electorate. It was the site of the first European settlements in Western Australia in 1827. It has a proud colonial history. Albany is a port city that services the agricultural hinterland of the Great Southern. Along with the nearby towns of Denmark and Walpole, and the renowned Frankland and Plantagenet winegrowing areas, the south coast region is an important tourist destination for local, national and international tourists.


Albany was also the last sight of Australia for the troops aboard the fleet of more than 30 ships that left our shores in November 1914. Many of these young men, who served in Gallipoli, in Palestine and on the Western Front, never returned. One of Albany's most popular and moving attractions is the Desert Mounted Corps Memorial. It is situated on top of Mount Clarence, overlooking King George Sound, where the people of the town waved goodbye to those brave young men.


Both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs have expressed their strong commitment to making sure that Albany's place in our Anzac history is appropriately honoured during the period of the national commemoration of the Centenary of Anzac. Expect to hear much more of Albany and its unique place in our history.


Among its many attractions, Esperance has the whitest and the most pristine beaches in the world. In Esperance, O'Connor can boast a region that has developed from a small community of fishermen and a few pastoralists to one of the most vibrant and successful agricultural regions in the country—in just 50 years. The sandy soil has been transformed, and this season the grain growers of Esperance are on target to deliver 2.5 million tonnes of grain, a record for the region. Esperance is a testament to the innovation and determination of its residents, who are always looking for ways to do things better and to do things smarter.


Today, as we debate the merits of foreign investment, it is worth remembering that foreign investment transformed Esperance. It was syndicated American money that was behind the development of the sand plain into an extraordinarily productive farming region. A community of around 1,000 residents in the early 1960s, Esperance shire is now home to 14,000 people. In an era in which many farming communities throughout Western Australia are in decline, Esperance is a wonderful example of success.


Mining, of course, is the lifeblood of the goldfields. Kalgoorlie has a rich history. It was established in the gold rush of the 1890s, when prospectors from all over Australia—and indeed the world—came to seek their fortunes. Today, the gold industry lives on. In 2012-13, the region produced $5.7 billion worth of gold. Its gold rush history is evident in Hannan Street, the statue of Paddy and the gracious and beautifully preserved colonial buildings, but what makes Kalgoorlie is not its buildings; it is the spirit of its people: hardworking, resilient and optimistic. They have seen the booms and they have seen the busts, but they are always ready to have another go. They are quite remarkable.


Mining is the lifeblood of Kalgoorlie, but it is also the lifeblood of Australia. It is our largest export earner and its flow-on impact in the economy cannot be underestimated. Across the region, revenue from mining topped $9 billion in 2012-13. It was a tragedy to see the contempt with which the previous government treated this industry. The mining tax, which I have proudly voted to scrap, was a textbook example of bad government. I saw firsthand that tax suck the confidence out of the miners in my electorate. Mining needs confidence. That is why I am a strong supporter of the exploration tax credit. If we are to see the big projects of tomorrow, we need people to invest their capital today.


These, then, are the five major regions that make up the electorate of O'Connor. It is populated by people who epitomise the spirit of regional Australia: hardworking, resilient, good-humoured people with plenty of backbone, people who look for solutions, people who are keen to explore innovative alternatives in their quest to do things better.


But we are faced with some very particular challenges in O'Connor, challenges that are shared by people in other regional centres throughout Australia but which in our case are compounded by the tyranny of distance. Western Australia produces 16 per cent of the nation's gross domestic product and 46 per cent of the nation's mercantile exports. Much of this wealth is produced by the people who live in the regional and rural communities of O'Connor. They deserve to have adequate access to health care. They deserve for their children to have same educational opportunities as their city cousins and for their parents to grow old with dignity and in comfort in the communities they have served all their lives. And we need to find solutions that address the significant disadvantage that Indigenous communities in our electorate face. I look forward to working with the Prime Minister's Indigenous task force to find those solutions. These are the key areas in which I have committed to work tirelessly to find solutions that work for us in O'Connor.


As a Western Australian I cannot ignore the inequity of the GST distribution formula. In the financial year 2013-14, we will receive just 45c for every dollar of GST that we pay. This is projected to fall to just 7c in the dollar in 2016-17. The Commonwealth grants formula was designed so that the more developed states would give a hand to the developing states, and in Western Australia's development phase we were grateful recipients of that assistance. But now the system is being used to support states which do not maximise economic development and investment. So, while we Western Australians are happy to help our compatriots who are working hard to improve their economies just like we did, we resent propping up those states who are not making every effort to maximise their resources and opportunities. They are seen by many Western Australians as bludging off the system. No part of Australia should be encouraged by the system to do anything less than their best. The planned review in March next year is an opportunity for me and for other Western Australian members to make the case for a more equitable arrangement.


Another issue of particular importance to agriculture, not just in O'Connor but across Australia, is the live export trade. I am very proud that the Australian livestock industry has for many years been engaging with our markets to improve the treatment of our livestock in the supply chain. In fact, we are the only one of 109 countries who export live animals to do so. While our systems are not perfect and there have been some regrettable instances of cruelty, we are making progress. But to withdraw arbitrarily from this trade will see our livestock replaced with animals from other countries where animal welfare has a much lower priority. I welcome the strong commitment of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Agriculture to rebuild and strengthen this important trade.


It is impossible to campaign across an electorate the size of O'Connor for 2½ years without the support and assistance of an enormous number of people. I now take the opportunity to put on the record my deepest and sincerest thanks—to my campaign chairman, Steve Martin, whose partnership on this journey extends well beyond the campaign and, I know, will continue well into the future; to my campaign committee, who gave an enormous amount of their time over such a long period, because they believed not just in me but also in the greater Liberal cause: Dom Della Vedova, Bob Morgan, Alana Lacy, Tom and Victoria Brown, Liz and Kel Parker, Don Green, Helen Inglis, Beau Ashton, Amanda Robideau and my wonderful niece Danielle Power. To our branch presidents, members and supporters, who did such a magnificent job manning the 133 polling booths across our enormous electorate, my deepest thanks. Thanks to our Western Australian state director, Ben Morton, whose commitment to winning back the seat of O'Connor was unwavering and who gave me great confidence that the work we were doing at the coalface would be rewarded. Thanks to Ben Allen, my campaign director, whose dry sense of humour always managed to relieve the tension in a crisis.


My sincere thanks go to the two senators with special responsibility for O'Connor. Chris Back, with his expertise in all things livestock, is always a great hit amongst rural people. He and his wife, Linda, worked tirelessly on my behalf. And Senator Dean Smith, with his energy and incredible attention to detail, gave my campaign impetus and momentum at precisely the right time.


To Senators Mathias Cormann and Michaelia Cash: I thank you for your invaluable assistance along this journey. And I thank Julie Bishop, our senior Western Australian Liberal, who was so generous with her time.


I also owe an enormous debt of gratitude to the 27 shadow ministers and parliamentary secretaries who visited the electorate, some on several occasions, and, in the case of Senator Ronaldson, on five separate visits. To our state MPs, Jim Chown and Graham Jacobs: your support and guidance have been greatly appreciated.


The fast and efficient establishment of my electorate offices in Kalgoorlie and Albany is a testament to the professionalism of my staff, and I thank them for their hard work so far.


In a long and arduous campaign, where a candidate is constantly seeking assistance and favours, it is inevitable that we turn to our family and close friends, and it is here that I direct my warmest thanks. To my big brother, Allan, who throughout my life has allowed me to pursue my dreams while he has steadfastly kept the business running, I owe a debt that I can never repay. To my big sister, Kate, whose amazing media and communication skills, along with her commitment, dedication and sense of purpose, were an inspiration to me and all of our team: I thank you from the bottom of my heart. To Michael Pedley: your contribution to the campaign was amazing and I cannot imagine how we would have managed without you. To my sisters Deb, Jane, Bev; my brother-in-law Gary; my nieces Danielle, Lucy and Amelia; and my nephew Scotty: I thank you for your contributions, big and small.


My final and most important thankyou is to my wonderful wife, Tanya: throughout the long and at times difficult campaign, you have been my support, my reassurance, my rock. You have endured the sacrifices without complaint, and without your courage and strength I could not contemplate this journey that we are about to embark on. To my beautiful children, Emma, Annalise, Phillippa and Archie: I apologise in advance for the birthdays missed, the sports carnivals I could not attend, the milestones achieved when Dad was busy somewhere in the electorate. It is my fervent hope that, at some point in the future, we will reflect back on this time and we will all agree it was worthwhile.


Finally, to the electors of O'Connor, I reiterate the commitment that I have made to work tirelessly on your behalf, to always be frank and honest about the challenges we face, and to work cooperatively and collaboratively to improve the lives of the people who live in the greatest part of the greatest nation on earth. Thank you.



The SPEAKER:  Before I call the honourable member for Gellibrand, I would remind the House that he is making his maiden speech and I would ask the House to extend to him the same courtesies that we have just extended to the honourable member for O'Connor.

",HoR,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH,15,1
"Watts, Tim, MP",ALP,2013-12-02,"



Mr WATTS
 (Gellibrand) (15:50):  I rise to speak in this place for the first time, conscious that I do so not only in front of the House but most importantly in front of my family. My two children are, at the same time, second and seventh generation Australians. On their paternal side, they are the progeny of six generations of Anglo-Saxon Protestants and, on their maternal side, of first generation Chinese migrants. My children's paternal ancestor, John Watts, set out for Australia from England as a 19-year-old in 1840. He came to Australia seeking the opportunity of what he called 'the colonial life' and became a landowner in the area now represented here by the member for Groom. In 1859, he was elected as the member for Drayton and Toowoomba in the first Queensland parliament and later became minister for public works. I regret to inform the House that John Watts was not a labour man, describing himself as a 'liberal conservative'. I do not question his judgement too severely as the great Australian  Labor Party would not be established until some 24 years after he had left parliament.


My wife and her family came to this country from Hong Kong in 1985 seeking the same freedom and opportunity in our nation as John Watts did some 150 years before them. They brought with them a different language and cultural tradition, but they shared the same desire and determination to be the architects of a better life for themselves and for their children. Today, these braided threads of my children's heritage are equally fundamental to both their own and the Australian identity. However, in 1877, less than 10 years after my ancestor left parliament, the Queensland parliament passed a series of laws designed to force Chinese residents out of the state. The presence of my family here today—diverse, happy and thriving in a modern Australia—is a living testament to how far we have come as a nation in the last 150 years. This transformation did not happen by accident; it happened because of our politics.


Members will appreciate that 'politics' is a term of contempt in this country. However, as unpopular as it may be, it is our politics that created the institutional framework for Australia's prosperity. The success of our politics at building the institutions of growth and fairness in our society has been our true national advantage. This is why I am humbled to be elected to this place as the member for Gellibrand. I am particularly honoured to be representing a seat with such a strong Labor history. Gellibrand has always been held by the Labor Party, and most recently Nicola Roxon and Ralph Willis provided four decades of extraordinary service to the Labor cause.


It is not easy being a Labor member of this House. While Labor's ideological objective—expanding equality of opportunity, social and economic—is very simple, more often than not the political task of advancing this cause is a very difficult one. Labor is the fire in our democracy. We are the source of the combustion that drives political change in our nation, but this flame is difficult to maintain. When the tenders of this flame have failed to fuel it, when we have let the embers of reform burn too low, the public has overlooked us. Equally, when we have let the fires of radical change burn too rapidly, when the flame has grown too wild, the public has recoiled and rejected us.


My strategy for the tending of this flame of change is taken from the New Labour strategist, the late Lord Philip Gould. He convinced me that progressives should not focus simply on winning elections, as crucial as that was, but instead plan on the bigger picture of winning centuries. Lord Gould argued that to win centuries Labor must win the battle of ideas in our community over the long term, rallying public support to our causes in both government and opposition and forcing the conservatives to fight on political ground already captured in the minds of the public by the ideas of the progressive movement. To win centuries, Labor must shape public opinion over time, not merely reflect it. In fact, Labor must win the public debate so comprehensively in the hearts and minds of the people that, once introduced, our reforms are so embedded in a bedrock of community support that they simply cannot be overturned by a conservative government, no matter how transient.


Labor's agenda won the 20th century. We were not in power for the majority of the last 100 years, but our ideas were. From the Fisher government's championing of the old age pension and workers' compensation to the Curtin government's wartime leadership and foundational work on the Anzac alliance; from the Chifley government's nation building and leadership of the establishment of the United Nations to the Whitlam government's opening of Australia to the world through tariff reduction, trade relations with China and multiculturalism; from the Hawke government's Medicare, HECS, compulsory superannuation, dollar float and financial deregulation to the Keating government's Native Title Act, enterprise bargaining, national competition policy and APEC leaders meeting; and throughout it all the union movement's fight for better conditions for workers; it was Labor ideas that shaped the 20th century.


Members on this side of the House can look back on this legacy with pride, but the question confronting new members is how we can win the 21st century. The Labor reforms of the past are a great legacy, but they are just that: the past. We must keep feeding the fires of political reform, looking ahead and engaging with the challenges of the future. To win the next century, Labor must see the changing landscape of the nation, understand the trends that are already shaping our future and paint the big picture about how Labor's reform agenda will create a fairer and more prosperous nation. This is a challenge that the party will need to take up on many fronts—education, secure work, urban liveability, workforce participation, climate change and regulatory growth, to name just a few. There are, however, three fronts of this fight that I want to personally address briefly today: first, defending the role of government in a period of fiscal challenge; second, championing the online communities which have emerged as a result of the digital revolution; and, third, showing that the success of our open economy depends on our open society founded on immigration and multiculturalism.


The first must-win debate for Labor is the role of government in a time of fiscal challenge. The case for an intelligent, active government needs to be continually remade. We in the Labor Party are different from the conservatives because we understand the role that government must play to make our nation a fairer and more prosperous place. While Labor must resist the unthinking Left, whose answer is always and everywhere to increase the role of the state, we must also rebut the ideologues of the Right who see no role for government that does not simply prop up the status quo.


It is no secret that Australia is currently in a period of structural fiscal constraint. Important sources of government revenue are under pressure and significant areas of government expenditure are growing. If we do nothing, the budget goes backwards. Yet, while you might easily miss it amongst the din and filthy clamour of partisanship and sloganeering, Australia already has a lean government by international standards. Our tax-to-GDP and spending-to-GDP ratios are among the lowest in the developed world. Despite this, the conservatives' response to fiscal contraction has been to unthinkingly and ideologically cut government spending. Their instinct is to chase the spiral downwards.


In this context, Labor must convince the public that the size of government must be determined primarily by our expectations of it. While some public revenue sources are under pressure, the task of government has not reduced. We cannot cut our way to a fairer and more prosperous nation. We must continue to invest in urban infrastructure so that the strains of population growth do not cripple the productivity of those living in our cities and suburbs—investments like the regional rail link and metro rail tunnel that will allow for more services and ensure a faster and more reliable commute for people across Melbourne's west, not just for those who catch the train but also for those who drive.


We must invest in the nation's human capital, ensuring that we have a workforce that possesses the skills needed to do the high-paying work of the modern economy—investments like Labor's Better Schools package, which delivered millions in additional funding for schools in Melbourne's west and was distributed to those who needed it the most on a needs based funding model.


We must continue to invest in the health of our people to avoid the emerging fiscal productivity and participation crisis of the rise of chronic disease. In Gellibrand, 5.3 per cent of the population currently suffers from diabetes. It is estimated that there are half as many again with undiagnosed diabetes or pre-diabetes. Without investments in preventative health, like Labor's Medicare Locals, the cost of this chronic disease will be felt throughout the budget and the economy. These brief examples show that there will always be problems that we need to collectively pool our resources in order to solve. In these areas, the short-term savings of smaller government condemn our society and economy to greater costs in the long term.


The second must-win debate for Labor is our response to the digital revolution. The word 'revolution' is overused, but one of the few true revolutions we have experienced in our society over the past decade has been the impact of the spread of digital technology on the way people communicate. Before coming to this place, I spent the better part of 10 years working in the ICT industry and I have seen the pace and scale of this change firsthand. Consider that the first iPhone was released in this country in the year after the Rudd government was elected. In the barely six years since, the proportion of the Australian population who own a smartphone has exploded to over 72 per cent, all of whom are now walking around with computer processors in their pockets more powerful than those used by NASA to put a man on the moon 50 years ago. 


However, for all its technical wonder, the most important aspect of the digital revolution is not technology; it is people. The internet has made it dramatically easier to find other people who are passionate about the same things you are, to share information with these people and then to collaborate in producing altogether new information with others in these communities, often with non-financial motivation. This new mode of production, peer production, has brought us a series of what Australian economist Nicholas Gruen has called 'emergent public goods'—goods such as the GNU/Linux operating system that supports the majority of the world's web servers, the Android mobile operating system that operates on the majority of the world's smartphones, and Wikipedia, the largest encyclopedia ever produced. At the same time, social media has allowed specialised communities of interest to form around even the most obscure subjects, producing unprecedented and constantly evolving repositories of technical expertise, culture and journalism—all created by communities for the benefit of other community members. In this era of unprecedented connectivity, as Michael Wesch puts it, 'The machine is us.' 


These changes are particularly important for the progressive movement. We are a movement founded on collective action, on people working together for mutual gain. From the early cooperatives, mutual societies and trade unions, progressives have pioneered new institutional arrangements for organising collective action. The digital revolution has made possible a panoply of new ways of acting collectively, but we have not yet engaged with this change on a philosophical or institutional level. We need to do so soon, as the way we respond to the digital revolution has the potential to become the major ideological divide over the next decade—the next century, in fact. It has implications for how progressives should think about issues as varied as tax, defence, public services, trade, privacy and infrastructure investment. For this reason, the work of thinkers like Yochai Benkler, Richard Stallman, Eric Raymond, Lawrence Lessig and Eric von Hippel, who have studied these online communities, should be essential readings for all progressives. 


In particular, progressives must become aware of the ways that government and business can stifle these online communities. There are already many examples of this in Australia, particularly with respect to intellectual property. As Chief Justice French noted in a case close to the heart of my predecessor in this place—the tobacco plain-packaging challenge—intellectual property is an instrument of policy created by government to serve the public. Figures as varied as Adam Smith, Friedrich Hayek and Thomas Jefferson have long warned of the dangers of this statutory monopoly and its tendency to expand. Despite this, policymakers continue to view intellectual property as little more than an innate property right to be unthinkingly protected by government. This orthodoxy is buttressed by trade agreements, often negotiated without transparency or democratic accountability, that, instead of promoting free trade, are increasingly providing the expansion of private statutory monopolies. 


Australian copyright law, in which all reproduction is prohibited—other than specific, narrow exceptions—is particularly problematic and is currently throwing sand in the gears of digital innovation in this country. In the absence of a broadbased fair-use exception, innovations like the Google search engine and the iPod were legally problematic under Australian law upon introduction—chilling incentives for digital innovation in this country. Patent laws are already becoming a similar handbrake on innovation. As maker communities and 3-D printing grow in popularity, so too will disputes about patent infringement. The emergence of commercial patent trolls in the technology sector is just the beginning of this problem. 


In response, progressives should champion a new microeconomic reform agenda to re-evaluate intellectual property law from first principles, focusing on incentives and public benefits—not the mindless protection of statutory monopolies. This process should be led by economists and innovators, not lawyers and rent seekers. Without it, intellectual property will increasingly become an instrument for the protection of vested interests rather than the promotion of innovation. As progressives, we must stand up for the new online communities created by the digital revolution. They are our people acting in a long, progressive tradition and we must be a voice for them in this place. To win the 21st century on matters digital, our mantra as progressives must become, 'It's the community, stupid.'


The final must-win debate for Labor is the importance of Australia's open society to our open economy. Through leaders like Whitlam, Hawke and Keating, Labor has argued well the case for the openness of our economy. What we have not argued with similar vigour is that an open economy cannot reach its full potential without an equally open society. The foundation stones of Australia's open society have been immigration and multiculturalism. 


Our early history was violent and the product of thinking and ideas that are foreign to us now. But even then, the southern continent, Terra Australis, was a canvas for the projected hopes of many in Europe and Asia—a new place that could perhaps be free of the injustices and prejudices of the Old World. For the most part, we have borne out this promise, but we will not have fully honoured it until we break our remaining links with the exclusive institution of the British monarchy and become a republic that allows all Australians to say that they have a head of state who is one of their own. 


As a nation, we have used this position as a beacon for ambitious dreamers around the world—to our overwhelming benefit. As in the case of my family, over 60 per cent of the residents of Gellibrand have at least one parent born overseas. In the last term of government alone, we welcomed more than 350,000 skilled migrants to our shores, increasing our productiveness and helping us to avoid the costs of an ageing population. The reason these migrants chose Australia is the opportunity of an open society that has proven to the world that multiculturalism can make our nation stronger. As Tim Soutphommasane, Australia's Race Discrimination Commissioner, has argued, Australia has developed a uniquely successful model of multiculturalism founded on the concept of citizenship. This model recognises that cultural heritage can form an important part of a citizen's identity and that, generally, individuals should be free to express it. 


However, by viewing multiculturalism through the prism of citizenship, Australian multiculturalism has also emphasised that this liberty is coupled with unifying and overarching obligations that we all have as citizens of a liberal democracy. Australia is a country where you are free to wear a hijab or celebrate Italy winning a World Cup game, even when they beat Australia—maybe. But you cannot bribe a government official, incite ethnic violence or take a child bride. The openness of our society and the opportunity we have extended to migrants to our nation has left Australia better placed to succeed in an open global economy. The great Australian chronicler of our nation's Anglo-Celtic convict heritage, Robert Hughes, noted that multiculturalism:


… proposes … that some of the most interesting things in history and culture happen at the interface between cultures … the future .. in a globalized economy … will lie with people who can think and act with informed grace across ethnic, cultural, linguistic lines … In the world that is coming, if you can't navigate difference, you've had it.


Despite this, there are those who seek to threaten Australia's multicultural success story. There are those on the other side of this chamber, particularly in the other place, who do not understand the success of the Australian model of multiculturalism and instead attack it with imported political arguments from nations with different experiences. There are those who are willing to sacrifice the success of our multicultural, open society to seek political advantage through the demonisation of asylum seekers who arrive through unauthorised channels. 


Nowhere is this better illustrated than in the decision of this government to rename the Department of Immigration and Citizenship the Department of Immigration and Border Protection. Let us reflect on those two terms, 'citizenship' and 'border protection.' One of those terms is about inclusion, the other about repulsion. One is about opportunity, one is about fear. One represents a very large number of people, the other a very small number. Such are the ignorant, inverted priorities of the coalition—priorities that sacrifice the very foundation of the success of the Australian model of multiculturalism, citizenship, in favour of language that raises the drawbridge on the rest of the world. 


Labor must challenge these threats to the success of our open society and continue to convince the public that Australian multiculturalism makes our nation stronger. We must argue that while we are morally compelled to do what is necessary to ensure that asylum seekers arrive in Australia in a fair and orderly way, to protect the primacy of Australia and citizenship for all, we must also ensure that we are offering refuge to those in need in proportion to our capacity to assist. In this context, this government's dramatic cuts to Australia's annual refugee intake and aid budget, at a time when so many people—in the countries surrounding Syria and in the refugee camps of Africa and Asia in particular—are so desperate, is an abject moral failure. These are good people with the bad luck to live in countries whose governments gas their citizens or where militias murder, mutilate and rape women and children. As a party who believes in equality of opportunity in a nation that has benefited so much from an open society, and in a country that knows how to make multiculturalism work, Labor cannot abandon them if we hope to win the 21st century.


I would like to conclude by thanking the people who have contributed to my being here today. To my wife Joyce: it is a cliche to say that someone is your better half, but in my case my wife is truly everything good in a person, that I am not. I thank you for your love and support and sacrifice, and I say here today that you have a commitment from me written in Hansard that our family life will not be Borgen-ed by this job! To my grandfather, who passed away recently, and my grandmother, who I lived with for a number of years: you stamped the twin obligations of hard work and community service on generations of your family, and I thank you. To my immediate family—my father, Peter, my mother, Yvonne, and my brother and sister, David and Sarah—and my uncles Ian, Michael, Derek and Barry and my aunties Jacqui and Pam: you are people who helped me find my political values and supported me in chasing my dreams and I thank you. To my in-laws Wang and Dominica Kwok, I thank you for welcoming me into your family and supporting Joyce and me in this difficult expedition into political life.


Thanking party supporters by name is a sure way to offend many, given the many hundreds who gave their time to the Labor campaign in Gellibrand, so I will limit myself to thanking my core campaign team—my indefatigable campaign manager Jesse Overton-Skinner, Melissa Horne, Hamish Park, Fiona Ward, Matt Nurse, Cesar Piperno, Telmo Languiller, Andrew Moore and James Kenyon. To Senator Conroy, who has supported me and mentored me for many years now, even when he has thought me to be misguided—we do not always agree; he is a Collingwood supporter after all—I am proud to be associated with his enormous contribution to Australia and the Labor cause.


Finally, I want to thank the other MPs on this side of the House who have given their first speeches in parliament. I have had the privilege of listening to many of your speeches before giving my own today, and it has been an inspiration. I proudly associate myself with those speeches. We are the Promethean party—the bearers of the fires of political change. This task is a difficult one but I am confident in Labor's future knowing that I share this mission with you all. I thank the House.

"Price, Melissa, MP",LP,2013-12-02,"



Ms PRICE
 (Durack) (16:12):  Madam Speaker, I too wish to add my voice to the very long chorus of well-wishers regarding your elevation to the position of Speaker of the House. I am confident that your experience and knowledge, and not forgetting your grace and good humour, will bring dignity and humility to this House.


I am an ordinary person now with an extraordinary job. I have the job of representing the people of Durack. This is a huge responsibility and one that I do not take lightly. I am very humbled to have been entrusted by the people of Durack to be their representative. I intend to work hard so that I may serve them for many years. But no matter what happens I am determined to leave my mark by making Durack and Australia a better place to live.


I am a girl from Kalgoorlie—the gold mining town in the eastern goldfields of Western Australia. I left school at the age of 15. I did not think the nuns could teach me anything further. I was wrong, of course, and had to find out the hard way. I eventually returned to complete my education, qualifying as a lawyer at the age of 31. I am the youngest of four children, with two older brothers, Mark and Greg, and my sister, Lynda. My parents, Ray and Lyn Dellar, created a loving family and went without to give to us all a Catholic education. I give thanks to those educators—the nuns and lay teachers at St Mary's Catholic Primary School and Prendiville Ladies College, as it was then.


Growing up in the goldfields in the 1960s and 1970s was no picnic. The gold price was unpredictable so times were tough. But in those days people who worked on the mines worked regular hours, went home to their families at night and were able to contribute to the community more broadly. Growing up, my mother encouraged my siblings and me to 'just have a go', 'do your best, that's all that can be asked of you.' These words of encouragement have followed me through life and given me the belief that to be successful all you need is effort—the rewards will flow.


I am a fourth generation goldfielder. My grandad David Dellar entered the Western Australian state parliament as a Labor politician in 1963. My uncle, Stan Dellar, also Labor, was elected to the parliament and was famously knocked from his seat by my friend the Hon. Norman Moore MLC, in 1977, who retired only last year after a stellar career. My father also had aspirations of a political life but the opportunity did not present itself. He did work hard for the Labor Party and worked on many different campaigns.


As a child growing up I saw my parents' involvement in the Labor Party as really just a part of their social life—not as political activism—not unlike many people living in mining towns in that era. Mum and I both agree that if grandad Dellar were alive today he would probably be a Liberal. He was a hard worker, took good care of his own and was quite the entrepreneur with his various mining interests. I also pay tribute to my mother's parents, Norman and Olive Blurton, who raised to their eight children in Leonora and Wiluna, later moving to Useless Loop to work in the salt works.


Not unlike many people who have grown up in regional Australia, I did not always love living in the bush. I often thought I was missing out on things that people from the city just took for granted. However, Sherbet and Renee Geyer did come to Kalgoorlie, so it was not all that bad! What you do get, though, from living in a country town is a sense of belonging to a community. I have never lost that belief that people from the bush really know me and understand me, and, more importantly, that I know and understand them. That passion for and understanding of people from regional Western Australia will drive me to be a strong voice for Durack and to champion all that it is and all that it can be.


The federal electorate of Kalgoorlie was first proclaimed in 1901, with the change to the electoral boundary to create Durack not taking place until 2008. I would like to take this opportunity to thank each of my predecessors of all political persuasions who have helped to create the powerhouse region that Durack is today. My first mention must, of course, go to Mr Barry Haase, who is here with us today. Thank you, Barry, for all the hard work that you have given to the electorate for 15 years. I would also like to thank and acknowledge other past members: Graeme Campbell, Mick Cotter and Fred Collard, to name but a few.


I have some 30-odd years of combined commercial and legal experience. The member for Curtin and the member for Pearce and I are the three members of the Clayton Utz Perth alumni here in Canberra. I am very grateful to my former colleagues from Clayton Utz for their tutelage and friendship, especially Adrienne Parker, Mary-Alice Paton and Stephen Boyle. Some would say I have had a colourful work history. I have enjoyed working in the hospitality and insurance industries, and also in management in the fast food industry, the grains industry and the mining industry, where I worked for Robe River Iron Associates at Wickham, and also the iron ore company Crosslands Resources. I was even an aerobics instructor at one point in my history. I think the House can probably judge for itself that I appear to have more in common with the fast food industry now than the fitness industry! More recently, I have been given the opportunity to work in more regionally focused industries. I had a legal and then a business development role at the CBH Group. This experience was very valuable for a girl from the goldfields. An appreciation and understanding of the farming industry is critical in a seat such as Durack, and, although I am no farmer, this experience taught me much about this important industry, including its passion for community and the challenges of running this type of a business.


My time working for Crosslands Resources, which is part of the Oakajee stable of companies, and is owned by Mitsubishi Corporation, was also very valuable. Wearing my business development hat I had the pleasure of travelling deep into the mid-west to assess possible mining acquisitions, near to towns like Yalgoo, Cue and Meekatharra. Regrettably, the Oakajee Port and Rail project is currently on the backburner, but I have no doubt that a solution will be found in the near future and we will all witness the unlocking of the value of the iron ore industry in the mid-west. In the meantime, Geraldton has displayed her resilience and has taken advantage of other opportunities as they have arisen.


I would like to take this opportunity to pay my respects to the Durack family, who were pioneers and developers of the Kimberley, and whose namesake epitomises the progress of this great region. The electorate of Durack is quite simply like no other in Australia or the world. Its sheer size, of approximately 1.6 million square kilometres, or one-third of Australia's land mass, makes it not only Australia's largest electorate but also the second largest electorate in the world. Durack's future relies upon successful diversification of industry. To achieve this in a region that encompasses 46 shire councils and stretches from the mid-west and the wheat belt through to the Gascoyne, Pilbara and Kimberley will be no easy feat.


As a kid from the bush, I know the region has its problems, but I also know its potential. It is my hope that this current parliament is remembered not only for the economic benefits Durack makes to Australia's economy but also for the contributions this parliament gives back to the electorate. Ensuring that all families have access to affordable child care, supporting small businesses and making improvements to services such as aged care facilities, telecommunications and road and port infrastructure is what everyday Australians will thank us for.


People may step back from the Durack electorate and say, 'Boy, do you have it all!' We have a multi-billion dollar resources industry which has risen out of the red dirt of the Pilbara, and we have some of the most unique and interesting landscapes in the world, from the wonders of the Ningaloo Reef and Karijini National Park to the picturesque Kimberley region. To those people I would say, 'Yes, we do have it all!' It is a big region with a big economy, but also with big problems. The Durack electorate will face many obstacles, particularly over the next decade, to diversify and meet these challenges.


Madam Speaker, you may not be surprised to know that one of the biggest sectors suffering in Durack is the small business sector. What is good for small business is good for Australia—in particular, in regional communities. In Durack, yes, we have the resources industry, but not all have benefited from this economic activity. In short, it has not been the land of milk and honey for everyone. In mining towns in Durack the cost of housing is now starting to ease, but the reality is that if you are working in the service sector or running a small business in these communities you are still struggling. We also see small businesses in the wheat-belt towns fighting to keep their doors open. As we all know, these small businesses are often the glue that holds these communities together. Whether it is the pharmacy in Kellerberrin, the tour operator in Broome or the B&B in Kalbarri, the story is the same. We need to reduce red tape, get rid of unnecessary taxes—something that I am pleased to say that the Abbott-led government is well on its way to achieving—and restore confidence to the economy. Small business can then flourish and hire more people—jobs for our children, jobs for our grandchildren.


Getting rid of the carbon tax is a significant step forward to provide an injection of hope for these constituents. The establishment of a parliamentary committee for the development of Northern Australia, with the honourable Warren Entsch as its chair, is yet another example of this government's foresight into the need to plan for Australia's strategic growth. I hope to be able to contribute in a meaningful way to the creation and the ultimate implementation of the white paper for Northern Australia.


Western Australia's resources industry, whose main contributors are the Pilbara and Kimberley regions in Durack, was the country's largest exporter in 2012, contributing 46 per cent or $114 billion to Australia's total merchandise exports. Big business has invested in this region and has reaped the benefits, but the ordinary person struggles with a higher-than-average cost of living, and we experience the same social issues as any other electorate. Madam Speaker, the Kimberley is one of Australia's hidden treasures, with spectacular gorges and waterfalls. The view from the Five Rivers Lookout in Wyndham is breathtaking, as is Cable Beach in Broome. But our tourism industry is under threat. The beauty of the canary-yellow canola fields and the light brown, healthy wheat hides the fact that there are still many farmers in the wheat belt who are struggling from previous poor harvests. The availability of the federal concessional farm loans scheme is important to these farm businesses. The arrangements between the Western Australian and federal governments must be finalised as quickly as possible.


Many cattle producers are still recovering from the effects of Labor's knee-jerk ban on live animal exports. This has highlighted how vulnerable this part of the industry is with so few markets; the sooner we can open up more markets, the better. Whilst the opponents of this industry are focused on animal welfare, I am focused on human welfare as we hear disturbing stories of cattle producers' families receiving threats, with too many taking their own lives. These are all issues that I know are important to my coalition colleagues. Our leadership team has already taken the first steps to ensure that the issues which affect the lives of everyday Australians are a first priority.


Madam Speaker, you did not need a crystal ball to predict the failure of the mining tax. Although it raised, relatively, no revenue, it still hung over the mining industry like a bad smell. From a regulatory point of view, it put a drain on the industry, whilst also discouraging investment and making Australia internationally uncompetitive. Whilst we have taken the first steps to rid Australia of the mining tax, it is worth reflecting on the positive impact that the resources industry has had, particularly at a local level. Our regional communities have benefited significantly from this industry in terms of infrastructure and employment opportunities, with one of the most valuable contributions being to Indigenous employment. The WA resources sector is the largest employer of Indigenous Australians, who comprise 4.2 per cent of its overall workforce. I believe that everyone in this House today would agree that there is a desperate need to improve the lives of Indigenous people in Australia. Although there has been some progress with government and community programs, we still have a long way to go. I applaud Prime Minister Abbott's decision to include Indigenous Affairs as part of his office, and I wish Warren Mundine the very best in his role as the Chair of the Indigenous Advisory Council, and with the creation of successful future policies for Indigenous Australians. Make no mistake: this is a tough job. It will take very strong leadership and courage to make the necessary changes. We need policies that will ensure that current and future generations of Aboriginal children are educated, have hope and opportunities, and remain healthy—so that they may aspire to contribute in their own ways to this great country. Durack has the third-highest proportion of Aboriginal residents. My plea is that history will show that this 44th Parliament showed the courage and the foresight to adopt policies that improved the lives of these Durack residents.


If you live in the city, your choices for post-secondary education are usually many; if you live in the bush, this is often not the case. Australia needs to promote and support the increase in post-secondary education service providers in rural and regional areas. Not everyone wants to study and live in the city, and our country cousins should be afforded the same opportunities as are available in the cities.


We still have a long way to go to improve health services in rural and regional areas. Just having a local doctor can make a huge difference to a community, but sadly that service is not always available. Part of the solution is to ensure that young people from regional areas are given the opportunity to study medicine. Providing rural and remote placements for student doctors should also be encouraged, so that these students gain a greater understanding of the health needs of regional Australia and, hopefully, return to take up practice.


I pause for a moment to reflect on the not-for-profit sector. This is an important part of our economic make-up; a sector that knows how to make a dollar go that bit further. Government funding of the not-for-profit sector should always be seen as a value-add. As a director of both the Cancer Council (WA) and BrightSpark Foundation, I have experienced firsthand the valuable contribution that this sector makes, especially in supporting cancer and child health research. I pay tribute to my friends and fellow board members who dedicate much of their unpaid time and expertise to ensuring the success of the not-for-profit sector, for the benefit of us all: in particular, Jenny Rogers, Professor Christobel Saunders, Pina Caffarelli, Graham Dowland, the Hon. Hendy Cowan, Andrew Thompson and Kim Pervan.


Government needs to be smaller, and more efficient; government departments more accountable, and more productive—with their performances measured to ensure that Australians are getting good value for money. Australia simply cannot afford not to make changes to the way in which we govern. A reduction in government employee numbers is a good start but, culturally, we have a long way to go. With the Abbott-led government now at the helm, we must strive for such changes. I look forward to being a part of the team that brings about the necessary cultural shift.


Like all new members of parliament, I did not arrive at this place without receiving a helping hand. My journey began during the Western Australian state election earlier in the year, when I was the candidate for the state seat of Kalgoorlie. I narrowly missed out on winning the seat. The experience did, however, sharpen my resolve to be a strong advocate for regional Western Australia, and it made me even more determined to win the seat of Durack so that I could be a strong voice in this House. I say a special thanks to Linda Crook, my campaign manager for the Kalgoorlie campaign, who believed in me then and has supported me ever since. Thanks also to the Kalgoorlie campaign team and all those at the Kalgoorlie Liberal branch, and to my family in Kalgoorlie: you have all played a part in my journey to Canberra.


My campaign to retain the seat of Durack was a very short, sharp, fast-paced six weeks. Although the seat was already held by the Liberal Party, success was not guaranteed. The campaign team therefore needed to be something very special to have any hope of holding the largest seat in Australia. I call this special group of people the 'Durack Dream Team'. I sincerely thank the members of this team who are as follows: Ben Morton, Ben Allen, David De Garis, Joey Armenti, Gordon Thomson, Ruth McLagon, Senator Alan Eggelston—thanks Eggy—and my dear friends Michelle Lewis and the Hon. Mark Lewis. A special mention and thank you goes also to Ian Blayney, the member for Geraldton, and Greg and Fran Weller, and all the Liberal branch members in the electorate. 


I would also thank my electoral staff who have really helped me to hit the ground running. Many thanks to De-Arne, Leanne, Jackie, Louise, Shannen and Lorraine. I know that together we will achieve great things for Durack. For her hard work on election day, I thank Judy, who organised the booth workers and all the numerous volunteers, far too many to mention. Special mention must go to my mum, sister Lynda, Brian, Jessica, Hannah, Alistair, Sheena, Aunty Mandy and Patrick. Special thanks also to the Hon. Norman Moore and Lee Moore, the Hon. Ken Baston and Robin Baston, Senator Eggelston, Tammy Corby, the Hon. Mark Lewis and Barry Haase for their extra special efforts on the day. I really could not have done it without them.


Madam Speaker, I thank the following new and old friends that may not have always understood my journey but have supported me nonetheless: Hilary MacDonald, Hayley Lawrance, Karen McGougan, Bev Sinclair and John Blakemore, Nicki and Maurice, Amaryl and Aldo, Craig and Trish, Shorty and Kate and Gary Connell. Thank you to the Price family and the Bell family for accepting me into their families without question. To my adorable Brad, being the member for Durack would not be possible without your love and support. Finally thanks to Rhiannon: may she rest in peace and keep close watch over me—now my guardian angel.

"O'Neil, Clare, MP",ALP,2013-12-02,"



Ms O'NEIL
 (Hotham) (16:32):  Thirty years ago, a group of Cambodians purchased a large piece of land in Springvale South. They had a vision of a regional temple, where thousands of local Buddhists would gather to worship but, when construction began, it was beset by problems. At this time one of the congregation began to be visited in her dreams by a Bunurong woman. 'This is not your land,' she would repeat night after night. The monks conferred and agreed that a shrine would be built to honour the Bunurong, and the congregation began to leave gifts of fruit, avocado and nuts. From there, construction ran smoothly and today Clarke Road temple is one of the largest in Melbourne. Still, worshippers leave gifts at the shrine to the Bunurong to show their respect to the traditional owners of that land.


Just to the north is Westall Secondary College, one of the most multicultural schools in Victoria. The school sits opposite the site of the old Springvale Enterprise Migrant Hostel. Between 1970 and 1992, 30,000 migrants and refugees called this hostel their first Australian home. They received food, shelter and services and were allowed to find their feet in a new land. Each day, while parents took English classes and looked for work, their children would cross Westall Road and access free, quality education. A generation later, those students are making their own contributions as doctors, lawyers, scientists and community workers of Melbourne's south-east.


Up Fairbank Avenue stands the Corning factory, where scores of local workers are making and testing the fibres that will be a part of the National Broadband Network. The factory floor is not dirty, and the workers do not sweat. This is modern manufacturing, made possible by a clever and adaptable workforce. Just down south, the trucks of Butler Market Gardens in Heatherton are setting out to deliver their speciality Asian produce to supermarkets around Melbourne. They have been at it for six generations. Market gardens like this one once stretched right across Cheltenham, Moorabbin and Clarinda, and today the gardens that remain form part of Melbourne's green wedge, which we call lungs of the south-east. It is fiercely protected from development by local activists who fight to preserve this area's rural character. Nearby, in the early evening, the netball courts at Duncan McKinnon Reserve will be filled with shouts and squeaks of rubber soles as girls of all grades get together for a regular game. Families surround the sidelines—husbands cheering for their wives, brothers for their sisters, dads for their daughters.


This is my electorate of Hotham. It will always be the traditional land of the Bunurong and will be ever lucky for the migrants who have made our local area their home too. It is a place of industry and enterprise, of community and family—proof of this country's achievements and its potential. This is Hotham; this is modern Australia. Whether I am at home or in Canberra, fighting for the people of Hotham, who have placed their trust in me, will always come first. So it was for Simon Crean, who gave 23 years of his life to this electorate and to making Australia a better, fairer, more open country. He was, and is, a reformer, a thinker, a negotiator, a doer; a politician who brought a good mind and a good heart to every task. He was equally at home in the suburbs or in a country town, on the factory floor or in the boardroom, at the footy or at the opera. He is one of my Labor heroes and a person in whose footsteps I am honoured to walk. Simon also has a great track record of supporting Labor women. When I joined the Labor Party at 16, Simon was the first member of parliament I met. He helped me when I ran for council as a 22 year old and, a year later, he endorsed me as the mayor. Now, he has backed me all the way to federal parliament.


Standing in this House is for me part of a family tradition. I come from a long line of battlers, bohemians and radicals—of people who fought for what they believed in. My first Australian ancestor, John O'Neil, arrived in chains, arrested in London for boxing in the street. They say that on a 10-point scale of Irish wildness, John and his wife Ellen would probably have scored an eight or a nine. In 1853, they caught wind of a chance to escape poverty fast. They hired a dray, and with their three children, pitched a tent in the Ballarat goldfields. According to the family historians, when the injustice of the goldfields officers crossed a line, John joined the rebellion that would form the foundation of Australian democracy. John's great grandson, my grandfather Lou, was built from the same stuff. He was at various times a wool classer, a bar clerk, a station hand and a communist, but he was always a proud trade unionist and at one stage was jailed for fighting for rights that today we take for granted.


My mother's father was a frustrated poet. He won the Courier-Mail writing competition three times, but he saw out his days trapped in a job where he did not get to use that fine mind. My grandmother Clare was a kind and wise woman with the type of quiet, steely resolve needed to raise four children without money or support. Like so many of her generation, she missed out—no more than a grade-4 education, no income, no choices. They were a wonderful family in a tight-knit Catholic community in Brisbane, but they were trapped by the times.


My parents were raised by these people, and in their spirit. Mum and Dad were book publishers. My father, Lloyd O'Neil, started out in the book trade as a 16-year-old bookseller at Angus and Robertson. He used to tell the story of a woman who came in looking for a gift. They found the right book and, as he was ringing up the purchase, he said, 'And the best thing is this one was published in Australia,' and she said, 'If that's the case, I don't want it.' It was the cultural cringe, neatly wrapped in one encounter. 


From there, Dad made publishing books about Australia his life mission. He published more than 1,000 titles—on everything from sport and cooking to art, politics and history. He was no jingoist but he believed that the Australian experience was like no other and that it had created a distinctively Australian voice that deserved to be heard. He used to say, 'I would prefer to publish a lesser work of Henry Lawson than the best work of William Faulkner.' For Dad, and for our family, books about Australia were inherently good things—not because Australia was better but because they were books about us.


My mother shared these views, taking some of Australia's best ideas into form as books. Mum is one of the great perfectionists of Australia's publishing industry and ran her own dynamic publishing house. Many of her bestsellers were books on women's health, women's politics and women's money—knowledge she saw as essential to the independence of the modern Australian woman. Mum introduced me, even as a tiny little girl, to Australian art and theatre. She taught me about feminism and showed me that, when women work together, we are unstoppable.


It was, and remains with my stepfather Brian, a family where to be original and creative was infinitely more important than kicking goals and acing exams. It was a household full of ideas about what Australia is and what it could be: a brave country; an open and creative republic, wise to its history and culture; an independent and respected presence in the world; a fair, decent country that valued things that matter—jobs, the arts. And it was a household where it was absolutely implicit that we would be doing something to see Australia reach this potential. That is the tradition in which I become a member of parliament.


I think back to what my grandfather Harry could have done if he had had a proper education; how my grandmother Clare might have had her own money and, with it, her freedom; what grandfather Lou might have achieved if he had not been forced into poverty, sharing a one-room flat in Kings Cross with my young father. I think of how they missed out, and so did Australia. The root of disadvantage was, in every case, economic. 


I had this in mind almost a decade ago when I set out to try to understand more about economics and business. I have been lucky in that time to study with some of the world's most famous economists. I have sat in boardrooms and worked in workplaces in mining, manufacturing, telecommunications and retail—just about every part of Australia's economy. I have closed the trading day at the New York Stock Exchange and helped a group of Aboriginal women build a business that will one day provide them with their first jobs.


What have I learned? For the growing parts of our economy, the old lines of labour and capital have all but disappeared. Working people—more than two million of whom now own their own businesses, and almost all of whom are shareholders—know that a fair society needs a strong economy, and that means businesses that work. The big thinkers in Australian business also know that government is essential to helping them succeed—and I do not mean in a narrow sense. I think we modern students of economics know that government should not be building great tariff walls or controlling the big macroeconomic levers. But if we take our noses out of economics textbooks and look at how our economy really works, we will see that government provides the platform on which our businesses compete—and win—globally. Other countries exploit low wages or low export costs, but in Australia our source of advantage is our skilled population, our world-class infrastructure, our safe and lively cities and our culture of invention and scientific research. In all of these, government matters.


As the countries we compete with grow, this parliament faces the challenge of making reforms that will keep Australia ahead of the game. Over the next decade, global demand for food is going to double. How can we help Australian scientists and farmers be part of the agricultural revolution that will be required to meet this demand? Australia's temperature could rise by up to five degrees by 2070, creating radical changes to our weather, our rainfall and our environment. How can we help our energy, tourism and primary industries adjust?


By 2020, the world will face a shortage of about 40 million skilled workers. How will Australia compete in this environment? By 2025, more than 60 per cent of global GDP growth will come from just 600 cities around the world. None of them is in Australia. How can we help more parts of our economy connect with these cities so that more Australians can benefit from this growth? By 2070, Melbourne's population will double to 8.5 million. Sydney will be of a similar size. How can we make sure our cities are places where creative people, who will generate wealth, will continue to want to live?


Government need not answer these questions alone, by any means. But all will require good policy and clear communication from our political leaders. And there is one reform that will trump them all. In every business or  organisation I have worked in, whatever it is trying to achieve, the driver of success or failure is people. If Australia is going to thrive in a world of fierce and unrelenting competition, we must have one of the best education systems in the world. Being the best is achievable and it is real. But, at the moment, we are moving in the wrong direction—sliding further and further back down in international rankings.


At my school we had a big gym and plenty of Bunsen burners, but what mattered to me most was having Mr Farnsworth nurture my love of politics with his superb impromptu lectures on the history of the Labor Party and the Whitlam dismissal. 


What seems to get a bit lost in our conversations about education in this place is that it is teachers who matter most. This parliament should lead a conversation about how to attract, train and retain the best and brightest Australians, young and old, in this national endeavour.


We focus a lot in the education debate on secondary schools. But students of public policy are coming to terms with the reality that I think Australian mothers have known for generations and that is that, by the time a child starts secondary school, much about their life chances has actually already been determined.


My first experience of caring for a child was as a foster parent. A baby came into our care straight from hospital, seven weeks premature, tiny and defenceless. All that stood between that perfect, sleepy little baby and a house of violence and chaos, between having a chance and no chance, was government.


The main parties in Australia differ in their beliefs on many things. But I know that we all believe that children are worth protecting. So this should not be an area where we need any reform. Yet, of the more than 12,000 children who are currently living in care in Australia, about a quarter have lived in 10 or more foster homes. Today, more than 1,000 children are locked up in immigration detention, with limited access to education, and many are subject to abuse and self-harm.


Each child subjected to fear and to danger, each child who misses out on an education, on proper health care, on the very best start in this abundant country of ours is the special failing of the people in this room. In my time here, I want to help change that.


Another area of bipartisanship in this House is improving the situation for Indigenous Australians. Two years ago, I lived for nine months in the searing heat of North East Arnhem Land. I worked in an Indigenous community which continues in its traditional language and culture but which is beset by crises in health, housing and employment. For many decades politicians have said it is shameful. I want my generation to be the last to have to say it. To make things right, some things are going to have to change. No two Aboriginal communities are the same and, hard as it is, we are going to have to learn to work with each community individually. We need to narrow the chasm that exists between public policy made in Canberra and policy implemented on the ground. And we need to help Aboriginal people strengthen their voice.


We do face a lot of challenges in Australia but, when I look to the future, what I actually see is a lot of opportunity. We are made to tackle what this next century will throw at us. We are a small country, nimble, fast and strong. We are on the doorstep of some of the fastest growing economies in the world. Globalisation has become our reality and we have adapted. Our resources have given us a head start, as long as they do not dumb us down. We have a people who are open and willing to change, when they understand what is required and why it is necessary.


I know this because of what I see when I look back. The Australian story is a rather unlikely one. Our first people have sustained the oldest living culture in the world by surviving on a most inhospitable land. When a group of half-starving criminals sailed into Botany Bay, they learnt how to change and they survived. Through immigration, we have brought more than 150 cultures to our country and we have done it peacefully.


Our economy has made profound transitions, not once, not twice, but probably a dozen since Federation. Change is part of who we are. We have used times of difficulty and transition to make our country better. And we will do it again.


When I turn my mind to the big issues of the future, I know that I will not do it alone. I want to thank my team of personal advisers: my completely brilliant brother Patrick; my wise stepfather Brian; and my wonderful mother Anne, who has sacrificed so much for me. To the Munzel family: you have taught me so much about life in the bush and I feel privileged that you are a loving part of my family, too.


To Helen, Ian, Joan, Phoebe, PK, who are here, and to Dan, my wonderful cousin: thank you so much for all your support.


I want to thank Nick Staikos, who ran a fantastic election campaign and who continues to serve his community through my office, along with Carina, Barb, Robyn, Luke and Koula.


 Thanks to Geoff Lake and Tim Holding for their unfailing support, advice and friendship. Thanks to Hong Urn, Martin Pakula, wonderful state colleagues who represent their communities so admirably. I want to thank Julie Warren, Tim Kennedy and Charlie Donnelly at the NUW, who are showing us all what it takes to run a growing, successful, modern union. Thanks to Matt Rocks at the TWU and Nick Bantounas for their support and counsel.


I want to thank Hotham's wonderful local branches, led by a group of inspiring true believers: the indomitable Amy Duncan, who has just celebrated her 80th birthday; Steve Staikos; Steve Dimopoulos; Heang Meng Tak; Youhorn Chea; Loi Truong; Sean O'Reilly; Gael and Charlie Mitzi; the Sapir family; Jeffrey Lim; and many others. I want to thank fine Labor women, like Ann Barker, Judith Grayley and Jaala Pulford.


And, most of all, I want to thank my partner Brendan. Brendan is the finest person I know. He is my best friend, the father of our beautiful boy, a man whose commitment to living what he believes inspires me every day. I know that, if I can come home after each week in parliament and look him in the eye, I can be proud of the work that I do here. And that pride will not come from sitting on this green leather.


Since I was elected, I have thought about a girl named Sarah, who made me her sister and showed me what life in Arnhem Land communities is really like.


I thought about Amanda, who visited me in my office last week in utter despair about her son who is four years without a job, out of training, and has given up.


I thought about beautiful little Rachel, the baby we had the privilege of caring for and about how I might be able to provide more safety and structure for other little girls like her.


I thought about the dairy farmers of Brendan's community in northern Victoria, whose annual fortunes run with the weather, who worry sometimes for years at a time about putting food on the table and about how I might now have the chance to do something big, something real, for those Australians. That is when I will feel proud of what I have done. Thank you.



The SPEAKER:  Before I call the honourable member for Indi, I would remind the House that this is the honourable member's maiden speech. I would ask the House to extend to her the same courtesies as we have just extended to the member for Hotham.

"McGowan, Cathy, MP",Ind.,2013-12-02,"



Ms McGOWAN
 (Indi) (16:50):  Madam Speaker, parliamentary colleagues, special friends, family and David. Madam Speaker, warm congratulations to you on your election. I would like to take this opportunity to thank you and my colleagues in this place for their warm welcome. I proudly begin my first speech by acknowledging the traditional owners and custodians of this land both past and present. 


Today I am going to share a story, a story about myself, my electorate of Indi and the power of community to re-invent itself. I will introduce you to the Voice for Indi, the rural community movement and the philosophy that has brought me to this place.


I am honoured to be the representative of the people of Indi and I am grateful to my family, 700-plus supporters and volunteers, almost 1,000 donors and, of course, the voters who brought me to this House. Many of you have made an extraordinary effort to be here today and I can only imagine what you must have done—getting up early to have families organised, children, animals, lunches done, kids on buses, farms cared for, picnics packed, car pools organised and that terrific trip of six hours up the Hume Highway on buses.


To the volunteers, all of you who staffed the booths and ran the offices at Alexandra, Wangaratta, Wodonga and Benalla, the door knockers, those who made the cups of coffee and tea and arranged food, the people who ran classes and shared their skills, the scrutineers, the organisers of local meetings, the young people, the lawyers, the designers, the marketers, the diary keepers, the bookkeepers, the reporters, the journalists and, most important, the makers of all things orange—I recognise all of you for your courage, your belief and your conviction that we could do it. Thank you.


In the 1800s, some five generations ago, my family left Europe in harsh times to make a better life for themselves and their children's children's children. Their courage and persistence is my foundation, like it is for so many Australians and so many of the people who are gathered here. On my father's side, Elizabeth Anne Brown arrived from County Cork, Ireland in 1860. She was 20 and alone. She died at the grand age of 87 and is buried in the Tallangatta cemetery, her occupation, proudly, farmer. Arriving in the Chiltern goldfields of north-east Victoria, she quickly met and married a wise bloke, John Terrill, a miner from Cornwall, England.


In 1875 they selected land in the Mitta Valley just below the township of Tallangatta. Barely a year later, John Terrill was killed in a mining accident at El Dorado, leaving Elizabeth Anne to raise six children and two nephews. My family is rich with the stories of clearing the land, dealing with floods, fires and drought, and the desperate struggle to meet the conditions to purchase that land. In 1890, Elizabeth Anne, 30 years after her arrival in Australia, made the final payment on the land and, in her own right, won free title. Her fourth child, Albert, was my great grandfather. Her legacy to me was courage, persistence, dogged determination and deep roots into farming and the rural community of north-east Victoria. She was a woman in agriculture well before that term was even thought of.


On the other side of my family, my great great grandfather worked in the post office at Wodonga. His job was to travel overnight on the train, sorting the mail so it would arrive in Melbourne ready to be delivered by 10 am. My grandmother, Rose Roberta Chapman, was born in Wodonga in November 1888. She married Gladston Robert McGowan, son of Tasmanian pub owners, in 1920 and went on to become a teacher, a mother of six children and a grand matriarch. She is buried in the Yackandandah cemetery next to my father, my mother, two sisters and a dearly loved brother, and where I too plan to be buried. Grannie's legacy to me was: be a teacher; be a lover of stories and history; have a deep sense of social justice and community service and never forget to laugh.


It is not known whether these two families knew each other, but what is known is that it was a dangerous time to live in rural Australia. In Grannie's words:


We lived in Wodonga and during that time the Kelly bushrangers were active. My father who worked for the PMG (before it became Australia Post) used to be accompanied by an armed policeman as they feared the train might be ambushed.


My parents were Paul McGowan and Marie Terrill, who met and married when he was a young agricultural scientist working at the Rutherglen Research Station. They lived, farmed and ran a business in the Indigo Valley, 20 kilometres south of Wodonga, all their lives. I am proud to say I live in that valley, on my own small farm, where I conducted a rural consultancy business—or I did until 7 September!


In the early days of my business, the jobs were many and varied. I lobbied for the establishment of a school for the Flying Fruit Fly Circus. I lobbied for home and community care in Wodonga, Tallangatta, Corryong, Beechworth, Chiltern, Rutherglen and Yackandandah. I lobbied for palliative care in the Ovens, King and Kiewa valleys, and for mobile child care for farming and rural families. Through this work, I built extensive networks and gained firsthand knowledge of the challenges of delivering services in rural areas, particularly in our valleys and towns. I learnt that one size does not fit all and, most importantly, it is a constant struggle to have our rural voices heard. A highlight of these years was working with the Victorian government department of agriculture as a rural affairs advisor and also travelling to Canada on a Churchill Fellowship to study rural women's networks and their role in improving communication with governments.


When I was 40, my mother died. She was dearly loved and a really important part of my life. It was a turning point for me—a second turning point was being elected to parliament.


But, going back to the first point, I recall thinking when mum died that soon my life, too, will be over, and what will I have to show for it? So I returned to study. I completed my master's degree in applied science at the University of Western Sydney, at Hawkesbury, and I learnt how to work with communities for change. The Australian Rural Leadership Program helped me grow in the art of leadership, to understand the role of a shared vision and the power of networks in transforming rural communities.


I decided to take a more active role in agricultural politics. I was an inaugural member of Australian Women in Agriculture, rising to become national president. I participated at National Farmers' Federation meetings and was elected to the Victorian Farmers Federation policy body. I learnt many skills: working with difference, building partnerships, how to chair meetings, how to build teams and how to embrace diversity. I became involved in international agricultural politics, trade, and became committed to Australia's role in feeding the world.


I restructured my business and became a consultant to rural communities, with specialist skills in development, empowerment and transformation. Working in Australia, and more recently in Ireland, India and Papua New Guinea, my clients were the national rural research and development corporations—dairy, wool, sugar, and horticulture—state and local governments and non-government organisations.


Teaching leadership became a passion. Together with friends and colleagues, many of whom are here today, we taught community leadership skills and we set up the Alpine Valleys Community Leadership Program. We ran leadership conferences. We talked about visions. We built networks. We wrote submissions. We grew our businesses. We all grew in skill, wisdom and confidence. We became a force. We began to find our voices—our community voices. With this brief introduction, you will see that I have deep roots and connections into the communities of north-east Victoria. I have an absolute commitment to the future of Indi.


Let me take a few minutes to talk about Indi. Indi is a foundation federation seat. Our first representative, in 1901, was Sir Isaac Isaacs, who was educated in Yackandandah and Beechworth, my local towns. Isaacs went on to become our first Australian-born Governor-General. More recent Indi representatives include the Country Party's Mack Holten—as Minister for Repatriation, he was Indi's first minister—Ewen Cameron, Lou Lieberman and Sophie Mirabella. I pay tribute to them for their public service, dedication and commitment.


In particular I acknowledge Mr Ewen Cameron for the role he played as my mentor. I worked for him as an electorate researcher in the old parliament house during the years of Prime Ministers Malcolm Fraser and Bob Hawke. They were heady days. I am delighted to reacquaint myself with friends from that time, including some of the long-serving library staff.


Indi is a local name for the Murray River. It is a well named electorate, because the rivers and how we use them are critical to the future of north-east Victoria. Indi is blessed with seven major watersheds: the Goulburn, Broken, King, Ovens, Kiewa, Mitta/Dart and Murray rivers, which contribute an estimated 50 per cent of the water to the Murray-Darling Basin. Our major industries include manufacturing, retail, tourism and agriculture. Our food and wine is exported all over the world. Our ski fields, rail trails and festivals provide entertainment to many.


One of the outstanding features of Indi is our small rural communities, where people take things into their hands. Small communities like Yackandandah, where residents started a community business, the Yackandandah Community Development Company. We bought the petrol station, we run a rural produce store and we give profits back to the community. Communities like Stanley, where volunteers set up and run their post office.


But not all is well in Indi. I believe that Indi has not yet, as my mother would say, reached its potential. In parts of Indi only 57 per cent of 20- to 24-year-olds finish year 12, compared with 78 per cent in Melbourne; only 19 per cent of those between 20 and 39 hold a bachelor's degree or higher, compared to 31 per cent across Australia; 63 per cent of people in Indi are in the bottom half of the Index of Relative Socio-Economic Disadvantage; and many of our young people move away from home for work and study. Other critical issues are infrastructure, access to transport and jobs. I will come to those in a minute.


I would like to talk to you about the part of my story where it changes. In May 2012, a group of young people decided enough was enough and put out a call for action. The Indi Expats, as they became known, were young people from communities across north-east Victoria. They had moved to the city for work, study and a better life. The federal election was coming up. How could their views be heard? They had big issues. Their questions were: what sense would we make of this and what would the adults do? As a result of this some of my friends came to the state of feeling big guilt. We asked ourselves what our legacy would be. If we could not be for our young people, what was the point? This question resulted in the birth of a community group named Voice for Indi. It is an incorporated body committed to building an active 21st century democracy based on engagement, respect and ideas, for Indi and beyond. Voice for Indi conducted 53 kitchen table conversations with over 425 people from all parts of the electorate. We discussed what would make for a stronger relationship between people and our elected representatives. They talked about what it means to live in the community of Indi, what our issues are and what makes for a strong community. In summary, the answers were: community matters; politics matters; representation matters; infrastructure matters; and services matter.


Like other places in Australia, the people of Indi wanted a representative in parliament who would put the electorate first, and they wanted their vote to count. They wanted to do things differently. The people of Indi had a vision for a community where people feel they belong and have a sense of purpose, where people pull together and help each other, where diversity, acceptance and tolerance are valued; a community that has quality services, infrastructure, education, jobs and health and opportunities for the next generation.


With this feedback, the Voice for Indi report became the foundation for a community-based, grassroots election campaign that totally changed our community. What did we do? Let me tell you about our not-so-secret ingredients. Start with the involvement and enthusiasm of young people, and their extensive use of social media. Add in volunteer training, support and permission to act in local communities. Negotiate shared values—be respectful, being our best selves, acknowledging difference and taking responsibility for our own actions. Understand that democracy is important to us—we want to participate and we want it to work for us. A good dose of courage, sense of duty, community service and trust helps. Finally, a vision for how the future can be better.


As our campaign gained momentum we were all surprised by the groundswell of support and creativity. Jenny put her sheep in orange T-shirts and drove them around Wangaratta, Corowa and Yea saleyards. Courageous indeed. Rex organised a campaign choir bus. Year 12 students made videos. Sophie covered shops in Chiltern with balloons and streamers. We kidnapped a Wangaratta Chronicle photographer on the train journey between Wodonga and Benalla. Nick trained the door knockers, Leah developed policy, Cam managed media, Lauren took over communications, Anne fed people, Denis managed logistics and Barb organised—and lots and lots more. Four of our people produced a video where they rapped: 'Our trains and buses fail to go, our internet's down, the phone is out; to get heard in Indi you have to shout.' Up there, many of these people are here today and I encourage you to ask them for their stories.


Madam Speaker, with this strong history and the support for our Indi community, I am so proud to be the first Independent member for Indi. So, what now? The Voice for Indi report guides me. I will listen: I will listen to the older people who have lost touch with their grandchildren, the teenagers who suffer with mental-health issues, the people who know what it is like to feel hardship and adversity and get on top of it. I will turn up to the pubs—in Mitta, Dederang, Whitfield, Chiltern and Alexandra—to hear people's concerns. I will visit community-education centres, such as in King Lake, shopping centres in Wodonga, Wangaratta and Benalla, and the schools of Marysville, Walwa, Myrtleford and Yea as well as the festivals in Beechworth, Bright, Swanpool, Mansfield and King Valley—and all the wonderful places in between.


To the young people of Indi, I make a formal commitment to involve you in decision making. I will focus especially on those who live in the more isolated rural areas, who are disadvantaged because of poor public transport, very patchy mobile-phone coverage, terrible internet connections, and fewer employment and educational opportunities. I will work with communities who have suffered terrible losses of family and friends through devastating bushfires and floods and continue our rebuilding process. To the Aboriginal people of Indi, I have committed to form an advisory group comprised of Aboriginal people, from Indi's communities, to advise me on issues such as health, education and employment. Today I also commit to making a public statement to recognise and acknowledge past mistreatments of the stolen generations, their families and communities as a result of the laws and policies of successive parliaments and governments that have inflicted profound sorrow on our fellow Australians. 


I will build partnerships to improve public transport infrastructure, access to telecommunications and health services, particularly rural mental health, and work to reduce the red tape that hinders the growth of small businesses in our rural communities. I will bring the voices and the community of Indi to Canberra. I will work for a vision of a prosperous and caring community, where businesses grow, agriculture flourishes and everyone can reach their potential.


Madam Speaker, as the 44th Parliament begins its journey, I support the Prime Minister and Leader of the House in their desire for a more respectful parliament. The story of my election and the role of respect has resonance for all of us. In closing, I would like to quote from a piece of wisdom found on a toilet door at Mittagundi, an outdoor-education centre for young people in the King Valley: 'The future is not some place we are going to, but one we are creating; the paths to it are not found, but made, and the making of these pathways changes both the maker and the destination.' The people of Indi had to shout to be heard. To all Australians, particularly those who feel they are not being heard here in this place, I defer to Margaret Mead: 'Never doubt that a small group of committed people can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.'



The SPEAKER:  Before I call the honourable member for Fairfax, I would ask the galleries if they would now extend the same courtesy to the next speaker. Before I call the honourable member for Fairfax, I would remind the House that this is the honourable member's maiden speech and I ask the House to extend the same courtesies to him as we have just extended to the member for Indi. I call the honourable member for Fairfax.

"Palmer, Clive, MP",PUP,2013-12-02,"



Mr PALMER
 (Fairfax) (17:12):  Madam Speaker, Australians know who I am and where I come from. They know I love my family and that I love Australia. In 1918 my father, at the age of nine, went to see a silent movie. By the time he was 14 he was producing and starring in his own movies. He went on to become the world's youngest movie producer—as he was known in Hollywood, at the time, in the United States. He returned to Australia to establish radio station 3AK in Melbourne and radio 7UV in Tasmania. Prime Minister Lyons, of the United Australia Party, opened radio 3AK—and I still have the recording. 


My mother was born in Penguin, Tasmania, and left in 1940 to work in ammunition production in Melbourne. Family members have served this nation in the first and second world wars, some giving their lives for Australian freedom. My nephew, Squadron Leader Martin Brewster, served with INTERFET in Timor, and all of them have done for Australia more than I could ever do. Like half of all Australians, I lost my first partner, Sue. Her love and our children, Michael and Emily, sustain me every day. My wife, Anna, and my lovely five-year-old daughter—or middle five, as she says, daughter—Mary, remind me every day of what life is all about: love for each other, and the love we will have for each other in the future. I look forward to the coming weeks, when I will again become a father, and I have a strong resolve to serve our nation and a strong resolve not to let the people of Fairfax down.


Fairfax has been taken for granted for many years. My election is a reminder to the major parties that they must truly serve all Australians. As has been said, let us not seek the Liberal answer or the Labor answer but the right answer. Let us not seek to fix blame for the past but let us accept our own responsibility for the future. We meet today in a city which itself has reconciled our people at difficult times in the nation's history—a city that in this last century has been witness to the trials and tribulations of our people—at a time when the nation lacks direction and needs to set sail on a new course.


How long can parliament remain indifferent to the needs of all Australians? How long can government be deaf to the everyday struggles of all Australians? They must be on top of the national agenda. On this small speck in the universe, planet Earth, we must do all that we can to help each other. Our main concern needs to rest with how we can grow and expand our economy and create more wealth—not wealth for the wealthy but for all, even the least among us. As a wise man once said many years ago, injustice to a man anywhere is an injustice to all men everywhere. We live today in a nation where the roads are no longer safe, where ambulances remove the carnage from our highways, where the infant mortality rate of our Indigenous people is twice that of the Australian community, where the life expectancy of many of our poorer and downtrodden citizens is less than it should be, where health services are declining, where our elderly and veterans are forgotten, where the tyranny of distance separates the hopes and the aspirations of remote Australia, and where the despair of the homeless and unemployed robs the nation of the productivity of our citizens. Tasmanians, I found out during our election campaign, feel abandoned by mainland Australia. The ghosts of the Anzacs call us to action.


To stimulate our economic activity, we must ignite the creativity of all our citizens. Chairman Mao said a long time ago that women hold up half the sky, yet women received their vote in 1902 but prejudice still remains. Leadership, not complacency, is our need today. In parliament and in cabinet, we need more women.


The nation needs a strong economy with efficient production. Australia still has a AAA credit rating. The decline in Queensland's credit rating has been followed by a decline in services. Our citizens need to live a civilised life. Government is not about business; it is about creating the environment to allow all our economy to flourish, to grow revenue to sustain the nation, and to provide income and security to all Australians.


Confidence is low. Our standard of living has declined. We must use our resources better. We are not prisoners to the world economy, helplessly adrift in a sea of despair. The problems we have have been made by Australians and can be solved by Australians. We should not accept defeat by just cutting and slashing, lest the reaper reap more than he can sow. Borrowing to avoid the problem and put off the day is not the real solution. We need in this place and at this time to set a national agenda for growth—a goal for all of us. When the day comes—and it most surely will—when citizens elected by the people take proper and full responsibility for the welfare of their fellow citizens and when we treat other Australians as we would want them to treat us then we can surely know that we do God's will. Public service has no reward other than the service of others. It is the legacy we leave future generations. History is our real judge. Let us work together not as opponents in this place but as colleagues joined by time and space to serve the nation we love.


Australians have lost hope in the future. Change is certain. Success reflects our ability to adapt to that change. It is not individuals' personalities that are important. It is not demeaning comments about those who sit opposite you that are important. After all, all of us in this place have merely offered our lives to serve, and the challenge is really what we can do to make life better for our fellow Australians.


At the last election, the Palmer United Party won 5.5 per cent of the vote, becoming Australia's fourth largest party. The Prime Minister only became Prime Minister because the coalition received the Palmer preferences. Palmer United outpolled the National Party. Palmer United elected one member—me—of the House of Representatives and three senators, only to find our last senator denied his position in the Senate by the AEC losing the ballot boxes in Western Australia. Palmer United and the motorists will hold the balance of power in the Senate. In Western Australia our polling is showing that we can win two senators if an election is held today. In Fairfax, Palmer United received one of the largest swings in the nation's history, of 50.3 per cent. That is why I am here. The Murdoch Newspoll showed 'others' as being 12.4 per cent recently, but they did not list Palmer United. I think we must be in the 'others'. Our recent polling has shown that we are now polling about 10 per cent of the nation, nearly twice as much as the vote we received at the election. Many Australians believed that a vote for Palmer was a wasted vote. Now our party vote has solidified. I want to thank all the 150 candidates who stood in every seat available in the House of Representatives, our Senate teams and our party members in every state and every territory.


Political courage is one of the rarest commodities, and in Queensland our state leader, Dr Alex Douglas, and his deputy, Carl Judge, defend freedom and the rights of individuals before a difficult parliament and in an impossible situation. They are putting the rights of Australians and principle before political expediency, a lesson we can all learn. The entrenchment of the two-party system in this country not only threatens democracy but destroys the creativity of the nation. It robs from all of us the benefit of each other's ideas and innovation.


The forward estimates in August 2013 projected provisional tax receipts for 2014 would exceed $70 billion. Instead of making our companies and businesses pay this tax quarterly in advance based on an estimate, we need to let them pay it yearly based on what they actually earn. If we keep $70 billion in enterprises' hands then they can spend it better than the government. Australia will create real demand, massive job growth and reduced unemployment. We will turbocharge our economy. If $70 billion is spent by individual taxpayers, the government gets 10 per cent GST. The government gets $7 billion every time it is spent by our citizens, and the government will receive the $70 billion at the end of each year. More hospitals and schools, a rising standard of living and increased wealth and revenue mean we can make Australian lives better. At current interest rates it would cost around $800 million a year, but it will generate billions each year for the nation. We have to stimulate domestic demand.


The government is the top petitioner of bankruptcy and liquidations, and as a result our businesses close, our employees lose their jobs and we lose out as a nation. We lose group tax, company tax, exports, GST and jobs. Stop government driving businesses to the wall. Let people stay employed. Transferring people from gainful employment to unemployment just guarantees misery for all of us. Find a better way, such as Chapter 11 in the United States. The US government do not petition bankruptcies; they stimulate the economy. The loss of one year's income due to unemployment is more than it costs for five years of education at high school. To neglect education performance is not only bad policy but bad economics.


Our Army, Navy and Air Force personnel protect and defend us all. We must link all service pensions to male total average earnings and expand gold card benefits to peacekeepers and to spouses of our very brave veterans. We need to support regional Australia by introducing zonal taxation. Regional areas need doctors and professionals to grow. Regional industries benefit all of Australia. We have to end this discrimination over regional industries and allow them to compete in international markets.


If Australians are satisfied that what their government is doing now is adequate for Australia and our future, Australians can accept their lot, but if, as I do, they see Australia's future as doing more than we have done so far—expanding our economy, not cutting and not borrowing but looking to grow the nation that we love—the government should give everyone the support to have an agenda of growth and enterprise for this nation. The nation has the strength and the potential to live out its heritage and to fulfil the dreams of the Anzacs, to turn Australia into the lucky country, to restore our economy and to reclaim our national heritage. Many people say they care but they really do not. Parliament should be about the needs of others, but sometimes it is not.


In Queensland, the Mulga is dying. Drought and flood have combined to rain havoc on families of that region. How can we not act? How can we complain about animal welfare overseas when we let thousands of cattle die a slow and painful death? How can we let Australian families suffer? Are we so indifferent to the needs of our fellow Australians? It is our responsibility in this place to be the last sentry at the gate to protect the rights and freedoms of all Australians, regardless of the party they belong to. Australia needs a revolution in the way we think and in the way we boost our wealth and our economy for the benefit of all our citizens. We have to re-establish confidence. We need to believe we can lift our economy to a better future. We need to have a positive attitude. We may not get there, but nothing is surer than we will fail if we do not project a positive agenda for the nation in a positive manner.


Public service and political life must be the highest calling. The catchcry of this place needs to be: respect for ideas. Great debate demands its victim and truth is the only winner. We are all winners when truth prevails over injustice. The content of our individual characters is more important than how much money we have. We need to praise the incorruptibility of our public officials, the integrity of our marriages and the worth of our people. It is ideas that matter. Governments may come and go, but ideas go on forever. It is ideas that will shape this nation; it is ideas that will endure through time. We are gone and forgotten in history, in commerce and in politics. It is ideas that capture the conscience of the nation. It is ideas that endure when all else is gone. Let us unite to serve the nation we love, to discover the future, to share our trials and tribulations, to overcome adversity, to pull together for our common good under the Southern Cross and to know, as a great man said, that on this earth God's work must truly be our own.



The SPEAKER:  The question is that the address in reply be agreed to. I call the honourable member for Isaacs.

",HoR,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH,15,1
"Dreyfus, Mark, MP",ALP,2013-12-02,"



Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs) (17:28):  Madam Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to rise today to speak. It is an honour to have been re-elected for a third time to represent the people in my electorate of Isaacs. I thank them for their support and their trust. Today I will talk about three things. The first is Labor's economic record. I am proud of Labor's achievements for our nation's prosperity during our two terms of government—a period of ongoing economic growth, low unemployment, low inflation and low interest rates that was accomplished despite the massive upheavals occurring in the global economy. I believe this record should be acknowledged. I also believe that Labor's excellent economic record must be defended against the scurrilous and self-serving rewriting of economic history that is already underway from the new government and its supporters. Today I will also state briefly my objectives as shadow minister for the arts and as shadow Attorney-General.


Finally, I will say a few words about my approach to the role of opposition, because I believe that it is possible to approach opposition in a constructive manner that places the national interest first and foremost. This is an entirely different approach to opposition to that of the Prime Minister, whose quarrelsome, destructive and dishonest tactics were a burden on our national life for the past four years, placing as they did the partisan political interests of the Liberal Party above all else, with the national interest a secondary consideration, if it was a consideration at all.


Australians look to their governments for many things—for support when times are tough and for an honest engagement with the major challenges that face us as a nation, such as climate change. They look to government to manage the economy effectively and in the interests of all Australians, particularly working people, who form the backbone of the Australian economy. They look for governments to provide justice, to support the rule of law and to work to lessen the injustices that many, many people in our community continue to face as a result of their race or gender.


First and foremost, the Australian people look to government to manage the economy, because they understand that government has a vitally important role to play in fostering economic prosperity. Good economic management means investing in transformative infrastructure like the National Broadband Network, investing in research and innovation and, perhaps most importantly, investing in our future through education. Good economic management also means maintaining demand through stimulus when the economy contracts. Good economic management means that, in delivering prosperity to our nation, government ensures that the benefits of our economic successes are spread fairly, that all Australians get a fair share of our national wealth and that Australians all have an opportunity to secure work that is dignified and fairly paid. The economy must always be managed in the interests of the great majority of Australians; it should never be managed for a few privileged and powerful sectional interests.


I am very proud of having served as a cabinet minister in a government that did an excellent job of managing the Australian economy, judged by those essential criteria that I have just outlined. I am proud to have served in a government that made the right decisions, a government that stayed true to the values of fairness, justice, openness and respect for the sovereign people that it was elected to serve, a government that got the big calls right, managing to keep our economy strong through the crisis that engulfed the rest of the world and, at the same time, making great strides to improve the lives of ordinary Australians and Australians in need. Despite all the hysteria, propaganda and manipulation used by the coalition to further its political interests, we must not allow the new government and its supporters to recast economic history to deny Labor successes or to paint their own self-serving and destructive opposition to Labor's nation-building policies as anything other than the politically opportunistic deceit that it was.


The agenda of this new government and particularly its approach to managing the economy will be deeply felt by millions of Australians over the coming years. This government's ability to manage the economy will determine whether many Australians will be able to get jobs. This government's decency and vision, or lack of them, will determine the quality of the social services that many Australians can access. We will know how authentic its professed concerns for Indigenous justice are when we see how the Indigenous community fares.


Let me pause to remark that we will hold this government to account on Indigenous affairs, given the Prime Minister's professed goodwill towards Aboriginal people and his desire to be the Prime Minister for Indigenous affairs. I have to say that the new government's goodwill is not discernible in the massive funding cut to Aboriginal legal services revealed in the last days of the election campaign when the coalition finally released their remarkably lightweight policy document on Indigenous affairs. Nor is any goodwill discernible in the Prime Minister's stated aim of repealing the protections against racial vilification contained in section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. These provisions have served our nation well for almost two decades and send a clear message that racist hate speech is unacceptable. The provisions were left intact throughout the entire period of the Howard government, but, since one of the Liberal Party's media cheerleaders, Andrew Bolt, was found by the Federal Court of Australia to have engaged in racial vilification, the Prime Minister and Senator Brandis have been eager to repeal these provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act that for almost 20 years have protected Australians against racially motivated hate speech.


We will be holding the government to account not only for their stated agenda but perhaps more importantly for the agenda that they have hidden from the Australian people, for the agenda that they have denied but that is now all too apparent in their first decisions, for the agenda that they are assiduously preparing the ground for but that they are too fearful to spell out—their agenda for cuts.


The unfolding debacle of the Liberal Party's response to Labor's school funding reforms is a case in point. First we had years of malicious opposition to Labor's fairer school-funding model from the Abbott led opposition. Then, when the Liberals saw that the Australian people wanted their government to invest in better and fairer education for the nation's children, at the last moment before the election they miraculously dropped their objections and claimed to be believers in the Gonski reforms and promised to implement them. But, once the Abbott government were elected, the nasty surprises began as they began to betray their promises to the Australian people and make pathetic excuses seeking to justify those betrayals. Finally, when it became clear that the Australian people were not going to accept the Abbott government's broken promises, pathetic excuses and nasty surprises, the Abbott government tried to backflip yet again. But it is just more excuses and more weasel words, refusing to back their own election promise that no school will be worse off. I say again: opposite me are a government that must and will be held to account.


I want to touch on the economic context in which the coalition finds itself governing, because, while the economy is softening in some sectors and the coalition will have to deal with that reality, the truth is that it has inherited an economy that is doing very well by international standards, in large part due to the stewardship of the former Labor government. Despite the coalition's histrionic rhetoric of a budget emergency prior to the election, the new government has inherited an economy in very good shape.


Let us take a look at some of the key statistics. Interest rates are very low. Australia's current benchmark interest rate is 2.5 per cent, well below the rate of 6.75 per cent when Labor took office. This means access to cheaper home loans for millions of Australians. It also highlights the falsity of the Howard government's promise that interest rates would always be lower under Liberal governments than under Labor. Inflation is below the target range, and taxes as a percentage of GDP are much lower than when Labor first took office. In fact, the total tax take in 2012-13 was 22.2 per cent of GDP, down from a high of 24.2 per cent between 2004 and 2006.


Most importantly, during Labor's term in office Australia has grown strongly compared to most advanced economies and is now one of the world's wealthiest nations. The IMF, for instance, ranks Australia fourth among the 35 wealthiest nations. A recent report by Credit Suisse ranked Australia as the most wealthy nation in the world when measured by median income. Australia is the only one of the OECD nations that has experienced continuous economic growth over the past 22 years. This is incredibly important. It means that the new government has inherited an economy that, as a result of Labor's stimulus package, avoided the worst impacts of the global financial crisis. Not only did the stimulus keep Australia growing; it avoided the tragic impact of mass unemployment that we have seen around the world: a waste of lives, a waste of labour and an enormous burden on those economies that suddenly have to provide support to those who have no opportunity to work.


In March this year our unemployment rate was 5.6 per cent, well below the OECD average of eight per cent, and it remains one of the lowest in the developed world. During the worst of the global recession the differences were even more pronounced. According to the OECD, during 2010 the annual unemployment rate for Australia was 5.2 per cent, while it was 9.6 per cent in the United States, almost 14 per cent in Ireland and over 20 per cent in Spain. Our stimulus package was so successful that it prompted over 50 of our most eminent economists to write an open letter that trumpeted it as a major economic achievement. Nobel Prize winner and former World Bank Chief Economist Joseph Stiglitz called our stimulus package 'one of the best designed Keynesian stimulus packages of any country'. The IMF was also strongly supportive of Labor's stimulus, and the OECD has pointed to Labor's policies as a model of how to respond to the economic crisis.


Labor achieved this despite the strident opposition of the Liberal Party and the Nationals. In fact, the coalition campaigned ferociously against the stimulus package despite the overwhelming economic evidence of its success. The new Treasurer has now let the cat out of the bag on just how cynical this exercise was, recently indicating that he may support stimulus if the economy requires it—despite his claims that the cupboard is bare and that Australia is in a budget emergency.


While the Treasurer's acceptance of the use of stimulus measures so effectively deployed by Labor suggests a welcome return to reality, it is also a timely reminder of the importance of not believing much of what is said by senior figures of this government but instead looking at what the government does. While the government has inherited a very strong economy, it has also inherited a budget in deficit. But the fact is that our deficit is very small by international standards. It is easily manageable in an economy as strong as Australia's and is in part a consequence of the spending measures that were used to keep Australia out of recession. That is why Australia has, despite this modest deficit, a AAA credit rating from all three international ratings agencies. This grand slam of AAA credit ratings is an economic achievement that the Liberal Party has never, ever achieved.


Both sides of politics, despite the hysterical cries of 'budget emergency' from those opposite during the campaign, agree that we need to return to surplus over time. We have no argument with that. Economies are cyclical, and we have moved through the economic cycle to a time when surplus should again be the goal. But there are major differences between the parties about how we should return to surplus. Returning to surplus requires that choices be made about what essential spending by government is and what we can do without.


Labor believes that we should cut unnecessary concessions that go to groups that are already doing well. This is not about class warfare; it is about the Australian ideal of a fair go. While we think that some fat can be cut from concessions to the well off, we believe that we should continue to invest in the future—in infrastructure and education—because that is what we must do to remain a prosperous nation. Failure to invest in our future will cost us much more in the long run. We must also protect the services that Australians rely on. As one of the wealthiest nations in the world, we can afford to both invest in our future and uphold our values of fairness at the same time.


In contrast, the coalition believe in cutting spending by targeting support accessed by ordinary families and low-income earners and by cutting public services. I am concerned that that is their real economic agenda: an agenda of cuts and austerity. It may sound far fetched, but there is much to suggest that this is what the modern Liberal Party have become. Take, for example, the recent decisions of the new Treasurer to add $3 billion to the budget deficit by junking a range of savings announced by the former government. This was an incredibly hypocritical action given their professed concern about the state of the budget, but it also gives a stark illustration of the priorities of the Abbott government.


Let us look at just one part of that astonishing decision. The new Treasurer has cut tax to Australia's 16,000 wealthiest superannuants, meaning that they will now not have to pay a very modest tax imposed on earnings above $100,000 per year. This contrasts with their election promise to increase tax for 3.6 million low-income earners, those earning under $37,000 per year, who will pay about $500 per year more tax on superannuation as a result. What a lack of moral vision: spending scarce resources to cut taxes paid by a small group of wealthy Australians, while raising taxes on millions of low-income earners. I am appalled, as I think are all Australians who value basic notions of fairness, by these warped priorities.


And this is just the warm-up act. The Prime Minister's Commission of Audit has just begun, but I have little doubt that he has already planned his response: cuts to education and health and the junking of his own inconvenient promises. We will continue to see wasteful spending, such as their extravagant and inequitable paid-parental-leave scheme, while the Liberal Party seed the ground for massive cuts to health services, education and jobs. We will continue to see the Liberals placing the interests of small, sectional interest groups, such as the 16,000 most wealthy superannuants, ahead of the interests of the great majority of ordinary Australians. We are a prosperous country and we deserve better. And we can afford better. We will be holding the Abbott government to account.


I want to talk briefly about my specific role in holding this government to account as shadow minister for the arts and as shadow Attorney-General. In my new role as shadow minister for the arts, I will be fighting to realise the vision of a creative and vibrant Australia in which our culture is explored, celebrated and understood through artistic endeavours of all kinds. This was a vision that my Labor predecessors in government worked very hard to achieve. The former Minister for the Arts Simon Crean, in particular, worked for three years to deliver Creative Australia—our national cultural policy—and his successor as arts minister, Tony Burke, then worked to implement that policy, with enormous energy and enthusiasm. The government has a vital role to play in continuing to support the arts, because the arts improve the lives of all Australians and enrich our economy. I will be holding the government to account in fulfilling that vital supporting role.


In my role as shadow Attorney-General, I will continue to fight for the same things that I have fought for throughout my life as a lawyer, as a barrister, as a parliamentary secretary and as Attorney-General. Specifically, I will be fighting to continue to build a more just Australia. Sometimes this will mean fighting with this government to defend the reforms we implemented and the gains we made while in office. I hope that sometimes this will mean supporting the government when it proposes a policy that will advance justice in our nation. But whatever the government does—and I must say that the early signs of its approach to justice are deeply disturbing—I will continue fighting to improve access to justice in our nation. I will continue to fight to strengthen the rule of law, and I will continue to fight to strengthen our nation as an egalitarian, participatory democracy in which justice is not a privilege that must be fought for but rather a way of life enjoyed by all Australians.


The final matter I will address today is my approach to the role of opposition in a general sense. I will be clear: I do not see the role of the opposition as the member for Warringah did in his four years as opposition leader. I do not think that the only purpose of the opposition should be to tear down the government of Australia, regardless of the cost to our nation, the prosperity and wellbeing of which suffers when its leaders are embroiled in endless skirmishing, with an unprincipled opposition that reactively opposes almost every policy the government puts forward and that deliberately talks down our national strengths and achievements for partisan political advantage. I do not think that the only purpose of the opposition should be to tear down the government of Australia, regardless of the cost to the public, who have to endure the bitter rhetoric of partisan political conflict. I do not think that the only purpose of the opposition should be to tear down the government of Australia, regardless of the cost to truth and, with that, to our personal integrity.


I hold that the purpose of the opposition, of which I am now a part, is to serve the national interest by engaging constructively in the debate our parliament has been entrusted to conduct about the future of our nation. This means that, when we do decide that the policies of the government are to be opposed, we will not do so with fearmongering negativity and a barrage of slogans founded on distortions and false claims. I hold that a key task of the opposition and of the government is to engage in a genuine political debate, to join in a productive contest of ideas, rather than in a barren war of rhetoric, because it is the robust exchange between those with differing viewpoints that creates the energy that is essential for a vibrant and creative democracy such as ours. As I remarked to the Sydney Institute earlier this year, viewed through one eye the world has no depth, but with the parallax created by differing viewpoints we perceive the world in three dimensions, and our nation is made richer and wiser for that.


I would urge the member for Warringah, now that he leads a new government, to serve the national interest by entering the policy arena and engaging the opposition in a genuine and productive contest of ideas. The space for genuine debate is one of the great strengths of democratic nations such as ours. I welcome such a debate in the months and years ahead.

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (21:00):  Again this year I had the privilege to participate in the Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program. In October, I joined the ADF in Papua New Guinea on Exercise Helicon Luk. The program provided me with a unique insight into the Black Hawk helicopter pilot training. The 16th Aviation Brigade provides helicopter support to our troops and undertakes ongoing qualifications renewal to ensure that they are flying safely and effectively. I participated in several aspects of Army flying operations, including ground refuelling operations, aircraft handling and maintenance, flight mission planning and briefing activities, and aircrew duties, including flying in the Army's S70A Black Hawk helicopter.


The full training program goes for four weeks and is the annual training exercise in deployment and maintenance away from bases. The testing is done in and around Madang, on the north coast of Papua New Guinea, as it is a better testing environment than we have in Australia. The area provides the right conditions for high-density altitude training in the mountains and gives 123 service men and women the opportunity to train in unfamiliar territory, putting the service personnel outside their comfort zone. The group which I joined included three instructors, 18 pilots and 20 loadies, better known as aircraft support personnel.


The highlight of the week was the day that, despite the cloud canopy closing in, we managed to land at the Isurava Kokoda memorial—a very surreal experience. I can understand why so many Australians enjoy the challenge of the Kokoda Track, despite the rugged terrain. There is something very special about standing at the Isurava Memorial and reading about the heroic exploits of our World War II soldiers and imagining the incredible challenges they overcame. However, I must confess that I did prefer arriving by Black Hawk rather than tackling the trek. To top off the day, we landed on a small outcrop at Shaggy Ridge, the site of several battles during World War II, on the way back to Madang. When we landed at Isurava, we were greeted by not only the local tribe but also a Channel 9 film crew doing a documentary with Garry Lyon and Sam Newman from The Footy Show. As they say, it is a small world.


I would like to place on record my appreciation to all the service men and women who included me in their routines and patiently explained their roles and responsibilities. In particular, I thank Major Andrew Scheiffers and Major David Thomson for their support and good-natured forbearance. I would also like to thank Sir Peter Barter for his generosity and support while we were in Madang. In the limited spare time I had, Sir Peter introduced me to Father Jan Czuba, the President of Divine Word University in Madang. Father Jan is truly inspiring, and Divine Word University are achieving great outcomes in their five special faculties of Health Sciences, Education, Arts, Business and Informatics, and Theology. Father Jan is the driving force behind the university—but it does not stop there. He is also involved in the Madang hospital and was appointed by Prime Minister Peter O'Neill to lead a task force to review the OBE, or Outcome Based Education, system, which he completed ahead of schedule.


The last time I visited Madang was back in 1982, and a lot has changed. However, it is still a warm and friendly city, idyllically located on the Dallman Passage. Tourism and education both provide future opportunities for the local community and, with support and encouragement from people such as Sir Peter Barter and Father Jan, I look forward to hearing of their progress.


Having participated in this ADF Parliamentary Program, especially now, as our involvement in Afghanistan is drawing to a close, I appreciate the unique insight I have been given into the workings of the Australian Defence Force and the challenges they face. I place on record my appreciation to everyone involved in this program.

"Gray, Gary, MP",ALP,2013-12-02,"



Mr GRAY
 (Brand) (10:30):  I would like to talk today about the vital role Medicare Locals play in keeping Australians well and out of hospital. There are 61 Medicare Locals across the country. They are designed to put some decisions about health services in the hands of people who know their needs the best—well-informed local communities. In my own electorate the Perth South Coastal Medicare Local delivers after-hours GP services in Rockingham and Mandurah, dial-a-doctor services and suicide prevention and it will also operate the headspace Youth Mental Health Centre and in the Rockingham GP superclinic when it opens next year.


Medicare Locals were established because patients and doctors benefit from local solutions to local challenges. To many communities health services are disconnected, the health professionals and doctors commute to communities and therefore do not share information. Medicare Locals fills the gap. Any reduction in funding or scaling back of the Medicare Locals program will have a severe impact on my community. Rockingham, Kwinana and Mandurah have long been identified as areas of concern for age-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes. The Perth South Coastal Medicare Local provides services to meet these local challenges. It employs around 90 frontline health workers who work across a range of areas to support the needs of my community.


In 2012-13 the Labor government provided half a million dollars for the Perth South Coastal Medicare Local to address priority gaps in after-hours GP services in the Rockingham and Mandurah areas. As part of this funding a new GP after-hours clinic opened in Mandurah in November 2012. When the state Liberal government cut funding for the Rockingham after-hours clinic, Perth South Coastal Medicare Local stepped in to keep clinic hours in operation—a clinic that provides about 900 hours of after-hours services per month.


Without the Medicare Locals program many families in the community would miss out. Young people with mental illnesses in the community would miss out. We know that one in four young people in our community with experience a mental health issue this year. The Perth South Coastal Medicare Local is taking the lead in establishing a headspace youth mental health service in Rockingham. It will support young people dealing with depression. It will support substance abuse and other mental health issues and provide early interventions and help them to fully participate in the social and economic life of their communities. So far 92 per cent of the young people using headspace centres in other parts of the country have reported improvement in their mental health after using headspace, and I expect to see the same result in Rockingham. Reducing the capacity of Medicare Locals will mean neither the headspace service nor the Rockingham after-hours clinic would be able to operate.


Right across the country Medicare Locals are assessing current and future health needs of communities and consulting with stakeholders about what matters in health at the front line. This is important in Rockingham, Kwinana and Mandurah, where the communities have long needed health care services that suit their needs and suit the model of the communities of Rockingham, Kwinana and Mandurah in the best way possible. That is why the Medicare local is so important to the communities of the south coastal areas of Perth, Western Australia.

Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston) (11:01):  I move:


That this House:


(1) notes that November is Lung Cancer Awareness Month;


(2) acknowledges that more than 9,100 Australians are diagnosed with lung cancer every year;


(3) recognises that lung cancer claims the lives of more Australians than any other cancer with only 14 out of 100 Australians surviving five years beyond their initial diagnosis; and


(4) calls on Australian and state and territory governments to work together to improve the survival rates of Australians diagnosed with lung cancer by encouraging early detection and providing access to high quality health care treatment and support.


It is very important in Lung Cancer Awareness Month that we take time to raise awareness of this very difficult and devastating disease. It is important to note that lung cancer can hit anyone. It is a cancer that affects both smokers and non-smokers. While obviously reducing smoking can be a good preventative measure, it is important that we do not stigmatise people with lung cancer and place those with any other form of cancer above them. Research shows that diagnoses of lung cancer can be compounded by feelings of guilt, shame, distress and isolation, which can cause delay in people seeking the treatment that they need. If there is any message that comes out of Lung Cancer Awareness Month, it should be that if you believe that you are having symptoms please go and get help, because early diagnoses could very much be the difference between getting a treatment that ensures that you can continue to live and not being able to survive this devastating disease.


We should acknowledge the great support services and information that is available. It is important that those who are diagnosed get the support and information that they need. The Cancer Australia website has a lot of practical information about the disease and organisations such as the Lung Foundation Australia also have a lot of information, as well as a patient support line to help those through this difficult time of diagnosis.


Only 14 out of every 100 people who are diagnosed with lung cancer survive beyond five years. It claims more lives in Australia than any other cancer. It is also the fifth most commonly diagnosed cancer in Australia, accounting for 8.9 per cent of all new cancers. This is a disease that is having a devastating effect on those who are diagnosed with it and do not make it through but also on all the families—the children, spouses and parents who are also affected by this disease.


Early diagnosis is important. As I have already mentioned, it is important to seek help. Some of the key symptoms can include a new cough that persists for longer than three weeks, a changed cough, coughing up blood or a chest infection that will not go away. For anyone who is experiencing thee symptoms, it is important not to delay getting help from a doctor. You should go and visit your GP. There are many new and improving treatments for lung cancer entering the market. These will, I very much hope, continue to improve outcomes. It is important that we continue to work on and develop new treatments so that that statistic of a survival rate of 14 in every 100 can become much higher.


I was very proud of the previous Labor government's investment in cancer care and patient support. Indeed, there was a record investment—close to $4.1 billion for cancer detection, treatment and research—between 2007 and 2013. My motion today calls on the Commonwealth, state and territory governments to work together to really improve these survival rates—and I do hope that the new government will not take its foot of the pedal when it comes to investing in cancer prevention, treatment and early diagnosis. Of course, one of the very important steps that were taken by the previous government was the plain-packaging legislation for cigarettes. I was very proud to vote for that legislation, and what we are seeing while it is still in its infancy is that reports are showing that plain packaging has lowered the appeal of smoking and increased the urgency of quitting among existing smokers. As I said earlier, not only smokers get lung cancer. We need to reduce the stigma around this, but prevention is a critical part, and reducing the number of people who take up smoking and also helping people to quit is a really important step. I am pleased that the coalition finally came to the party o plain packaging of cigarettes and hope that this will continue. So I commend the motion to the House and hope that all members do support it.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2013-12-02,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) (11:06):  I second the motion, and I commend at the outset the member for Kingston for this motion and commend her for her advocacy of Lung Cancer Awareness Month and everything she is doing in her electorate and in wider regions to combat the ills of smoking. This is above politics. The member for Kingston acknowledged the work the previous government had done in this space, and certainly I know that the new Minister for Health, Peter Dutton, is also working very hard and committing a lot of funds. There will never be enough funds to fight the ills of smoking and to fight the perils of lung cancer. But I know that the Liberal-Nationals government is committed to ensuring that we do everything we can with the support of the opposition to fight smoking and to fight lung cancer.


The motion of the member for Kingston acknowledges that more than 9,100 Australians are diagnosed with lung cancer every year. That is a troubling statistic and one that we want very much lowered, if it cannot in fact be completely eliminated. The motion recognises that lung cancer claims the lives of more Australians than any other cancer, with only 14 out of 100 Australians surviving five years beyond their initial diagnosis. My father Lance was one of those who died from lung cancer, on 1 September 2008. Dad succumbed: he fought the good fight, but in the end it was too much. I know that Dad, in his dying days, stressed to my children—Georgina, Alexander and Nicholas—not to ever take up smoking, and thankfully they have not. And I know they will not, having seen their favourite 'Pop Lance' unfortunately succumb to lung cancer. My father-in-law, Bernard Shaw, also died from cancer, and he too smoked. Unfortunately, he found out all too late that he just should not have done it.


I must say that in my local area the Relay for Life has proven to be a wonderful fundraiser to fight cancer. In the Wagga Relay for Life on 12 and 13 October this year, remarkable generosity was shown by many, many participants and their supporters. They raised nearly $¼ million to fight cancer. Bill Wood and his hardworking committee made such a great effort to promote this tremendous event. More than 120 teams and 2,000 walkers took part. Duncan and Narelle Potts were very much in the thick of things, with Duncan, in his capacity on the radio, getting the word out there. And Dave Webster and his Australian Army cadets did such a terrific job promoting too, and working on the day. The Relay for Life at Griffith, on 23 and 24 March this year, was a truly inspirational event. More than $130,000 was raised to help in the fight to find a cure for cancer. They are doing their bit, these Relays for Life. I cannot recommend them enough. It is hard work walking around and around an oval, but every step is one closer to finding cures, because of the money that goes to research to fight cancers, and certainly lung cancer.


I know Annabel Macdonald, who works very hard locally in my Wagga Wagga area in the space of raising awareness about cancer, is fighting the good fight, along with many other people right throughout the Riverina. She was very pleased that I was going to speak on this motion. As she said, lung cancer, as it is elsewhere in Australia, is the most common cause of cancer death in New South Wales. The symptoms of lung cancer are detected when the cancer is advanced, sadly, and are often confused with other conditions or the side effects of smoking. If you are a smoker and you have symptoms, including a new dry cough or a change in a chronic cough, chest pain, breathlessness, repeated bouts of pneumonia or bronchitis, or coughing or spitting up blood, you need to consult your doctor or health professional. It is so important, as earlier detection is so vital in advancing the medical treatment you can receive and advancing the years you might have left.


Continued investment in community education, cancer research, improved treatments and early detection means that two out of every three people diagnosed now survive cancer, for all cancers combined. And that is very encouraging. As I said, this is above politics. We need to do all that we can as a government, as an opposition, as parliamentarians in this place and as Australians to raise awareness of lung cancer and to find money for research to fight cancers.

"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2013-12-02,"



Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (11:11):  I thank the member for Kingston for putting forward this motion on Lung Cancer Awareness Month and am pleased today to speak in support of it. Lung cancer caused the death of 209 people in the period 2006 to 2010 in the Ipswich and Somerset regions in my electorate of Blair. Between 2007 and 2009 the West Moreton Hospital and Health Service, which covers most of the electorate of Blair, reported an annual average incidence of 101 patients presenting with lung cancer. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, lung cancer was the underlying cause of death for 1,560 people living in my home state of Queensland in 2011. This year an estimated 2,485 new cases of invasive lung cancer were diagnosed in Queensland, and close to 2,000 of those will not survive. There has been a 20 per cent increase in death from lung cancer since 2009. This year, despite the fact that Queensland tragically and often colloquially is called the 'skin cancer capital of the world', more people in Queensland will die from lung cancer than from any other cancer.


More men die of lung cancer than women. In fact, the incidence among men is 56 per cent higher than among women and male death rates are double those of women. A significant cause and risk factor for lung cancer is age, but clearly Indigeneity is an issue as well. Until recently, about 47 per cent of Indigenous adults smoked. Recent reports indicate a 10 per cent reduction in smoking rates amongst Indigenous adults, and that is a very good thing. Still, we see about 15,000 people across the country die each year from smoking related diseases in Australia. According to Paul Jelfs, division head for Social, Health and Labour at the Australian Bureau of Statistics, there has been a significant decline in smoking in urban areas, but it remains stubbornly high in remote areas and there is still a very high smoking rate for Indigenous people compared with the non-Indigenous population, so we have a very big health challenge ahead of us. On a more encouraging note, he went on to say that young Indigenous people are quitting, or not taking up smoking, in large numbers. Amongst 15- to 24-year-olds, 54 per cent of Indigenous young people have never smoked and 10 per cent are ex-smokers. That is a very good outcome and an encouraging statistic.


In May 2013 the former federal Labor government established the Rural Health Outreach Fund and the Medical Outreach—Indigenous Chronic Disease Program as part of its $179 million investment in health services for Australians living in rural and remote areas. Nevertheless, we know that the figures are still stark and concerning in terms of lung cancer. But the former Labor government had the runs on the board when it came to acting on its commitment. In August 2012 the former federal Labor government was vindicated when it won a historic High Court victory over tobacco giants who had taken their case to the High Court of Australia, challenging our world-first plain-packaging laws for all cigarettes and tobacco sold in Australia.


When an estimated 90 per cent of lung cancer in males and 65 per cent of lung cancer in females is a direct result of tobacco smoking, acting against tobacco companies is morally and ethically the right thing to do. In addition to the plain packaging laws that came into effect, there are many other things that we did, including listing nicotine patches on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme to reduce the price of them. We also produced a round of anti-smoking ads and the like.


Locally, I want to congratulate Ipswich City Council for its stance against smoking and banning smoking in the pedestrian malls such as the Nicholas Street Mall and d'Arcy Doyle Place in the Ipswich CBD. In 2009, the then Labor government introduced the Australian National Preventive Health Agency Bill, and a report relevant to the bill and to the member for Kingston's motion today was prepared by the National Preventative Health Taskforce and entitled Australia: the healthiest country by 2020—national preventative health strategy—the roadmap for action. Recently retired Professor Robert Bush from the Ipswich campus of the University of Queensland was a participant in that report and did some terrific work along with his colleague Professor Helen Chenery, including the work they did on the Ipswich study.


I would like to commend and congratulate William Darbishire for his excellent work as the CEO of the Lung Foundation and make special mention of the Lung Foundation's very successful awareness campaign, Show Us Your Lungs, which they also brought to Parliament House. I have a great T-shirt, which I wear running around the streets of Ipswich, which I managed to pilfer from that particular event. So I want to congratulate William for that. We also made a great commitment. When we were in government after 2007, we put $3.5 billion—$226 million in last year's budget—towards improving the prevention, detection and treatment of cancer. As the then Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing, I am proud to be part of that decision. I thank the member for Kingston for her motion and fully support it. (Time expired)

"Jones, Ewen, MP",LP,2013-12-02,"



Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (11:16):  I too rise to support the member for Kingston's motion on Lung Cancer Awareness Month and I do so with the admission that I am an addict. I no longer use, but I still recognise myself as a smoking addict. Nicotine is the greatest drug in the world for those people who like it. I was a reasonably heavy smoker and I took after my father with that. My father was one of those people who could smoke a hundred cigarettes in a day. They say that when you roll over in your sleep at night there is a moment where you wake up. My dad would roll over, get up, smoke two or three cigarettes and go back to bed.


I only smoked between 40 and 50 cigarettes a day, and the reason I gave up was that my then wife and I were going to have a family. She said that if I wanted to keep on smoking I would have to go outside. So it was not the packaging; it was not the messages on the bottom. It was the pure laziness of having to go outside for a smoke that made me give up. Those people who do smoke make fun of absolutely everything. In my day, at the bottom of your packet of cigarettes there were messages that smoking causes lung cancer and heart disease. I tried to make sure that I bought packets of cigarettes that said that smoking damages your fitness or that smoking is harmful if you are pregnant, because those things did not hurt me. When you are a smoker, you will rationalise absolutely everything for it, but it is broader than that.


I recognise the words of the member for Blair that kids today are so much better off than we are. My son is 11 years old. We sit at our dinner table. My daughters, as far as I am aware, have never smoked. My son is 11 years old and has his heart set on playing half-back for the Cowboys. We were talking about smoking and he asked me if I smoked. I said, 'Yes, I smoked.' He said, 'So let me get this right, dad: you knew it was bad for you?' 'Yes.' 'You knew it could give you cancer?' 'Yes.' 'You knew it could give you heart disease?' 'Yes.' 'You knew about all of those things that come off it—blindness and all those things?' 'Yes.' 'And yet you still did it?' 'Yes.' 'Let me go through that again, dad.' He cannot for the life of him figure out why I smoked. Being cool and being a little bit rebellious when you are in primary school or early high school is not enough.


I note the words of the member for Blair and the words of the parliamentary secretary earlier in relation to men's health. I think it is something that we go do through and that we do have to recognise. I have spoken at and been to prostate awareness things where men do not look after themselves. Women are so much better at discussing matters amongst themselves, going to the doctor and getting things tested, because it is part of their lives. For men, be it diabetes, depression, lung cancer or prostate, it does not matter how much sense it makes, there is reluctance to go and get themselves checked, to sit there and have that conversation and that relationship with the doctor. Men will go to the doctor when they are near death. Men will go to the doctor when they are very, very ill and need drugs. We do not go to the doctor to get ourselves checked, and we do not go to the doctor and get our blood pressure checked often enough. We do not go and get our vital signs checked up.


As previous members have mentioned, men were 56 per cent more likely to die of lung cancer than women because we do not keep our relationships with our GPs current. Lung Cancer Awareness Month must push that men develop that relationship with their GP. For mine, I think the message is that we can get out there. I was a smoker because it appealed to me. I got hooked and I loved it and I still do. That is the wonderful thing about cigarettes—you can rationalise anything you want! You can be standing outside a building in 45-degree heat, sucking on a burning stick, sweating profusely whilst everyone is inside drinking cold beer, eating prawns and you are thinking you are the lucky one. That is what smoking can do for you. When you are a smoker, an addict, you may not be able to make your car payment, you may not be able to make your rate payment or your insurance payment, but you can scrounge enough 5c pieces to get a packet of cigarettes. That is the nature of addiction. That is what we have to attack. That is what we have to fix up. I am sure I am joined by you, Deputy Speaker Broadbent, and the member for Wright in cursing this insidious disease.

"King, Catherine, MP",ALP,2013-12-02,"



Ms KING
 (Ballarat) (11:21):  I would like to thank the shadow parliamentary secretary for health for introducing this important motion and for her work not just on Lung Cancer Awareness Month but also in the area of lung health generally. As noted, lung cancer claims the lives of more Australians than any other cancer. In 2010 lung cancer was the leading cause of cancer death for men and women. Some 18 per cent of all cancer deaths in 2010 were due to lung cancer. We know that lung cancer claims the lives of more Australians than any other cancer, with only 14 out of 100 Australians surviving five years beyond their initial diagnosis.


According to the Lung Foundation Australia, more than 9,100 Australians are diagnosed with lung cancer each year. In 2007 there were 7,626 deaths caused by lung cancer. If you are male, the risk of been diagnosed with lung cancer in Australia is higher. 2009 saw 10,200 newly diagnosed cases of both small-cell and non-small cell lung cancers in Australia. They are fairly confronting statistics and it is certainly why Lung Cancer Awareness Month is a month of promotion about the importance of lung health and lung care. We know that cancer is still placing an intolerable burden on our community. We have all been touched by this disease somehow. We have a family member, a friend or someone in our own lives who has been burdened with cancer. But I believe that, if governments at all levels work together, we can improve the survival rate of Australians diagnosed with lung cancer.


Early detection absolutely is the key and I am extremely proud of the work that the previous government did in this area in encouraging early detection and ensuring access to high-quality health care treatment and support. We worked tirelessly to ensure access to early detection, treatment and quality care. In the budget, the Labor government announced some $5.9 million of funding to continue to improve outcomes for people with lung cancer, with Cancer Australia working to deliver best practice cancer care, research and national reporting of lung cancer data. The investment was part of the world-leading cancer care package and the new investment was on top of some $3.5 billion that went into combating cancer since 2007, including $1.5 billion in new cancer medicines. In 2009 alone we announced $6.8 million to improve lung cancer care through identifying research in clinical priorities, providing more consistent data and targeting health professionals to deliver best practice, and we made headway in talking about lung cancer suffering in Torres Strait Islanders and Indigenous Australians.


As we know, tobacco smoking is one of the biggest factors in lung cancer. It is a testament to the previous government that we took on the tobacco industry to reduce the promotion of harmful smoking, removing the last form of advertising for smoking. I want to pay tribute to the previous Minister for Health and Ageing and Attorney-General, Nicola Roxon, as well as previous health minister Tanya Plibersek for their work in this area of tackling smoking, particularly their efforts in plain packaging reform. It was a tough fight but one that was well worth having and one on which I would be exceptionally disappointed to see any backward steps taken.


Through education and investment in critical medical research we can ensure that lung health is a priority across Australia. We remain committed to improving the cancer services provided across Australia. Lung Cancer Awareness Month is a month of promotion and awareness raising and one in which we should redouble our efforts in looking at significant ways to prevent and reduce the rate of lung cancer in Australia. Lung cancer does, of course, have many causes, but tobacco smoking is certainly the largest cause. I know many people struggle. We heard from the member for Herbert on his own personal journey and struggle with smoking, and I want to commend him. I have a pretty strong policy in my office of nagging every single one of my staff who do smoke. As an ex-smoker from a very long time ago now, I feel it is important that not only do I nag them but also they are provided with supportive opportunities to quit and that it is an environment in which we do not see smoking as something that is common within the workplace. I have so far been successful in managing to get four of my staff to take that very difficult challenge of giving up smoking. I acknowledge that it is an incredibly difficult addiction to break; but, when you see young children develop lung cancer and the survival rates are so small, it is incredibly important that during lung awareness week we talk about the opportunities and support for people, whether it be through the Quit Foundation or MBS items on the PBS, to quit smoking so that we improve lung health and the survival rates of people with lung cancer in this country.

"Irons, Steve, MP",LP,2013-12-02,"



Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (11:27):  I rise to support the motion by the member for Kingston that we note that November is Lung Cancer Awareness Month. There are three other parts to the motion that I also support. It is important that we as parliamentarians on both sides of the House do all we can to help prevent deaths by raising the awareness of the importance of early detection. The Cancer Australia website states:


The symptoms of lung cancer can often be vague and mimic those of other conditions, so it's important to know what your cough is telling you.


For the benefit of my constituents and other people who may read this speech, I will quote from some of the statistics and advice from the website with regard to coughs:


Unexplained, persistent symptoms lasting more than three weeks can include:


a new or changed cough


coughing up blood—this is called haemoptysis


a chest infection that won't go away


chest pain and/or shoulder pain


shortness of breath


hoarse voice


weight loss or loss of appetite


These symptoms may be due to other conditions however, if any of these symptoms are experienced, it is important that they are discussed with a GP or healthcare worker without delay.


In 2009 lung cancer was the fifth most commonly diagnosed cancer in Australia after prostate, bowel, breast and melanoma of the skin, accounting for 8.9 per cent of all new cancers in Australia. For men and women separately, lung cancer is the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer for men after prostate, bowel and melanoma of the skin; and for women after breast, bowel and melanoma of the skin. In 2009 there were 10,193 new cases of lung cancer diagnosed: 6,034 in men and 4,159 in women. In 2020 an estimated 13,640 people are expected to be diagnosed with lung cancer in Australia. In 2009 the average age of the first diagnosis of lung cancer was 71 years for men and 69.9 years for women.


The risk of developing lung cancer increases with age. In 2009, 85 per cent of new lung cancers in men and 81 per cent in women were diagnosed in people aged 60 years or older. In 2009, the age standardised incidence rate was 43.2 cases per 100,000 people. This was higher for men than for women: 55.7 cases in 100,000 for men compared with 33.1 cases per 100,000 for women. The incidence of men diagnosed with lung cancer in Australia decreased from 85.2 cases per 100,000 in 1982. The incidence of women diagnosed with lung cancer in Australia increased from 18.2 per 100,000 in 1982. In 2012 lung cancer is expected to be the leading cause of burden of disease due to cancer among men and the second highest burden of disease due to cancer among women.


All these statistics are indicators of how important early detection is. Symptoms of lung cancer in nonsmokers may be different from lung cancer in people who smoke. Sometimes the symptoms may be more subtle, such as shortness of breath with activity, or hard to define, such as fatigue. As a quick aside, talking about lung cancer in nonsmokers is more important than ever. Currently, 20 per cent of women who develop lung cancer in the United States are lifelong nonsmokers. In addition, the majority of people, both men and women, who develop lung cancer at this time are former, not current, smokers. So it is important that even former smokers who think they may be in the clear make sure to have regular check-ups.


Last Friday I represented the Prime Minister at the Asbestos Disease Society's ecumenical memorial service at the Redemptorist Monastery in Vincent Street, North Perth. The service was in remembrance of families, friends, work colleagues and those unknown who have died from asbestos caused diseases and gave us an opportunity to collectively express our compassion and support for many grieving families. This year was the 18th year since the inaugural ecumenical memorial service in 1996, and in this period alone 3,369 of their members and friends have died from asbestos caused diseases. That includes 296 this year. The current epidemic of asbestos caused diseases and lung cancer is alarmingly on the rise in Australia. On behalf of the PM, I lit a candle in memory of loved ones and friends. I also lit a candle in memory of Lauren Mariolis, who died of brain cancer at the age of 10, and my sister Margaret Dix, who fell to her death in 2004. I also wish all the best to Barry Knowles, who sat next to me at the ceremony. God bless him as well. I commend this motion to the House.

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2013-12-02,"



Ms HALL
 (Shortland) (11:32):  I take great pleasure in rising to speak on this motion and congratulate the member for Kingston on bringing it to the House. November was Lung Cancer Awareness Month, and earlier this year the Lung Foundation Australia came to this parliament and gave a presentation to all members. That really reinforced the fact that we should be thinking about lung cancer and lung disease, and this motion reminds us of just how common it is. In 2011 lung cancer was the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer in Australia after prostate cancer, bowel cancer and melanoma. In 2009 there were 10,193 new cases of lung cancer, and in 2020 it is estimated that there will be nearly 14,000 people expected to be diagnosed with it.


What these facts establish is that lung cancer is a very significant cause of illness in Australia. It is a disease that really needs to be addressed. There are a number of risk factors associated with lung cancer. Obviously the most commonly known risk factor is smoking. By quitting smoking, after five years a person can have halved their chance of getting lung cancer. It is also important to note that making changes to your lifestyle—diet, exercise, reducing alcohol—also helps address issues associated with the risk factors of lung cancer.


Lung cancer is not only caused by smoking. There can also be a number of other environmental issues that contribute to lung cancer: passive smoking, radiant exposure, occupational exposure and air pollution. A family history of lung cancer also contributes to lung cancer. Previous lung disease such as lung fibrosis, chronic bronchitis, emphysema and pulmonary tuberculosis also increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer. So it is not an open-and-shut case.


On 2011 figures, only 14 per cent of sufferers from this cancer live past the first five-year period. So Cancer Australia has been working with affected families, as has the Lung Foundation, in raising awareness. GPs and other professionals have also helped with the diagnosis, treatment and care of lung cancer patients. As the member for Kingston mentioned, it is really important to get an early diagnosis and it is also very important not to stigmatise those people that are living with lung cancer or have been diagnosed with lung cancer.


The rate of teenage smoking in New South Wales has dropped significantly. In 1984 about 27 per cent of teenagers smoked in New South Wales, and in 2008 that had dropped as low as 8.6 per cent. The proportion of teenagers in New South Wales who have never smoked increased from 32 per cent to 75 per cent in 2008, and the best way to reduce the rate of smoking is never to smoke. Increases in the cost of cigarettes, advertising bans, public funding campaigns and, of course, the plain packaging legislation that passed through the last parliament have all been very important measures to reduce lung cancer. Governments not accepting political donations from cigarette companies is another important message. I would like to invite members to join the Lung Foundation parliamentary friends group, which will be established over the next couple of weeks, because this is a very important message that goes out into our communities, saying that we as parliamentarians are supportive of good lung health.

Mr WYATT
 (Hasluck) (11:37):  November was Lung Cancer Awareness Month, an important month considering the number of Australians who are diagnosed with lung cancer every year. This aggressive cancer claims the lives of more Australians than any other cancer, with only 14 out of 100 Australians surviving beyond five years of their initial diagnosis.


One of the challenges we have is the way in which we develop an awareness for people to look at the symptoms that ultimately impact on them when they are diagnosed with an advanced form of lung cancer. I recollect that my younger brother, who died of an aggressive lung cancer, was coughing up blood and thought it was something that was not unusual, which delayed the diagnosis. By the time he received the diagnosis it was too late; it had spread significantly. He lasted two months after the diagnosis. So lung cancer has always been in the forefront of my thinking, because I have seen so many people over the years affected by the fact that their lung cancer is not only caused by smoking. I have lost two friends who had been doing wood-turning. The dust that people generate in wood-turning is significant, and if they do it regularly without wearing a mask then that is another contributing factor.


It is critical that state and federal governments work together to ensure the best possible prevention and treatment for lung cancer. It is important because I think that sometimes the awareness level is not there and people do not look for the signs and symptoms. When they become aware of them, in hindsight they say, 'Yes, I did have that,' and by then it becomes problematic. But we are getting more and more people surviving lung cancer because of the quality of the treatment that is provided because of the work that is done by researchers.


When we think about it, lung cancer was uncommon before the advent of cigarette smoking. It was not even recognised as a distinct disease until 1761, and different aspects of lung cancer were described further in 1810. Malignant lung tumours made up only one per cent of all cancers seen at autopsy in 1878 but had risen to 10 to 15 per cent by the early 1900s.


Case reports in medical literature numbered only 374 worldwide in 1912. But a review of autopsies showed the incidence of lung cancer had increased from 0.3 per cent in 1852 to 5.66 per cent in 1952, and over the subsequent years we have seen a significant increase in that number. In Germany in 1929, physician Fritz Lickint recognized the link between smoking and lung cancer, which led to an aggressive anti-smoking campaign. The British Doctors Study, published in the 1950s, was the first solid epidemiological evidence of the link between lung cancer and smoking, and I remember that in 1964 the Surgeon General of the United States recommended smokers should stop smoking.


Having worked in a number of roles in the communities in which I have lived and worked, I know the awareness has been much more significant. The work of the cancer foundation and many leading clinicians and those who undertake health promotion campaigns have certainly made us much more cognisant of the importance of early diagnosis, recognising the signs and symptoms. But one group that we do have to focus on is men. I often find that being typical guys we tend not to take seriously the first symptoms that we have: the shortness of breath, the pain of the coughing that comes with it. We tend to ignore it all until it is too late. What I do find, from evidence and certainly from having worked in the health arena, is that women are much more likely to go and have the matter dealt with. I commend the member for Shortland, who is establishing a parliamentary friends of lungs group, because lungs are among the significant organs that are often overlooked in the way in which we deal with health and disease prevention issues and I certainly hope the work undertaken by the group will create a broader and greater awareness amongst our parliamentary colleagues who, in turn, will become advocates in the way in which they engage in discussions within their own electorates.


It is through the educative process that we make others aware, and I would certainly emphasise the need to talk to the fellows in all of this because we have still not learnt that we are not immortal and that we are mortal and that lung cancer is a significant risk factor for those who expose themselves to the range of risks that exist within the environment and within their behaviours.

Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (11:42):  I am glad of the opportunity to speak in recognition of the importance of Lung Cancer Awareness Month, and I thank the member for Kingston for bringing this motion. Lung cancer is a terrible disease. It is the main cause of cancer death in Australia, and it is a form of cancer with a comparatively poor survival rate. Only 13 in 100 survive five years beyond the initial diagnosis. Thankfully, over the last 25 years the application of public health policy has seen a significant reduction in the incidence of lung cancer. There is no doubt that one of the most significant public health achievements in this country over the last quarter of a century has been tobacco control, which has made a clear difference when it comes to rates of lung cancer.


Cancer Australia's 2011 report to the nation notes that 90 per cent of lung cancer in males and 65 per cent of lung cancer in females is estimated to be as a result of smoking. Of course there are significant other factors involved in causing lung cancer but tobacco is far and away the worst. That is why tobacco control has been so important and effective—because, by dramatically reducing the rate of smoking, we greatly lessen the impact of carcinogens in tobacco on smokers and on those exposed to passive smoking, and the incidence of lung cancer has decreased accordingly.


This has not been easy and it is important to recognise that the hard work of shifting Australia from being a country with a relatively high level of smoking and of smoking related disease and death to the situation today required policy and political courage. Between 1991 and 2010 the proportion of daily smokers aged 14 years and over decreased by almost 40 per cent and smoking rates in Australia are now among the lowest in the world, just as life expectancy in Australia is now among the highest in the world. There is no question that the Labor Party has led this effort or that the Labor government took that work further with our world-leading introduction of plain packaging accompanied by a $27.8 million advertising campaign. I was very pleased to make a contribution to the debate in support of Labor's Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Amendment Bill during the life of the previous parliament. It was legislation that made key improvements to the way in which tobacco promotion through the internet and new technologies was controlled.


There are those who continue to claim that this long hard battle was and is unnecessary—indeed, that it was an improper cause pursued by those with a kind of nanny-state mentality. As I said before, that view stands awkwardly alongside the clear statement of the National Tobacco Strategy 2004-09 which said:


Tobacco is a unique consumer item. Tobacco products cause premature death and disability when used as intended by the manufacturer; and they are addictive. No company trying to introduce cigarettes into Australia today would succeed in getting them onto the market.


I note that the UK government is about to follow in our plain-packaging footsteps and yet a member of the government has expressed the view that smoking and the sale of tobacco should really be left as a matter of individual freedom and individual responsibility. To hold that kind of view you would have to ignore altogether the vast inequitable disparity that exists, on the one hand between a multibillion-dollar corporation with all the advertising resources and techniques at its disposal in its effort to push an addictive product on young people, and on the other hand a teenage boy or girl who, if they succumb to that manipulation, will likely have their life significantly shortened.


The history of tobacco is a reminder that corporate interests are quite capable of putting profits before people's health, and not just inadvertently. It is a reminder that one of the critical functions of government is to act as a balance against the potential for large companies and organisations to put their interests improperly ahead of the interests of individuals and society as a whole. I am glad that the Prime Minister has recently acknowledged that it is wrong to accept donations from tobacco companies, just as Labor did a decade earlier, and it is a welcome development that this approach is now bipartisan. We must have a committed national effort to reducing smoking rates further and to improving the way we diagnose and treat lung cancer.


There are thousands of Australians living with lung cancer, and our thoughts are with all those fighting against this painful, frightening life-threatening illness, and with their families. Lung Cancer Awareness Month is an opportunity to recognise the toll that this disease takes on individuals, families and communities and an opportunity to acknowledge the expertise, research, health care and emotional support provided by health professionals working to combat lung cancer and assist those suffering from it. More than anything, it is an opportunity to remember that lung cancer continues to be a significant cause of death and continues to be a form of cancer that has a comparatively poor survival rate, and for that reason it is a significant issue of public policy. I would like to thank and pay tribute to Lung Foundation Australia for its important work in this area.


Debate adjourned.

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (12:27):  I rise today to support this motion from the member for Higgins. As previous speakers are already noted, yesterday, 1 December 2013, was World AIDS Day. It is important to restate some figures to remind us all just how widespread and dangerous HIV-AIDS has become. This reminder is necessary because somehow the scale of AIDS no longer manages to shock us and no longer stirs our compassion as it should. We have become inured to the facts of AIDS. More than 35 million people now live with HIV/AIDS worldwide, and almost 10 per cent of these people are under the age of 15. Alarmingly, every day more than 6,000 people contract HIV.


Our nearest neighbour, Papua New Guinea, is also fighting this deadly epidemic, and I am pleased Australian aid money assists them with this challenge. I also take this opportunity to acknowledge my colleagues from the PNG government. In 2011, the Kirby Institute estimated the number of people living with HIV in Papua New Guinea to be 34,000, which translates into an HIV prevalence rate of 900 per 100,000 people. UNAIDS's estimates for 2012 put the number of people living with HIV in PNG at 25,000. UNAIDS has also stated that in 2012 there were 13,000 children under the age of 17 left orphaned by AIDS in Papua New Guinea.


In 2011, I visited PNG with the then shadow foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop. During our time there, we met with representatives of Oil Search, including Managing Director Peter Botten and Mr Aopi. We saw firsthand some of the outreach work Oil Search is undertaking with local villages. Oil Search operates all of PNG's currently producing oil and gas fields and has a 29 per cent interest in the PNG LNG Project. Most importantly, the company has successfully developed public-private partnerships with PNG's national and provincial governments, non-governmental organisations and faith based organisations to improve HIV prevention and treatment.


Through the Oil Search Health Foundation, which was established in 2011, the company has been able to secure grants from the global fund worth nearly $US80 million, and the company has also contributed more than $10 million of their own funds to tailor HIV programs to meet the specific needs of PNG people. Working closely with the PNG Department of Health, the Oil Search Health Foundation has aligned their HIV program and support services to the country's national standards and is now delivering health, education, treatment and support services where they are needed most. Today, a team of nearly 100 health foundation staff, most of whom are PNG nationals, deliver HIV, maternal and child-health and malaria programs in six of PNG's 22 provinces and support 55 health facilities that have performed over 36,000 HIV tests and distributed over 600,000 condoms since 2008.


On World Aids Day, oil search raises awareness about HIV by putting up big red ribbons at all its camps. Staff are also invited to participate in educational presentations. The Oil Search HIV program conducted its first HIV questionnaire last year for oil search's workforce in PNG. It showed a solid level of knowledge and understanding of HIV. The questionnaire was also repeated this year.


In addition to the services provided by the health foundation, since 2003 oil search's in-house medical team has also treated over 32,000 patients from its workforce and from communities in and around the areas in which it operates. Managing director Peter Botten says that these figures make oil search PNG's largest healthcare provider outside government. This is clear evidence of the enormous impact that businesses can have on people's lives, and I encourage more businesses to follow oil search's lead. In July 2014, Melbourne will host the 20th international AIDS conference. It will bring together 14,000 delegates from around 200 countries, making it the largest medical conference ever held in Australia.


The challenge of AIDS has not abated. The cost of care remains incredibly high, and the impact on those who have AIDS, their families and friends and the broader community make this a challenge that we must confront. I join with the member for Higgins in asking this parliament to continue Australia's strong commitment to an enduring and effective partnership between government, scientists and the community to meet the needs of people living with HIV, to continue Australia's strong commitment to medical health and research and to foster and cultivate Australia's medical health and research community and researchers to ensure that we stay at the forefront of all aspects of treatment, care and research in HIV. I commend the motion to the House.

"Parke, Melissa, MP",ALP,2013-12-02,"



Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (12:32):  I am glad of the opportunity to speak in recognition of World AIDS Day, and I thank the member for Higgins for bringing this motion. As the motion notes, HIV/AIDS has been responsible for the death of some 36 million people worldwide and, since the beginning of the epidemic, has affected more than 75 million people. While Australia's response to HIV/AIDS from the earliest days in the 1980s was forward-looking, proactive and effective, over the last few years there has been a worrying rise in the otherwise low rate of infection in this country, and this needs to be addressed as a public health priority.


Australia contributes to the worldwide challenge of reducing HIV infection and treating those with AIDS both here and abroad. The motion acknowledges the significance of the 20th international AIDS conference, which will be hosted in Melbourne in 2014. This will be a crucial opportunity for the 14,000 delegates from around 200 countries to consider our position in relation to millennium development goal No. 6, which calls for unprecedented action to first halt and then reverse the devastating impact of HIV/AIDS. On that point, the UNAIDS Global report on the AIDS epidemic 2013, released only last month, provides a sober reflection on progress made and challenges ahead. While we have achieved an estimated 33 per cent decrease in the number of annual new infections worldwide between 2001 and 2012 and a similar decrease in the number of deaths, there continue to be more than 35 million people infected by HIV. That includes 25,000 in Australia.


I wholeheartedly support part 4 of the motion that calls on the parliament to continue efforts to support medical health research and to meet the needs of people living with HIV. But in my contribution to the debate I want to add how important it is for parliament to continue to support Australia's international contribution to combatting the global epidemic. The AIDS conference in Melbourne next year will certainly consider the domestic health efforts made by participating countries. But more importantly it will consider the global AIDS epidemic and the coordinated effort required to address the epidemic wherever it occurs. The fact is that through our aid program Australia plays an important role, especially in the region, in the global fight against HIV/AIDS. I take this opportunity to include within the debate on this motion a clear call on the government to sustain Australia's work and funding when it comes to the shared international effort required to defeat HIV/AIDS.


It is salient to point out that the government has announced a $700 million cut to Australia's foreign aid budget in this financial year without providing details of how those cuts will be achieved. The cuts over the forward estimates amount to $4.5 billion. This year is nearly halfway done yet we still do not know where $700 million, or one out of every eight dollars of Australia's aid for this year, will be cut. I think it is unlikely that those cuts or the rest of the $4.5 billion to be slashed from our development assistance budget can be made across the range of bilateral, multilateral, regional and NGO programs without withdrawing funding from health initiatives that are essential to saving lives from the scourge of HIV/AIDS.


I will just mention a few of the existing commitments that we can only assume are now under question. First, there is the provision of up to $100 million over eight years, 2008 to 2015, to Indonesia for HIV prevention and care and the provision of $59 million over nine years, 2007 to 2015, for a regional program across Myanmar, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, the Philippines and China with a focus on harm reduction among people who inject drugs. And there is the provision of $30 million over five years, 2009 to 2013, for the Pacific Islands HIV and STI Response Fund. If the government would make a commitment that no cuts will be made to programs that address the HIV/AIDS epidemic, many people would be happy to hear it.


Under the Labor government, in 2009 we launched a new international development strategy entitled Intensifying the Response: Halting the Spread of HIV. In October 2010 we announced a 55 per cent increase in our commitment to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. What the position is now, in terms of the Australian government approach, is unknown—because the new government has not made it clear where the $700 million in cuts to international assistance will be made this year, let alone the $4.5 billion in cuts over the four years to 2016-17.


As the UNAIDS Global report notes, 'Our ability to lay the foundation for an end to the AIDS epidemic continues to be undermined by a major resource gap.' As we look forward to hosting the 20th International AIDS Conference in Melbourne next year—the largest medical conference ever to be held in Australia—I look forward to hearing about how the government intends to maintain the absolutely critical growth path in Australia's contribution to the regional and global fight to defeat HIV/AIDS.


Debate adjourned.

Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry) (16:01):  I rise today to speak on the Grape and Wine Legislation Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013 and cognate bills. This is a truly great example of what can be achieved when governments work together with both industry and businesses to achieve better business outcomes. The wine industry is a great example of a progressive Australian agricultural industry. These amendment bills have come about at the request of industry and merge two of the country's peak wine bodies together. A newly named Australian Grape and Wine Authority will emerge and be responsible for the marketing, research and development of the country's $3.4 billion wine industry. The merger also brings together the research and development functions of the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation and Wine Australia Corporation marketing and export oversight functions.


Importantly, industry itself proposed no changes to the amounts of levies or the regulatory compliance role of the Wine Australia Corporation. A single wine industry body will support the industry by providing links between investment initiatives and functions of the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation and Wine Australia Corporation. There is no financial impact other than the Commonwealth entering into an agreement to match the Australian Grape and Wine Authority research and development funding. These amendment bills send a clear message to all Australian industry and business that this government is listening to the recommendations and taking on board all points of view before it makes decisions.


It is no secret that wineries located in the Hunter region are well known for their quality right around Australia and indeed the world. Some of Australia's largest exporters of wine, like McWilliam's, Drayton's, Tyrrell's and Brokenwood, reside within our Hunter region. They are representative of the great reds and whites that Australian wineries make and the popularity of our drops overseas. Hunter winemakers and grape growers are part of an industry that employs over 22,000 Australians nationally. They are part of an export industry that Wine Australia estimates to be worth $1.8 billion and that exported 698 million litres of wine to countries like the United Kingdom, the USA, Canada, China and New Zealand last financial year. Wine Australia's latest Wine export approval report says:


Australia ranks fourth among the world's 10 biggest wine exporters in the average value per litre of bottled wine exports …


But we are behind New Zealand, France and the US—but ahead of Argentina, Italy, South Africa, Germany and Chile.


The report also says that in total volume Australian wine is also now the No. 1 imported wine in the UK and New Zealand. It is second in the USA and fourth in Canada and China. Wine Australia saw some years ago a growing interest in Australian wines throughout Asia. We are now seeing exports of the premium, highly profitable segment of the wine market continuing to grow in East Asian markets just like China. The Chinese market has grown from $57 million in 2007 to in excess of $250 million today to be our third biggest in value. Australian bottled wine exports to the USA in the higher than $7.50 a litre segment grew by 16 per cent in the year ended 30 September 2013. I would like to see the industry grow further. I believe that these amendment bills are a good step in the right direction.


I would like to tell you a little more about the Grape and Wine Legislation Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill that has been introduced by my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Barnaby Joyce. This bill proposes amendments to the Wine Australia Corporation Act 1980 to establish a new authority. It renames the act as the Australian Grape and Wine Authority Act 2013. The bill makes significant amendments to the existing Wine Australia Corporation Act 1980. The merger is not a takeover of the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation by Wine Australia; it is a strategic merger of the two statutory corporations on an equal footing.


The bill is divided into schedules. Schedule 1 amends the Wine Australia Corporation Act to create the authority. Schedule 2 covers matters arising from the transition from two statutory corporations to the authority. It covers matters such as the transfer of staff to the authority. Schedule 1 is divided into two parts. Part 1 of the schedule amends the Wine Australia Corporation Act 1980 to establish a selection committee to select and nominate to the Minister for Agriculture possible directors of the board of the authority. The bill also gives the Minister for Agriculture an alternative option of appointing a first board of the authority for a 12-month period without reference to the selection committee.


Part 2 of schedule 1 commences on 1 July 2014. This part amends the Freedom of Information Act 1982 and the Wine Australia Corporation Act 1980. This part establishes the authority and provides the governance framework for its operations. Schedule 1 also provides the research and development functions, including provisions for the Commonwealth to match research and development levy funds dollar for dollar. The authority will be required to spend research and development levy money and government-matching funds on research and development activity only. Industry has highlighted the importance of this issue for the new authority and I want to make it clear to the industry that the R&D levies will be spent on R&D purposes only. It is also important to the government to ensure that Australian government money appropriated for research and development is actually used for this purpose.


The bill does not include any changes to the structure or the amounts of the levies that currently fund both statutory corporations or to the existing regulatory, marketing or compliance roles of the Wine Australia Corporation. The bill transfers definitions of research and development from the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989. It establishes an authority with a skills based board of five to seven directors selected and nominated by a statutory selection committee and appointed by the minister. The board is led by a chair appointed by the minister following consultation with industry.


The authority is required to prepare a five-year corporate plan to outline the authority's strategies, policies and priorities to achieve the objective. The authority is also required to prepare an annual operation plan. Unlike those of the two statutory corporations, this plan is not required to have ministerial approval.


Schedule 2 provides for the transition of the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation and Wine Australia to the authority, including that the operations, assets, liabilities and staffing conditions are transferred to the authority. The bill allows the Minister for Agriculture to select the first board of directors. The board, as I said before, will commence on 1 July 2014. In between the date of appointment and 1 July 2014, the minister can engage the future board of directors as consultants to assist with the preparation of the authority's commencement, including making preparations to appoint the chief executive. The board's two statutory corporations will continue to exercise their individual powers and meet all statutory responsibilities until 30 June 2014. Before 1 July 2014 the future directors, in their role as consultants, cannot make decisions that would bind the authority; however, it can be expected that any recommendations they make would be considered for ratification by the board at its first meeting.


The costs of the consultants will be met by the Commonwealth through the Department of Agriculture. Once the authority commences, any and all Commonwealth funding provided for the purposes of engaging consultants will be refunded by the authority. As the consultants are the future board of directors acting in the interests of the authority, it is reasonable for the authority to reimburse the Commonwealth for the costs of these consultants.


The bill ensures that all employees of the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation and Wine Australia are transferred to the Australian Grape and Wine Authority along with all of their employee entitlements.


The bill provides for a number of amendments to be made to outdated sections of the Wine Australia Corporation Act 1980 and introduces modernised language to bring it up to date with current terms.


The wine industry has a unique regulatory structure, with the Wine Australia Corporation enforcing the label integrity program, licencing exporters and maintaining Australia's wine geographical indication systems. These important roles are not affected by the merger. The Australian Grape and Wine Authority will therefore have a strong focus on controlling exports, developing domestic and international markets for Australian grape product along with investigating, coordinating and funding grape and wine research and development. The authority will be responsible for reporting its progress on these matters to the parliament or the minister, and representative organisations.


The two companion bills that are being introduced alongside this bill propose minor amendments to the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Act 1999 and Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Act 1999 to enable levies collected to be paid to the new authority.


In talking about the opportunities and growth in our wine industry, I would like to speak to recent cuts to cellar-door subsidy schemes by the New South Wales government. The federal government's wine equalisation tax is a tax on wine, levied at 29 per cent. The tax is paid on the value of the wine at the last wholesale price or an equivalent value when there is no wholesale price. WET is adhered to by wine manufacturers, wholesalers and importers. Retailers do not have a WET liability unless they make their own wholesale wine. Generally, WET is included in the price that retailers such as bottle shops and restaurateurs pay when purchasing the wine. The retailer is not entitled to claim back the cost of the WET, as the WET is built into the price the retailer pays and passes on to the consumer. The government also provides wine producers with a wine equalisation tax rebate of up to $500,000 a year, which equates to approximately $1.7 million wholesale value of eligible sales.


The New South Wales government's cellar-door subsidy was an integral part of that mechanism, designed and agreed to by industry, the New South Wales government and the federal government. I have had winemakers from the Hunter, the Riverina and the Mudgee regions—New South Wales' three biggest wine regions—all complain to me how unhelpful the scrapping of this state subsidy has been. The termination of the cellar-door subsidy scheme, which I am told was worth about $3½ million a year to Hunter producers, was a big kick in the guts to most of them—especially since this subsidy was part of an agreement that was developed with industry to ensure that winemakers remain competitive.


In the late 1990s the High Court found that a state tax known as the business franchise fee was invalid. Because these licencing fees were not unique to wine the loss of state revenue would have been quite large, so the Howard government came to the rescue by agreeing to increase its tax, the wholesale sales tax, in order to raise what the states would have raised and hand it back to them. But Mr Howard's job did not end there, because by necessity the federal government's tax applied to all sales, including those at the cellar door, which had been exempt from the state imposed business franchise fee. So he asked the New South Wales government to agree to provide a rebate for cellar-door sales out of the wholesale sales tax that he handed back to them. That way, no-one was worse off as a result of the High Court's decision. Instead of limiting the industry, we should be supporting them. It is an ideal time for the regions like this to draw tourists, because our dollar is now back around 90c. I say that the states should reinstate this rebate.


In closing, I would like to re-emphasise why this amended legislation is a positive step forward. Firstly, the industry wanted it; secondly, because it will cut bureaucratic red tape; it will help grow the industry and, in growing the industry, it will help grow our economy. As we push for exports into markets particularly like China's, I am reminded of Tourism Australia's new marketing campaign. Built off the back of the campaign of There's Nothing Like Australia, it is the Restaurant Australia campaign. What they are promoting is our great food and our outstanding wines. By having overseas visitors—people coming into Australia—tasting our foods and exploring our wines, they then go back with a better appreciation and understanding of Australian wines and that will increase our export sales. I want to grow the market because I believe in the market and I believe in the growers. I think we have unique exceptional products in Australia and we are perfectly positioned now that the dollar is coming back to be able to penetrate some of those Asian markets. I support this bill because it is a bill driven by the industry itself.

Mr CHAMPION
 (Wakefield) (16:16):  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I appreciate you being here to listen to me. I know that you would much prefer to be listening to the maiden speech of the member for Gellibrand, and it seems from Twitter that it is a very good maiden speech indeed. So we are both missing out while we do this important work for the wine industry.


As the previous member said, the wine industry's future is very, very closely aligned with broader lifestyle economies. By that I mean an alignment with tourism and an alignment with the creative industries. That is where we are going to find great synergies in the wine industry. Only recently I was at Seppeltsfield, which is a great winery in my electorate and has been for many, many years. But now it is a winery in transition, because they are very, very closely aligning themselves with this type of creative economy. With the assistance of grants from the previous government, they have managed to reach an agreement with the JamFactory, a creative arts organisation in South Australia, to sell their products on site and, very shortly, another grant will help them completely transform their cellar-door area. It is an area currently covered in bitumen, built for the old days when you had large bus tours coming in. That area is now going to be opened up, beautified, and of course there will be a restaurant put in as well. So they are really building on what is a very, very beautiful and unique part of the world, and trying to make a unique experience for the people who go to that winery.


And it is not just about buying wine but maybe buying a good set of handcrafted knives—there is a knife-maker who is going to be a visiting artist—or a lovely piece of glass from these wonderful artists from the JamFactory. While they are there, of course, they will be having a meal as well. It is that sort of experience, I think, that is part of the wine industry weathering what is a difficult time in its history.


There are a couple of challenges. Obviously the high dollar is a huge challenge for exporters—and I know that the speaker to come knows something about that in her electorate. There is not a group of people in manufacturing—and wineries are included in that—who are not suffering not just from having a high dollar but also from having import competition from countries with artificially low currencies, often currencies that have been depreciated either because of the state of their economies or by deliberate government action. That is evident, I think, in the government of Japan and other economies around the world.


So we do have a very great challenge with the dollar and that does inhibit our ability to export. It is a bigger problem than is acknowledged by the political debate. I think we have been, to a certain extent, sidetracked away from a debate on the currency because there is no-one to blame. It is a debate and an economic problem where we have to, largely, search for solutions together, rather than blame one another for it. It is the result of many of the economic difficulties that this country and its manufacturers face.


Fortunately, I think the wine industry has a way out of a high dollar—a sticky dollar—and that is to move up the price scale. For too long, our industry was built on very cheap—high quality, but nevertheless cheap—exports to places like the UK and America. We competed on quality, to be sure, but we also competed largely on price. If there is a challenge for the industry, I think it is not just selling a lot of wine but selling wine for a good price, because we know that the consumers, whether they be here or around the world, will pay higher prices for a premium product. That is a critical challenge for the industry. You see many wineries doing that and using that as a way of dealing with what is a difficult set of currency arrangements between us and the rest of the world. We really need to come to grips with the facts of our currency. There is no doubt that it is overvalued, and there is no doubt that some of that is about other currencies, currency traders, reserve banks and the like investing in our currency because it has become a bit of a safe haven in the world.


The wine industry also has to deal with the issue of what is commonly called a glut. Of course the best way to resolve that is through greater sales, but it is continuing to cause some issues. Like I said, that last issue—that last piece of the puzzle—is a greater alignment with our food industries and our creative industries to create great synergies where people do not just come to visit a winery but come for a great meal, a great piece of art, a great bottle of wine and a great experience. That is invaluable, and that is why people are prepared to pay for it.


When I spoke on this bill when it came to the House in June of this year, I went through many of the framework issues of the bill. I do not think I will necessarily repeat all of those, but this was a bill that was the subject of industry and government collaboration. It is supported by both sides of parliament, so it is a happy piece of legislation. It is the sort of work that, I think, all of our constituents long for, even though it does not necessarily create as much attention as those things that we argue about.


The great virtue of this is in the peak bodies of the industry coming together and calling for reform and governments consulting with them—taking their interests into account, creating a proposal for a single new authority that takes on the functions and powers of the two previous authorities and creating a body that is better aligned with the future of the industry and a whole-of-industry strategy. Of course there are great benefits to aligning the strategy: better service delivery mechanisms and administrative efficiency gains. They are an important thing for any industry and, of course, they are an important thing for the wine industry.


The consultation process was pretty deliberate and pretty comprehensive. I have heard of no complaints about it in my electorate. I think it was comprehensive. That is reflected in the reintroduction of this bill by the current government. There are only a few bills that have survived the transition to government but this is one of them, and it is because of the important and noncontroversial functions of this bill.


The previous speaker said that the wine industry was one of Australia's progressive industries, and I actually agree with him. There is a great deal of creativity and earthy know-how in this industry. There are people in it who are really ingenious and have created an industry that combines our rural world with people who grow things and people who manufacture things. You see that in my electorate around the place. We have bottling plants and labelling plants in places like Freeling and Elizabeth. We have, obviously, small and large wineries in the area. They all provide employment and, I think, a great deal of passion and intellectual enjoyment—so not just pay cheques but creative and good jobs—for so many in my electorate.


So I am pleased to see that this bill is back. I look forward to its passage through the Senate and of course to the functions of this single authority for the wine industry being created. I also look forward to them providing a great strategy for the industry: prising open some of those export markets and making sure that high-value export markets are accessed by our wineries so that we might provide better jobs and better export income for Australia, even in what is a very difficult currency situation. I commend the bill to the House.

"Stone, Dr Sharman, MP",LP,2013-12-02,"



Dr STONE
 (Murray) (16:26):  I, too, rise to support the Grape and Wine Legislation Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013, the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013, and the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013. You will note that there is no contention when we come to debate this cognate set of bills. All of us both in the opposition and the government are in agreement that the creation of a single authority is a great idea. It was carefully consulted on by the previous government. There were more than 16 public meetings, 23 letters of support and no formal letters of objection, I understand, during the consultation period. In fact, the idea of this single authority, through these bills, was working its way through the previous government without contention when time ran out.


So we stand today to put these bills through parliament. We are going to merge two existing statutory corporations: the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation and the Wine Australia Corporation. Out of that will come the Australian Grape and Wine Authority. The GWRDC, which was part of the previous landscape, focused very much on market development, compliance with the industry's regulations, trade knowledge, and development; it also looked at geographic indications, integrity and labelling. The new body will go on to do that important work, I am sure, but as well it will deal with the issues of levies, and it will reduce red tape, by having a single authority instead of two. It will also make sure that, if you want to take up any particular part of this industry, in terms of being licensed or understanding regulations, there will be fewer bureaucrats to deal with in the system. Certainly anything we can do to cut red tape in industry in Australia is to be welcomed; we are overburdened with red tape and compliance regulation in this country.


There should be no extra costs other than that already agreed to by the Grape and Wine Authority research and development funding. I am aware that the winemakers in Australia, their federation and the Wine Grape Growers Australia group welcome this merger. So this is all good news.


There are two schedules as part of this cognate bill. The first deals with amendments to the Wine Australia Corporation Act 1980 which will start on the day of the royal assent, and schedule 1 and 2 amendments to the Freedom of Information Act 1982. That is, in particular, to make sure that there is appropriate provision for the new governance arrangements. Schedule 2 of the principal bill contains the provisions governing the merger of the two corporations, and actually establishes the authority, including issues like the transferring of staff.


All around, the merger seems a far better idea than having two agencies. They are to be merged into one, and we would expect out of that merger greater efficiency and effectiveness and a single voice driving our great grape and wine industry forward. The industry is not small; it earns $3.4 billion annually. But as an agriculture based industry it faces the usual, very high risks of frosts, hail, drought, flood, smoke damage from fire, fire itself or disease. None of us in grape-growing areas will forget that we had a brilliant winegrowing industry in the 1800s in Australia and into the early 1900s, when phylloxera arrived. In my part of the world—in the Strathbogies and the Dookie area—very old vineyards, which ceased to be during the onslaught of that terrible disease, are now being re-established with disease-free stock, and once again their wines are delighting Australia with the very special flavours they have as a result of their great soils, great climate and very clever winemaking skills.


We do have a number of issues, though, with our wine industry. One of them has been touched on by two previous speakers. Globally we are about the fourth biggest exporter, and in the emerging market of China we are about the fourth biggest supplier of wines. There, our export industry has grown from $57 million in 2007 to $250 million in 2013. However, our near neighbour New Zealand is doing much better in the Chinese market—as it is in other markets, where you would expect the connoisseurs of wines to understand that Australia can more than compete with wines from across the ditch. The problem is that we do not have the free trade agreements in place that New Zealand or some of our other closest competitors do. So, in China, our wine is trying to compete with one hand tied behind its back.


When I was recently in China, people asked me about our wines. They said, 'Surely you must produce great wines.' I said, 'Of course we do.' They said, 'How come they are so much less accessible to us than those from New Zealand—and, of course, the price is very different?' That has everything to do with a free trade agreement, which is not yet in place between Australia and China. We know that the previous government had it in mind, but it will be our government which will have to deliver it—and urgently. I say: all strength to the arm of our DFAT officials who are pursuing the free trade agreements not only with China but also with Japan and South Korea. Without free trade agreements, our wine is made less competitive—not only because of the lack of agreements to bring down the tariffs but also because of the very highly valued dollar—with the dirt-cheap imported wines which look good in the bottle and which come in to flood the supermarkets, particularly the ALDI, Coles and Woolworths liquor outlets. It is very difficult for our own, home-grown wines to compete without a level playing field.


So I stress that we in Australia need to understand that it is not enough to simply produce the cleanest, most flavoursome and most superb wines of any in the world; we have to make it possible for our winemakers to compete on a more level playing field than that on which they currently do. It is not their fault that we do not have free trade agreements in place; it is the fault of laziness in the past. We have to get over that laziness and get ourselves into the 21st century so that the tariffs and duties we encounter look more like those of our neighbours.


We also have very difficult circumstances in the concentration of retail ownership. The big Woolworths-Coles duopoly owns a substantial proportion of the retail liquor outlets in Australia. They make it difficult for our winegrowers to put new products on the shelves, they make it difficult for smaller, boutique vineyards to break into the marketplace and they certainly expect to pay cutthroat prices for wine suppliers. It is the same for all agribusiness, of course—whether they are supplying vegetables, milk or fruit to the big duopoly. I am very pleased to say that the government is making a very serious effort to bring about less unconscionable practice in the concentrated buyer power we find in Australia's food and beverage retail markets. It is not fair, however, to expect our wine producers to do a brilliant job and produce some of the world's greatest wines but then find that it is almost impossible to sell them beyond the internet or their winery gate because in our marketplace buyer power is concentrated.


Finally, I want to say in relation to labelling that it is amusing to see how carefully France guards its names and labels, like 'champagne', and how you have the sherries, the moselles and so forth clutched very closely to the bosom of other nations, who say that they describe geographies rather than types of wine. That is okay; we can do just as well in Australia with our types and our geographic locations. So let me stress that in my part of the world we have brilliant wines from the Strathbogies, from the Dookie region and from the Goulburn and Murray valleys. We have wines near the Pyrenees, where our Mallee country comes close to where the wines are grown. So I think it is important that in Australia we do not feel that somehow we have a problem with not being able to call our magnificent sparkling wines 'champagne' anymore. Let us make sure they become internationally known for their own geographic derivation and have their own names proudly displayed on the bottle.


Having said that, I note that a lot of our wines are exported with labels which warn of less-than-responsible drinking. As we know, wine is a magnificent product, but like all good things it can be abused. We quite happily put those labels on the exported bottles as they go to California or parts of Canada. Already in Australia there has been much discussion, and notice has been given to the beer, wine and spirits industry that, in the first instance, we expect warning labels to be voluntarily placed on our alcohol containers but with a view to mandating labels in the future if the voluntary codes do not work. Perhaps with this single entity coming through in the future it will be easier for the grape and wine industry to be able to engage in the debate about what are the most appropriate labels to put on our wine bottles. Perhaps we should adopt the international labels and make sure that they are at the right place and are the right size so that they are meaningful and not just a joke when it comes to warning the drinker of abusing or overconsuming alcohol at the wrong time or in the wrong place. I also stress that it will be important that we have on those labels the warning, 'Do not drink alcohol when you're pregnant,' which is an important part of wine labelling in France, Canada and most parts of the United States.


So I very happily commend these various pieces of legislation in this cognate debate to the House. I think it is one of those cases where common sense is prevailing for an industry which has so many very small players—over 2,500 wine producers across Australia. There are over 6,000 wine grape growers. Many of them are now finding it extremely difficult to make ends meet as they compete with the high cost of labour; the high cost of any of their chemical inputs; the high cost of irrigation water; the very high dollar, which brings their competitors into the country at dirt-cheap prices; the concentrated ownership of a lot of the liquor outlets in Australia; and, of course, our lack of free trade agreements with some of the most important emerging markets globally. Put all of that together and our wine industry needs all the help it can get. I wish this single entity, the Australian Grape and Wine Authority, the greatest of fortune, and I am sure our government will make sure a lot of those barriers to future success and prosperity in the industry are removed.

Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (16:38):  I rise to speak on the Grape and Wine Legislation Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013, the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013 and the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013. These bills have support from both sides of the House. This legislation will merge the existing statutory wine authority corporations that we have—the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation and the Wine Australia Corporation—into one entity, and that is good because it reduces red tape. It reduces a bureaucracy and makes it smaller. It is interesting that this has strong support across the whole industry. Where consultation was done, there was not one single formal written objection to this proposal. So it is good to hear that the opposition is supporting us with these bills.


However, there are some concerns about the future viability of this most important industry that we have. To reflect its importance: this is an industry here in Australia that is the fourth largest exporter of wine in the world. That is a credit that we have. We are a small population but the fourth largest exporter. Something like 60 per cent of our production is actually exported overseas with only about 40 per cent consumed locally. In past years we have had export sales in wine of over $2.8 billion. That is the importance of this industry.


We look to the future and the challenges that this industry has. It has a wonderful future with growing prosperity in South-East Asia, in China and in India. The potential for this industry to grow, expand and create more wealth for our nation should make it one of our most important industries and one we need to look after.


However, there are some grey clouds on the horizon and there are some significant problems that this industry has. Of course the high dollar is an issue that many exporters have, but I say the real concern, the real challenge to the viability of an innovative, prosperous wine industry in Australia's future is the concentration of our own, home-grown retail market. For most companies, if they are to be successful exporters, they first must be successful and develop experience in their home market. Getting the grounding in their home market, getting their brands and production methods established is what gives them the ability to go out into that international field where competition is so much tougher, where they are competing in the global environment. That is why our local market is so important. But the concern we have is the absolute market concentration we see at the retail level in our wine and alcohol sector.


We have the supermarket duopoly currently controlling in the vicinity of 60 to 70 per cent of the retail wine sales in our nation. This has a very detrimental effect on producers. That was recently noted in a report put together by KPMG: the Australian Food and Grocery Council's State of the industry 2013: essential information: facts and figures. This report should send the alarm bells ringing through this place. The report notes significant problems that many of our food producers have and which I am also sure apply to our wine producers. It notes that across the industry there has been a significant increase in trade spend. Trade spend is what is paid by the supplier to the retailer for trade discounts and promotional allowances. That trade spend actually increased from an incredible 19.5 per cent of gross sales in 2008-2009. I have asked the Parliamentary Library to try to find me some data to see how that 19.5 per cent compares internationally. Unfortunately, they were unable to do so, but I believe there is no other nation in the world, there is no other food producing sector anywhere in the world that has such a high trade spend. This report noted that, between 2008-09 and 2011-12, that trade spend, the amount the producers are paying to the retailers, increased from 19.5 to 23.4 per cent. For food producers in this nation, for every dollar of sale they have, 23.4 per cent goes to the rebates and allowances they pay to our retailers. This is completely unsustainable. This report warns:


The increase in trade spend has come at the cost of suppliers' marketing and research and development spend which may have a long-term impact on growth, sustainability and innovation.


Those are the very three things we need to make sure we have viable food and wine producers. Growth, sustainability and innovation are jeopardised by this increase in trade spend.


To compare that 23 per cent trade spend: in our food industry salaries and on costs represent eight per cent. We are looking at close to three times the cost of wages and salary in the food producing industry going into trade spend. Former Treasury Wine Estates boss David Dearie recently commented on the effect of this massive increase that we have seen in the trade spend and also on the concentrated nature of the Australian retail market.


In an article published in The Sydney Morning Herald on 27 November, Mr Dearie said there are 2,500 wineries in Australia, each with multiple brands, which means tens of thousands of brands are competing for shelf space, 70 per cent of which is owned by just two companies. He said the supermarkets were using their relative strength and the wine sector's weakened, fragmented state to demand thicker margins compared to other beverage categories. Unfortunately, he recommends that a level of consolidation in the wine sector is inevitable and vital to boost their bargaining power with the supermarket chains.


But no matter how concentrated our wine producers become, they will not be able to have the bargaining power to offset the strength of the supermarket chains—and this is exactly the opposite of what we need. We need to have thousands of wine producers out there innovating and experimenting, coming up with new ideas and trying new methods. We need entrepreneurial drive in our wine sector. But this is all being threatened—it is all being compromised—by the concentration we have in our retail sector. This shows the importance of the coalition's commitment to have a complete review of the Trade Practices Act. Maybe what we need is the Standard Oil option, because the danger and threat to our wine producers of a concentrated retail market cannot be understated. This bill is a welcome move—it is a step in the right direction—but we really need to be very careful that our retail sector is not damaging the production sector. I commend the bill to the House.

"Joyce, Barnaby, MP",Nats,2013-12-02,"



Mr JOYCE
 (New England—Minister for Agriculture and Deputy Leader of The Nationals) (16:46):  I rise to conclude the debate on the Grape and Wine Legislation Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013 and cognate legislation. The government is continuing to work to progress the merger of two statutory corporations—the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation and the Wine Australia Corporation. The merger of the two corporations will create a single whole of industry statutory authority—the Australian Grape and Wine Authority. The new authority will offer strategic benefits to the industry, such as improved leadership, service delivery and administrative efficiency. It will also enable a single board to make strategic links between research and development, investment initiatives and marketing. There will not be any changes made to the structure or amount of industry levies.


The legislation provides that all levies collected for a particular purpose, such as research and development, will only be used for that purpose by the new authority. There will also not be any changes to the existing regulatory, marketing and compliance roles of the Wine Australia Corporation under the new authority. The decision to implement the merger followed an industry proposal submitted in August 2012 by the two industry peak bodies: Wine Grape Growers Australia and the Winemakers Federation of Australia. The merger has widespread industry support and addresses discussions that have been raised over the last 20 years. Three bills have been presented for introduction—the Grape and Wine Legislation Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013, the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013 and the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013—and these bills provide the mechanism to create the Australian Grape and Wine Authority and implement the key elements of the reform.


I concur with the comments of my colleagues that what the wine industry does is allow those who have the work ethic to find themselves a small area of land and, if they work very hard, grow five or 10 acres of grapes—and, if they have a product that suits the palate, all other things being equal, it should sell and they should be able to make some money out of it. The only thing that can stand in their way is that they cannot market their product. If the marketplace has impediments, that means that, past the cellar door, the product has little hope of surviving.


I have been made aware of this by some colleagues in South Australia, who talk of excellent wines that one day they found were no longer on the shelves. The problem is that it is not the quality of the product that matters but the capacity to market the product. I am happy that the coalition has moved to a root and branch review of the Competition and Consumer Act, formerly known as the Trade Practices Act. There are a number of sections that are obviously very pertinent to this. One would have been—and I am sure that the members here are aware of it—what was otherwise known as section 51AC. It is now section 22 under the new Competition and Consumer Act. That section is about unconscionable conduct. We have to make sure that those in Australia who want to get ahead and who put their shoulder to the wheel and forfeit their role working for somebody else to set up their own business do not do so for no purpose such that there is no chance of ever receiving any benefit from what they do because they cannot sell the product.

Mr JOYCE:
  Is there a custom and practice that we try and act civilly here, or is that not part of it?



An opposition member interjecting—




Mr JOYCE:
  No? Okay. Then you are right at home. It is good to see that on this side of the chamber people are looking after the people who want to participate in the commerce of our nation. We are making our best endeavours to try and make sure that the livelihoods of those in small business are looked after, while people on the other side mimic something from a zoo.

  Do you know what always amazes me? I was thinking about this today. One of the greatest representations of the other side is Mr Paul Howes. He is the person who picks the—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Mitchell
):  Please stick to the bill.




Mr JOYCE:
  Mr Howes is very important, because he picks the prime ministers of our nation. He is the faceless man. He wrote a book about himself—in fact, he has written a few books about himself.



An opposition member interjecting—




Mr JOYCE:
  Don't you love the way they come out in chorus? One of the books that he wrote about himself was Confessions of a faceless man. He does not believe in 'ma and pa farms'. He said it. Why this is relevant is because these are predominantly ma and pa farms. Only Paul Howes and the AWU could turn farming into a pejorative; only they are capable of that. That should be known by the member for Blair, who would have a lot of ma and pa farms in his area. I expect him to stand up on behalf of those ma and pa farms in the Gatton valley and dismiss the comments of Paul Howes, because they are an absolute disgrace. Might I remind you that ABARES has said in excess of 95 per cent of farms in Australia are ma and pa farms, to use the Paul Howes pejorative. In fact, the Productivity Commission thinks it is more like 99 per cent. But those over there do not want ma and pa farms. They do not believe in the family business. They probably do not like ma and pa houses. They probably want to send us all back to the council flat in the midlands of England, because that is where it works best. The people from the Gatton valley will hold you to account for what you have said.




Mr Neumann:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. He is supposed to be summing up the bill. He has confessed that this is his first speech in the Federation Chamber. But he has to be relevant to the bill in this summation and not go on with the ridiculous stuff that he is doing now.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I thank the member for Blair. The minister will continue on the summing up of the bill.




Mr JOYCE:
  Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker. I can understand the sensitivities of someone who lives in the Gatton valley with a lot of ma and pa farms. I am glad that this will be on the Hansard so that I can send it to your local paper and show what people on your side of the political fence believe about the farming community. It is very important that we stand on behalf of the farming community, which apparently others have grown too sophisticated to support these days. They do not want ma and pa farms, which means, I suppose, that they do not want ma and pa houses. They do not want ma and pa small businesses. They just want to run down the farming community. They want to run down those in small business.




Mr Neumann:
  I rise on a point of order. This is not relevant in any way, shape or form to the summation of this legislation, which is a bipartisan approach to this issue. This is simply a rant and a rave by the minister, irrelevant to the summation of the bill.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The minister will continue on the summing up of the bill.




Mr JOYCE:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I shall do this because it is extremely relevant because, just like we are bringing greater efficiencies to the wine industry to reduce costs to try and keep family businesses on the family farm, it is very important that we note which side of the chamber does not believe in the family farm, does not believe in the right of a family enterprise to succeed—by their own statements. You know who else is in the AWU, the same union as Mr Paul Howes? It would have to be the Leader of the Opposition. That is who else is in it.




Ms Hall:
  On a point of order, Deputy Speaker. This is totally irrelevant.




Mr Joyce:
  You sound like you are about to cry! Come on, it's not that hard—it's all right.




Ms Hall:
  And the minister's behaviour is totally inappropriate. It is not an interjection; it is inappropriate behaviour.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Mitchell
):  I will ask the minister for the last time to sum up on the bill.




Mr JOYCE:
  I will come to a conclusion, because I know the sensitivities of what we have raised here today. It is always surprising when someone interjects how they don't like it when it comes back in the other direction. I commend the bill to the chamber.



Ms Hall interjecting—



Mr Joyce interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  You are skating close there, Minister, about disorderly conduct and also on reflecting on members in the chamber. The question is that the bill be now read a second time.

Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry) (16:01):  I rise today to speak on the Grape and Wine Legislation Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013 and cognate bills. This is a truly great example of what can be achieved when governments work together with both industry and businesses to achieve better business outcomes. The wine industry is a great example of a progressive Australian agricultural industry. These amendment bills have come about at the request of industry and merge two of the country's peak wine bodies together. A newly named Australian Grape and Wine Authority will emerge and be responsible for the marketing, research and development of the country's $3.4 billion wine industry. The merger also brings together the research and development functions of the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation and Wine Australia Corporation marketing and export oversight functions.


Importantly, industry itself proposed no changes to the amounts of levies or the regulatory compliance role of the Wine Australia Corporation. A single wine industry body will support the industry by providing links between investment initiatives and functions of the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation and Wine Australia Corporation. There is no financial impact other than the Commonwealth entering into an agreement to match the Australian Grape and Wine Authority research and development funding. These amendment bills send a clear message to all Australian industry and business that this government is listening to the recommendations and taking on board all points of view before it makes decisions.


It is no secret that wineries located in the Hunter region are well known for their quality right around Australia and indeed the world. Some of Australia's largest exporters of wine, like McWilliam's, Drayton's, Tyrrell's and Brokenwood, reside within our Hunter region. They are representative of the great reds and whites that Australian wineries make and the popularity of our drops overseas. Hunter winemakers and grape growers are part of an industry that employs over 22,000 Australians nationally. They are part of an export industry that Wine Australia estimates to be worth $1.8 billion and that exported 698 million litres of wine to countries like the United Kingdom, the USA, Canada, China and New Zealand last financial year. Wine Australia's latest Wine export approval report says:


Australia ranks fourth among the world's 10 biggest wine exporters in the average value per litre of bottled wine exports …


But we are behind New Zealand, France and the US—but ahead of Argentina, Italy, South Africa, Germany and Chile.


The report also says that in total volume Australian wine is also now the No. 1 imported wine in the UK and New Zealand. It is second in the USA and fourth in Canada and China. Wine Australia saw some years ago a growing interest in Australian wines throughout Asia. We are now seeing exports of the premium, highly profitable segment of the wine market continuing to grow in East Asian markets just like China. The Chinese market has grown from $57 million in 2007 to in excess of $250 million today to be our third biggest in value. Australian bottled wine exports to the USA in the higher than $7.50 a litre segment grew by 16 per cent in the year ended 30 September 2013. I would like to see the industry grow further. I believe that these amendment bills are a good step in the right direction.


I would like to tell you a little more about the Grape and Wine Legislation Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill that has been introduced by my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Barnaby Joyce. This bill proposes amendments to the Wine Australia Corporation Act 1980 to establish a new authority. It renames the act as the Australian Grape and Wine Authority Act 2013. The bill makes significant amendments to the existing Wine Australia Corporation Act 1980. The merger is not a takeover of the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation by Wine Australia; it is a strategic merger of the two statutory corporations on an equal footing.


The bill is divided into schedules. Schedule 1 amends the Wine Australia Corporation Act to create the authority. Schedule 2 covers matters arising from the transition from two statutory corporations to the authority. It covers matters such as the transfer of staff to the authority. Schedule 1 is divided into two parts. Part 1 of the schedule amends the Wine Australia Corporation Act 1980 to establish a selection committee to select and nominate to the Minister for Agriculture possible directors of the board of the authority. The bill also gives the Minister for Agriculture an alternative option of appointing a first board of the authority for a 12-month period without reference to the selection committee.


Part 2 of schedule 1 commences on 1 July 2014. This part amends the Freedom of Information Act 1982 and the Wine Australia Corporation Act 1980. This part establishes the authority and provides the governance framework for its operations. Schedule 1 also provides the research and development functions, including provisions for the Commonwealth to match research and development levy funds dollar for dollar. The authority will be required to spend research and development levy money and government-matching funds on research and development activity only. Industry has highlighted the importance of this issue for the new authority and I want to make it clear to the industry that the R&D levies will be spent on R&D purposes only. It is also important to the government to ensure that Australian government money appropriated for research and development is actually used for this purpose.


The bill does not include any changes to the structure or the amounts of the levies that currently fund both statutory corporations or to the existing regulatory, marketing or compliance roles of the Wine Australia Corporation. The bill transfers definitions of research and development from the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989. It establishes an authority with a skills based board of five to seven directors selected and nominated by a statutory selection committee and appointed by the minister. The board is led by a chair appointed by the minister following consultation with industry.


The authority is required to prepare a five-year corporate plan to outline the authority's strategies, policies and priorities to achieve the objective. The authority is also required to prepare an annual operation plan. Unlike those of the two statutory corporations, this plan is not required to have ministerial approval.


Schedule 2 provides for the transition of the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation and Wine Australia to the authority, including that the operations, assets, liabilities and staffing conditions are transferred to the authority. The bill allows the Minister for Agriculture to select the first board of directors. The board, as I said before, will commence on 1 July 2014. In between the date of appointment and 1 July 2014, the minister can engage the future board of directors as consultants to assist with the preparation of the authority's commencement, including making preparations to appoint the chief executive. The board's two statutory corporations will continue to exercise their individual powers and meet all statutory responsibilities until 30 June 2014. Before 1 July 2014 the future directors, in their role as consultants, cannot make decisions that would bind the authority; however, it can be expected that any recommendations they make would be considered for ratification by the board at its first meeting.


The costs of the consultants will be met by the Commonwealth through the Department of Agriculture. Once the authority commences, any and all Commonwealth funding provided for the purposes of engaging consultants will be refunded by the authority. As the consultants are the future board of directors acting in the interests of the authority, it is reasonable for the authority to reimburse the Commonwealth for the costs of these consultants.


The bill ensures that all employees of the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation and Wine Australia are transferred to the Australian Grape and Wine Authority along with all of their employee entitlements.


The bill provides for a number of amendments to be made to outdated sections of the Wine Australia Corporation Act 1980 and introduces modernised language to bring it up to date with current terms.


The wine industry has a unique regulatory structure, with the Wine Australia Corporation enforcing the label integrity program, licencing exporters and maintaining Australia's wine geographical indication systems. These important roles are not affected by the merger. The Australian Grape and Wine Authority will therefore have a strong focus on controlling exports, developing domestic and international markets for Australian grape product along with investigating, coordinating and funding grape and wine research and development. The authority will be responsible for reporting its progress on these matters to the parliament or the minister, and representative organisations.


The two companion bills that are being introduced alongside this bill propose minor amendments to the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Act 1999 and Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Act 1999 to enable levies collected to be paid to the new authority.


In talking about the opportunities and growth in our wine industry, I would like to speak to recent cuts to cellar-door subsidy schemes by the New South Wales government. The federal government's wine equalisation tax is a tax on wine, levied at 29 per cent. The tax is paid on the value of the wine at the last wholesale price or an equivalent value when there is no wholesale price. WET is adhered to by wine manufacturers, wholesalers and importers. Retailers do not have a WET liability unless they make their own wholesale wine. Generally, WET is included in the price that retailers such as bottle shops and restaurateurs pay when purchasing the wine. The retailer is not entitled to claim back the cost of the WET, as the WET is built into the price the retailer pays and passes on to the consumer. The government also provides wine producers with a wine equalisation tax rebate of up to $500,000 a year, which equates to approximately $1.7 million wholesale value of eligible sales.


The New South Wales government's cellar-door subsidy was an integral part of that mechanism, designed and agreed to by industry, the New South Wales government and the federal government. I have had winemakers from the Hunter, the Riverina and the Mudgee regions—New South Wales' three biggest wine regions—all complain to me how unhelpful the scrapping of this state subsidy has been. The termination of the cellar-door subsidy scheme, which I am told was worth about $3½ million a year to Hunter producers, was a big kick in the guts to most of them—especially since this subsidy was part of an agreement that was developed with industry to ensure that winemakers remain competitive.


In the late 1990s the High Court found that a state tax known as the business franchise fee was invalid. Because these licencing fees were not unique to wine the loss of state revenue would have been quite large, so the Howard government came to the rescue by agreeing to increase its tax, the wholesale sales tax, in order to raise what the states would have raised and hand it back to them. But Mr Howard's job did not end there, because by necessity the federal government's tax applied to all sales, including those at the cellar door, which had been exempt from the state imposed business franchise fee. So he asked the New South Wales government to agree to provide a rebate for cellar-door sales out of the wholesale sales tax that he handed back to them. That way, no-one was worse off as a result of the High Court's decision. Instead of limiting the industry, we should be supporting them. It is an ideal time for the regions like this to draw tourists, because our dollar is now back around 90c. I say that the states should reinstate this rebate.


In closing, I would like to re-emphasise why this amended legislation is a positive step forward. Firstly, the industry wanted it; secondly, because it will cut bureaucratic red tape; it will help grow the industry and, in growing the industry, it will help grow our economy. As we push for exports into markets particularly like China's, I am reminded of Tourism Australia's new marketing campaign. Built off the back of the campaign of There's Nothing Like Australia, it is the Restaurant Australia campaign. What they are promoting is our great food and our outstanding wines. By having overseas visitors—people coming into Australia—tasting our foods and exploring our wines, they then go back with a better appreciation and understanding of Australian wines and that will increase our export sales. I want to grow the market because I believe in the market and I believe in the growers. I think we have unique exceptional products in Australia and we are perfectly positioned now that the dollar is coming back to be able to penetrate some of those Asian markets. I support this bill because it is a bill driven by the industry itself.

"Champion, Nick, MP",ALP,2013-12-02,"



Mr CHAMPION
 (Wakefield) (16:16):  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I appreciate you being here to listen to me. I know that you would much prefer to be listening to the maiden speech of the member for Gellibrand, and it seems from Twitter that it is a very good maiden speech indeed. So we are both missing out while we do this important work for the wine industry.


As the previous member said, the wine industry's future is very, very closely aligned with broader lifestyle economies. By that I mean an alignment with tourism and an alignment with the creative industries. That is where we are going to find great synergies in the wine industry. Only recently I was at Seppeltsfield, which is a great winery in my electorate and has been for many, many years. But now it is a winery in transition, because they are very, very closely aligning themselves with this type of creative economy. With the assistance of grants from the previous government, they have managed to reach an agreement with the JamFactory, a creative arts organisation in South Australia, to sell their products on site and, very shortly, another grant will help them completely transform their cellar-door area. It is an area currently covered in bitumen, built for the old days when you had large bus tours coming in. That area is now going to be opened up, beautified, and of course there will be a restaurant put in as well. So they are really building on what is a very, very beautiful and unique part of the world, and trying to make a unique experience for the people who go to that winery.


And it is not just about buying wine but maybe buying a good set of handcrafted knives—there is a knife-maker who is going to be a visiting artist—or a lovely piece of glass from these wonderful artists from the JamFactory. While they are there, of course, they will be having a meal as well. It is that sort of experience, I think, that is part of the wine industry weathering what is a difficult time in its history.


There are a couple of challenges. Obviously the high dollar is a huge challenge for exporters—and I know that the speaker to come knows something about that in her electorate. There is not a group of people in manufacturing—and wineries are included in that—who are not suffering not just from having a high dollar but also from having import competition from countries with artificially low currencies, often currencies that have been depreciated either because of the state of their economies or by deliberate government action. That is evident, I think, in the government of Japan and other economies around the world.


So we do have a very great challenge with the dollar and that does inhibit our ability to export. It is a bigger problem than is acknowledged by the political debate. I think we have been, to a certain extent, sidetracked away from a debate on the currency because there is no-one to blame. It is a debate and an economic problem where we have to, largely, search for solutions together, rather than blame one another for it. It is the result of many of the economic difficulties that this country and its manufacturers face.


Fortunately, I think the wine industry has a way out of a high dollar—a sticky dollar—and that is to move up the price scale. For too long, our industry was built on very cheap—high quality, but nevertheless cheap—exports to places like the UK and America. We competed on quality, to be sure, but we also competed largely on price. If there is a challenge for the industry, I think it is not just selling a lot of wine but selling wine for a good price, because we know that the consumers, whether they be here or around the world, will pay higher prices for a premium product. That is a critical challenge for the industry. You see many wineries doing that and using that as a way of dealing with what is a difficult set of currency arrangements between us and the rest of the world. We really need to come to grips with the facts of our currency. There is no doubt that it is overvalued, and there is no doubt that some of that is about other currencies, currency traders, reserve banks and the like investing in our currency because it has become a bit of a safe haven in the world.


The wine industry also has to deal with the issue of what is commonly called a glut. Of course the best way to resolve that is through greater sales, but it is continuing to cause some issues. Like I said, that last issue—that last piece of the puzzle—is a greater alignment with our food industries and our creative industries to create great synergies where people do not just come to visit a winery but come for a great meal, a great piece of art, a great bottle of wine and a great experience. That is invaluable, and that is why people are prepared to pay for it.


When I spoke on this bill when it came to the House in June of this year, I went through many of the framework issues of the bill. I do not think I will necessarily repeat all of those, but this was a bill that was the subject of industry and government collaboration. It is supported by both sides of parliament, so it is a happy piece of legislation. It is the sort of work that, I think, all of our constituents long for, even though it does not necessarily create as much attention as those things that we argue about.


The great virtue of this is in the peak bodies of the industry coming together and calling for reform and governments consulting with them—taking their interests into account, creating a proposal for a single new authority that takes on the functions and powers of the two previous authorities and creating a body that is better aligned with the future of the industry and a whole-of-industry strategy. Of course there are great benefits to aligning the strategy: better service delivery mechanisms and administrative efficiency gains. They are an important thing for any industry and, of course, they are an important thing for the wine industry.


The consultation process was pretty deliberate and pretty comprehensive. I have heard of no complaints about it in my electorate. I think it was comprehensive. That is reflected in the reintroduction of this bill by the current government. There are only a few bills that have survived the transition to government but this is one of them, and it is because of the important and noncontroversial functions of this bill.


The previous speaker said that the wine industry was one of Australia's progressive industries, and I actually agree with him. There is a great deal of creativity and earthy know-how in this industry. There are people in it who are really ingenious and have created an industry that combines our rural world with people who grow things and people who manufacture things. You see that in my electorate around the place. We have bottling plants and labelling plants in places like Freeling and Elizabeth. We have, obviously, small and large wineries in the area. They all provide employment and, I think, a great deal of passion and intellectual enjoyment—so not just pay cheques but creative and good jobs—for so many in my electorate.


So I am pleased to see that this bill is back. I look forward to its passage through the Senate and of course to the functions of this single authority for the wine industry being created. I also look forward to them providing a great strategy for the industry: prising open some of those export markets and making sure that high-value export markets are accessed by our wineries so that we might provide better jobs and better export income for Australia, even in what is a very difficult currency situation. I commend the bill to the House.

"Stone, Dr Sharman, MP",LP,2013-12-02,"



Dr STONE
 (Murray) (16:26):  I, too, rise to support the Grape and Wine Legislation Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013, the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013, and the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013. You will note that there is no contention when we come to debate this cognate set of bills. All of us both in the opposition and the government are in agreement that the creation of a single authority is a great idea. It was carefully consulted on by the previous government. There were more than 16 public meetings, 23 letters of support and no formal letters of objection, I understand, during the consultation period. In fact, the idea of this single authority, through these bills, was working its way through the previous government without contention when time ran out.


So we stand today to put these bills through parliament. We are going to merge two existing statutory corporations: the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation and the Wine Australia Corporation. Out of that will come the Australian Grape and Wine Authority. The GWRDC, which was part of the previous landscape, focused very much on market development, compliance with the industry's regulations, trade knowledge, and development; it also looked at geographic indications, integrity and labelling. The new body will go on to do that important work, I am sure, but as well it will deal with the issues of levies, and it will reduce red tape, by having a single authority instead of two. It will also make sure that, if you want to take up any particular part of this industry, in terms of being licensed or understanding regulations, there will be fewer bureaucrats to deal with in the system. Certainly anything we can do to cut red tape in industry in Australia is to be welcomed; we are overburdened with red tape and compliance regulation in this country.


There should be no extra costs other than that already agreed to by the Grape and Wine Authority research and development funding. I am aware that the winemakers in Australia, their federation and the Wine Grape Growers Australia group welcome this merger. So this is all good news.


There are two schedules as part of this cognate bill. The first deals with amendments to the Wine Australia Corporation Act 1980 which will start on the day of the royal assent, and schedule 1 and 2 amendments to the Freedom of Information Act 1982. That is, in particular, to make sure that there is appropriate provision for the new governance arrangements. Schedule 2 of the principal bill contains the provisions governing the merger of the two corporations, and actually establishes the authority, including issues like the transferring of staff.


All around, the merger seems a far better idea than having two agencies. They are to be merged into one, and we would expect out of that merger greater efficiency and effectiveness and a single voice driving our great grape and wine industry forward. The industry is not small; it earns $3.4 billion annually. But as an agriculture based industry it faces the usual, very high risks of frosts, hail, drought, flood, smoke damage from fire, fire itself or disease. None of us in grape-growing areas will forget that we had a brilliant winegrowing industry in the 1800s in Australia and into the early 1900s, when phylloxera arrived. In my part of the world—in the Strathbogies and the Dookie area—very old vineyards, which ceased to be during the onslaught of that terrible disease, are now being re-established with disease-free stock, and once again their wines are delighting Australia with the very special flavours they have as a result of their great soils, great climate and very clever winemaking skills.


We do have a number of issues, though, with our wine industry. One of them has been touched on by two previous speakers. Globally we are about the fourth biggest exporter, and in the emerging market of China we are about the fourth biggest supplier of wines. There, our export industry has grown from $57 million in 2007 to $250 million in 2013. However, our near neighbour New Zealand is doing much better in the Chinese market—as it is in other markets, where you would expect the connoisseurs of wines to understand that Australia can more than compete with wines from across the ditch. The problem is that we do not have the free trade agreements in place that New Zealand or some of our other closest competitors do. So, in China, our wine is trying to compete with one hand tied behind its back.


When I was recently in China, people asked me about our wines. They said, 'Surely you must produce great wines.' I said, 'Of course we do.' They said, 'How come they are so much less accessible to us than those from New Zealand—and, of course, the price is very different?' That has everything to do with a free trade agreement, which is not yet in place between Australia and China. We know that the previous government had it in mind, but it will be our government which will have to deliver it—and urgently. I say: all strength to the arm of our DFAT officials who are pursuing the free trade agreements not only with China but also with Japan and South Korea. Without free trade agreements, our wine is made less competitive—not only because of the lack of agreements to bring down the tariffs but also because of the very highly valued dollar—with the dirt-cheap imported wines which look good in the bottle and which come in to flood the supermarkets, particularly the ALDI, Coles and Woolworths liquor outlets. It is very difficult for our own, home-grown wines to compete without a level playing field.


So I stress that we in Australia need to understand that it is not enough to simply produce the cleanest, most flavoursome and most superb wines of any in the world; we have to make it possible for our winemakers to compete on a more level playing field than that on which they currently do. It is not their fault that we do not have free trade agreements in place; it is the fault of laziness in the past. We have to get over that laziness and get ourselves into the 21st century so that the tariffs and duties we encounter look more like those of our neighbours.


We also have very difficult circumstances in the concentration of retail ownership. The big Woolworths-Coles duopoly owns a substantial proportion of the retail liquor outlets in Australia. They make it difficult for our winegrowers to put new products on the shelves, they make it difficult for smaller, boutique vineyards to break into the marketplace and they certainly expect to pay cutthroat prices for wine suppliers. It is the same for all agribusiness, of course—whether they are supplying vegetables, milk or fruit to the big duopoly. I am very pleased to say that the government is making a very serious effort to bring about less unconscionable practice in the concentrated buyer power we find in Australia's food and beverage retail markets. It is not fair, however, to expect our wine producers to do a brilliant job and produce some of the world's greatest wines but then find that it is almost impossible to sell them beyond the internet or their winery gate because in our marketplace buyer power is concentrated.


Finally, I want to say in relation to labelling that it is amusing to see how carefully France guards its names and labels, like 'champagne', and how you have the sherries, the moselles and so forth clutched very closely to the bosom of other nations, who say that they describe geographies rather than types of wine. That is okay; we can do just as well in Australia with our types and our geographic locations. So let me stress that in my part of the world we have brilliant wines from the Strathbogies, from the Dookie region and from the Goulburn and Murray valleys. We have wines near the Pyrenees, where our Mallee country comes close to where the wines are grown. So I think it is important that in Australia we do not feel that somehow we have a problem with not being able to call our magnificent sparkling wines 'champagne' anymore. Let us make sure they become internationally known for their own geographic derivation and have their own names proudly displayed on the bottle.


Having said that, I note that a lot of our wines are exported with labels which warn of less-than-responsible drinking. As we know, wine is a magnificent product, but like all good things it can be abused. We quite happily put those labels on the exported bottles as they go to California or parts of Canada. Already in Australia there has been much discussion, and notice has been given to the beer, wine and spirits industry that, in the first instance, we expect warning labels to be voluntarily placed on our alcohol containers but with a view to mandating labels in the future if the voluntary codes do not work. Perhaps with this single entity coming through in the future it will be easier for the grape and wine industry to be able to engage in the debate about what are the most appropriate labels to put on our wine bottles. Perhaps we should adopt the international labels and make sure that they are at the right place and are the right size so that they are meaningful and not just a joke when it comes to warning the drinker of abusing or overconsuming alcohol at the wrong time or in the wrong place. I also stress that it will be important that we have on those labels the warning, 'Do not drink alcohol when you're pregnant,' which is an important part of wine labelling in France, Canada and most parts of the United States.


So I very happily commend these various pieces of legislation in this cognate debate to the House. I think it is one of those cases where common sense is prevailing for an industry which has so many very small players—over 2,500 wine producers across Australia. There are over 6,000 wine grape growers. Many of them are now finding it extremely difficult to make ends meet as they compete with the high cost of labour; the high cost of any of their chemical inputs; the high cost of irrigation water; the very high dollar, which brings their competitors into the country at dirt-cheap prices; the concentrated ownership of a lot of the liquor outlets in Australia; and, of course, our lack of free trade agreements with some of the most important emerging markets globally. Put all of that together and our wine industry needs all the help it can get. I wish this single entity, the Australian Grape and Wine Authority, the greatest of fortune, and I am sure our government will make sure a lot of those barriers to future success and prosperity in the industry are removed.

"Kelly, Craig, MP",LP,2013-12-02,"



Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (16:38):  I rise to speak on the Grape and Wine Legislation Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013, the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013 and the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013. These bills have support from both sides of the House. This legislation will merge the existing statutory wine authority corporations that we have—the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation and the Wine Australia Corporation—into one entity, and that is good because it reduces red tape. It reduces a bureaucracy and makes it smaller. It is interesting that this has strong support across the whole industry. Where consultation was done, there was not one single formal written objection to this proposal. So it is good to hear that the opposition is supporting us with these bills.


However, there are some concerns about the future viability of this most important industry that we have. To reflect its importance: this is an industry here in Australia that is the fourth largest exporter of wine in the world. That is a credit that we have. We are a small population but the fourth largest exporter. Something like 60 per cent of our production is actually exported overseas with only about 40 per cent consumed locally. In past years we have had export sales in wine of over $2.8 billion. That is the importance of this industry.


We look to the future and the challenges that this industry has. It has a wonderful future with growing prosperity in South-East Asia, in China and in India. The potential for this industry to grow, expand and create more wealth for our nation should make it one of our most important industries and one we need to look after.


However, there are some grey clouds on the horizon and there are some significant problems that this industry has. Of course the high dollar is an issue that many exporters have, but I say the real concern, the real challenge to the viability of an innovative, prosperous wine industry in Australia's future is the concentration of our own, home-grown retail market. For most companies, if they are to be successful exporters, they first must be successful and develop experience in their home market. Getting the grounding in their home market, getting their brands and production methods established is what gives them the ability to go out into that international field where competition is so much tougher, where they are competing in the global environment. That is why our local market is so important. But the concern we have is the absolute market concentration we see at the retail level in our wine and alcohol sector.


We have the supermarket duopoly currently controlling in the vicinity of 60 to 70 per cent of the retail wine sales in our nation. This has a very detrimental effect on producers. That was recently noted in a report put together by KPMG: the Australian Food and Grocery Council's State of the industry 2013: essential information: facts and figures. This report should send the alarm bells ringing through this place. The report notes significant problems that many of our food producers have and which I am also sure apply to our wine producers. It notes that across the industry there has been a significant increase in trade spend. Trade spend is what is paid by the supplier to the retailer for trade discounts and promotional allowances. That trade spend actually increased from an incredible 19.5 per cent of gross sales in 2008-2009. I have asked the Parliamentary Library to try to find me some data to see how that 19.5 per cent compares internationally. Unfortunately, they were unable to do so, but I believe there is no other nation in the world, there is no other food producing sector anywhere in the world that has such a high trade spend. This report noted that, between 2008-09 and 2011-12, that trade spend, the amount the producers are paying to the retailers, increased from 19.5 to 23.4 per cent. For food producers in this nation, for every dollar of sale they have, 23.4 per cent goes to the rebates and allowances they pay to our retailers. This is completely unsustainable. This report warns:


The increase in trade spend has come at the cost of suppliers' marketing and research and development spend which may have a long-term impact on growth, sustainability and innovation.


Those are the very three things we need to make sure we have viable food and wine producers. Growth, sustainability and innovation are jeopardised by this increase in trade spend.


To compare that 23 per cent trade spend: in our food industry salaries and on costs represent eight per cent. We are looking at close to three times the cost of wages and salary in the food producing industry going into trade spend. Former Treasury Wine Estates boss David Dearie recently commented on the effect of this massive increase that we have seen in the trade spend and also on the concentrated nature of the Australian retail market.


In an article published in The Sydney Morning Herald on 27 November, Mr Dearie said there are 2,500 wineries in Australia, each with multiple brands, which means tens of thousands of brands are competing for shelf space, 70 per cent of which is owned by just two companies. He said the supermarkets were using their relative strength and the wine sector's weakened, fragmented state to demand thicker margins compared to other beverage categories. Unfortunately, he recommends that a level of consolidation in the wine sector is inevitable and vital to boost their bargaining power with the supermarket chains.


But no matter how concentrated our wine producers become, they will not be able to have the bargaining power to offset the strength of the supermarket chains—and this is exactly the opposite of what we need. We need to have thousands of wine producers out there innovating and experimenting, coming up with new ideas and trying new methods. We need entrepreneurial drive in our wine sector. But this is all being threatened—it is all being compromised—by the concentration we have in our retail sector. This shows the importance of the coalition's commitment to have a complete review of the Trade Practices Act. Maybe what we need is the Standard Oil option, because the danger and threat to our wine producers of a concentrated retail market cannot be understated. This bill is a welcome move—it is a step in the right direction—but we really need to be very careful that our retail sector is not damaging the production sector. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr JOYCE
 (New England—Minister for Agriculture and Deputy Leader of The Nationals) (16:46):  I rise to conclude the debate on the Grape and Wine Legislation Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013 and cognate legislation. The government is continuing to work to progress the merger of two statutory corporations—the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation and the Wine Australia Corporation. The merger of the two corporations will create a single whole of industry statutory authority—the Australian Grape and Wine Authority. The new authority will offer strategic benefits to the industry, such as improved leadership, service delivery and administrative efficiency. It will also enable a single board to make strategic links between research and development, investment initiatives and marketing. There will not be any changes made to the structure or amount of industry levies.


The legislation provides that all levies collected for a particular purpose, such as research and development, will only be used for that purpose by the new authority. There will also not be any changes to the existing regulatory, marketing and compliance roles of the Wine Australia Corporation under the new authority. The decision to implement the merger followed an industry proposal submitted in August 2012 by the two industry peak bodies: Wine Grape Growers Australia and the Winemakers Federation of Australia. The merger has widespread industry support and addresses discussions that have been raised over the last 20 years. Three bills have been presented for introduction—the Grape and Wine Legislation Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013, the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013 and the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (Australian Grape and Wine Authority) Bill 2013—and these bills provide the mechanism to create the Australian Grape and Wine Authority and implement the key elements of the reform.


I concur with the comments of my colleagues that what the wine industry does is allow those who have the work ethic to find themselves a small area of land and, if they work very hard, grow five or 10 acres of grapes—and, if they have a product that suits the palate, all other things being equal, it should sell and they should be able to make some money out of it. The only thing that can stand in their way is that they cannot market their product. If the marketplace has impediments, that means that, past the cellar door, the product has little hope of surviving.


I have been made aware of this by some colleagues in South Australia, who talk of excellent wines that one day they found were no longer on the shelves. The problem is that it is not the quality of the product that matters but the capacity to market the product. I am happy that the coalition has moved to a root and branch review of the Competition and Consumer Act, formerly known as the Trade Practices Act. There are a number of sections that are obviously very pertinent to this. One would have been—and I am sure that the members here are aware of it—what was otherwise known as section 51AC. It is now section 22 under the new Competition and Consumer Act. That section is about unconscionable conduct. We have to make sure that those in Australia who want to get ahead and who put their shoulder to the wheel and forfeit their role working for somebody else to set up their own business do not do so for no purpose such that there is no chance of ever receiving any benefit from what they do because they cannot sell the product.



An opposition member interjecting—




Mr JOYCE:
  Is there a custom and practice that we try and act civilly here, or is that not part of it?



An opposition member interjecting—




Mr JOYCE:
  No? Okay. Then you are right at home. It is good to see that on this side of the chamber people are looking after the people who want to participate in the commerce of our nation. We are making our best endeavours to try and make sure that the livelihoods of those in small business are looked after, while people on the other side mimic something from a zoo.



An opposition member interjecting—




Mr JOYCE:
  Do you know what always amazes me? I was thinking about this today. One of the greatest representations of the other side is Mr Paul Howes. He is the person who picks the—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Mitchell
):  Please stick to the bill.




Mr JOYCE:
  Mr Howes is very important, because he picks the prime ministers of our nation. He is the faceless man. He wrote a book about himself—in fact, he has written a few books about himself.



An opposition member interjecting—




Mr JOYCE:
  Don't you love the way they come out in chorus? One of the books that he wrote about himself was Confessions of a faceless man. He does not believe in 'ma and pa farms'. He said it. Why this is relevant is because these are predominantly ma and pa farms. Only Paul Howes and the AWU could turn farming into a pejorative; only they are capable of that. That should be known by the member for Blair, who would have a lot of ma and pa farms in his area. I expect him to stand up on behalf of those ma and pa farms in the Gatton valley and dismiss the comments of Paul Howes, because they are an absolute disgrace. Might I remind you that ABARES has said in excess of 95 per cent of farms in Australia are ma and pa farms, to use the Paul Howes pejorative. In fact, the Productivity Commission thinks it is more like 99 per cent. But those over there do not want ma and pa farms. They do not believe in the family business. They probably do not like ma and pa houses. They probably want to send us all back to the council flat in the midlands of England, because that is where it works best. The people from the Gatton valley will hold you to account for what you have said.




Mr Neumann:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. He is supposed to be summing up the bill. He has confessed that this is his first speech in the Federation Chamber. But he has to be relevant to the bill in this summation and not go on with the ridiculous stuff that he is doing now.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I thank the member for Blair. The minister will continue on the summing up of the bill.




Mr JOYCE:
  Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker. I can understand the sensitivities of someone who lives in the Gatton valley with a lot of ma and pa farms. I am glad that this will be on the Hansard so that I can send it to your local paper and show what people on your side of the political fence believe about the farming community. It is very important that we stand on behalf of the farming community, which apparently others have grown too sophisticated to support these days. They do not want ma and pa farms, which means, I suppose, that they do not want ma and pa houses. They do not want ma and pa small businesses. They just want to run down the farming community. They want to run down those in small business.




Mr Neumann:
  I rise on a point of order. This is not relevant in any way, shape or form to the summation of this legislation, which is a bipartisan approach to this issue. This is simply a rant and a rave by the minister, irrelevant to the summation of the bill.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The minister will continue on the summing up of the bill.




Mr JOYCE:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I shall do this because it is extremely relevant because, just like we are bringing greater efficiencies to the wine industry to reduce costs to try and keep family businesses on the family farm, it is very important that we note which side of the chamber does not believe in the family farm, does not believe in the right of a family enterprise to succeed—by their own statements. You know who else is in the AWU, the same union as Mr Paul Howes? It would have to be the Leader of the Opposition. That is who else is in it.




Ms Hall:
  On a point of order, Deputy Speaker. This is totally irrelevant.




Mr Joyce:
  You sound like you are about to cry! Come on, it's not that hard—it's all right.




Ms Hall:
  And the minister's behaviour is totally inappropriate. It is not an interjection; it is inappropriate behaviour.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Mitchell
):  I will ask the minister for the last time to sum up on the bill.




Mr JOYCE:
  I will come to a conclusion, because I know the sensitivities of what we have raised here today. It is always surprising when someone interjects how they don't like it when it comes back in the other direction. I commend the bill to the chamber.



Ms Hall interjecting—



Mr Joyce interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  You are skating close there, Minister, about disorderly conduct and also on reflecting on members in the chamber. The question is that the bill be now read a second time.


Question agreed to.


Bill read a second time.


Message from the Governor-General recommending appropriation announced.


Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (16:58): I am very aggrieved by the attitude of the coalition to the Ipswich Motorway in South-East Queensland. Before the election the coalition said one thing to the people of the western corridor and after the election they said a very different thing indeed. In fact, the coalition took a policy to the 2004 election of opposing the upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway. We supported of the upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway in the 2004 election. In the 2007 election, again the coalition opposed the upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway and Labor took a policy to that election to upgrade the Ipswich Motorway. In the 2010 election, the coalition took a policy to the electors in the electorates of Blair and Oxley opposing the continuation of the upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway, and Labor supported the continuation of the upgrade to the Ipswich Motorway.


That upgrade from Dinmore through to Darra has been completed, affording thousands and thousands of jobs to the people who worked on it, including to Indigenous apprentices. Nothing has improved the lifestyle and lives of people in the western corridor more than that $2.8 billion commitment from the former federal Labor government. In March 2008, then federal infrastructure minister, the member for Grayndler, was there to do the first sod-turning on the Dinmore to Goodna stretch of the Ipswich Motorway, which was completed six months ahead of schedule and under budget. It was the largest federally-funded road project in the history of the state of Queensland. It was completed on 15 May 2012.


Ninety thousand vehicles a day use that section of the Ipswich Motorway between Ipswich and Brisbane. Motorists and truck drivers have noticed the difference. The upgrade improved safety and delivered quicker and less frustrating driving conditions for motorists. It was important for small business, for large businesses, for farmers and for residents across the western corridor. I am proud to say that it was a project which I supported and campaigned on for three federal elections along with my friend the member for Oxley.


The Queensland department of main roads has shown the number of crashes resulting in hospitalisation on the Ipswich Motorway has dropped. The upgrade has been a life saver for motorists, with the new stretch of highway from Dinmore to Goodna being fatality free since its opening last year, according to The Queensland Times on 2 August 2013. Last year, 10 people were hospitalised after crashes on the upgraded road; so far this year one person has been hospitalised as at August 2013. That continued the downward trend in serious traffic conditions on the motorway since 2007 when two people were killed and 33 were hospitalised. Nothing has driven economic development and improved the lifestyles of people in the western corridor between Ipswich and Brisbane, the rural areas outside in the Brisbane Valley, the Somerset region, the Lockyer Valley and the Scenic Rim more than the Ipswich Motorway upgrade, initiated and done by the federal Labor government.


There is a final section on that Ipswich Motorway not in my electorate—from Darra to Rocklea. We provided $40 million to the Queensland government to undertake a study. It came back and it was going to cost about $2.6 billion to do the final section. We said that we would kick-start the construction. So in the May budget this year, we announced for the section from the Oxley roundabout to Suscatand Street an injection of $279 million to get it started. We did that because we thought it was important. We delivered that and we said we would do it from 2014-15 to 2018-19 in the Nation Building Program, along with many other projects to secure jobs growth and economic development not only in South-East Queensland but also across the whole of the state of Queensland. So this is a very important project.


What did the coalition do? Having opposed the upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway from Dinmore to Darra election after election, they said nothing about this until 21 August this year during the election campaign when they came out and said, 'Coalition matches ALP on Ipswich Motorway'—for the first time, a Damascus road conversion experience, having voted against the upgrade again and again and again in federal parliament.


But it did not last long. It could not take, despite the flattering and favourable headlines that TheQueensland Times gave the coalition about bringing forward funding. I had a look at the fiscal budget impact of coalition policies. We had put aside $279 million to kick-start the final stage. Have a look at the coalition's infrastructure package. The Prime Minister says that he is going to be not just the Indigenous Prime Minister but also the infrastructure Prime Minister. There was $279 million. So I went looking for it and I could not find it. There at 4.15 was the Ipswich Motorway, Darra to Rocklea. I expected to see $279 million, but what did I find? Nothing in the first year, $20 million in the next year, $20 million in the next year and $25 million in the final year—$65 million.


Now, having gone to an election saying they are going to put $279 million towards the final section of the Ipswich Motorway, the coalition's own fiscal budget impact of coalition policies says $65 million. Why should we be surprised? Having voted against Ipswich Motorway again and again and again—having campaigned against LNP and Liberal candidates who consistently oppose the Ipswich Motorway upgrade—I finally get one that says they will do it. And it did not last more than a few weeks, because this thing released just before the election shows $65 million, not $279 million. In May this year the Queensland LNP government said they would not come to the party to help with the construction of the Darra to Rocklea section of the Ipswich Motorway.


The Queensland Times, in the headline to an article on 30 November, said 'Ipswich M-Way upgrade is going nowhere fast'. Well, it is certainly not going anywhere under this government, because this government has gone back to form: opposing the Ipswich Motorway upgrade, in effect. We saw, election after election after election, opposition. And when John Howard was the Prime Minister, for 11 long and dark years, they did nothing—ignorance, idleness, inertia; that is their attitude to the Ipswich Motorway upgrade. And it was not just Ipswich; it was other road funding across the region. They opposed the upgrade of the Blacksoil Interchange currently under construction on the Warrego Highway. Go along the Warrego Highway and you will see it. It was opposed by the coalition.


So I am thoroughly and utterly aggrieved at the duplicity of the coalition on the Ipswich Motorway. But why should I be surprised? I really should not, because no-one is more anti-jobs when it comes to road infrastructure and lifestyle improvement than the coalition in the South-East Queensland corridor. Ten thousand people across the life of that project worked on the Ipswich Motorway upgrade. It has improved massively what has happened in this corridor. There are bikeways. There are 26 new or rebuilt bridges in the Dinmore to Goodna section. We have seen seven kilometres of service roads taking 20 per cent of the traffic off the motorway, 24 kilometres of shared pedestrian bikeways and cycleways, upgrading the motorway from two lanes to three lanes each way. But they could not see the benefit for South-East Queensland.


What the coalition does not understand is that this is the fastest-growing region in South-East Queensland. Ipswich Mayor Paul Pisasale said it brilliantly when he asked: 'What is $65 million going to do? Pay for helicopters to fly over and see all the traffic jams.' And that is the attitude of the coalition on the Ipswich Motorway: opposition and inertia, and they will do nothing. I guarantee that when I go to the next election I will face a candidate from those opposite—it will be about my fourth candidate—who will say one thing and do something different. If the coalition wins the next election, because that is their attitude to this corridor: opposition, opposition, opposition. (Time expired)
