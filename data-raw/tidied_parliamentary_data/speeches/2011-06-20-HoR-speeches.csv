Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (16:36):  I move:


That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Kennedy from moving the following motion—That this House:


(1) note the impact of the live animal export suspension on Northern Australia, the whole cattle industry and all those associated with it and directs the Government within two weeks to:


(a) deploy 10 Australian officials to Indonesia;


(b) direct these officials, along with Indonesia Government appointees, to immediately implement an upgrading of Indonesian abattoirs to meet humane standards currently met in Australia; and


(c) instruct Indonesian meatworkers on how to process to humane standards currently met in Australia;


(2) directs the Government to ship to Indonesia 60 stun guns with knocking boxes and video cameras within seven days, and to provide appropriate training;


(3) directs the Government as a matter of urgency to:


(a) immediately accredit Indonesia abattoirs that already meet Australian standards;


(b) begin accrediting Indonesian abattoirs that have been newly upgraded to meet humane standards currently met in Australia;


(c) implement supply chain traceability and auditing systems; and


(d) implement independent monitoring of conditions in Indonesian abattoirs;


(4) once the conditions in clause 3 are satisfied, calls on the Government to immediately ensure the resumption of trade with accredited Indonesian abattoirs that meet humane standards currently met in Australia; and


(5) directs the Federal Government to immediately commence an inquiry into the circumstances leading up to the Minister for Agriculture’s decision to suspend the live cattle export trade to Indonesia and that this inquiry include Meat and Livestock Australia and all other related instrumentalities and departmental division.


The government keeps assuring me that it is addressing this problem and acting to overcome it and ensure that we get a positive outcome. The government is saying, 'Trust me.' It appears that people have been told that now for nine years. I am sorry, we are not prepared to trust anyone. If you really want us to trust you, then you should be voting for this motion. Is there a single person in this parliament that believes that 60 stun-guns should not be on their way to Indonesia now? They should have been sent a week ago. On this side of the House, everyone would agree with that. Why won't the government support the motion? If you have got something to fear, then the people of Australia have something to fear. But, if you do not have anything to fear, then why not do this? It is very simple. 


I must stress the urgency of the motion because, from Thursday of last week when we lost this motion until now, thousands of cattle have been cruelly killed. It is not the fault of the people that voted for this—the people on this side of the House. This side of the House, and I refer to the opposition, have got plenty to answer for. They knew about this for six years and did nothing about it. But give them their due: they are doing something about it now. We applaud them for doing that. I cannot see any reason why the government would not agree to this. They are being told stories by the MLA, but the real story here is that the MLA and the departmental officials that are responsible for this are doing a big con act. 'Oh, this is very complicated,' they say. It ain't complicated—you send the cattle up there to Jakarta, you put them in the back of a hired utility and you say, 'Hey fellas, we've got some ratbags back in Australia we've got to make happy; would you please do it this way?' You have to put it that way. Since it is a hell of a lot easier to do it with a stun-gun than the way they are doing it at present, I am sure they would be more than happy to agree. But do not let anyone stand up and have the hypocrisy to say that they are against cruelty when they are defending the continuation of the killing of cattle in this inhumane manner. 


That is the situation. If you are seriously worried about animal welfare, then stop it—this motion stops it. It forces the government to do something, instead of listening to the people who are responsible for this situation and are now advising the government that they have it all under control. The government is accepting that. The government has got to realise that, while it might be accepting it, the voting public are not accepting it. The voting public are listening to the things that I am saying in here because they know that they are true. They know that nothing has been done by this government to ensure that a single ox is killed humanely in Indonesia—nothing. The same people are giving out the same stories that they have given out for nine years. If the stun-guns do not get up there in the next two or three weeks, then if I was a betting man I would bet that Indonesia will bring in cattle from Brazil. The minute they start to do that we will be finished—we will never get back in there again. 


Someone mentioned foot-and-mouth disease. Indonesia is provisionally a free country and most of Brazil is provisionally free, so they do not run into that problem. There are those of us who argue that there are parts of Indonesia—with its 1,000 islands—that are not provisionally free, but we will not go into that today. My colleague the honourable member for Denison does not have the same view as I do about the foreseeable future, but he absolutely believes that cattle should not be cruelly killed and every day that goes by more and more of them will be killed.


The government is saying, 'Trust me.' It is listening to people working for the MLA and people working for the government that are saying, 'We have got it under control; we are addressing it.' That is the story we have been told for the last nine years. The honourable member for Denison and I thank very much the opposition, and particularly the Leader of the Opposition, for taking a strong stand on this in spite of the fact that there is a downside for them insofar as criticism for the past will be sheeted home to them. But forget about the past. Let us look to the future; let us do something about it. 


We cannot get any information, so we do not know how many cattle are in the pipeline. I am told it is in the tens of thousands. Someone told me 30,000; another person told me it might be nearer 100,000. One of the mayors in my own area said that a number of cattlemen are now on suicide-watch. This place just does not seem to care how many farmers commit suicide in this country. I have said again and again no-one cares about a farmer committing suicide every four days in this country. Not one single thing that I can think of has been done to allay that figure, except sending counsellors out. My experience with counsellors—God bless them; I love them—is that I really appreciate the work that they are doing but they are almost irrelevant to the problem. That has been my experience with counselling, and I do not mean to speak badly about counsellors. But I am told by one of my mayors, who is down here for the conference today and who came to see me, that the police have rung up to officially inform him that we have a number of graziers on suicide watch at this moment.



So the government says, 'Trust me.' That is what is being said here: 'Trust me.' That is the answer to the problem! Has one single stun-gun, video camera or knocking box left Australia? No. We know that for an absolute fact and we are into the first fortnight. If they say they care about the ox, I am sorry but you have lost that argument. We already know you do not care because you have not sent a single stun-gun up there. If you cared, you would have been sending stun-guns up there the next day. But you do not care, as evidenced here again today. So we are giving very specific directions. From the point of view of the member for Denison, this will hold the line until he goes to what he believes is the right thing to do, which is cutting off the export trade. I would disagree with that, of course— (Time expired)

Mr WILKIE
 (Denison) (16:46):  I second the motion moved by the member for Kennedy, which is entirely consistent with that part of my private member's bill which calls for the immediate and urgent implementation of safeguards in Indonesia so the resumption of our live animal export and trade with that country can occur straightaway. I will speak more to this issue tonight when I table that bill.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (16:47): I rise to speak against this suspension of standing orders, as occurred last Thursday. The member for Kennedy and the member for Denison are two members of this chamber I have a great deal of respect for. I respectfully submit to the member for Kennedy that the clear procedures set out by this parliament to facilitate private members' business being dealt with are greater than any that have ever been made in the history of this parliament. The fact of the matter is that we will enable and facilitate private members' discussions this evening. They are all on motions or bills that have been put forward in accordance with the procedures that have been worked out. Everyone has the same level playing field and the same ways of operating in this matter.


The truth is that, in doing this, the government want to be consistent. We are ensuring that everyone knows what the procedures are. You put a motion on notice or you give notice of an intention to present a bill. It is then considered by the Selection Committee and it is dealt with on the next occasion. In the normal proceedings that would be on the following Monday evening. We then have a debate. If there is a need for further discussion then that occurs. It is then listed for a vote in accordance with the procedures of the Selection Committee in a way in which everyone knows the outcome. We have, since 2007, operated in a way that has facilitated business before this parliament being dealt with. When the government introduces legislation, it comes into this parliament and gives notice. We then have a second reading speech. Debate is then suspended after the second reading speech and the legislation is then able to be considered by the parliament in the next week.


If it is the case that people can come into this parliament and move a suspension of standing orders or something that they have not given notice of, then we will simply not be able to facilitate the proper consideration of either legislation or motions which are moved by members of this parliament. The fact is that we have had a range of suspensions moved. We barely get through a day of this parliament without a suspension of standing orders being moved by those opposite.




Dr Southcott:
  You've got your priorities wrong.




Mr ALBANESE:
  Some of the members opposite speak about our priorities. We heard that from the shadow finance minister, who could not actually call a division on the budget bills he was opposing. We heard from the shadow finance minister that he wants to change the determinations on the processes for the consideration of budget bills.



Opposition members interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Honourable members on my left will display a modicum of discipline.




Mr ALBANESE:
  Those processes were determined unanimously by this House. It is quite extraordinary. The suspensions of standing orders have already cost this parliament the consideration of 124 questions. The fact is that the suspensions moved by those opposite, when the Leader of the Opposition has suspended 46 per cent of question times, and at the end of last week the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Kennedy moved suspensions of standing orders—




Mr Pyne:
  That's five minutes.




Mr ALBANESE:
  If you were here for more than five minutes, you might know that I am speaking to the suspension of standing orders. I am actually speaking to the motion, which is about the procedures of this House. The motion is not about the substance of the motion that the member for Kennedy is seeking to move; the motion is about the suspension of standing orders. I read in today's paper that we were going to have a bill considered in this House at 10 am this morning. Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition came into the chamber at 10 am, but if he did he would have been the only one who was here. He shows no attention to the detail. That is the problem of those opposite: no attention to detail. All they want to do is come before this parliament and complain, say what they oppose but not say what they are for, like the walking vuvuzelas that they are. Once again we see their opportunism on show for all to see. They have had a different position on live cattle exports every single day throughout the past two weeks. With regard to the issue of plebiscites, I just wonder how a plebiscite would go before the Australian public of all those who support exporting live cattle to Indonesia. I just wonder how that would go, if we are going to go down that sort of road.


Of course, those opposite have never got over their loss in August last year. What we are seeing played out before the Australian public is the longest dummy spit in the history of Australian politics. The fact of the matter is they want to disrupt the parliament at each and every opportunity. It does not matter whether it is Greens motions about asylum seekers or motions from the member for Kennedy or anything else; their one priority is disruption. Do you know who said, 'Disrupting the House is not a sign of a disciplined opposition; disrupting the House is a sign of a desperate opposition'? It was the Leader of the Opposition on 21 June 2006.




Mr Christensen:
  Point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: for the last two minutes, the Leader of the House has been talking about the opposition, our policies and everything but the substance of the motion. I ask you to draw him to speak to the motion.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. Peter Slipper
):  The member will resume his seat. We are debating whether standing orders will be suspended and I encourage the Leader of the House to observe closely the terms of the motion before the chair.




Mr ALBANESE:
  I am, Mr Deputy Speaker, because what I am speaking in favour of is orderly proceedings in this House of Representatives, not this disruptive behaviour which the Leader of the Opposition himself said on 21 June 2006 is a sign of a desperate opposition. He went on to say this:


What we have seen from members opposite consistently in the course of this year but particularly over the last few weeks is consistent, deliberate, planned and premeditated conduct to disrupt this House.


That is what the Leader of the Opposition said on 21 June 2006 and there were never wiser words said by the Leader of the Opposition. That is why the government will be opposing this and why the member for Corio will be adding to comments opposing this legislation. The fact of the matter is—



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr ALBANESE:
  We have had two speakers in favour. Now they want to stop two speakers in favour and two speakers against, so determined are the great democrats opposite, so desperate are they. The fact of the matter is that this should not be supported. This should be debated next week. (Time expired)



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I now call the Leader of the Opposition.




Mr Albanese:
  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: we had a mover of this proposition. We then had a seconder of the proposition. It is normally the case in procedures before this House that we have two speakers in favour and it is important that we have two speakers against.



Opposition members interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! Honourable members on my left will remain silent while I am listening to the point of order put forward by the Leader of the House.




Mr Albanese:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. House of Representatives practice clearly allows for speakers from either side to be equal. That is the way that we deal with things in this chamber. We had the member for Kennedy put his position. We then had the seconder, the member for Denison, contribute to the debate. We then had me, as the Leader of the House, outline why there should be opposition and now it is important that—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The Leader of the House will resume his seat, as will the Leader of the Opposition. My understanding is that debate alternates from one side to the other. I have already given the call to the Leader of the Opposition, who now has the call.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (16:58):  It is absolutely necessary that standing orders be suspended because cattle are dying and farmers are losing their livelihoods—




Mr Fitzgibbon:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I did try to seek the call before the Leader of the Opposition got to his feet, for good reason: I did not want to interrupt his contribution—



Opposition members interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! I do thank the Chief Government Whip for raising that point of order. If I did not see him, I apologise. However, I have already given the call to the Leader of the Opposition, who has the call.




Mr ABBOTT:
  Thank you very much. This is—




Mr Fitzgibbon:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, on a further point of order: in response to the intervention from the member for Dawson, I hoped that before the opposition leader commenced his address you might invite the members of the opposition to remain quiet while we hear his feigned indignation.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I do admire the, shall we say, original approach of the Chief Government Whip. He has now resumed his seat, which is a good thing because I have given the call to the Leader of the Opposition.




Mr Albanese:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, a point of order relating to standing order 62: I was concerned that the member for Paterson was blocking the view of the Leader of the Opposition. According to standing order 62 'Members moving in the chamber':


A Member in the Chamber must:


(a) take his or her seat promptly;


…   …   …


I ask you to enforce that, Mr Deputy Speaker.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I do thank the Leader of the House for raising that point of order. I have given the call to the Leader of the Opposition. Let me say: if I hear any other points of order which are taken frivolously the members who take those points of order will have an hour in the sin bin.




Mr ABBOTT:
  There are currently 1,900 cattle at Port Hedland in Western Australia. Those cattle are owned by an Australian company and they are going to be exported to an Australian owned and operated abattoir in Indonesia. That abattoir—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. The time for this debate has expired. The question is that the motion for suspension of standing orders moved by the honourable member for Kennedy be agreed to. I put that question: all those in favour say aye, to the contrary no. I think the noes have it.



Opposition members:  The ayes have it.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! A division is required. Ring the bells.




The bells being rung—




Opposition members:  There was only one no!



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I heard more than one no.


Question put:

Ms SAFFIN
 (Page) (17:18):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the third report of the committee for 2011, entitled Referrals made February to March 2011.I ask leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report.


Leave granted. 




Ms SAFFIN:
  I thank the House. On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the third report of 2011, addressing referrals made from February to March 2011. This report deals with three inquiries with a total estimated cost of $551.9 million. In each case the committee has recommended the House of Representatives agree to the works proceeding. The report also includes the committee's findings relating to a budget overrun in a previously approved work.


The new works are the proposed development and construction of housing for Defence in Muirhead, Northern Territory, the proposed upgrade of the electrical reticulation system at Robertson Barracks, also in the Northern Territory, and the proposed redevelopment of the Australian Defence Force Academy in the Australian Capital Territory. The previously approved work is the construction and renovation of housing at Larrakeyah Barracks in Darwin, Northern Territory, approved by this House in 2009.


I will deal first with the Muirhead housing proposal. This is a very large project which would essentially develop an entirely new suburb in the northern suburbs of Darwin. The committee toured the site and visited a house that is similar to the kind of housing that Defence Housing Australia will build in the suburb. Defence Housing Australia intends to build on 279 lots and sell the other 651 developed but vacant lots.


The committee's major concern with this project is the lack of social and cultural planning. Witnesses at the hearing raised questions about the way in which the new suburb would integrate with existing suburbs and how the design and layout of Muirhead would anticipate the social and cultural needs of its future residents. DHA has not undertaken its own planning to address these issues, and the committee has recommended that it do so for this project. The committee has also recommended that DHA do this from now on for all developments of more than 50 lots.


The committee was able to visit a house that incorporates the design principles that DHA will be employing at Muirhead. In particular, the house was designed to be passively cooled by the prevailing breezes in the area, especially in the dry season. The committee is pleased that DHA is making an effort to utilise cost-effective and cost-neutral design options that make houses both more comfortable and cheaper to cool. At the house we inspected it really made a significant difference to the temperature, as it should to the energy use in that house. DHA told us that it will be the standard it will build from now on. It is something that is worthy of being incorporated in other developments. Moving to the Defence works in the report, the committee considered the electrical reticulation system upgrade at Robertson Barracks in Darwin and the redevelopment of the Australian Defence Force Academy in Canberra. The Robertson Barracks project will ensure there is reliable power to the base, even if the external power supply is interrupted. The project will also provide for additional capacity for future base developments, being aware that there are people who also reside on base. The Australian Defence Force Academy redevelopment proposes new and refurbished facilities that will enable contemporary pedagogy—it is not just about pedagogy, but it is partly about that—as well as providing additional teaching space and improved administrative areas. A major part of the proposal involves the demolition of Adams Hall—that is the large hall where a quite a significant number of public events take place each year—and  the construction of a new multi-venue auditorium in its place. The committee sought Defence's assurances that there was no way to reuse the existing hall, and the committee is satisfied that the demolition is based on sound consideration of all possible options. The committee is particularly keen to see the chaplains' space redeveloped, as it is woefully inadequate at the moment. This is very important, given the substantial pastoral care provided by ADFA's chaplains.


The final chapter in this report deals with a project approved by this House on 26 November 2009, the Larrakeyah housing project in Darwin. In early 2011 Defence Housing Australia wrote to the committee to inform it that the budget for the project was insufficient to complete the full scope of works. The committee held a public hearing with DHA on 21 March 2011 to seek further information about how this situation arose. As outlined in its report, the committee is not satisfied with the reasons given by DHA for the budget overrun. In particular, the Darwin market conditions and the project's complexity, cited by DHA as reasons for the budget shortfall, were entirely foreseeable by DHA. The original budget process was not sufficiently rigorous and the committee expects DHA to ensure that this situation does not arise again.


I would like to thank members and senators for their work in relation to these inquiries. And I would like to thank the secretariat, who are in the chamber today. In particular, I would like to thank Senators Troeth and Forshaw for their long service to the committee, as they will both be leaving the Senate—and, therefore, the committee—at the end of this month. I particularly draw attention to Senator Troeth's role as my deputy and acknowledge her counsel and common sense, her fairness and her understanding of the processes, policies and procedures of the committee. I found her input invaluable and I shall certainly miss her. And Senator Forshaw's experience, which is wide-ranging, including of the Senate and a whole range of matters that came before the committee, I also found invaluable, and I will miss him. I commend the report to the House.

"Simpkins, Luke, MP",LP,2011-06-20,"



Mr SIMPKINS
 (Cowan) (17:26):  I welcome the opportunity to speak for a while longer on the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011. I will not delay the House too much. When my contribution was suspended last week, I had spoken for some time about the privations and the adversity that our former prisoners of war had endured in the Second World War, with particular emphasis on the prisoners of the Japanese Imperial Army. I also spoke, as everyone has in this debate, about the need to acknowledge and express our appreciation of those veterans, those prisoners of war. The privations and the suffering that they have endured make them noteworthy of such considerations, as we have provided in the past as a coalition government and as the parliament should see passed today.


When we look upon the contributions made to this country, it is right that we have a special regard for all those who have served in uniform. Greater love hath no man than to lay down his life for his country. And it is perfectly true of those who have served and those who continue to serve in uniform for our nation that they were prepared, and our current soldiers are prepared, to lay down their lives for our nation. It is therefore right that they should get appropriate consideration for the commitment that they have made. Serving in the Navy, the Army and the Air Force is not a normal job; it is taking up a life where the risks are greater than in other sectors within our community.


It is therefore important as well that, when we speak of the entitlements of our veterans, we must also have regard for everyone who has served our country. What last week revealed was that, although we may have bipartisan support for measures such as those that apply for prisoners of war, when it actually comes to the need for fairer indexation of military superannuation pensions, the comparison is very stark indeed. There are some that oppose fair indexation. The government, the Greens and Independent Senator Xenophon oppose fair indexation. Unfortunately, the Greens live in a fool's paradise where you can get by in the modern world without a defence force, when the reality is that sometimes you just have to fight, like those diggers, sailors and airmen did in past wars, because there is just no other option. So there are those who are opponents of a fair and just military superannuation system. Again, unfortunately it seems as though the government has failed to deliver what it promised in 2007 in the time since. It is really about time that fair indexation is introduced. We have learnt. We are committed to the course. I am committed to fair indexation.


I thank my constituents for their advice and their feedback on these sorts of matters. I thank particularly a regular email contributor to my knowledge, Mr Terry 'Maddog' Malligan, from Madeley. I thank the members of the Ballajura RSL, who are holding their annual quiz night this coming Saturday night. I wish them all the best for that event and I will see them there. I thank the members of the Wanneroo-Joondalup RSL. In fact, I thank all the veterans and the ex-service men and women who have contacted me to tell me of their views on this matter.


I have looked through this bill and I have looked at what it aims to achieve. I say that we certainly owe a debt of gratitude to those who have served under the most hideous of conditions as prisoners of war. I also acknowledge all those who have worn the uniform and have been prepared to do what needs to be done for this nation's best interests. When I look at what has happened in the past and at the debt of gratitude that we really owe to all those who have served in uniform, not just prisoners of war, I look forward to fair indexation of superannuation being addressed. Unfortunately, it would appear that it will not be addressed until we are returned to government. I look forward to that at the earliest opportunity so that the coalition can provide full and fair indexation, in accordance with our last policy and in accordance with the wishes of the uniformed community, past and present, within our great country. This is what we owe them. This is what we need to come through with. We look forward to delivering that in the future.

"Elliot, Justine, MP",ALP,2011-06-20,"



Mrs ELLIOT
 (Richmond—Parliamentary Secretary for Trade) (17:31):  I am very pleased to be speaking on this bill before the House today, the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011, which gives effect to the government's budget commitments to the veterans community through three measures. The first measure is the new $27.2 million prisoner-of-war recognition supplement, which provides former POWs with an extra $500 per fortnight in recognition of their very special sacrifice and service. The second measure consists of amendments to compensation-offsetting provisions in the Veterans' Entitlements Act. This measure will help ensure equity for a claimant who is entitled to compensation for a level of incapacity under two schemes. The third measure will rationalise the temporary incapacity allowance and loss of earnings allowance to improve targeting of allowances for veterans and members who lose wages during periods of short-term incapacity.


I am very proud to speak in relation to this bill, to speak about this government's record in honouring our veterans and also to speak today about honouring all of those service men and women for the sacrifices they have made for our country. I particularly commend the measure to provide the prisoner-of-war recognition supplement. This measure is an acknowledgment of the commitment and obligation we owe to former Australian POWs for the sacrifices experienced by them in the service of our country. The POW recognition supplement is a $500 fortnightly payment made to all surviving Australian POWs of Japan and Europe from the Second World War and from the Korean War. It is estimated that approximately 900 former POWs will benefit from the payments.


The Australian experience of imprisonment during times of war dates back over 110 years to the time of the Boer War. Whilst individual stories vary greatly in the level of hardship and deprivation faced during times of internment across all conflicts, all of our POWs have some shared common experiences from their impris­onment, particularly including isolation from family and friends, the constant struggle for life, and the need to depend on their mates and comrades for daily survival and to maintain hope in such horrendous circumstances.


I turn first to the First World War. For Australia, as for many nations, the First World War remains the most costly conflict in terms of deaths and casualties. From a population of fewer than five million, 416,809 men enlisted, of whom over 60,000 were killed and 156,000 wounded. More than 4,070 Australians spent the war as prisoners. The Gallipoli campaign saw the first of 217 Australians captured by Ottoman forces. On the battlefields of the Western Front, 3,853 Australian troops were taken prisoner by German forces, most of them held in Germany. A third of these Australian prisoners were captured on 11 April 1917 at the First Battle of Bullecourt in northern France. A number of Australian airmen were also shot down and captured by the Germans. By the time of the armistice, signed in November 1918, a total of 395 Australians had died during their imprisonment in the First World War.


In the Second World War, from 3 September 1939 almost a million Australians, both men and women, served in campaigns against Germany and Italy in Europe, the Mediterranean and North Africa, as well as against the Japanese in South-East Asia and other parts of the Pacific. Over 30,000 would never return home. More than 30,000 were taken as prisoners of war. One of the most significant differences between this war and the First World War was the number of Australian troops captured. Almost eight times the number captured in the First World War were captured in the Second World War, the majority of these as prisoners of the Japanese. The Japanese treatment of its POWs is one of the darkest chapters in Australia's wartime history. In fact, it is difficult for many of us to comprehend how incredibly tragic an experience it was. Of the almost 9,000 Australians who were held in Italian and German camps and experienced varying degrees of mistreatment and brutality, some 250 men died during the war. Over 22,000 Australians became prisoners of war of the Japanese in South-East Asia. Almost 15,000 of the Australians were captured in Singa­pore, while the other principal Australian prisoner-of-war groups were captured in Java, Timor and Ambon. The most notorious and well-known names in the Australia's World War II experience are Changi, Borneo and the Thai-Burma Railroad. In fact, the name Changi is synonymous with the suffering of Australian prisoners of the Japanese during the Second World War. More than 100,000 Allied POWs were crammed into the Changi camp after the fall of Singapore. From May 1942, large work parties began to be sent out of Changi to work on projects such as the Thai-Burma Railway and in other work camps throughout Asia. In February 1942 there were around 15,000 Australians in Changi. By mid-1943 fewer than 2,500 remained. 


Australian POWs in Borneo were held in four main camps: Sandakan, Kuching, Labuan and Jesselton. Of these, Sandakan in North Borneo contained the majority of Australians. In January 1945, when the Japanese feared an Allied invasion of Borneo, they began a series of forced marches from Sandakan to Ranau—a distance of 260 kilometres along jungle tracks. Weak and sick mistreated prisoners starved to death on the way as food became scarcer and scarcer. They had no medical supplies and the terrain was muddy and treacherous. If a prisoner collapsed and could not get up, he was usually shot dead by the Japanese. More marches followed until all POWs had left Sandakan. By the end of the war only six Australians of the 2,500 Allied POWs held at Sandakan had survived this horrific ordeal. 


Whilst Allied POWs were held across Asia, it is those camps along the Thai-Burma Railway during 1943 which remain most resonant for Australians in the Second World War POW experience; largely due to the fact that 9,500 Australians worked on the railway and nearly 7,000 survived to tell the story. The railway stretched 421 kilometres from Thailand to Burma, the aim being to provide the Japanese with a land access route from South-East Asia to supply their large army in Burma. Some 62,000 Australian, British and Dutch POWs, as well as a smaller group of American POWs and estimates of 270,000 Asian indentured labourers, occupied camps along the length of the line, moving from one site to the next as work progressed. The daily deprivations, misery and humiliation of this work are indeed impossible to comprehend. Some 12,000 Allied POWs died on the railway, including 2,646 Australians. The building of the railway exacted such a brutal toll due to the harsh treatment of the prisoners of war, the prevalence of disease, the terrible state of their health, the terrain through which they had to build, the climate of torrential monsoon rain, the extreme heat and the lack of adequate engineering tools and supplies. Though the railway was completed in mid-October 1943, it was never used. Almost as soon as it was completed it was damaged by Allied bombing. Today only sections of it survive. 


My great-uncle Harry Staples, of the 8th Division, died as a prisoner of war on the Thai-Burma Railway. A number of years ago I went to Kanchanburi in Thailand to the railway and walked through Hellfire Pass to see the site where he and so many of our POWs suffered and died. Visiting the war graves highlighted for me how important it is as individuals, families, communities and a nation that we never forget the sacrifices that so many have made, and how important it is that we come together not just on days like Remembrance Day and Anzac Day but at all times to remember their sacrifice. 


When we turn to civilian POWs, almost 1,500 Australian civilians spent the war in captivity, out of about 130,000 civilians interned by the Japanese. Australian army nurses were another group imprisoned. On 14 February 1942, following the fall of Singapore, 65 nurses were attempting to return to Australia on the ship Vyner Brooke. Twelve drowned when the vessel was torpedoed and 21 were massacred after reaching Bangka Island. The sole survivor from that was Nurse Vivian Bullwinkel. The other surviving nurses from the Vyner Brooke were imprisoned in a civilian camp in Sumatra. Eight of the 32 died in captivity. Although they were not made to work as the male POWs were, they were subject to many of the same deprivations and humiliations at the hands of the Japanese. Six Australian military nurses captured at Rabaul in January 1942 were sent to Japan and all survived the war.


The Korean War began on 25 June 1950 and came to an end with the signing of an armistice on 27 July 1953. Australian casualties numbered more than 1,500, of whom 339 were killed. During the Korean War, 30 Australian servicemen were captured by North Korean or Chinese forces. Twenty-four of those taken prisoner were serving with the Australian Army, and six members of the Royal Australian Air Force were also captured. Of the 30 Australians, only one, Private HW Madden, died whilst imprisoned. Madden was posthumously awarded the George Cross. Prisoners in Korea suffered many of the same trials as those of the Japanese—neglect, hunger and brutality—but also the biting cold of a Korean winter, where temperatures could go as low as minus 60 degrees Celsius. 


By introducing this new payment for surviving Australian prisoners of war, the government's bill recognises the hardships these people endured and recognises the massive sacrifice they made in their service to our country. It is important that we always continue to remember that service and the sacrifices made by our past and also our serving defence forces, who paid the ultimate price. I would like to take the opportunity to commend all of the wonderful veterans groups in my electorate who work so tirelessly to ensure that we as communities continue to remember the great commitment of all of our veterans. I am fortunate to have a very large veterans community and wonderful individuals who do great work with veterans and in many other groups as well. 


I say in conclusion that whilst we reflect upon service in previous conflicts we must of course also remember those serving our nation currently. It is very important to remember the commitment that they have made. I would like to finish by remarking on the event last Friday in my electorate at Kingscliff where the funeral was held for Sapper Rowan Robinson, who died on 6 June while serving in Afghanistan. Sapper Robinson grew up in Kingscliff and around the North Coast, and his funeral was attended by many family and friends who recalled wonderful fond memories of him. I would like to say that our thoughts and prayers are with his family as we remember his sacrifice and his service to our nation.

"Griggs, Natasha, MP",CLP,2011-06-20,"



Mrs GRIGGS
 (Solomon) (17:44):  I rise to speak on the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011. This bill gives effect to a number of veterans' affairs 2011 budget measures: firstly, it will create a prisoner-of-war recognition supplement, providing a $500 fortnightly payment to former Australian prisoners of war; secondly, it will clarify and affirm the original intention of the compensation-offsetting policy in respect of pensions payable under parts 2 and 4 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986; and, thirdly, schedule 3 rationalises temporary incapacity allowances for veterans.


Reviewing the measures in more detail, specifically schedule 1, the prisoner-of-war recognition supplement, under this measure from 20 September this year former Australian prisoners of war will receive a $500 payment each fortnight from the Australian government. This payment will be made to former military personnel and civilians alike who were interned as prisoners of war during either World War II or the Korean War. These supplement payments will not be taxable and will not affect a former prisoner of war's present access to income support via the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 and the Social Security Act, or compensation payments under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. 


There are over 900 Australians known to the Department of Veterans' Affairs as ex-prisoners of war. All of them will automatically receive the payment from 6 October.


The coalition has a strong record of providing assistance to Australia's ex-prisoners of war. In 2001, all former Japanese POWs received a $25,000 tax-free ex gratia payment from the Australian government. In 2003, former Korean POWs received similar payments, as did former German and Italian POWs in 2007.


This additional supplement payment is welcomed by the 900 Australian ex-POWs and their families who are eligible. As I indicated earlier, schedule 2 of this bill seeks to clarify the operation of compensation provisions under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. Compensation offsetting is a longstanding principle under Australia's repatriation system. The fundamental principle to this system is that payments of compensation are for incapacity. The coalition believes that the changes proposed by this schedule should be investigated by a Senate committee. We will seek to refer the bill so that the ex-service community will have the opportunity to have a say and provide input into the proposed changes.


Finally, schedule 3 of the bill rationalises the manner in which incapacity payments are to be paid in accordance with the act.


The changes provided by this bill remove the temporary incapacity allowance. In place of receiving this payment, a veteran will be entitled to seek access to the loss-of-earnings allowance or LOE, an allowance paid where the veteran accrues an actual loss of earnings as a result of hospitalisation or treatment of accepted disabilities or illnesses. The coalition is not opposed to this rationalisation and calls on the government to ensure the changes are appropriately and effectively communicated to the veterans and ex-service community.


A further issue I address, relevant to this bill, is that of the Anzac centenary. Unfortunately, no money was provided in the budget for the commemoration of the Anzac centenary, a point I find deeply disappointing. So I ask: when will this government make a firm financial commitment to the Anzac centenary in 2015? The significance of this centenary cannot be understated. Communities looking forward and beginning to plan for this most important national commemorative event require certainty in terms of funding and the level of federal support.


I have on a number of occasions this year in the House mentioned the commemorative services held to mark the 69th anniversary of the bombing of Darwin during World War II. The bombings are a very significant event in the history of Darwin, the Northern Territory and Australia. Commemoration of this event has enormous significance for those who were present in Darwin during the air raids. Furthermore, the significance of this commemoration retains its importance to today's Territorians and to past and present personnel of the Australian Defence Force.


Planning is well underway for next year's 70th anniversary of the bombing-of-Darwin commemorations. Earlier this year, Senator Crossin called for the bombing of Darwin to be marked by a public holiday. I understand the sentiment; however, I am not here advocating for a public holiday; I am here asking that the government appropriately acknowledge this event as one of national significance and that some funding be provided for commemoration of this important historical event.


While the coalition welcomes the government's belated funding increase to the Australian War Memorial, the coalition remains concerned that no funding to redevelop the World War I galleries has been identified. The coalition has committed funds towards this work to facilitate its completion ahead of the 2015 Anzac centenary commemorations. It is very disappointing that the Gillard Labor government acted to increase the Australian War Memorial funding only after significant pressure from the community and from the coalition.


I have been contacted by the president of my local branch of the National Servicemen's Association of Australia, Mr Ivan Walsh, who wrote to the Department of Veterans' Affairs over seven months ago requesting permission to erect a permanent flagpole at the Adelaide River War Cemetery. It is extremely disappointing that these men who served our country are yet to receive a response from the department regarding a simple request for permission to erect a flagpole as a permanent feature for ongoing commemorative services at the Adelaide River War Cemetery. I seek leave to table the letter.


Leave granted.




Mrs GRIGGS:
  I ask if the minister could please look into this issue, as the Adelaide River War Cemetery is a very significant commemorative area and it is also in his electorate. As the years have gone by, there seems to be more focus on Adelaide River War Cemetery for commemorative events. They are asking permission to have the flagpole installed before the national Remembrance Day in November. I would really appreciate it if the minister could investigate this and provide an answer to the committee. Another matter of disapp­ointment is that the Gillard Labor government will cut $8 million from grassroots veterans advocacy funding over the forward estimates. I know that a review of the advocacy funding, released 12 months ago, did not recommend a cut in funding, which makes this recent announcement even harder to understand. Veterans services provided by volunteers from within our local community, particularly services to those new veterans returning from recent conflicts and their families, will definitely be impacted. My electorate represents Defence Force constituents who have served overseas, are still serving overseas or are due to be deployed. From the perspective of the electorate of Solomon, the issues relevant to veterans are of significant concern. This government must ensure that it looks after our defence personnel both during and after their service to this wonderful country of ours. The ex-servicemen community had no warning that cuts to advocacy funding were likely or about the impact of having to compete for a smaller funding pool. It is not good enough. This cut could also jeopardise the provision of assistance to younger veterans and their families, who may seek advice from volunteer veteran pension and welfare officers about claims for compensation. As I mentioned earlier this year in this place, the coalition remains the only party in the parliament committed to military superannuation reform.


I take this opportunity to touch on Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits and DFRB fair indexation. The Labor Party and the Greens stand condemned for their failure to support the coalition's bill to provide fair indexation to DFRDB and DFRB superannuants. This is simply not good enough. The coalition believes the current indexation arrangements are unfair. The opposition of the Labor-Greens alliance means that the only way to deliver these reforms is through the election of a coalition government. I reaffirm comments made earlier by my colleagues in this place that the coalition is committed to Australian veterans.

"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,2011-06-20,"



Mr ADAMS
 (Lyons) (17:54):  It is a great pleasure to speak on the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011. I say to the honourable member for Solomon, who thought to raise in the debate on this very good bill political issues about super­annuation for the people presently serving in the military, that there were 11 years during which some of us made representation to the previous government about this, and nothing occurred. It is a pretty poor effort to come in here and start raising this on a veterans bill when we have some pretty good news here for veterans and ex-prisoners-of-war. The member may want to get into some of the history as to why her party did not deliver over those 11 years.


This bill gives effect to the veterans' affairs 2011 budget measures, which will create a prisoner of war recognition supplement, clarifying and affirming the original intention of the compensation offsetting policy in relation to disability pensions, rationalised temporary incapacity allowance and the loss of earnings allowance.


I first became aware of prisoners of war because of my friends Philip and John Green, whom I grew up with and went to school with and who are both still my friends. John has moved away a bit, but Philip is still a great mate. Their fathers were both prisoners of war. As boys we talked about this and discussed it, and I met their fathers, who had gone through that terrible experience. They were both in Timor when it fell—I think Sparrow Force was among the forces that were there as our forward defence before the Japanese landed about 22,000 troops, on their forward movement into that area—and they were taken prisoner.


Georgie Green, Philip's father, spent his time as a prisoner of war on the Burma railway, and I think Teddy—John's father—spent some time in the bicycle camp in Timor and later in that same area. That was not a very pleasant experience for them. In later years George was very pleased to visit Hellfire Pass and take his grandson there to show him the places where he had had to endure some harsh treatment and was able to survive that. I think it was just about trying to show those at home what they had endured, where they had endured it and how they had survived it. These were guys who never spoke of or glorified anything about war and were always conscious of that in their activities.


Georgie and Teddy were great role models and great men who had a lot of respect in the community. The community in which I grew up, the Longford community, had an RSL which was built in 1947 by the returning veterans. The annual Anzac Day sports event was a pretty well-known event right throughout Tasmania. Most of us growing up in the 1950s and going to school attended those sports days. We learnt what Anzac Day was about and what remembrance was about, and that worked very well. I can remember Georgie Green presenting me with an ice-cream after I had run a footrace. Footraces were never my great strength, but I can remember getting an ice-cream from Georgie Green, so it was a great opportunity. We remember those veterans and those people who were prisoners of war, as we should do. We remember the great stories and the written work of Weary Dunlop and the wonderful innovations that Weary was able to bring to bear in order to help prisoners survive, using needles and implements made out of bamboo to give rainwater to those suffering from bad dysentery and lack of fluids. Incredible work and effort went into making those things work. We read about how, through Weary Dunlop's efforts, public health issues were addressed by draining away water from around the camps to prevent malaria and by ensuring cleanliness when prisoners were cooking their food. These stories are worth reading for any young person wanting to have an understanding of those times and to come to grips with what war and deprivation can bring.


While we are having this debate on the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill, it is worth mentioning the 100th anniversary of Anzac Day in 2015 and to remember the battles which took place in the First World War. My Uncle Charles, my grandfather's brother, is buried on the Somme. When you look at those graves, which you see right through Europe, you realise what difficult issues people were faced with. 


This bill certainly gives recognition to prisoners of war and their dependants through a range of benefits and reflects the severe circumstances of their service. Widows of former prisoners of war are eligible for war widow pensions and the gold card. Funeral benefits are payable for deceased former prisoners of war. Children of deceased former prisoners of war are eligible for veterans children's education schemes. (Quorum formed)  I thank my colleagues for their attendance in the chamber during my speech on the bill. The amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act made by schedule 1 will give effect to the 2011 budget measure to create a new prisoner of war recognition supplement, the POWR supplement. That supplement will be $500 per fortnight, payable to former prisoners of war in recognition of the severe hardship and deprivations that they experienced in the service of their country.  


A lot of veterans are no longer with us. The two I spoke about earlier, Georgie Green and Teddy Green, have now both passed on. On first meeting these ex-prisoners of war I found them both to be upstanding men. They were ordinary workers, Teddy having a small farm after shearing for a long time. He spent most of his life around the Cressy district. They were both men of great character, men that most of us growing up looked up to as decent human beings marching on Anzac Day, giving recognition to their service to their country under great hardship. 


There is a lot of work to do on cenotaphs around the country in recognition of the 100-year anniversary of the Anzacs in 2015. There is a lot of tidying up work to be done, especially in the areas surrounding the cenotaphs. I think government has a role to play and I certainly hope there will be some grant programs to allow veterans' communities, along with local councils and others, to participate in bringing those cenotaphs up to the standard that we in this country expect of them. I have been involved in several of those over different governments and a lot of them have worked very well, keeping our cenotaphs and our memorials up to standard. I understand there has been a lot of work done in different parts of the world—in France and at Anzac Cove. It would be interesting to see what has occurred there. A lot of young people these days are finding it very interesting to be involved in these recognitions. That makes us think about why young people are taking such an interest in our veterans and in the wars that we have been involved in. I think it is about young people becoming aware of community, of their sense of duty and of what being involved in a community can mean. Going to war, being a prisoner of war, can certainly give you that perspective by recognising what people have gone through. So it has something to do with that. 


I pay tribute to the uncle of Peter Lawrence from my electorate. Peter, who passed away this week, searched for his uncle's medals for many years. Before Peter died, I presented him with the service medals of his uncle Leo Lawrence. It is very sad to lose Peter. I pass on my condolences to his family. He will be buried on Thursday. He was proud of his uncle's service to his nation and he has now passed on. I support the bill.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2011-06-20,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (18:09):  The Veterans’ Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011 gives effect to creating a prison-of-war recognition supplement, clarifying and affirming the original intention of the compensation offsetting policy in relation to disability pensions, and rationalising temporary incapacity allowance and loss of earnings allowance. The coalition agrees with all these measures.


Schedule 1 of the bill provides that, from 20 September this year, former Australian prisoners of war will receive a $500 payment each fortnight from the Australian government. This payment will be made to former military personnel and civilians who were taken as prisoners of war during World War II and the Korean War. This payment will not be taxable and will not affect present access by former prisoners of war to income support under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 and the Social Security Act or to compensation payments under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. There are almost 900 Australians known by the Department of Veterans' Affairs to be ex-POWs. All known ex-prisoners of war will automatically receive the payment, which they will be paid from 6 October.


The coalition has a strong record of providing assistance to Australia's ex-prisoners of war. In 2001, all former Japanese prisoners of war received a $25,000 tax-free, ex gratia payment from the Australian government. In 2003, former Korean prisoners of war and, in 2007, former German and Italian prisoners of war received similar payments. This additional payment will be welcomed by the 900 Australian ex-prisoners of war—and their families—who are eligible for the payment.


Schedule 2 of the bill seeks to clarify the operation of compensation provisions under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. Comp­ensation offsetting is a longstanding prin­ciple under Australia's repatriation system. The fundamental principle of Australia's system is that compensation is paid for incapacity, not for a specific injury. The coalition believes that the changes proposed by this schedule should be investigated by a Senate committee. We will seek to refer the bill to afford the ex-service community an opportunity to have input into the proposed changes.


Schedule 3 of the bill will rationalise the way incapacity payments are paid under the act. The changes in this bill will remove the temporary incapacity allowance. Instead of receiving this payment, the veteran will be entitled to seek access to the loss of earnings allowance—LOE. The loss of earnings allowance is paid where the veteran accrues an actual loss of earnings as a result of hospitalisation or treatment of accepted disabilities or illnesses. The coalition is not opposed to this rationalisation and calls on the government to ensure the changes are appropriately communicated to the veteran and ex-service community.


The coalition is deeply disappointed that there was no money in the budget for the commemoration of the Anzac centenary. Communities across Australia need certainty about the availability of funding so that they can begin planning for this important, national commemorative event. I regard Anzac Day as our most important national day, and I am sure that most, if not all, members opposite would agree with me. The importance of this occasion was today marked by New Zealand Prime Minister, John Key, who defined it as a deeply significant occasion for both countries.


The coalition welcomes the government's belated funding increase to the Australian War Memorial. It is disappointing that the Gillard Labor government acted only after significant pressure from the community and the coalition which forced them kicking and screaming to this outcome. The coalition remains concerned that there is no funding to completely redevelop the World War I galleries. The coalition has committed funds towards this work so that it is completed ahead of the 2015 Anzac centenary commemorations. Labor must now do the same thing.


The Gillard Labor government will cut $8 million from grassroots veterans' advocacy funding over the forward estimates. This decision will have a severe impact on the services provided by volunteers in our local community to veterans, especially to new veterans returning from recent conflicts, and to their families. A review of advocacy funding released 12 months ago did not recommend a cut in funding, which makes this announcement in the budget even more difficult to understand. The ex-service community had no warning that this cut was coming and they will now compete for a smaller funding pool. This cut could also jeopardise the provision of assistance to younger veterans and their families, who may seek advice from volunteer veteran pension and welfare officers about claims for compensation.


In terms of the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme and DFRB fair indexation, the coalition is committed to military superannuation reform. The Labor Party and the Greens stand condemned for their failure to support the coalition's bill to provide fair indexation to DFRDB and DFRB superannuants. The coalition believes the current indexation arrangements are palpably unfair. The opposition of the Labor-Greens alliance means the only way to deliver this reform is with the election of a coalition government.


I might read a letter that I received, as would many other members of parliament. It is from Bert Hoebee, who for a time served with distinction at Blamey Barracks at Kapooka, which is in Wagga Wagga—my hometown—in the electorate of Riverina. Wagga Wagga is the home of the soldier, because every recruit in the Australian Army goes through Wagga Wagga, through Blamey Barracks, prior to other deployments within the Army. Bert Hoebee writes:


Recently I wrote to you about the matter of social justice for veterans. 


On 2 June, the House of Representatives agreed, evidently without dissent, to support the Coalition's policy of fair indexation for military superannuation pensions.


On 16 June, the Senate voted down the Bill to provide for implementation of that policy.


This despicable act of bastardry—


as Bert writes—


and political opportunism, directly and with the utmost disdain, ignored the will of the people of Australia as expressed in the House two weeks prior.


This act of what some call 'betrayal' was aided and abetted by the Greens, who abandoned their own policy to support fair indexation, through the complicity of its 'contribution' that had nothing more to offer but pompous statements on issues irrelevant to the case.


Thus are ex-service people condemned to continued unfair and unjust superannuation pension indexation, ever-depreciating purchasing power and reducing standards of living. Where are Labor's core value of fairness and its principle of a fair go for all Australians reflected in all of this?


Any government and its hangers-on that ignores the will of the people and turns its back on Australian service men and women in this reprehensible manner does so at its peril.


I now ask you, again, to examine your conscience, and ask: what are you going to do about this unjust treatment of Australia's ex-service people, in direct contravention of the express will of the House?


In another email, he writes:


It is high time to fairly index the pensions of all of our superannuated veterans (under the now-closed DFRB and DFRDB Scheme and the current MSBS scheme)—


the Military Superannuation Benefits Scheme—


and to put a stop to discrimination against them.



That is the fair deal which was a condition of their employment and to which they contributed financially during their service. Just and fair: nothing more, nothing less. Simple. Easily do-able. Long overdue.


This from a man who served his country with distinction. This is a man who, as I say, represented the Army in the home of the soldier, Blamey Barracks. I think it is high time that we listened more and more to people like Bert Hoebee. They, after all, represent the grassroots of our military—those people who served with distinction, who served with absolute determination and high principle and who should be listened to. It is high time to fairly index the pensions of all our superannuated veterans and to put a stop to discrimination against them. That is the deal which was a condition of their employment, as Bert wrote, and to which they contributed financially during their service. I call on the government to do it.

Mr LAURIE FERGUSON
 (Werriwa) (18:18):  The previous speaker, the member for Riverina, made recourse to a fair bit of rhetoric there. He spoke of things being 'palpably unfair'. He referred to letters that talk about pompous statements from the government. He used words such as 'complicity', 'political opportunism' and 'betrayal'. Quite frankly, I am amazed that that kind of outburst can occur this evening, because for 11 long years the Howard government was incapable of doing anything about what the member now defines as being 'palpably unfair'. To come in here and carry on in such a fashion, opportunistically appealing to the veteran community, is just pathetic.


This morning's Sydney Morning Herald has a very timely obituary in regard to this piece of legislation. It outlined the life of Keith Shearim, who at 19 years of age was captured in Singapore in February 1942. Starting at 19 years, I stress, he was to spend three years in prison. He was quoted as saying:


I survived on rice sludge: always the same—breakfast, dinner and tea.


He said later:


It was always full of weevils and rat dung.


He further commented of this period that he survived through 'good luck, good officers, good non-commissioned officers' and good luck again. As I say, that is a very timely summary of the situation of many of those who still survive, who the government is trying to repay in some fashion this evening through this legislation.


As has been detailed by others, the survivors number only 996. That is the number of gold card recipients, and that is probably a very reasonable summary. That is why the total cost of this legislation is estimated at only $27 million over the next four years. Of course, that is an indication of what is going to happen with demography. The cost will reduce from $8.5 million in the first year to $4.5 million in four years time.





(Quorum formed)

As I was saying, the budget figures indicate that within four years the 900-odd recipients will be reduced by half.


The Australian prisoner-of-war experience started with the Boer War, where 104 people were incarcerated. They shared the same experience as the future Prime Minister of Britain Sir Winston Churchill. However, while they say that generally the winners write the history, in the case of the Boer War perhaps the most reprehensible and atrocious conditions were those that the British forced upon the Boer civilians, with large numbers dying in camps. This was in an indication of what was to happen in the Vietnam War, where large numbers of civilians were moved so that they had no connection with military forces. Of course, what particularly stands out in Australian history is the situation in Japan. We know that in the European theatre of war the mortality rate of prisoners was only three per cent, whereas 36 per cent of prisoners of the Japanese perished. We have heard accounts of and know well the Sandakan march where 3,500 civilian Indonesians and 2,500 prisoners of war perished. They were originally used to construct an airstrip and prisoner camp and then, with allied action in Borneo, were forced to go on marches where they all perished.


The International Military Tribunal for the Far East in 1946 undertook an investigation of Japanese atrocities in the Second World War and convicted 5,700 officers for categories B and C prisoner abuse. Amongst the more infamous outcomes of that inquiry was that Shiro Ishii was given immunity for providing statistics to the allies of the people that he had killed with experiments. Even the Indian judge, Radhabinod Pal, who in the end objected to convicting the Japanese, said:


The evidence is still overwhelming that atrocities were perpetrated by members of the Japanese armed forces against the civilian populations of some of the territories occupied by them, as also against prisoners of war.


It is disturbing that by 2006 a survey by Asahi news in Japan indicated that 70 per cent of those Japanese who responded were totally unaware of the war time experience of prisoners of war.


As I said, the conditions these people suffered were not of the usual standard that one has come to expect. The survival rates in other theatres of war and other conflicts were far greater. The situation was that of the 22,380-odd Australians who were prisoners of the Japanese 8,000 died in captivity—a situation which is fairly unparalleled in history. I stress that there were also 250,000 local people who were mistreated by the Japanese in the Burma-Thailand rail project. It was not just the prisoners of war, but it was a serious event in Australian history.


I want to give some credit to Tom Uren, a former member of this House, a former minister and my predecessor as the member for Reid. He was captured in Timor and was one of the huge numbers of people who were imprisoned and were victims of Japanese incarceration. His lessons out of this were perhaps different from those of some people who were never in prison. He devoted himself throughout his career to the search for international peace and cooperation. He was a staunch opponent of the war in Vietnam. He always stressed that what he learned from his period with Weary Dunlop and others was cooperation, that they survived because people learned to work together and that, as a community, people are capable of overcoming the worst and the most horrendous conditions. That was to be a life-guiding point for him, something he learned from that experience in Japan. He has played a significant role with regard to advocacy for these people over many decades. I was speaking to him a few weeks ago and—of course he did not specify to me what was going to occur in the budget—he was looking forward to a good decision. This is what has come out of it: a payment of $500 per fortnight to the remaining 990-odd victims.


It is not only people like Tom Uren. I want to briefly talk about my wife's uncle, Ernest John Walsh, who was captured in Singapore in 1941. He was thought to be missing at first. It was quite a period of time before they were actually certain that he was a prisoner. That only occurred on 17 November 1943. He was both in Singapore and on the Burma-Thailand railway. I think what is important here is that the suffering that people endured was in some cases to be with them for the rest of their lives. Knowing my wife's uncle and her broader family, the condition of his children was the worst of all of those in the extended family. He was renowned for alcoholism. He was incapable of not assaulting policemen and others in uniform. He tended to become very aggressive towards them, attacking them when there was no need whatsoever. Ernest Walsh lived with the problems he experienced as a prisoner of the Japanese for the rest of his life. His family, including his children, was very much affected by those problems. Whilst he might have been a TPI and received a number of medals and awards for his commitment to this country, the kind of suffering he experienced has a lifelong effect on people. It is that effect that this government is attempting at a very late stage to do something about, which many governments, Labor and Liberal, have failed over many decades to do. We are recognising the particular conditions that these people endured over and above the majority of servicemen. I commend the legislation.

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2011-06-20,"



Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel and Minister for Indigenous Health) (18:30):  I thank the member for Werriwa for his contribution to the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill. He is just leaving the chamber, but I will come to his contribution in a moment. In summing up, I acknowledge the contributions of the members for Fadden, Ryan, Maranoa, Herbert, Solomon, McPherson, Cowan and Riverina for the opposition and the members for McEwen, Shortland, Richmond, Lyons and Werriwa for the government.


As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, this bill will give effect to three 2011 budget measures. Firstly, the bill will create a new prisoner of war recognition supplement for Australians who were prisoners of war. The new supplement of $500 per fortnight will be paid in recognition of the hardships that these men and women endured during their captivity. It is expected that approximately 900 former prisoners of war will benefit from the new, fortnightly supplement, which will be payable from 20 September 2011, the first payment being made on 6 October 2011.


I thank the member for Werriwa for his insights into the sacrifices made by prisoners of war. In particular, I reflect upon the 8,000 who died, out of a total of 22,300 prisoners, as a result of their treatment while in captivity with the Japanese. That should give us some insight about the nature of their treatment. I think his understanding, and that of other members of the parliament, of the issue says a lot about our appreciation of not only the contribution made by service men and women but in particular the sacrifices which were made by these very brave men and women. Those who are still with us have proved how resilient and tough they were. Clearly, their lives would have been in danger constantly. I am sure the suffering they endured would have left some of them, as the member for Werriwa pointed out, in a state where they would have had real issues over the remainder of their lives. I know that when this payment was announced by the Prime Minister—and I thank her for making it—at Kirribilli with a group of war veterans who were former prisoners of war it was a salutary experience for me especially, as Minister for Veterans' Affairs, to see how stoic these men were and remain, how resilient they are and, indeed, what a positive attitude they have to life. That says heaps about them as individuals and about us as a community and a country.


Further amendments in the bill will clarify and affirm the compensation offsetting legislation under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. Offsetting is intended to prevent double payments of compensation for the same incapacity, as I think is now understood. A decision of the full Federal Court highlighted the need to clarify this aspect of the legislation. The bill clarifies and affirms the compensation offsetting legislation that has been in place in the repatriation system since 1973. Finally, the bill will rationalise and better target payments for veterans and members who are undergoing treatment for war or defence caused injuries or diseases.


The bill will remove the current overlap in the allowances paid to veterans and members who are unable to work due to episodes of medical treatment and recuperation for war or defence caused injuries or diseases. Payments of temporary incapacity allowance will cease from 20 September 2011, with future payments being better targeted through the loss-of-earnings allowance. This measure has no impact on a veteran's or member's existing disability pension payment. From 20 September 2011, all eligible veterans and members in this situation will be assessed consistently against the criteria for loss-of-earnings allowance. These measures continue the government's commitment to streamlining and enhancing services and support to our veterans and members and their families.


A number of matters were raised by opposition members during the debate and, indeed, have been raised outside of this place by the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, Senator Ronaldson. Despite what has been asserted, the budget measures included in this bill were the subject of wide consultation with the ex-service community. Post-budget briefings of heads of ex-service organisations, or ESOs, were held; an ex-services roundtable, including a separate briefing on the measures in this legislation, was held; PMAC, the Prime Ministerial Advisory Council, was briefed, and the ESO deputy commissioners in each state and territory discussed the issues with their ESO community. There was widespread discussion and consultation with the veteran community about the budget measures raised in the bill. We know, as I am sure you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the ex-service community has some very skilled practitioners who know how this legislation works and are free to raise concerns about these measures—which has not happened to date.


The compensation offsetting provisions, despite the comments which have been made, are not about changing the current arrangements; they are about ensuring that the principles of offsetting, which have been in place since 1973, are clear and unambiguous. These measures, quite simply, maintain the status quo. These measures ensure that veterans cannot get compensated twice for the same incapacity. That is widely accepted by the ex-service community. These amendments do not deny or change any existing veterans' entitlements. Let us be very clear about it: these amendments simply clarify and affirm existing arrangements that have been operating under all governments since 1973.


The member for Fadden specifically raised communication with regard to the proposed rationalisation of the temporary incapacity allowance and the loss of earnings allowance in the veteran community. I am pleased to inform the member that there is a communication plan in place. As with any changes to any measure, communication with the veteran community occurs as a matter of course. In addition to the briefing sessions already being provided and having been provided to ex-service organisations nationwide, key strategies will include provision of information to organisations, articles for the Veterans' Affairs Newsletter and updated information on the DVA website. The department will also be writing to veterans who may be affected in order to manage transition to the new arrangements.


I wish to briefly raise three other issues. One of them is funding for the Australian War Memorial. This matter has been raised in this place by a number of opposition speakers, as well as by the shadow minister outside this place and, indeed, in the Senate itself. It needs to be made very clear that this government is now providing funding of an additional $8 million a year, on top of the current $38 million, to the Australian War Memorial budget. That is a 21 per cent increase in its budget. That was done as a result of an examination of its finances, which was undertaken by me and the Minister for Finance and Deregulation at the request of the Prime Minister. We have responded to a very important need to provide additional resources to the Australian War Memorial, yet there has not been one jot of recognition from the opposition of the fact that the government has actually done something well beyond what the Australian War Memorial was initially asking for.



Mr Randall interjecting—




Mr SNOWDON:
  We were not dragged kicking and screaming anywhere, my friend. Let us be very clear about this. This process started at the end of October last year and it is an initiative of this government. We have had the shadow minister walking around the country bleating that, somehow or  other, the opposition has forced the government into this position. That is an absolutely ludicrous proposition and anyone who has dealt with or had any knowledge of the Australian War Memorial, the Council of the Australian War Memorial, the staff of the Australian War Memorial and the staff of the Department of the Veterans' Affairs would be able to tell you that that is not the case. But these clowns opposite prefer not to listen. So what we now have is an argument that, somehow or other, we have not provided sufficient resources to the Australian War Memorial for the development of its World War I galleries.


Let me make it very clear: this budget provides $1.7 million for the memorial to scope the full scale of the refurbishment. It may surprise the opposition that, despite the bleatings that we are not providing resources to the War Memorial for this particular purpose, this $1.7 million was precisely the amount of money the Australian War Memorial asked for. We were requested by the Australian War Memorial to provide them with $1.7 million for a scoping study so they could update their First World War galleries. The money has been provided. So let us not have any more cant from the opposition, particularly from the shadow spokesman, on this issue, because it is very clear we are meeting our responsibilities and, most importantly, we are doing it in conjunction with the Australian War Memorial.


The third issue I want to refer to is the opposition's criticism of the government about not providing funding for the centenary of Anzac for the 2011-12 budget. Again, I am at a bit of a loss to understand where the opposition is coming from here. The National Commission on the Commemoration of the Anzac Centenary report, How Australia may commemorate the Anzac Centenary, was presented to the Prime Minister on 28 March 2011. The Prime Minister indicated that the government would respond later in 2011. In the lead-up to the Anzac Centenary, the government has undertaken preparatory work, including the establishment of the Anzac Centenary Advisory Board. I will, hopefully, be making an announcement as to the chair of the board very shortly.


The opposition's commentary on this issue, like so many others in the veterans' community, is another example of creating unnecessary and unwarranted concern. It is a beat-up. The shadow veterans' affairs minister mentioned that the Australia Remembers 1945-1995 program set the standard. He referred to the Australia Remembers program. But he may be interested to know that no funding was provided in 1993-94 budget for that program, which, in the context of time, is comparable to the 2012-13 budget for the centenary of Anzac. There was no money provided in an equivalent year.


Initial funding of $350,000 was provided in the 1994-95 budget, which, in contemporary terms, is comparable to the 2013-14 budget. So let us be clear: we are well ahead of the game. The government will have funding in place well before then for the centenary of Anzac arrangements, and the Prime Minister has requested that we take matters back to the cabinet later this year.


The last matter I wish to raise is military superannuation. The shadow minister is on about this all the time, despite what we tell him. He appears to have a tin ear. This matter was raised by, among others, the member for Fadden, the member for Riverina and the member for Solomon. In 11 years of government, when the now opposition were in control of the treasury bench, in a period of economic sunshine, they did nothing about superannuation indexation—not a jot! They come in here, crying crocodile tears about the need for reform in the superannuation system but, when they had the levers of government, when they were in control of the treasury bench, they did absolutely nothing about it. What they are saying is clearly hypocritical. You had your opportunity, you were in government for 11 years and you did nothing. By the way, the proposal the opposition have put forward—and we saw it debated in the Senate—has not even been properly funded. The real fiscal cost of their proposal was $1.7 billion over four years, with an underlying cash cost of $175 million. It would have increased the government's unfunded liabilities by $6.2 billion. 


Furthermore, their proposal was discriminatory. It did not even include the over 90 per cent of current ADF members in the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme. It deigned to do something about some but not all. Superannuation is a means by which Australians can manage their living standards in retirement. It is not designed to provide a replacement for income earned over a working life. The opposition has been hypocritical in every sense on this issue and on so many others in the area of veterans' affairs.

Mr SIMPKINS
 (Cowan) (17:26):  I welcome the opportunity to speak for a while longer on the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011. I will not delay the House too much. When my contribution was suspended last week, I had spoken for some time about the privations and the adversity that our former prisoners of war had endured in the Second World War, with particular emphasis on the prisoners of the Japanese Imperial Army. I also spoke, as everyone has in this debate, about the need to acknowledge and express our appreciation of those veterans, those prisoners of war. The privations and the suffering that they have endured make them noteworthy of such considerations, as we have provided in the past as a coalition government and as the parliament should see passed today.


When we look upon the contributions made to this country, it is right that we have a special regard for all those who have served in uniform. Greater love hath no man than to lay down his life for his country. And it is perfectly true of those who have served and those who continue to serve in uniform for our nation that they were prepared, and our current soldiers are prepared, to lay down their lives for our nation. It is therefore right that they should get appropriate consideration for the commitment that they have made. Serving in the Navy, the Army and the Air Force is not a normal job; it is taking up a life where the risks are greater than in other sectors within our community.


It is therefore important as well that, when we speak of the entitlements of our veterans, we must also have regard for everyone who has served our country. What last week revealed was that, although we may have bipartisan support for measures such as those that apply for prisoners of war, when it actually comes to the need for fairer indexation of military superannuation pensions, the comparison is very stark indeed. There are some that oppose fair indexation. The government, the Greens and Independent Senator Xenophon oppose fair indexation. Unfortunately, the Greens live in a fool's paradise where you can get by in the modern world without a defence force, when the reality is that sometimes you just have to fight, like those diggers, sailors and airmen did in past wars, because there is just no other option. So there are those who are opponents of a fair and just military superannuation system. Again, unfortunately it seems as though the government has failed to deliver what it promised in 2007 in the time since. It is really about time that fair indexation is introduced. We have learnt. We are committed to the course. I am committed to fair indexation.


I thank my constituents for their advice and their feedback on these sorts of matters. I thank particularly a regular email contributor to my knowledge, Mr Terry 'Maddog' Malligan, from Madeley. I thank the members of the Ballajura RSL, who are holding their annual quiz night this coming Saturday night. I wish them all the best for that event and I will see them there. I thank the members of the Wanneroo-Joondalup RSL. In fact, I thank all the veterans and the ex-service men and women who have contacted me to tell me of their views on this matter.


I have looked through this bill and I have looked at what it aims to achieve. I say that we certainly owe a debt of gratitude to those who have served under the most hideous of conditions as prisoners of war. I also acknowledge all those who have worn the uniform and have been prepared to do what needs to be done for this nation's best interests. When I look at what has happened in the past and at the debt of gratitude that we really owe to all those who have served in uniform, not just prisoners of war, I look forward to fair indexation of superannuation being addressed. Unfortunately, it would appear that it will not be addressed until we are returned to government. I look forward to that at the earliest opportunity so that the coalition can provide full and fair indexation, in accordance with our last policy and in accordance with the wishes of the uniformed community, past and present, within our great country. This is what we owe them. This is what we need to come through with. We look forward to delivering that in the future.

"Elliot, Justine, MP",ALP,2011-06-20,"



Mrs ELLIOT
 (Richmond—Parliamentary Secretary for Trade) (17:31):  I am very pleased to be speaking on this bill before the House today, the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011, which gives effect to the government's budget commitments to the veterans community through three measures. The first measure is the new $27.2 million prisoner-of-war recognition supplement, which provides former POWs with an extra $500 per fortnight in recognition of their very special sacrifice and service. The second measure consists of amendments to compensation-offsetting provisions in the Veterans' Entitlements Act. This measure will help ensure equity for a claimant who is entitled to compensation for a level of incapacity under two schemes. The third measure will rationalise the temporary incapacity allowance and loss of earnings allowance to improve targeting of allowances for veterans and members who lose wages during periods of short-term incapacity.


I am very proud to speak in relation to this bill, to speak about this government's record in honouring our veterans and also to speak today about honouring all of those service men and women for the sacrifices they have made for our country. I particularly commend the measure to provide the prisoner-of-war recognition supplement. This measure is an acknowledgment of the commitment and obligation we owe to former Australian POWs for the sacrifices experienced by them in the service of our country. The POW recognition supplement is a $500 fortnightly payment made to all surviving Australian POWs of Japan and Europe from the Second World War and from the Korean War. It is estimated that approximately 900 former POWs will benefit from the payments.


The Australian experience of imprisonment during times of war dates back over 110 years to the time of the Boer War. Whilst individual stories vary greatly in the level of hardship and deprivation faced during times of internment across all conflicts, all of our POWs have some shared common experiences from their impris­onment, particularly including isolation from family and friends, the constant struggle for life, and the need to depend on their mates and comrades for daily survival and to maintain hope in such horrendous circumstances.


I turn first to the First World War. For Australia, as for many nations, the First World War remains the most costly conflict in terms of deaths and casualties. From a population of fewer than five million, 416,809 men enlisted, of whom over 60,000 were killed and 156,000 wounded. More than 4,070 Australians spent the war as prisoners. The Gallipoli campaign saw the first of 217 Australians captured by Ottoman forces. On the battlefields of the Western Front, 3,853 Australian troops were taken prisoner by German forces, most of them held in Germany. A third of these Australian prisoners were captured on 11 April 1917 at the First Battle of Bullecourt in northern France. A number of Australian airmen were also shot down and captured by the Germans. By the time of the armistice, signed in November 1918, a total of 395 Australians had died during their imprisonment in the First World War.


In the Second World War, from 3 September 1939 almost a million Australians, both men and women, served in campaigns against Germany and Italy in Europe, the Mediterranean and North Africa, as well as against the Japanese in South-East Asia and other parts of the Pacific. Over 30,000 would never return home. More than 30,000 were taken as prisoners of war. One of the most significant differences between this war and the First World War was the number of Australian troops captured. Almost eight times the number captured in the First World War were captured in the Second World War, the majority of these as prisoners of the Japanese. The Japanese treatment of its POWs is one of the darkest chapters in Australia's wartime history. In fact, it is difficult for many of us to comprehend how incredibly tragic an experience it was. Of the almost 9,000 Australians who were held in Italian and German camps and experienced varying degrees of mistreatment and brutality, some 250 men died during the war. Over 22,000 Australians became prisoners of war of the Japanese in South-East Asia. Almost 15,000 of the Australians were captured in Singa­pore, while the other principal Australian prisoner-of-war groups were captured in Java, Timor and Ambon. The most notorious and well-known names in the Australia's World War II experience are Changi, Borneo and the Thai-Burma Railroad. In fact, the name Changi is synonymous with the suffering of Australian prisoners of the Japanese during the Second World War. More than 100,000 Allied POWs were crammed into the Changi camp after the fall of Singapore. From May 1942, large work parties began to be sent out of Changi to work on projects such as the Thai-Burma Railway and in other work camps throughout Asia. In February 1942 there were around 15,000 Australians in Changi. By mid-1943 fewer than 2,500 remained. 


Australian POWs in Borneo were held in four main camps: Sandakan, Kuching, Labuan and Jesselton. Of these, Sandakan in North Borneo contained the majority of Australians. In January 1945, when the Japanese feared an Allied invasion of Borneo, they began a series of forced marches from Sandakan to Ranau—a distance of 260 kilometres along jungle tracks. Weak and sick mistreated prisoners starved to death on the way as food became scarcer and scarcer. They had no medical supplies and the terrain was muddy and treacherous. If a prisoner collapsed and could not get up, he was usually shot dead by the Japanese. More marches followed until all POWs had left Sandakan. By the end of the war only six Australians of the 2,500 Allied POWs held at Sandakan had survived this horrific ordeal. 


Whilst Allied POWs were held across Asia, it is those camps along the Thai-Burma Railway during 1943 which remain most resonant for Australians in the Second World War POW experience; largely due to the fact that 9,500 Australians worked on the railway and nearly 7,000 survived to tell the story. The railway stretched 421 kilometres from Thailand to Burma, the aim being to provide the Japanese with a land access route from South-East Asia to supply their large army in Burma. Some 62,000 Australian, British and Dutch POWs, as well as a smaller group of American POWs and estimates of 270,000 Asian indentured labourers, occupied camps along the length of the line, moving from one site to the next as work progressed. The daily deprivations, misery and humiliation of this work are indeed impossible to comprehend. Some 12,000 Allied POWs died on the railway, including 2,646 Australians. The building of the railway exacted such a brutal toll due to the harsh treatment of the prisoners of war, the prevalence of disease, the terrible state of their health, the terrain through which they had to build, the climate of torrential monsoon rain, the extreme heat and the lack of adequate engineering tools and supplies. Though the railway was completed in mid-October 1943, it was never used. Almost as soon as it was completed it was damaged by Allied bombing. Today only sections of it survive. 


My great-uncle Harry Staples, of the 8th Division, died as a prisoner of war on the Thai-Burma Railway. A number of years ago I went to Kanchanburi in Thailand to the railway and walked through Hellfire Pass to see the site where he and so many of our POWs suffered and died. Visiting the war graves highlighted for me how important it is as individuals, families, communities and a nation that we never forget the sacrifices that so many have made, and how important it is that we come together not just on days like Remembrance Day and Anzac Day but at all times to remember their sacrifice. 


When we turn to civilian POWs, almost 1,500 Australian civilians spent the war in captivity, out of about 130,000 civilians interned by the Japanese. Australian army nurses were another group imprisoned. On 14 February 1942, following the fall of Singapore, 65 nurses were attempting to return to Australia on the ship Vyner Brooke. Twelve drowned when the vessel was torpedoed and 21 were massacred after reaching Bangka Island. The sole survivor from that was Nurse Vivian Bullwinkel. The other surviving nurses from the Vyner Brooke were imprisoned in a civilian camp in Sumatra. Eight of the 32 died in captivity. Although they were not made to work as the male POWs were, they were subject to many of the same deprivations and humiliations at the hands of the Japanese. Six Australian military nurses captured at Rabaul in January 1942 were sent to Japan and all survived the war.


The Korean War began on 25 June 1950 and came to an end with the signing of an armistice on 27 July 1953. Australian casualties numbered more than 1,500, of whom 339 were killed. During the Korean War, 30 Australian servicemen were captured by North Korean or Chinese forces. Twenty-four of those taken prisoner were serving with the Australian Army, and six members of the Royal Australian Air Force were also captured. Of the 30 Australians, only one, Private HW Madden, died whilst imprisoned. Madden was posthumously awarded the George Cross. Prisoners in Korea suffered many of the same trials as those of the Japanese—neglect, hunger and brutality—but also the biting cold of a Korean winter, where temperatures could go as low as minus 60 degrees Celsius. 


By introducing this new payment for surviving Australian prisoners of war, the government's bill recognises the hardships these people endured and recognises the massive sacrifice they made in their service to our country. It is important that we always continue to remember that service and the sacrifices made by our past and also our serving defence forces, who paid the ultimate price. I would like to take the opportunity to commend all of the wonderful veterans groups in my electorate who work so tirelessly to ensure that we as communities continue to remember the great commitment of all of our veterans. I am fortunate to have a very large veterans community and wonderful individuals who do great work with veterans and in many other groups as well. 


I say in conclusion that whilst we reflect upon service in previous conflicts we must of course also remember those serving our nation currently. It is very important to remember the commitment that they have made. I would like to finish by remarking on the event last Friday in my electorate at Kingscliff where the funeral was held for Sapper Rowan Robinson, who died on 6 June while serving in Afghanistan. Sapper Robinson grew up in Kingscliff and around the North Coast, and his funeral was attended by many family and friends who recalled wonderful fond memories of him. I would like to say that our thoughts and prayers are with his family as we remember his sacrifice and his service to our nation.

"Griggs, Natasha, MP",CLP,2011-06-20,"



Mrs GRIGGS
 (Solomon) (17:44):  I rise to speak on the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011. This bill gives effect to a number of veterans' affairs 2011 budget measures: firstly, it will create a prisoner-of-war recognition supplement, providing a $500 fortnightly payment to former Australian prisoners of war; secondly, it will clarify and affirm the original intention of the compensation-offsetting policy in respect of pensions payable under parts 2 and 4 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986; and, thirdly, schedule 3 rationalises temporary incapacity allowances for veterans.


Reviewing the measures in more detail, specifically schedule 1, the prisoner-of-war recognition supplement, under this measure from 20 September this year former Australian prisoners of war will receive a $500 payment each fortnight from the Australian government. This payment will be made to former military personnel and civilians alike who were interned as prisoners of war during either World War II or the Korean War. These supplement payments will not be taxable and will not affect a former prisoner of war's present access to income support via the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 and the Social Security Act, or compensation payments under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. 


There are over 900 Australians known to the Department of Veterans' Affairs as ex-prisoners of war. All of them will automatically receive the payment from 6 October.


The coalition has a strong record of providing assistance to Australia's ex-prisoners of war. In 2001, all former Japanese POWs received a $25,000 tax-free ex gratia payment from the Australian government. In 2003, former Korean POWs received similar payments, as did former German and Italian POWs in 2007.


This additional supplement payment is welcomed by the 900 Australian ex-POWs and their families who are eligible. As I indicated earlier, schedule 2 of this bill seeks to clarify the operation of compensation provisions under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. Compensation offsetting is a longstanding principle under Australia's repatriation system. The fundamental principle to this system is that payments of compensation are for incapacity. The coalition believes that the changes proposed by this schedule should be investigated by a Senate committee. We will seek to refer the bill so that the ex-service community will have the opportunity to have a say and provide input into the proposed changes.


Finally, schedule 3 of the bill rationalises the manner in which incapacity payments are to be paid in accordance with the act.


The changes provided by this bill remove the temporary incapacity allowance. In place of receiving this payment, a veteran will be entitled to seek access to the loss-of-earnings allowance or LOE, an allowance paid where the veteran accrues an actual loss of earnings as a result of hospitalisation or treatment of accepted disabilities or illnesses. The coalition is not opposed to this rationalisation and calls on the government to ensure the changes are appropriately and effectively communicated to the veterans and ex-service community.


A further issue I address, relevant to this bill, is that of the Anzac centenary. Unfortunately, no money was provided in the budget for the commemoration of the Anzac centenary, a point I find deeply disappointing. So I ask: when will this government make a firm financial commitment to the Anzac centenary in 2015? The significance of this centenary cannot be understated. Communities looking forward and beginning to plan for this most important national commemorative event require certainty in terms of funding and the level of federal support.


I have on a number of occasions this year in the House mentioned the commemorative services held to mark the 69th anniversary of the bombing of Darwin during World War II. The bombings are a very significant event in the history of Darwin, the Northern Territory and Australia. Commemoration of this event has enormous significance for those who were present in Darwin during the air raids. Furthermore, the significance of this commemoration retains its importance to today's Territorians and to past and present personnel of the Australian Defence Force.


Planning is well underway for next year's 70th anniversary of the bombing-of-Darwin commemorations. Earlier this year, Senator Crossin called for the bombing of Darwin to be marked by a public holiday. I understand the sentiment; however, I am not here advocating for a public holiday; I am here asking that the government appropriately acknowledge this event as one of national significance and that some funding be provided for commemoration of this important historical event.


While the coalition welcomes the government's belated funding increase to the Australian War Memorial, the coalition remains concerned that no funding to redevelop the World War I galleries has been identified. The coalition has committed funds towards this work to facilitate its completion ahead of the 2015 Anzac centenary commemorations. It is very disappointing that the Gillard Labor government acted to increase the Australian War Memorial funding only after significant pressure from the community and from the coalition.


I have been contacted by the president of my local branch of the National Servicemen's Association of Australia, Mr Ivan Walsh, who wrote to the Department of Veterans' Affairs over seven months ago requesting permission to erect a permanent flagpole at the Adelaide River War Cemetery. It is extremely disappointing that these men who served our country are yet to receive a response from the department regarding a simple request for permission to erect a flagpole as a permanent feature for ongoing commemorative services at the Adelaide River War Cemetery. I seek leave to table the letter.


Leave granted.




Mrs GRIGGS:
  I ask if the minister could please look into this issue, as the Adelaide River War Cemetery is a very significant commemorative area and it is also in his electorate. As the years have gone by, there seems to be more focus on Adelaide River War Cemetery for commemorative events. They are asking permission to have the flagpole installed before the national Remembrance Day in November. I would really appreciate it if the minister could investigate this and provide an answer to the committee. Another matter of disapp­ointment is that the Gillard Labor government will cut $8 million from grassroots veterans advocacy funding over the forward estimates. I know that a review of the advocacy funding, released 12 months ago, did not recommend a cut in funding, which makes this recent announcement even harder to understand. Veterans services provided by volunteers from within our local community, particularly services to those new veterans returning from recent conflicts and their families, will definitely be impacted. My electorate represents Defence Force constituents who have served overseas, are still serving overseas or are due to be deployed. From the perspective of the electorate of Solomon, the issues relevant to veterans are of significant concern. This government must ensure that it looks after our defence personnel both during and after their service to this wonderful country of ours. The ex-servicemen community had no warning that cuts to advocacy funding were likely or about the impact of having to compete for a smaller funding pool. It is not good enough. This cut could also jeopardise the provision of assistance to younger veterans and their families, who may seek advice from volunteer veteran pension and welfare officers about claims for compensation. As I mentioned earlier this year in this place, the coalition remains the only party in the parliament committed to military superannuation reform.


I take this opportunity to touch on Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits and DFRB fair indexation. The Labor Party and the Greens stand condemned for their failure to support the coalition's bill to provide fair indexation to DFRDB and DFRB superannuants. This is simply not good enough. The coalition believes the current indexation arrangements are unfair. The opposition of the Labor-Greens alliance means that the only way to deliver these reforms is through the election of a coalition government. I reaffirm comments made earlier by my colleagues in this place that the coalition is committed to Australian veterans.

"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,2011-06-20,"



Mr ADAMS
 (Lyons) (17:54):  It is a great pleasure to speak on the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011. I say to the honourable member for Solomon, who thought to raise in the debate on this very good bill political issues about super­annuation for the people presently serving in the military, that there were 11 years during which some of us made representation to the previous government about this, and nothing occurred. It is a pretty poor effort to come in here and start raising this on a veterans bill when we have some pretty good news here for veterans and ex-prisoners-of-war. The member may want to get into some of the history as to why her party did not deliver over those 11 years.


This bill gives effect to the veterans' affairs 2011 budget measures, which will create a prisoner of war recognition supplement, clarifying and affirming the original intention of the compensation offsetting policy in relation to disability pensions, rationalised temporary incapacity allowance and the loss of earnings allowance.


I first became aware of prisoners of war because of my friends Philip and John Green, whom I grew up with and went to school with and who are both still my friends. John has moved away a bit, but Philip is still a great mate. Their fathers were both prisoners of war. As boys we talked about this and discussed it, and I met their fathers, who had gone through that terrible experience. They were both in Timor when it fell—I think Sparrow Force was among the forces that were there as our forward defence before the Japanese landed about 22,000 troops, on their forward movement into that area—and they were taken prisoner.


Georgie Green, Philip's father, spent his time as a prisoner of war on the Burma railway, and I think Teddy—John's father—spent some time in the bicycle camp in Timor and later in that same area. That was not a very pleasant experience for them. In later years George was very pleased to visit Hellfire Pass and take his grandson there to show him the places where he had had to endure some harsh treatment and was able to survive that. I think it was just about trying to show those at home what they had endured, where they had endured it and how they had survived it. These were guys who never spoke of or glorified anything about war and were always conscious of that in their activities.


Georgie and Teddy were great role models and great men who had a lot of respect in the community. The community in which I grew up, the Longford community, had an RSL which was built in 1947 by the returning veterans. The annual Anzac Day sports event was a pretty well-known event right throughout Tasmania. Most of us growing up in the 1950s and going to school attended those sports days. We learnt what Anzac Day was about and what remembrance was about, and that worked very well. I can remember Georgie Green presenting me with an ice-cream after I had run a footrace. Footraces were never my great strength, but I can remember getting an ice-cream from Georgie Green, so it was a great opportunity. We remember those veterans and those people who were prisoners of war, as we should do. We remember the great stories and the written work of Weary Dunlop and the wonderful innovations that Weary was able to bring to bear in order to help prisoners survive, using needles and implements made out of bamboo to give rainwater to those suffering from bad dysentery and lack of fluids. Incredible work and effort went into making those things work. We read about how, through Weary Dunlop's efforts, public health issues were addressed by draining away water from around the camps to prevent malaria and by ensuring cleanliness when prisoners were cooking their food. These stories are worth reading for any young person wanting to have an understanding of those times and to come to grips with what war and deprivation can bring.


While we are having this debate on the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill, it is worth mentioning the 100th anniversary of Anzac Day in 2015 and to remember the battles which took place in the First World War. My Uncle Charles, my grandfather's brother, is buried on the Somme. When you look at those graves, which you see right through Europe, you realise what difficult issues people were faced with. 


This bill certainly gives recognition to prisoners of war and their dependants through a range of benefits and reflects the severe circumstances of their service. Widows of former prisoners of war are eligible for war widow pensions and the gold card. Funeral benefits are payable for deceased former prisoners of war. Children of deceased former prisoners of war are eligible for veterans children's education schemes. (Quorum formed)  I thank my colleagues for their attendance in the chamber during my speech on the bill. The amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act made by schedule 1 will give effect to the 2011 budget measure to create a new prisoner of war recognition supplement, the POWR supplement. That supplement will be $500 per fortnight, payable to former prisoners of war in recognition of the severe hardship and deprivations that they experienced in the service of their country.  


A lot of veterans are no longer with us. The two I spoke about earlier, Georgie Green and Teddy Green, have now both passed on. On first meeting these ex-prisoners of war I found them both to be upstanding men. They were ordinary workers, Teddy having a small farm after shearing for a long time. He spent most of his life around the Cressy district. They were both men of great character, men that most of us growing up looked up to as decent human beings marching on Anzac Day, giving recognition to their service to their country under great hardship. 


There is a lot of work to do on cenotaphs around the country in recognition of the 100-year anniversary of the Anzacs in 2015. There is a lot of tidying up work to be done, especially in the areas surrounding the cenotaphs. I think government has a role to play and I certainly hope there will be some grant programs to allow veterans' communities, along with local councils and others, to participate in bringing those cenotaphs up to the standard that we in this country expect of them. I have been involved in several of those over different governments and a lot of them have worked very well, keeping our cenotaphs and our memorials up to standard. I understand there has been a lot of work done in different parts of the world—in France and at Anzac Cove. It would be interesting to see what has occurred there. A lot of young people these days are finding it very interesting to be involved in these recognitions. That makes us think about why young people are taking such an interest in our veterans and in the wars that we have been involved in. I think it is about young people becoming aware of community, of their sense of duty and of what being involved in a community can mean. Going to war, being a prisoner of war, can certainly give you that perspective by recognising what people have gone through. So it has something to do with that. 


I pay tribute to the uncle of Peter Lawrence from my electorate. Peter, who passed away this week, searched for his uncle's medals for many years. Before Peter died, I presented him with the service medals of his uncle Leo Lawrence. It is very sad to lose Peter. I pass on my condolences to his family. He will be buried on Thursday. He was proud of his uncle's service to his nation and he has now passed on. I support the bill.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2011-06-20,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (18:09):  The Veterans’ Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011 gives effect to creating a prison-of-war recognition supplement, clarifying and affirming the original intention of the compensation offsetting policy in relation to disability pensions, and rationalising temporary incapacity allowance and loss of earnings allowance. The coalition agrees with all these measures.


Schedule 1 of the bill provides that, from 20 September this year, former Australian prisoners of war will receive a $500 payment each fortnight from the Australian government. This payment will be made to former military personnel and civilians who were taken as prisoners of war during World War II and the Korean War. This payment will not be taxable and will not affect present access by former prisoners of war to income support under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 and the Social Security Act or to compensation payments under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. There are almost 900 Australians known by the Department of Veterans' Affairs to be ex-POWs. All known ex-prisoners of war will automatically receive the payment, which they will be paid from 6 October.


The coalition has a strong record of providing assistance to Australia's ex-prisoners of war. In 2001, all former Japanese prisoners of war received a $25,000 tax-free, ex gratia payment from the Australian government. In 2003, former Korean prisoners of war and, in 2007, former German and Italian prisoners of war received similar payments. This additional payment will be welcomed by the 900 Australian ex-prisoners of war—and their families—who are eligible for the payment.


Schedule 2 of the bill seeks to clarify the operation of compensation provisions under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. Comp­ensation offsetting is a longstanding prin­ciple under Australia's repatriation system. The fundamental principle of Australia's system is that compensation is paid for incapacity, not for a specific injury. The coalition believes that the changes proposed by this schedule should be investigated by a Senate committee. We will seek to refer the bill to afford the ex-service community an opportunity to have input into the proposed changes.


Schedule 3 of the bill will rationalise the way incapacity payments are paid under the act. The changes in this bill will remove the temporary incapacity allowance. Instead of receiving this payment, the veteran will be entitled to seek access to the loss of earnings allowance—LOE. The loss of earnings allowance is paid where the veteran accrues an actual loss of earnings as a result of hospitalisation or treatment of accepted disabilities or illnesses. The coalition is not opposed to this rationalisation and calls on the government to ensure the changes are appropriately communicated to the veteran and ex-service community.


The coalition is deeply disappointed that there was no money in the budget for the commemoration of the Anzac centenary. Communities across Australia need certainty about the availability of funding so that they can begin planning for this important, national commemorative event. I regard Anzac Day as our most important national day, and I am sure that most, if not all, members opposite would agree with me. The importance of this occasion was today marked by New Zealand Prime Minister, John Key, who defined it as a deeply significant occasion for both countries.


The coalition welcomes the government's belated funding increase to the Australian War Memorial. It is disappointing that the Gillard Labor government acted only after significant pressure from the community and the coalition which forced them kicking and screaming to this outcome. The coalition remains concerned that there is no funding to completely redevelop the World War I galleries. The coalition has committed funds towards this work so that it is completed ahead of the 2015 Anzac centenary commemorations. Labor must now do the same thing.


The Gillard Labor government will cut $8 million from grassroots veterans' advocacy funding over the forward estimates. This decision will have a severe impact on the services provided by volunteers in our local community to veterans, especially to new veterans returning from recent conflicts, and to their families. A review of advocacy funding released 12 months ago did not recommend a cut in funding, which makes this announcement in the budget even more difficult to understand. The ex-service community had no warning that this cut was coming and they will now compete for a smaller funding pool. This cut could also jeopardise the provision of assistance to younger veterans and their families, who may seek advice from volunteer veteran pension and welfare officers about claims for compensation.


In terms of the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme and DFRB fair indexation, the coalition is committed to military superannuation reform. The Labor Party and the Greens stand condemned for their failure to support the coalition's bill to provide fair indexation to DFRDB and DFRB superannuants. The coalition believes the current indexation arrangements are palpably unfair. The opposition of the Labor-Greens alliance means the only way to deliver this reform is with the election of a coalition government.


I might read a letter that I received, as would many other members of parliament. It is from Bert Hoebee, who for a time served with distinction at Blamey Barracks at Kapooka, which is in Wagga Wagga—my hometown—in the electorate of Riverina. Wagga Wagga is the home of the soldier, because every recruit in the Australian Army goes through Wagga Wagga, through Blamey Barracks, prior to other deployments within the Army. Bert Hoebee writes:


Recently I wrote to you about the matter of social justice for veterans. 


On 2 June, the House of Representatives agreed, evidently without dissent, to support the Coalition's policy of fair indexation for military superannuation pensions.


On 16 June, the Senate voted down the Bill to provide for implementation of that policy.


This despicable act of bastardry—


as Bert writes—


and political opportunism, directly and with the utmost disdain, ignored the will of the people of Australia as expressed in the House two weeks prior.


This act of what some call 'betrayal' was aided and abetted by the Greens, who abandoned their own policy to support fair indexation, through the complicity of its 'contribution' that had nothing more to offer but pompous statements on issues irrelevant to the case.


Thus are ex-service people condemned to continued unfair and unjust superannuation pension indexation, ever-depreciating purchasing power and reducing standards of living. Where are Labor's core value of fairness and its principle of a fair go for all Australians reflected in all of this?


Any government and its hangers-on that ignores the will of the people and turns its back on Australian service men and women in this reprehensible manner does so at its peril.


I now ask you, again, to examine your conscience, and ask: what are you going to do about this unjust treatment of Australia's ex-service people, in direct contravention of the express will of the House?


In another email, he writes:


It is high time to fairly index the pensions of all of our superannuated veterans (under the now-closed DFRB and DFRDB Scheme and the current MSBS scheme)—


the Military Superannuation Benefits Scheme—


and to put a stop to discrimination against them.



That is the fair deal which was a condition of their employment and to which they contributed financially during their service. Just and fair: nothing more, nothing less. Simple. Easily do-able. Long overdue.


This from a man who served his country with distinction. This is a man who, as I say, represented the Army in the home of the soldier, Blamey Barracks. I think it is high time that we listened more and more to people like Bert Hoebee. They, after all, represent the grassroots of our military—those people who served with distinction, who served with absolute determination and high principle and who should be listened to. It is high time to fairly index the pensions of all our superannuated veterans and to put a stop to discrimination against them. That is the deal which was a condition of their employment, as Bert wrote, and to which they contributed financially during their service. I call on the government to do it.

"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,2011-06-20,"



Mr LAURIE FERGUSON
 (Werriwa) (18:18):  The previous speaker, the member for Riverina, made recourse to a fair bit of rhetoric there. He spoke of things being 'palpably unfair'. He referred to letters that talk about pompous statements from the government. He used words such as 'complicity', 'political opportunism' and 'betrayal'. Quite frankly, I am amazed that that kind of outburst can occur this evening, because for 11 long years the Howard government was incapable of doing anything about what the member now defines as being 'palpably unfair'. To come in here and carry on in such a fashion, opportunistically appealing to the veteran community, is just pathetic.


This morning's Sydney Morning Herald has a very timely obituary in regard to this piece of legislation. It outlined the life of Keith Shearim, who at 19 years of age was captured in Singapore in February 1942. Starting at 19 years, I stress, he was to spend three years in prison. He was quoted as saying:


I survived on rice sludge: always the same—breakfast, dinner and tea.


He said later:


It was always full of weevils and rat dung.


He further commented of this period that he survived through 'good luck, good officers, good non-commissioned officers' and good luck again. As I say, that is a very timely summary of the situation of many of those who still survive, who the government is trying to repay in some fashion this evening through this legislation.


As has been detailed by others, the survivors number only 996. That is the number of gold card recipients, and that is probably a very reasonable summary. That is why the total cost of this legislation is estimated at only $27 million over the next four years. Of course, that is an indication of what is going to happen with demography. The cost will reduce from $8.5 million in the first year to $4.5 million in four years time.





(Quorum formed)

As I was saying, the budget figures indicate that within four years the 900-odd recipients will be reduced by half.


The Australian prisoner-of-war experience started with the Boer War, where 104 people were incarcerated. They shared the same experience as the future Prime Minister of Britain Sir Winston Churchill. However, while they say that generally the winners write the history, in the case of the Boer War perhaps the most reprehensible and atrocious conditions were those that the British forced upon the Boer civilians, with large numbers dying in camps. This was in an indication of what was to happen in the Vietnam War, where large numbers of civilians were moved so that they had no connection with military forces. Of course, what particularly stands out in Australian history is the situation in Japan. We know that in the European theatre of war the mortality rate of prisoners was only three per cent, whereas 36 per cent of prisoners of the Japanese perished. We have heard accounts of and know well the Sandakan march where 3,500 civilian Indonesians and 2,500 prisoners of war perished. They were originally used to construct an airstrip and prisoner camp and then, with allied action in Borneo, were forced to go on marches where they all perished.


The International Military Tribunal for the Far East in 1946 undertook an investigation of Japanese atrocities in the Second World War and convicted 5,700 officers for categories B and C prisoner abuse. Amongst the more infamous outcomes of that inquiry was that Shiro Ishii was given immunity for providing statistics to the allies of the people that he had killed with experiments. Even the Indian judge, Radhabinod Pal, who in the end objected to convicting the Japanese, said:


The evidence is still overwhelming that atrocities were perpetrated by members of the Japanese armed forces against the civilian populations of some of the territories occupied by them, as also against prisoners of war.


It is disturbing that by 2006 a survey by Asahi news in Japan indicated that 70 per cent of those Japanese who responded were totally unaware of the war time experience of prisoners of war.


As I said, the conditions these people suffered were not of the usual standard that one has come to expect. The survival rates in other theatres of war and other conflicts were far greater. The situation was that of the 22,380-odd Australians who were prisoners of the Japanese 8,000 died in captivity—a situation which is fairly unparalleled in history. I stress that there were also 250,000 local people who were mistreated by the Japanese in the Burma-Thailand rail project. It was not just the prisoners of war, but it was a serious event in Australian history.


I want to give some credit to Tom Uren, a former member of this House, a former minister and my predecessor as the member for Reid. He was captured in Timor and was one of the huge numbers of people who were imprisoned and were victims of Japanese incarceration. His lessons out of this were perhaps different from those of some people who were never in prison. He devoted himself throughout his career to the search for international peace and cooperation. He was a staunch opponent of the war in Vietnam. He always stressed that what he learned from his period with Weary Dunlop and others was cooperation, that they survived because people learned to work together and that, as a community, people are capable of overcoming the worst and the most horrendous conditions. That was to be a life-guiding point for him, something he learned from that experience in Japan. He has played a significant role with regard to advocacy for these people over many decades. I was speaking to him a few weeks ago and—of course he did not specify to me what was going to occur in the budget—he was looking forward to a good decision. This is what has come out of it: a payment of $500 per fortnight to the remaining 990-odd victims.


It is not only people like Tom Uren. I want to briefly talk about my wife's uncle, Ernest John Walsh, who was captured in Singapore in 1941. He was thought to be missing at first. It was quite a period of time before they were actually certain that he was a prisoner. That only occurred on 17 November 1943. He was both in Singapore and on the Burma-Thailand railway. I think what is important here is that the suffering that people endured was in some cases to be with them for the rest of their lives. Knowing my wife's uncle and her broader family, the condition of his children was the worst of all of those in the extended family. He was renowned for alcoholism. He was incapable of not assaulting policemen and others in uniform. He tended to become very aggressive towards them, attacking them when there was no need whatsoever. Ernest Walsh lived with the problems he experienced as a prisoner of the Japanese for the rest of his life. His family, including his children, was very much affected by those problems. Whilst he might have been a TPI and received a number of medals and awards for his commitment to this country, the kind of suffering he experienced has a lifelong effect on people. It is that effect that this government is attempting at a very late stage to do something about, which many governments, Labor and Liberal, have failed over many decades to do. We are recognising the particular conditions that these people endured over and above the majority of servicemen. I commend the legislation.

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2011-06-20,"



Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel and Minister for Indigenous Health) (18:30):  I thank the member for Werriwa for his contribution to the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill. He is just leaving the chamber, but I will come to his contribution in a moment. In summing up, I acknowledge the contributions of the members for Fadden, Ryan, Maranoa, Herbert, Solomon, McPherson, Cowan and Riverina for the opposition and the members for McEwen, Shortland, Richmond, Lyons and Werriwa for the government.


As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, this bill will give effect to three 2011 budget measures. Firstly, the bill will create a new prisoner of war recognition supplement for Australians who were prisoners of war. The new supplement of $500 per fortnight will be paid in recognition of the hardships that these men and women endured during their captivity. It is expected that approximately 900 former prisoners of war will benefit from the new, fortnightly supplement, which will be payable from 20 September 2011, the first payment being made on 6 October 2011.


I thank the member for Werriwa for his insights into the sacrifices made by prisoners of war. In particular, I reflect upon the 8,000 who died, out of a total of 22,300 prisoners, as a result of their treatment while in captivity with the Japanese. That should give us some insight about the nature of their treatment. I think his understanding, and that of other members of the parliament, of the issue says a lot about our appreciation of not only the contribution made by service men and women but in particular the sacrifices which were made by these very brave men and women. Those who are still with us have proved how resilient and tough they were. Clearly, their lives would have been in danger constantly. I am sure the suffering they endured would have left some of them, as the member for Werriwa pointed out, in a state where they would have had real issues over the remainder of their lives. I know that when this payment was announced by the Prime Minister—and I thank her for making it—at Kirribilli with a group of war veterans who were former prisoners of war it was a salutary experience for me especially, as Minister for Veterans' Affairs, to see how stoic these men were and remain, how resilient they are and, indeed, what a positive attitude they have to life. That says heaps about them as individuals and about us as a community and a country.


Further amendments in the bill will clarify and affirm the compensation offsetting legislation under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. Offsetting is intended to prevent double payments of compensation for the same incapacity, as I think is now understood. A decision of the full Federal Court highlighted the need to clarify this aspect of the legislation. The bill clarifies and affirms the compensation offsetting legislation that has been in place in the repatriation system since 1973. Finally, the bill will rationalise and better target payments for veterans and members who are undergoing treatment for war or defence caused injuries or diseases.


The bill will remove the current overlap in the allowances paid to veterans and members who are unable to work due to episodes of medical treatment and recuperation for war or defence caused injuries or diseases. Payments of temporary incapacity allowance will cease from 20 September 2011, with future payments being better targeted through the loss-of-earnings allowance. This measure has no impact on a veteran's or member's existing disability pension payment. From 20 September 2011, all eligible veterans and members in this situation will be assessed consistently against the criteria for loss-of-earnings allowance. These measures continue the government's commitment to streamlining and enhancing services and support to our veterans and members and their families.


A number of matters were raised by opposition members during the debate and, indeed, have been raised outside of this place by the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, Senator Ronaldson. Despite what has been asserted, the budget measures included in this bill were the subject of wide consultation with the ex-service community. Post-budget briefings of heads of ex-service organisations, or ESOs, were held; an ex-services roundtable, including a separate briefing on the measures in this legislation, was held; PMAC, the Prime Ministerial Advisory Council, was briefed, and the ESO deputy commissioners in each state and territory discussed the issues with their ESO community. There was widespread discussion and consultation with the veteran community about the budget measures raised in the bill. We know, as I am sure you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the ex-service community has some very skilled practitioners who know how this legislation works and are free to raise concerns about these measures—which has not happened to date.


The compensation offsetting provisions, despite the comments which have been made, are not about changing the current arrangements; they are about ensuring that the principles of offsetting, which have been in place since 1973, are clear and unambiguous. These measures, quite simply, maintain the status quo. These measures ensure that veterans cannot get compensated twice for the same incapacity. That is widely accepted by the ex-service community. These amendments do not deny or change any existing veterans' entitlements. Let us be very clear about it: these amendments simply clarify and affirm existing arrangements that have been operating under all governments since 1973.


The member for Fadden specifically raised communication with regard to the proposed rationalisation of the temporary incapacity allowance and the loss of earnings allowance in the veteran community. I am pleased to inform the member that there is a communication plan in place. As with any changes to any measure, communication with the veteran community occurs as a matter of course. In addition to the briefing sessions already being provided and having been provided to ex-service organisations nationwide, key strategies will include provision of information to organisations, articles for the Veterans' Affairs Newsletter and updated information on the DVA website. The department will also be writing to veterans who may be affected in order to manage transition to the new arrangements.


I wish to briefly raise three other issues. One of them is funding for the Australian War Memorial. This matter has been raised in this place by a number of opposition speakers, as well as by the shadow minister outside this place and, indeed, in the Senate itself. It needs to be made very clear that this government is now providing funding of an additional $8 million a year, on top of the current $38 million, to the Australian War Memorial budget. That is a 21 per cent increase in its budget. That was done as a result of an examination of its finances, which was undertaken by me and the Minister for Finance and Deregulation at the request of the Prime Minister. We have responded to a very important need to provide additional resources to the Australian War Memorial, yet there has not been one jot of recognition from the opposition of the fact that the government has actually done something well beyond what the Australian War Memorial was initially asking for.



Mr Randall interjecting—




Mr SNOWDON:
  We were not dragged kicking and screaming anywhere, my friend. Let us be very clear about this. This process started at the end of October last year and it is an initiative of this government. We have had the shadow minister walking around the country bleating that, somehow or  other, the opposition has forced the government into this position. That is an absolutely ludicrous proposition and anyone who has dealt with or had any knowledge of the Australian War Memorial, the Council of the Australian War Memorial, the staff of the Australian War Memorial and the staff of the Department of the Veterans' Affairs would be able to tell you that that is not the case. But these clowns opposite prefer not to listen. So what we now have is an argument that, somehow or other, we have not provided sufficient resources to the Australian War Memorial for the development of its World War I galleries.


Let me make it very clear: this budget provides $1.7 million for the memorial to scope the full scale of the refurbishment. It may surprise the opposition that, despite the bleatings that we are not providing resources to the War Memorial for this particular purpose, this $1.7 million was precisely the amount of money the Australian War Memorial asked for. We were requested by the Australian War Memorial to provide them with $1.7 million for a scoping study so they could update their First World War galleries. The money has been provided. So let us not have any more cant from the opposition, particularly from the shadow spokesman, on this issue, because it is very clear we are meeting our responsibilities and, most importantly, we are doing it in conjunction with the Australian War Memorial.


The third issue I want to refer to is the opposition's criticism of the government about not providing funding for the centenary of Anzac for the 2011-12 budget. Again, I am at a bit of a loss to understand where the opposition is coming from here. The National Commission on the Commemoration of the Anzac Centenary report, How Australia may commemorate the Anzac Centenary, was presented to the Prime Minister on 28 March 2011. The Prime Minister indicated that the government would respond later in 2011. In the lead-up to the Anzac Centenary, the government has undertaken preparatory work, including the establishment of the Anzac Centenary Advisory Board. I will, hopefully, be making an announcement as to the chair of the board very shortly.


The opposition's commentary on this issue, like so many others in the veterans' community, is another example of creating unnecessary and unwarranted concern. It is a beat-up. The shadow veterans' affairs minister mentioned that the Australia Remembers 1945-1995 program set the standard. He referred to the Australia Remembers program. But he may be interested to know that no funding was provided in 1993-94 budget for that program, which, in the context of time, is comparable to the 2012-13 budget for the centenary of Anzac. There was no money provided in an equivalent year.


Initial funding of $350,000 was provided in the 1994-95 budget, which, in contemporary terms, is comparable to the 2013-14 budget. So let us be clear: we are well ahead of the game. The government will have funding in place well before then for the centenary of Anzac arrangements, and the Prime Minister has requested that we take matters back to the cabinet later this year.


The last matter I wish to raise is military superannuation. The shadow minister is on about this all the time, despite what we tell him. He appears to have a tin ear. This matter was raised by, among others, the member for Fadden, the member for Riverina and the member for Solomon. In 11 years of government, when the now opposition were in control of the treasury bench, in a period of economic sunshine, they did nothing about superannuation indexation—not a jot! They come in here, crying crocodile tears about the need for reform in the superannuation system but, when they had the levers of government, when they were in control of the treasury bench, they did absolutely nothing about it. What they are saying is clearly hypocritical. You had your opportunity, you were in government for 11 years and you did nothing. By the way, the proposal the opposition have put forward—and we saw it debated in the Senate—has not even been properly funded. The real fiscal cost of their proposal was $1.7 billion over four years, with an underlying cash cost of $175 million. It would have increased the government's unfunded liabilities by $6.2 billion. 


Furthermore, their proposal was discriminatory. It did not even include the over 90 per cent of current ADF members in the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme. It deigned to do something about some but not all. Superannuation is a means by which Australians can manage their living standards in retirement. It is not designed to provide a replacement for income earned over a working life. The opposition has been hypocritical in every sense on this issue and on so many others in the area of veterans' affairs.

"Byrne, Anthony, MP",ALP,2011-06-20,"



Mr BYRNE
 (Holt) (20:00):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security I have pleasure in presenting the committee's report entitled Annual report of committee activities 2009-10.The tabling of this report has been delayed because of the federal election. It is a report of the activities of the committee of the 42nd Parliament. The activities dealt with in the report were carried out under the previous chair and member for Brisbane, the Hon. Arch Bevis. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Bevis for his work on the committee. His contributions to this important area of national security will be missed.


Reviewing administration and expenditure on an annual basis is one of the primary functions of the committee. Section 29 of the Intelligence Services Act stipulates that the committee has an obligation to review the administration and expenditure, including the annual financial statements of the Australian intelligence community. During this period the committee tabled their reviews of administration and expenditure Nos 6, 7 and 8 for the financial years 2006-07, 2007-08 and 2008-09. These reports were tabled in September 2009, May 2010 and June 2010 respectively.


The Review of Administration and Expenditure No. 8 (2008 - 2009) - Australian Intelligence Agencies made recom­mendations relating to the efficiency dividend and the funding of the Office of the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security, OIGIS, in particular. ONA's submission stated that, as a result of the efficiency dividend, there would be 'some modest reduction in ONA's analytical capacity'. Another agency stated that any additional reduction in their budget would significantly impact their operational activities. The committee was concerned about the impact of the efficiency dividend on the smaller agencies of the Australian intelligence community and therefore recommended that the Australian government review the potential adverse effects of the efficiency dividend on the AIC.


The committee also took the opportunity afforded by this review to look at the budget of the Office of the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security, OIGIS. The OIGIS's budget has not grown in line with ASIO's budget growth. In light of the increases in the number of personnel and activities of the Australian intelligence community as well as an expansion in the IGIS's role, the committee recommended that the budget of the Office of the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security be increased.


The Review of Administration and Expenditure No. 7 - Australian Intelligence Agencies noted the difficulties that some agencies have experienced in relation to staff recruitment. The competitive job market, growth within agencies and the desire to ensure staff are of an appropriate calibre has raised some challenges in this area. In response, agencies have sought to invest in reviewing and better developing their recruitment strategies.


Two reports on the listing of organisations as terrorist organisations were tabled in the period under review. The two reports dealt with five organisations comprising four re-listings and one initial listing. The reports were: the Review of the re-listing of Hamas' Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades (the Brigades), the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT), and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) as terrorist organisations under the Criminal Code Act 1995; and, the Review of the listing of Al-Shabaab as a terrorist organisation under the Criminal Code Act 1995.


Seven public submissions were received in relation to the re-listing and the committee held a hearing on 22 October 2009. The committee did not recommend disallowance of any of the regulations in relation to the five organisations.


Since 2002 the committee has sent representatives to the biennial conference of oversight agencies. In 2010, the conference was hosted by the PJCIS and the IGIS in Sydney between Sunday, 21 March 2010 and Wednesday, 24 March 2010 and members of the committee attended. Delegates from Belgium, Canada, New Zealand, Poland, South Africa, United Kingdom and the United States attended the 2010 conference in Sydney with a number giving presentations on their oversight structures.


In conclusion, and on behalf of the committee, I would like to thank all those who have contributed to the work of the committee during the past year, in particular Mr Robert Little, the inquiry secretary, and former committee secretary Dr Margot Kerley, who has recently retired. I commend the report to the House.


Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.

Mr RUDDOCK
 (Berowra) (20:05):  I take this opportunity to thank the chair for his remarks. I endorse his comments about the committee secretariat, particularly Mr Robert Little and our former secretary Dr Margot Kerley. Can I just observe that this report relates to activities under the chairmanship of our former colleague and member for Brisbane, Arch Bevis. I acknowledge the very considerable personal interest he took in these matters and the leadership he undertook in relation to the committee's activities. I commend the comments and observations made by the present chair.


I will spend a moment or two focusing on a couple of issues that I think are particularly germane—and not necessarily those emphasised by my colleague. In relation to the Review of Administration and Expenditure No. 8 (2008 - 2009) - Australian Intelligence Agencies it was particularly interesting because the review is the first full review of the administration and expenditure of six intelligence agencies which the committee was able to look at as part of the Australian intelligence community, as we understand it. During this review, the committee found that a significant incon­sistency exists in relation to the way in which the oversight of the Australian intelligence community occurs. An agency whose role is in fact growing is now the subject of consideration by committees that have a different function and are not necessarily expert or do not necessarily have access to the broader information that might be relevant to examining an intelligence function.


The committee noted in its report that it had previously had evidence from a number of agencies that noted the work of the Australian Federal Police that had been developing since the terrorist attacks in the United States and the terrorist attacks in Bali. The committee noted that the Australian Federal Police have increasingly been involved in counterterrorist activities and that sections have been created to address significant counterterrorism and national security functions. I mention this because the committee made a recommendation that the Intelligence Services Act should be amended to include the Australian Federal Police counterterrorism elements in the list of organisations that the committee reviews.


The government has seen fit not to pick up that recommendation. I find that very disappointing. As I see it, there have already been substantial concerns about the work of intelligence agencies and the Australian Federal Police, which were not seen to be adequately integrated at earlier points in time. It warranted a review by Sir Laurence Street, initiated by the former Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police Mick Keelty, because it was seen to be a major oversight. I am concerned that the government is perpetuating that in the way in which it has considered this role. I understand that it was because perhaps the AFP did not want to be reporting to two committees. I suggest, with respect, that that was a very poor argument given that it was left with a committee that has no broader experience in the review of the intelligence community as a whole.



The other matter I want to draw attention to is the impact of efficiency dividends, which the committee noted in its earlier report for that same year. Most of the intelligence organisations are fairly small. The need for intelligence agencies has not in any way diminished. Their work is in fact growing, particularly in relation to counterespionage and the area of cyberterrorism. These are matters of public note, but in my judgment the impact of efficiency dividends is likely to diminish the ongoing effectiveness of the capacity of these organisations, which we have been trying to enhance. So I draw attention to our earlier comments on that matter in this report and encourage the government to be very focused on the need to ensure that the intelligence community is adequately resourced at a time when it is facing a growing challenge.

"Wilkie, Andrew, MP",Ind.,2011-06-20,"



Mr WILKIE
 (Denison) (20:41):  Who could forget the shocking images of animal cruelty we saw on the ABC Four Corners program exactly three weeks ago? For me the one image, more than any other, which is seared into my mind is that of the black beast shaking in fear, the look in its eyes one of abject terror because it was the last of a group to be slaughtered and it had been made to witness the shocking cruelty meted out to one animal after another. How on earth could the Howard, Rudd and Gillard governments have allowed such shocking animal mistreatment to have gone on day after day, night after night, in countless slaughter­houses in arguably our most important neighbour, especially one to whom we have such a close link and provide such significant aid?


It is not like these governments did not have cause to keep an eye on our live animal export trade given all the problems the business has experienced year after year in country after country. In the Middle East alone eight countries have been identified as mistreating Australian livestock during just the last eight years. It beggars belief that a succession of Australian governments have let us down in this way, as does the revelation that Meat and Livestock Australia has been fleecing producers for years, raking in enormous fees off the back of the lie it was looking after the interests of the Australian live animal export industry and the beasts it deals with, only to be busted as an irresponsible, incompetent, dishonest and uncaring bunch of cowboys.


No wonder there has been such an extraordinary welling up of public concern since the Four Cornersprogram. Even those who have been concerned with live animal exports for a long time felt energised to do whatever we could to finally do something and this bill, the Live Animal Export Restriction and Prohibition Bill 2011, will do just that. Most importantly the bill will end all live animal exports by mid-2014, as it should, because the live animal export system is broken and beyond repair and the arguments against shutting it down are baseless.


For a start, ending all live animal exports will not destroy our relationship with Indonesia because our ties with that country are stronger than critics give them credit for and are certainly strong enough to survive our decision to stop selling just one form of one particular foodstuff. Nor will Indonesians go hungry, because on average they consume just two kilograms of red meat each a year. In other words, even the complete removal of Australian beef would make virtually no difference whatsoever, except for more affluent Indonesians who tend to eat Australian beef and who have the means to purchase and store boxed Australian meat processed by Australian workers in Australian abattoirs. And the Indonesian government plans to be beef self-sufficient by 2014 anyway.


The religious dimension of this matter has also been mischievously overcooked by the live animal export industry, because the fact is that the overwhelming number of relatively affluent Muslims who tend to consume Australian meat would have no objection to buying that meat so long as it has been processed in an Australian halal certified abattoir. Moreover, the argument that banning live cattle exports to Indonesia will somehow destroy the beef industry is ridiculous. The direct and indirect value of the red meat industry in Australia is something in the order of $17 billion dollars, and it employs some 55,000 workers. By comparison, the live export trade comes in at about $1 billion and 10,000 workers. In other words, ending the live export trade will have a marginal effect, even more so when the workers shift to the processed meat sector.


The economic argument is in fact strongly in favour of banning live animal exports, because of the way the trade is cannibalising the processed meat industry at the expense of thousands of Australian jobs. Any short-term commercial jolt will be limited, while the medium- to long-term benefit will be enormous. In any case, the three-year phase out period stipulated in the bill gives the industry more than enough time to move from live to processed meat. For a start, within 12 months the mothballed abattoirs in Katherine and Innisfail could be refurbished and reopened, the mooted abattoir in Darwin could be well on its way to completion and thousands of unemployed and under­employed workers could be trained.


This bill dovetails perfectly with the motion of the member for Kennedy, which seeks to energise the government's imm­ediate response to Australia's live animal export crisis. His motion, which I seconded and which is endorsed by both Animals Australia and the RSPCA, demands the immediate implementation of safeguards in Indonesia, including the deployment of Australian government officials as well as the provision of stun-guns and other equipment, before a speedy resumption of exports. This is, I feel, a sensible and politically realistic approach: to quickly put in place effective animal welfare safeguards before the resumption of trade, pending the winding up of the industry within three years. Such an approach also considers the graziers, the Indigenous station hands, the truckers, the shipping-line operators, the feed producers and everyone else involved in the live animal export industry who are in difficulty right now from the jolt of this entirely warranted, but nonetheless unexpected, decision by government. Fast-tracking safeguards in Indonesia is also the only way to help the tens of thousands of animals currently in Indonesian feedlots which are being, and will continue to be, treated in exactly the same way as the poor animals we saw on Four Corners three weeks ago.


Yes, I certainly do see the point in abolishing the industry immediately, because the live animal export trade is deeply flawed and no amount of remedial action can be sure to safeguard the animals. But good public policy demands a balance between rhetoric and reality. There is no point coming in here with a popular response which fails to help at least the tens of thousands of Australian animals already in Indonesia. Nor is there any point coming in here and calling for an outcome knowing full well it is just theatre and there is no chance whatsoever of it being achieved.


Much has been said on compensation for the Australian live animal export industry. Yes, the government should help the industry deal with the current moratorium's commercial jolt, but let us not forget that it is Meat and Livestock Australia which stands out as the organisation funded and trusted to safeguard Australia's live animal export trade and that it is Meat and Livestock Australia which has not given a toss except to suck up the cash while showing complete and utter contempt for the industry which pays its bills. Nor has MLA apparently shown the slightest regard for the poor Australian beasts in its care, which, by any ethical measure, should be treated overseas to the same standard or better as is demanded in this country. In other words: it is MLA which should now put its grubby hands into its very deep pockets and pull out the cash needed to help support the live animal export industry while the Australian government puts in place the safeguards necessary for trade to resume.


This country is at a crossroad. Yes, the government has done the right thing by imposing a moratorium on live animal exports to Indonesia, and I applaud it and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry for doing so. But the real measure of the government is what it does next. The government must put animal welfare and the public interest ahead of everything else. It must move urgently to put in place the safeguards needed to protect the tens of thousands of beasts already in feedlots in Indonesia and those which would follow them once the trade is allowed to resume. More broadly, I call on everyone in this place to support the Live Animal Export Restriction and Prohibition Bill 2011. It already has the support of Animals Australia and the RSPCA. The support of the parliament will legislate the safeguards our animals need right now and shut down a trade that is fundamentally broken, systemically cruel and definitely not in Australia's economic interest.

"Wilkie, Andrew, MP",Ind.,2011-06-20,"



Mr WILKIE
 (Denison) (20:41):  Who could forget the shocking images of animal cruelty we saw on the ABC Four Corners program exactly three weeks ago? For me the one image, more than any other, which is seared into my mind is that of the black beast shaking in fear, the look in its eyes one of abject terror because it was the last of a group to be slaughtered and it had been made to witness the shocking cruelty meted out to one animal after another. How on earth could the Howard, Rudd and Gillard governments have allowed such shocking animal mistreatment to have gone on day after day, night after night, in countless slaughter­houses in arguably our most important neighbour, especially one to whom we have such a close link and provide such significant aid?


It is not like these governments did not have cause to keep an eye on our live animal export trade given all the problems the business has experienced year after year in country after country. In the Middle East alone eight countries have been identified as mistreating Australian livestock during just the last eight years. It beggars belief that a succession of Australian governments have let us down in this way, as does the revelation that Meat and Livestock Australia has been fleecing producers for years, raking in enormous fees off the back of the lie it was looking after the interests of the Australian live animal export industry and the beasts it deals with, only to be busted as an irresponsible, incompetent, dishonest and uncaring bunch of cowboys.


No wonder there has been such an extraordinary welling up of public concern since the Four Cornersprogram. Even those who have been concerned with live animal exports for a long time felt energised to do whatever we could to finally do something and this bill, the Live Animal Export Restriction and Prohibition Bill 2011, will do just that. Most importantly the bill will end all live animal exports by mid-2014, as it should, because the live animal export system is broken and beyond repair and the arguments against shutting it down are baseless.


For a start, ending all live animal exports will not destroy our relationship with Indonesia because our ties with that country are stronger than critics give them credit for and are certainly strong enough to survive our decision to stop selling just one form of one particular foodstuff. Nor will Indonesians go hungry, because on average they consume just two kilograms of red meat each a year. In other words, even the complete removal of Australian beef would make virtually no difference whatsoever, except for more affluent Indonesians who tend to eat Australian beef and who have the means to purchase and store boxed Australian meat processed by Australian workers in Australian abattoirs. And the Indonesian government plans to be beef self-sufficient by 2014 anyway.


The religious dimension of this matter has also been mischievously overcooked by the live animal export industry, because the fact is that the overwhelming number of relatively affluent Muslims who tend to consume Australian meat would have no objection to buying that meat so long as it has been processed in an Australian halal certified abattoir. Moreover, the argument that banning live cattle exports to Indonesia will somehow destroy the beef industry is ridiculous. The direct and indirect value of the red meat industry in Australia is something in the order of $17 billion dollars, and it employs some 55,000 workers. By comparison, the live export trade comes in at about $1 billion and 10,000 workers. In other words, ending the live export trade will have a marginal effect, even more so when the workers shift to the processed meat sector.


The economic argument is in fact strongly in favour of banning live animal exports, because of the way the trade is cannibalising the processed meat industry at the expense of thousands of Australian jobs. Any short-term commercial jolt will be limited, while the medium- to long-term benefit will be enormous. In any case, the three-year phase out period stipulated in the bill gives the industry more than enough time to move from live to processed meat. For a start, within 12 months the mothballed abattoirs in Katherine and Innisfail could be refurbished and reopened, the mooted abattoir in Darwin could be well on its way to completion and thousands of unemployed and under­employed workers could be trained.


This bill dovetails perfectly with the motion of the member for Kennedy, which seeks to energise the government's imm­ediate response to Australia's live animal export crisis. His motion, which I seconded and which is endorsed by both Animals Australia and the RSPCA, demands the immediate implementation of safeguards in Indonesia, including the deployment of Australian government officials as well as the provision of stun-guns and other equipment, before a speedy resumption of exports. This is, I feel, a sensible and politically realistic approach: to quickly put in place effective animal welfare safeguards before the resumption of trade, pending the winding up of the industry within three years. Such an approach also considers the graziers, the Indigenous station hands, the truckers, the shipping-line operators, the feed producers and everyone else involved in the live animal export industry who are in difficulty right now from the jolt of this entirely warranted, but nonetheless unexpected, decision by government. Fast-tracking safeguards in Indonesia is also the only way to help the tens of thousands of animals currently in Indonesian feedlots which are being, and will continue to be, treated in exactly the same way as the poor animals we saw on Four Corners three weeks ago.


Yes, I certainly do see the point in abolishing the industry immediately, because the live animal export trade is deeply flawed and no amount of remedial action can be sure to safeguard the animals. But good public policy demands a balance between rhetoric and reality. There is no point coming in here with a popular response which fails to help at least the tens of thousands of Australian animals already in Indonesia. Nor is there any point coming in here and calling for an outcome knowing full well it is just theatre and there is no chance whatsoever of it being achieved.


Much has been said on compensation for the Australian live animal export industry. Yes, the government should help the industry deal with the current moratorium's commercial jolt, but let us not forget that it is Meat and Livestock Australia which stands out as the organisation funded and trusted to safeguard Australia's live animal export trade and that it is Meat and Livestock Australia which has not given a toss except to suck up the cash while showing complete and utter contempt for the industry which pays its bills. Nor has MLA apparently shown the slightest regard for the poor Australian beasts in its care, which, by any ethical measure, should be treated overseas to the same standard or better as is demanded in this country. In other words: it is MLA which should now put its grubby hands into its very deep pockets and pull out the cash needed to help support the live animal export industry while the Australian government puts in place the safeguards necessary for trade to resume.


This country is at a crossroad. Yes, the government has done the right thing by imposing a moratorium on live animal exports to Indonesia, and I applaud it and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry for doing so. But the real measure of the government is what it does next. The government must put animal welfare and the public interest ahead of everything else. It must move urgently to put in place the safeguards needed to protect the tens of thousands of beasts already in feedlots in Indonesia and those which would follow them once the trade is allowed to resume. More broadly, I call on everyone in this place to support the Live Animal Export Restriction and Prohibition Bill 2011. It already has the support of Animals Australia and the RSPCA.

Mr CHAMPION
 (Wakefield) (21:01):  I move:




That this House:





(1) notes the:





(a) Australian Building and Construction Commission (ABCC) created under the Howard


Government'
s industrial 
relations legislation unfairly targets workers in the construction


industry; and





(b) Government believes the current ABCC should be abolished and replaced with a new


inspectorate that is part of the Fair Work Australia system; and





(2) calls on all 
m
embers to support the abolition of the ABCC to restore fairness in the construction


industry for workers and employers.



The Australian Building and Construction Commission is a regulator that was conceived as part of the legislative malice that the previous Howard government exhibited to organised labour and to the working men and women of this country. It is a malice that we have seen over 100 years. We saw it in the 1890s, in the shearers' strikes; we saw it in the 1930s, in the railway strikes that brought Ben Chifley to this parliament; we saw it in Mudginberri and the disputes of the eighties; and we saw it on the docks with the dogs and balaclavas and the illegal sacking of Australians simply for being members of a union.


We see this malice towards the working men and women in the construction industry—900,000 people singled out for special observance under special powers and special prosecution with special penalties. All of this is simply because they want to be part of a union and want to organise and exert their rights at work. The ABCC is the last remaining edifice in the legislative malice that was Work Choices and the 1998 Workplace Relations Act. The then government sought to insert into Australian law all of the unfairness and viciousness that they had in their hearts for organised labour.


The building industry is at the heart of our economy. It is an industry that is robust, diverse and at times troubled. There are many examples of this. I am sure members opposite will make plenty of remarks and observations about the conduct of unions and workers. But we know this is an industry that has huge problems with sham contracting, phoenix companies, unpaid entitlements and bills to other firms. We know it is an industry with a problem with the employment of illegal workers. 


The Sydney Morning Herald on 26 June 2011 observed the death of a Mr Hwang who had been working illegally in Australia since 1998 and who had died of a respiratory illness. He died a pauper. He was an illegal worker in the tiling industry and one of many in that industry who are subject to those conditions. He had never been on an employer's books and was never paid any superannuation. On the website Adelaide Now on 9 March 2011 was the headline 'Dodgy builders ""out of control""', and the story referred to underpaid construction workers, many of them illegal workers, flooding into South Australia's construction industry. It outlined the cases of workers on the SAPOL building site who were owed $200,000 in wages by a subcontractor who had fled the country. There were individuals there who were owed $11,000—one was owed $18,000—and these are just some of the examples of workers in this industry who have been ripped off, underpaid and undocumented and who have taken Australian jobs.


When we look at how the ABCC has performed and what it has done about problems such as these, we see they have received $182 million over the last few years and have had exactly five employer prosecutions. There were zero in 2006, zero in 2007, zero in 2009 and zero in 2010. Less than five per cent of all prosecutions were of employers. These were quiet years for the ABCC. This was because this regulator is myopic and blinkered. It was conceived in malice—that is why it has to go.


It is a regulator that has not fairly applied the rule of law to this industry. It has not put in place safeguards to protect civil liberties or workers. It has not looked to be a fair regulator for the Australian people, and that is why we look forward to it being replaced by a regulator that will put at its heart the rule of law, will protect civil liberties such as the right to a lawyer and will enshrine in legislation a sunset clause to protect Australians from its extraordinary powers. This is a regulator that was born of malice, and it must be replaced by a regulator that is born of fairness.

"Ley, Sussan, MP",LP,2011-06-20,"



Ms LEY
 (Farrer) (21:06):  Tonight's debate calling on members to support the abolition of the Australian Building and Construction Commission is a prudent opportunity to remind the Australian public of why the ABCC was established. The coalition set up the ABCC in response to the Cole Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry when the brutal thuggery of some unions and businesses was making it impossible for small business and independent contractors to access sites without conceding to often unlawful union demands. Australians fully supported the Howard government's establishment of the ABCC, appreciating that we needed a body with the clout to enforce law and order on building and construction sites around Australia. The ABCC is responsible for monitoring conduct in the industry and prosecuting unlawful industrial action, breaches of freedom of association laws and addressing all complaints of unlawfulness in the industry. We have seen bikies on the West Gate Bridge, union officials being prosecuted over threats to kill, and illegal blockades of building sites. The blockade by the CFMEU at the Melbourne Markets relocation project site, between 19 May 2010 and 28 May 2010, is a prime example. The CFMEU refused to accept the greenfields agreement between the developer and the Australian Workers Union. Construction was blocked for 10 days by union members. Such heavy-handed, illegal behaviour on the part of unions provides the evidence of the need for the ABCC. When we have union officials blockading worksites with cars and rocks, and going as far as allegedly luring kangaroos onto a worksite to disrupt building, we have a real problem. This behaviour is unacceptable in Australian workplaces. It is a direct attack on prod­uctivity and employers, and the vandalism and obstruction that occurs on construction sites in Australia needs to cease.


Without the ABCC, Australia could descend back to the dark old days of corruption and heavy-handed union bullying. Yet preventing the bully-boy tactics of unions is not the only role of the ABCC. They do go into bat for workers, ensuring they receive the correct pay and entitlements. Workers at the Pentridge Prison Apartment development received back pay recently, when the ABCC became aware of allegations of underpayments following reports on Melbourne media saying that workers at the site had been locked out and had not been paid their wages. The ABCC can provide one-on-one advice to employers in the building and construction industry about classifications and hourly rates, record-keeping obligations, leave and termination issues and employment condit­ions. Yet Labor's contempt for the ABCC is longstanding. Despite going to the 2007 election committing to keep a tough cop on the beat, they are now backflipping—proposing to give the minister the capacity to issue directions to Fair Work Australia about the policies, programs, priorities and the manner in which the powers and functions of the building industry inspectorate are exercised and performed. This is in stark contrast to a commitment made by the now Prime Minister when she was confronted with a sea of yellow T-shirt wearing protestors in Brisbane in 2009. She stated:


Like me, I am sure you were appalled to read of dangerous car chases across Melbourne city involving carloads of balaclava-wearing people, criminal damage to vehicles resulting in arrests, threats of physical violence and intimidation …


Balaclavas, violence and intimidation must be unreservedly condemned … and the Rudd Labor government will do everything necessary to ensure that we do not see this appalling conduct again.


That is what the Prime Minister said.


It is a real shame that the Gillard Labor government does not share this commitment, and the only promise that matters now is one that has apparently been made to the backroom boys of the unions. Unfortunately, the faceless men of the Labor Party are once again pushing their own agenda. And if it means holding an industry hostage to enact their own power plays then this is exactly what they want to do.


The coalition supports the Australian Building and Construction Commission, and we definitely support the need for keeping a tough cop on the beat. This private member's motion is nothing short of a pathetic Labor attempt to appease its faceless union bosses.

Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston) (21:11):  I am very pleased to second this motion. I would like to thank the member for Wakefield for bringing it to the House tonight. This motion rightly points out that the Howard government's Australian Building and Construction Commission has unfairly targeted building and construction unions and their individual workers. It is clear from the comparison of the total number of successful prosecutions made by the ABCC. We have five for employers—



Mr Briggs interjecting—




Ms RISHWORTH:
  The member for Mayo has just walked in. I am sure he was critical, just as he was with Work Choices, in the back room, in coming up with the best plan about how to target unions and their rank and file members—because we know he has some runs on the board there. However, we saw five successful prosecutions of employer groups and 86 of employee organisations. The previous speaker suggested—and I find it very hard to believe—that there were no other issues, that employers in the building and construction industry never do anything wrong; they never have issues where they underpay their workers or do not hold high health and safety standards. Those numbers I think clearly state that this organisation was there to target unions and their rank and file members. This is a very important point because we do need to make sure both employees and employers are held accountable. It is important that employers do uphold health and safety standards as well as their employees and ensure that there are decent conditions for workers on building sites and workplaces right around this country.


It is not surprising that this was created by the Howard government, because they created so many things, including their first wave of industrial relations changes in 1998 and then their second wave, through Work Choices, where they got a little giddy with their Senate majority and decided to really rip away the wages and conditions of ordinary Australians that deserved—



Mr Briggs interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  Order! The member for Mayo can tell us when he gets his chance.




Ms RISHWORTH:
  good health and safety standards and good conditions at work. There are many who believe that, as a result of the culture of fear and intimidation that occurred as a result of the ABCC, workers could not feel they could voice their concerns about their workplace. They did not feel that they could raise health and safety issues or their entitlements, that under the ABCC if they did raise these issues or took action to address these issues they would be compulsorily interrogated and not be provided the appropriate protections and safeguards, including the fundamental right to legal representation. So it is no wonder that there are many that believe that there were reduced safety standards on building sites, increased injury rates and reduced access to employee advocates and unions for workers. And, as a result of the climate of fear and intimidation, there are many who felt they could no longer put their tools down to ensure that safety was there on the worksite. One particular story was related to me about how this affected a construction site. There was a site on which water supplies were turned off by management despite the fact that temperatures were topping about 45 degrees on some days. When water supplies were turned on again, black sludge then flowed from the taps, so workers determined that the lack of water constituted a significant safety risk and walked off the job until water supplies were fixed. However, some months later, the workers who walked off the job, as well as their friends and colleagues at the construction site, were subject to what they felt was threatening and unwarranted interrogation to determine whether a safety risk was sufficiently immediate to warrant walking off the job. I am not sure about you, Madam Deputy Speaker, but I think black sludge and no access to water are an evident safety risk, and it is no wonder that in this example—and I am sure there are many others—workers felt that they were unfairly targeted by the ABCC.


It seems that with the previous government there was an obsession with targeting workers, an obsession with reducing their pay and conditions, an obsession with ensuring that people did not get a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. It has been this Labor government that has taken action to create Fair Work Australia, to restore the safety net that was destroyed by the previous government. On that point, I commend the motion to the House.

"Andrews, Karen, MP",LP,2011-06-20,"



Mrs ANDREWS
 (McPherson) (21:16):  I rise to speak against the motion by the member for Wakefield to abolish the Australian Building and Construction Commission. There are many years of history to industrial disputation in the building and construction industry, and there have been a number of investigations and inquiries into that sector over the years.


In the late 1980s—more than 20 years ago—the full bench of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission conducted a review into the building and construction industry. Extensive submissions were made to the full bench by employers and unions on a wide range of industry practices, resulting in the consolidation of a number of awards into the National Building and Construction Industry Award 1990. The full bench found, firstly, that there was inconsistent industrial regulation between the federal and state jurisdictions and that a framework should be developed to deal with those issues; secondly, that the paid rates system should be abandoned in favour of a minimum rate plus a supplementary payment or allowance, which was consistent with the prevailing wage fixation principles; and, thirdly, that a single award should be established with a rationalisation of respondents. This was a step in improving the performance of the building and construction industry, but clearly more work needed to be done on reforming some entrenched practices in the industry.


In early 2001 the government called for an initial report into the building and construction industry. An investigation was undertaken by the Employment Advocate on a wide range of matters such as breaches of freedom of association, including the forcing of construction workers to join a union; the pursuit of contractors to enter into an agreement in possible breach of the Workplace Relations Act; strike pay; and right of entry. This report was the precursor to the Cole Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry.


Whilst there were more than 200 recommendations, Commissioner Cole spec­ifically recommended changes to ensure bargaining only at enterprise level, elimin­ating pattern bargaining; mechanisms to 'ensure that any participant in the industry causing loss to other participants as a result of unlawful industrial action is held responsible for that loss'; mechanisms to ensure that disputes are settled in accordance with legislated or agreed dispute resolution procedures 'rather than by the application of industrial and commercial pressure'; and the creation of an independent body which:


… will ensure that participants comply with industrial, civil and criminal laws applicable to all Australians … as well as industry specific laws applicable to this industry only.


The legislation that gave effect to the Cole commission's desire for the implementation of the rule of law included the Workplace Relations Amendment (Codifying Contempt Offences) Act 2004 and later the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005. The second act commenced in September 2005, with its main object being to provide an improved industrial relations framework:


… to ensure that building work is carried out fairly, efficiently and productively for the benefit of all building industry participants and for the benefit of the Australian economy as a whole.


This act provided for the establishment of the Australian Building and Construction Commission.


The role of the commission is to monitor and promote appropriate standards of conduct throughout the building and construction industries. As well as an education and training role, the ABCC can, and has, instituted proceedings for contrav­entions of laws relating to freedom of association, coercion in agreement making, right of entry, strike pay, sham arrangements and unfair services contracts. Specifically, when the ABCC uncovers a contravention, it will initiate proceedings in the courts or Fair Work Australia, and to date the courts have imposed $4,123,125 in penalties, $698,300 suspended, in successful ABCC cases. From its inception in October 2005 through to 31 May 2011, the ABCC has been successful in 74 cases and unsuccessful in only eight cases. The majority of proceedings have been in Victoria, which has had a long and difficult history with the building and construction industry, including the bitter disputation leading to the deregistration of the Builders Labourers Federation in 1986.


The ABCC has a very positive role to play in monitoring and ensuring compliance with relevant legislation in an industry that has been dogged by practices which, if not unlawful, are precariously close. The greatest risk in the abolition of the ABCC is that the positive progress that has been made to date in reforming this industry will be eroded. If that happens there is a risk that there will be a return to the poor practices that were prevalent during the— (Time expired)

"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,2011-06-20,"



Mr LAURIE FERGUSON
 (Werriwa) (21:21):  That was a very interesting recitation of historical events, but I think the reality is better summarised by George Williams in an article on 6 July 2010 in the Sydney Morning Herald. He noted that this legislation:


… can be applied to anyone. Workers can be brought in, not because they are suspected of wrongdoing, but to report on the activities of their co-workers. Family members, including young children, can be told to reveal information about a parent in the building industry.


… One person who just happened to be passing a building site was reported in this paper—


that is, the Sydney Morning Herald; it is not the construction union making this report—


to have been ''hauled in for several hours of secret questioning'' after seeing a confrontation between a union official and a building manager.


That is a recitation of the truth, the coercive powers in this legislation, coercive powers that the police forces of this country lack in many cases in regard to real criminality. As other speakers have indicated, there is a total imbalance in the way this organisation has operated. That is because it has a very close association with the infamous Cole royal commission into the industry. As the member for Mayo well knows, it was a politically driven royal commission and totally discredited. 


There is a total imbalance in the way this organisation has operated in the industry. That is derived from the way it was created and the reasons that the Howard government created it. There is a situation here where the industry in Sydney is characterised by the heavy use of imported labour. In Sydney people are locked on sites and are not allowed to leave the place where they are working. They are living on rations. On many building sites in Sydney you not only have the worker; you have his spouse working on the building site for no payment providing food. In some cases we have got a situation where, as the mover of this motion indicated, the amounts of money owed to these workers are horrendous. There has been very little activity by this organisation in regard to—



Mr Briggs interjecting—




Mr LAURIE FERGUSON:
  Name them? You would be advised to read a few newspapers and do a bit of research for the first time in your life. The situation here, as I say, is that there is a total imbalance in the way the organisation has operated. The member for Mayo will be able, of course, because he is such a knowledgeable person in this field, to recite case after case where this organisation has pursued employers in regard to sham contracting, in regard to pyramid company operations, in regard to underpayment. I challenge him to come forward with those, because previous speakers on this side have indicated the large degree to which union officials and individual workers have been prosecuted. That is a challenge to you, my friend.


We have seen $30 million of taxpayers' money expended on a series of unsuccessful prosecutions, nationally covered, in relation to Ark Tribe and others that were exonerated. It is also worth noting a poll by Essential Media in November 2010 which indicated public opinion on these matters. They said that 63 per cent of Australians were opposed to the fines this organisation could impose and 55 per cent of Australians were opposed to the way in which evidence was produced. With regard to seeking documents it was 58 per cent, and another 60 per cent were opposed to the use of these industrial laws in general. So Australian public opinion is very much concerned about the extreme powers this body has.


It is also worth noting an article by Bernard Keane in Crikey. I know the member will comment on this as well. It certainly demolishes some of the research by Econtech in regard to the way in which this has been justified. A figure of 9.4 per cent for productivity improvements was put forward by that research. Once again that supposed gain for the industry was demolished by the Wilcox royal commission. The situation here is that severe problems in the industry are being ignored. This organisation is one whose agenda is essentially driven by a biased position. We do not see any concern about donors in Western Australia on the wharves who have said they are prepared to bring guns onto building sites to solve industrial problems. There is no activity or prosecution by this organisation.


In summary, this is not $30 million worth of taxpayers' money well spent. It is an organisation which has been discredited by the failure of its activities. Its prosecutions have been essentially unsuccessful, it has been regarded by the Australian people as having too extensive powers, powers that go beyond any other body in this country, and it is selective in who it has concentrated on.

Mr BRIGGS
 (Mayo) (21:26):  It does give me great pleasure to speak on this motion moved by my little friend over there, the member for Wakefield. I must say I am surprised that the member for Wakefield has moved this motion. I cannot quite work out the connection. He is obviously trying to find some connection into the Left in South Australia. We have got Don's children here in the parliament tonight. We have got the member for Wakefield, the member for Adelaide and the member for Kingston, Don's children, before us—born out of the SDA, given birth to by Senator Don Farrell, who famously yesterday wished the Minister for Foreign Affairs happy anniversary, this week being the anniversary of fundamental injustice.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  The member must stop reflecting on members in the parliament and get to the motion.




Mr BRIGGS:
  I am just reflecting that it is a surprising motion moved by a paid-up operating member of the SDA. I will say another thing about the two former practising industrial advocates over on the other side who both referred to the 1998 workplace relations act. I thought they would have known better; it was 1996 to begin with. They were reforms moved in 1986, landmark reforms from a great workplace relations minister, Peter Reith, the former member for Flinders, a fantastic minister for workplace relations who got things done, who fixed the wharves. I notice the member for Wakefield referred to that earlier in his remarks. 


This is an industry that was littered with illegality, where the rule of law no longer applied. Terence Cole QC in a royal commission found example after example of illegality which bedevilled this industry, which added cost to buildings across this country, reduced productivity across this country. The previous speaker, the member for Werriwa, has got a great connection with the CFMEU, a long-term connection which he should have declared during his remarks, although it is so well-known he probably did not need to. 


What those on the other side forget to mention is that this legislation deals with both sides. If there is illegality in the system, both sides of the argument will be prosecuted. It was out of the royal commission of Terence Cole, a very well-credentialled man who those on the other side were very happy to support in 2007 when he conducted another royal commission, which may have involved the former member for Mayo. They were very happy to support his inquiry then. But when he did this inquiry he was some sort of political partisan. The truth is that he was not. What he found was disgraceful and disgusting and needed to be acted upon. That is what the Howard government did, because that is what the Howard government did when they were in government: they delivered legislation which delivered high real wages, more jobs, higher productivity. They delivered legislation which fixed up this industry which was riddled with illegality, which was riddled with behaviour which I am surprised that the member for Wakefield is supporting, I must say. It does surprise me that the former SDA organisers, Don's children over there, are so supportive of this union and its activities. 


Of course, not all members of the CFMEU are bad people. There are some members of the CFMEU who are good, hard-working Australians. This legislation has never sought to take any action on them; it seeks to take action on those who break the law. That is who it seeks to take action on, that is what it was designed to do and that is what it has been doing. That is why it is an utter disgrace that these people want to take it away. I will tell you why they want to take it away. They have been talking about the corruptibility of political parties with donations. The reason they want to take this away is the donations they receive from their mates in the trade union movement. That is all that this is about.

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (21:30):  I rise to put on the record how delighted I was to attend the Disaster Recognition Ceremony at South Bank in Brisbane on Sunday 12 June 2011. At this ceremony we paid tribute to our many Queensland and Brisbane flood heroes. Can I say from the outset how honoured I am to represent an electorate and a state where so many brave people, young and old, went to extreme lengths to help their neighbours, friends, family and in some cases total strangers in their time of need.


At ceremonies held across the state as part of Queensland Week 2011, 3,500 men and women from across Queensland were acknowledged for their efforts. It makes it truly inspiring to call Queensland home. As a community, as a city and as a state we fronted up to the challenge, we supported each other and we came through it stronger and more determined than ever.


My electorate suffered, but Ryan is a wonderful community. Indeed, it is a collection of communities. It is a special place where people look out for one another, where friends and even total strangers greet one another and, most importantly, where people do not hesitate when asked to go above and beyond the call of duty.


It is worth noting that during the January floods, no-one had to be asked to help. Busloads of the very heroes we honoured two Sundays ago turned up in droves to parks, streets and neighbourhoods all over Brisbane. With a bucket, mop and gloves in hand, locals were ready to help and ready to get our beautiful city back on its feet. It is fair to say that Brisbane would not have recovered as quickly without our heroes.


It is quite astonishing to comprehend, but with the help of the Army we achieved in three days what took three months after the 1974 floods. Much credit must go to the extraordinary leadership and work ethic of former Lord Mayor Campbell Newman, and to the Brisbane City Council, who arranged tetanus shots and organised the buses to get our heroes where they were needed.


There were so many everyday heroes who simply got out and about and helped with the clean-up. They are the reason the city of Brisbane was back on its feet in a matter of days. We really have so much to thank them for. Their work was extraordinary. It was a great privilege to witness so many of these flood heroes receive their awards. It was a moving ceremony, as it had been a moving experience to watch the outpour of community spirit during the January 2011 floods.


When the floodwaters came, Brisbane was hit hard and hit fast. Thankfully, the community responded just as rapidly. It was humbling to see both friends and strangers go to each other's assistance. Whether it was helping to evacuate the elderly from their homes, or cooking for the tireless volunteers in the street, the fact is that if there was a job to be done there was someone in Brisbane prepared to volunteer and get it done.


I still to this day recall a visitor from America who was so completely amazed at the traffic jam of volunteers coming into Brisbane. I remember this young fellow saying that only in Australia would you see people actually driving towards the disaster.


The Disaster Recognition Ceremony in South Bank on Sunday was about paying tribute to the remarkable Brisbane residents who went above and beyond the call of duty. It saw the volunteers, emergency services workers and community members thanked for their steadfast community service during this summer of disasters.


As the federal member for Ryan I want to pay tribute to our outstanding community, our volunteers, our emergency service men and women and of course our everyday Brisbane residents who picked up their mops and buckets and were ready to be put to work. There are so many heroes around Queensland who contributed in so many ways following the floods and Cyclone Yasi. Many were acknowledged on the weekend and of course others will go unnoticed. The fact of the matter is that as a state we shone through those dark days. Again this has highlighted for me what a great place our community is to live, work and raise a family in, and I am very proud to represent it in the federal parliament.


Finally, we should never forget that there are so many people who have still not recovered from these disasters. As much as the physical damage may have been cleared away, they still need our support.

Mr BROADBENT
 (McMillan) (16:00):  As a former volunteer firefighter with a 12-year badge, I know the importance of the Australian Fire Services Medal. A local long-serving member of the Korumburra fire brigade was recognised on the Queen's Birthday Honours List. Billy, as he is known, was presented with the Australian Fire Services Medal. The medal recognises distinguished service by members of Australian fire services, especially volunteers. The AFSM, as it is known, award citation for Bill Rodda read:


Mr Rodda has given exemplary service to the Country Fire Authority … after joining the Korumburra Fire Brigade in 1974. His outstanding dedication and commitment are exemplified by his contribution to the safety and welfare of the community, by his leadership and support of the volunteer culture in general through his involvement as the leader of the Korumburra Brigade over a considerable period of time, and by his active representation of volunteers at the state level as a member of the governing body of the (then) Victorian Urban Fire Brigades Association, now known as the Volunteer Fire Brigades Victoria.


Mr Bill Rodda has served the fire brigade in Korumburra for 37 years. Mr Rodda is a Volunteer Fire Brigades Victoria district 9 president, and captain of his local brigade for 25 years. When told of his award, he commented, 'I am very honoured and shocked. I did not know that I would be considered good enough. For someone like myself, when you retire the CFA is great because there is lots to learn still, which keeps the grey matter kicking over. Socially it is great; I have met heaps of fantastic people through the CFA.'


At a recent joint presentation dinner on 7 May, operations manager Mark Jones presented 755 years worth of service awards to volunteers. He recognised the members and the employers who supported those volunteers as well as the members who are self-employed and the partners of those volunteers—and Maureen Rodda is one of those amazing women who support the Bill Roddas of this world. Bill was as surprised as several other members present that night when he presented two life memberships to two very surprised members of his local brigade: one to Don Allan, district group officer with the Leongatha Korumburra group, and one to Don Landry from Leongatha South. As I noticed Don Allan DGO with the Leongatha Korumburra group, I remembered the night of the Ash Wednesday bushfires. When we were thrown into the heat of the battle I called one of my very important leaders 'DOG' rather than 'DGO'. He has never forgiven me.

Mr COMBET
 (Charlton—Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (16:30):  The government is committed to introducing a price on carbon, and the 2011-12 budget makes some changes to existing climate change programs to better align with that objective. Introducing a price on carbon is a key reform for the government. The budget makes a number of changes for the Climate Change and Energy Efficiency portfolio to better align with the government's objectives. One of the changes within the budget is in relation to the National Solar Schools Program, which has assisted more than 2,600 schools. The program will close earlier than had initially been planned for. It will close in June 2013, generating a number of savings, including creating funding opportunities for energy efficiency, greenhouse and energy reporting, and Solar Cities programs.


Overall, departmental operating funding, of the appropriation funding, will total $435.1 million in 2011-12. That comprises operating funding of $142.3 million, down from $218 million in 2010-11; departmental capital funding of $11.3 million, which is down from $50.4 million in 2010-11; and administered funding of $289.5 million, down from $683.7 million in 2010-11. The major components of the administered funding are energy efficiency programs including the Home Insulation Program, the solar hot water initiative, Low Carbon Communities and a number of other, minor measures. The Office of the Renewable Energy Regulator will receive appropriation funding totalling $29.6 million in 2012-12. The department's operating funding decreases significantly from 2010-11 to 2011-12 and beyond, which reflects lapsing programs and one-off funding for what was then the Australian climate change regulatory authority that had been anticipated under the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. The department's funding does not reflect any funding for establishing a carbon price regulator at this point in time.


Major new measures for the portfolio announced in the budget include the savings I have already indicated from the National Solar Schools Program closure as well as the renewable energy target and implementation of legislative amendments for the Office of the Renewable Energy Regulator, the energy efficiency functions that I have alluded to, greenhouse and energy reporting over four years, the Solar Cities program and savings for the Green Loans and Green Start programs, which were previously reported in additional estimates.


All of these changes ensure that the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency has the resources that are necessary for the work that is ahead of it in its departmental functions: the formulation of an important reform in the form of a carbon price mechanism, the important work of the Office of the Renewable Energy Regulator and the necessary departmental capacity in systems to administer a number of important programs.


Amongst those important programs, the Home Insulation Program has received a good deal of attention over the last 12 months or so. This program, of course, has been the government's focus for dealing with the issues that arose in the implementation of the program. We implemented a foil insulation safety program with regard to foil insulation installed under the Home Insulation Program. That foil insulation safety program is now largely discharged. There is a more general program for non-foil insulation, and the government committed to inspecting a minimum of 150,000 households insulated with non-foil insulation. That inspection program is now also approaching a conclusion. The government sought a range of advice and analysis from organisations, including the CSIRO and a risk assessment organisation—Booz and Company—to advise on the announcement that the government made to draw the wind-up of the Home Insulation Program to a conclusion. We are confident that that will be concluded in the not-too-distant future. (Time expired)

Mr HUNT
 (Flinders) (16:35):  I ask the minister: on what date did any minister or departmental official first engage a market research firm or advertising agency on a commercial basis for any preparatory work in relation to the proposed carbon tax advertising campaign? On an associated matter, I refer to an announcement last Thursday that the government will spend $12 million on carbon tax advertising. Is this in addition to the $13.7 million allocated for the Climate Change Foundation Campaign in the 2011-12 budget, including a carryover from 2010-11? If so, what will the $13.7 million Climate Change Foundation Campaign funding be used for? Will any foundation campaign money be available towards carbon tax advertising in a supportive manner by non-government organisations?

Mr COMBET
 (Charlton—Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (16:36):  Firstly, of course, it is a responsibility of the department to engage contractors. I do not have the precise dates of engagement at this point in time, but it is a function of the department to engage contractors for that purpose. As I understand it, that process is still ongoing. When those contracts are finalised, they will be recorded on the AusTender site. In relation to the funding that has been announced, last week the government indicated that $12 million has been committed for a national advertising campaign. That is a new commitment. The shadow minister is referring to an amount of $13.7 million that the government had previously announced in relation to a climate change engagement campaign. That is a separate amount of funding that appeared in the budget for 2011-12. It is divided over both financial years. That $13.7 million appears as $5.5 million in the current financial year and $8.2 million in the financial year 2011-12. That $13.7 million was derived originally from what was described as the climate change foundation campaign in the previous term of parliament. There was an amount approximating, I think, $29 million allocated to that campaign. Approximately $15.3 million was returned to the budget, and the remaining $13.7 million was provided for the engagement campaign. So the $12 million announced last week for advertising is an additional commitment that the government has made.


These are measures that are important for ensuring that members of the community have access to the appropriate information at an appropriate time in relation to the measures that the government is taking in the area of climate change and energy efficiency. The engagement campaign funding is not advertising funding in the sense that it is funding television advertising, but it is providing an opportunity for working with organisations, including non-government organisations, to improve understanding of climate change issues and energy efficiency issues. The national advertising campaign for which $12 million has been committed will be to assist community understanding at an appropriate point in time. A final decision about the advertising campaign is yet to be taken and is contingent on further discussions being held and concluded, but the campaign would be intended to provide information to the community about the carbon pricing measures that the government is proposing to implement.


Of course, there has been a lot of community debate about the issue of carbon pricing, a lot of it led by the opposition—of course, extremely misleading and misrepresentative of the positions. I think the community is entitled to be informed about the important measures associated with a carbon price mechanism and in particular that, as the government has committed, at least half of the revenue generated by the carbon price mechanism would be dedicated towards assisting households to adjust to any price impacts associated with the introduction of a carbon price into the economy. Of course, other measures are also important, and the government has further committed that the carbon price revenue would also be disposed towards supporting jobs and competitiveness of the most affected industries and, furthermore, supporting other climate change programs and measures to support the investment in clean energy that we need to be able to reduce our emissions and substantially improve the contribution of cleaner energy sources to our energy supply.


So those generally are the commitments that the government has made. We are continuing to work on the detailed carbon price package. We do so through the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee. Contingent upon the outcome of those discussions, the detail of the carbon price mechanism will be announced, and I think it will be very important for the community generally to have access to reliable factual information about the carbon price itself and how it may impact upon people.

Mr COMBET
 (Charlton—Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (16:43):  Thank you to my close friend and colleague the member for Shortland. I see she is supported by the member for Gippsland in the thrust of that question. I think he was jumping up to ask it himself—almost! Of course, the government has taken a number of initiatives to ensure that the best quality information and research is made available for the consideration not just of the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee members on science and other matters but for members of the community generally. As part of the engagement strategy that generally obtains in the portfolio, the establishment of the Climate Commission is a very important part of engagement with the community.


Just quickly, though, I will point to some of the other measures before I go directly to the issue of the Climate Commission. The government, of course, commissioned Professor Ross Garnaut to update his 2008 Climate change review and in particular to focus on significant changes or improvements in expert knowledge that have implications for the key findings from his 2008 review. Professor Garnaut has concluded that update; he published eight papers and they have been consolidated into a recent book that has been published. So there is very comprehensive information about the science, the economics and the state of international negotiations contained in Professor Garnaut's work. The Productivity Commission was also asked to undertake analysis of the carbon pollution reduction policies of key countries around the world including China, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States. It found that all countries examined had adopted major policies. In fact, over a thousand policies were identified in the area of climate change intended to help reduce pollution levels. A key finding from the Productivity Commission was that a market mechanism in the form, for example, of an emissions trading scheme is unquestionably the cheapest and most efficient way of reducing pollution across an economy. Those are just two important measures that the government initiated in relation to climate change and to inform the carbon price debate and deliberations over policy.


Another important one though, as the member for Shortland has pointed to, is the establishment of the Climate Commission. It is chaired by Professor Tim Flannery, a former Australian of the Year. There are a number of other eminently qualified members of the commission, including Professor Will Steffen of the ANU, who is a world renowned climate scientist and who is also advising the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee. Recently the Climate Commission conducted a seminar within Parliament House. It was one of a series that it has conducted to date around the country. It commenced with a public forum in Geelong in Victoria and it has visited a number of other important regional areas around the country, particularly with a focus on communities in areas where there is a lot of employment in emissions-intensive and trade-exposed industries. They have been very successful fora at explaining the science and, to some degree, the economics of climate change.


In addition, the Climate Commission has published an important report updating the science which is titled The critical decade: climate science, risks and responses. There were four key findings from the Climate Commission's report. One of them was that there is no doubt that the climate is changing and that the evidence of this is overwhelming and entirely clear. The atmosphere is warming, the ocean is warming, ice is being lost from glaciers and icecaps, sea levels are rising and global surface temperatures are rising. The member for Tangney will no doubt appreciate this. He is unusually quiet while I am mentioning these matters. He is usually slightly more vociferous.



Dr Jensen interjecting—




Mr COMBET:
  The Climate Commission's document makes these changes very clear and states what the science is. Secondly, the report adverts to the fact that we are already seeing social, economic and environmental impacts from changes in the climate. Thirdly, the report traverses the area of the contribution of human activity and specifically the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation as contributing to climate change. Fourthly, it makes the point that this is the critical decision. Decisions that we make from now to 2020 will determine the severity of climate change that future generations have to deal with.

Mr COMBET
 (Charlton—Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (16:48):  When we publish the details of the carbon price mechanism and the entirety of the package, the government will make available the financials in relation to the carbon price mechanism. We are working from a set of principles that have been made public and that have been agreed in the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee. That included budget neutrality, or revenue neutrality, for the scheme for a number of the measures that were anticipated within it.


We have done an extraordinary amount of work over the last seven or eight months within the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee to devise a range of the measures that would operate for a carbon price. We published in February of this year the proposed framework for the carbon price mechanism. It is an emissions trading scheme that commences with a fixed price period of between three to five years.


There is in contemplation, within the principles that have been enunciated by the multiparty committee, the necessity for a number of things to occur. One of them is to ensure that households are assisted to meet the anticipated price impacts of a carbon price being introduced into the economy. The government from its standpoint has made clear, as I indicated in an earlier answer, that at least half of the revenue from the carbon price mechanism would be used to assist pensioners and low- and middle-income households with what we anticipate to be modest cost impacts.


In addition to that, a number of other measures generally—that I also adverted to in an earlier answer—are being contemplated within the broad description of support for jobs and competitiveness within the trade-exposed and emissions-intensive parts of the economy. This will be very important. The government for its part is contemplating a significant level of assistance for those industries that are in the emissions-intensive trade-exposed part of the economy. This will be important from the standpoint of supporting Australian jobs and it will be an important disposition of part of the revenue, as it were, of a carbon price mechanism. Further to that there will be measures, as we have generally described, to support further efforts to drive towards clean energy and other climate change programs.


All of these categories are the subject of detailed discussion within the multiparty committee context. It is not appropriate for me to go into them in greater detail at this point in time nor in relation to the financials of the carbon price package. We are yet to settle on key elements of it, including until there is a final agreement on what the starting carbon price will be. These are all matters that we are discussing within the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee at the moment. When we do settle on a package we will make available not just the detail of each of the measures but also the financial implications of the measures that are taken. That is the government's commitment. We will continue to do the work. We are aiming to finalise this in the not too distant future and make the material available for consideration by the community, which is again why it is important that the government does communicate the detail of these matters to the members of the community in the way that we have foreshadowed.


This is, at the end of the day, I think, the most significant environmental and economic reform that a government will have undertaken. It is extremely important for the country's future. It is an important investment in the country's future as well. It will operate by obliging the largest emitters of carbon pollution in our economy—they number less than a thousand entities—to pay a carbon price for each tonne of pollution that they generate. That is an important distinction from the way that it is being misrepresented by the opposition. They are the largest emitters of carbon pollution in our economy that would have a liability under the carbon price mechanism and it is the revenue that is generated by the payment of that obligation that would support the general categories that I have described: the household assistance, the support for jobs and competitiveness, and the drive towards a clean energy economy.

Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (16:53):  Recently I met with members of the Climate Commission, as did other members of the committee which I chair, and that includes the member for Shortland. I also attended the presentations by the commission both here in Parliament House and in Adelaide. Furthermore, I attended a Christian coalition on climate change forum, which the member for Isaacs and the member for Flinders also attended, where we heard from a scientist there and other speakers on the issue of climate change.


It is clear to me from the summaries provided by all of those at each of those forums that the evidence supporting the view that climate change is real and that carbon dioxide emissions are contributing to it is very strong. However, it is also clear that there is a campaign underway of some kind to discredit that science. I was very pleased to hear this morning that some of the scientists have come out in support of their fellow scientists on this very issue.


My question to you, Minister, is twofold. Firstly, are you aware—and I appreciate the response you gave earlier to the member for Shortland—of any country or any government that refutes the science of climate change? Secondly, given that it is quite often raised that carbon dioxide emissions are contributing and that what we need is a global response, can you advise as to what the next stage of the post-Copenhagen process will be?

Mr COMBET
 (Charlton—Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (16:55):  Thank you to the member for Makin for those questions on important issues. I had the opportunity, along with my colleague the Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, of attending the international conference under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change at Cancun in Mexico in December last year. During that period of time and during the various discussions over the course of the period that the conference ran for, which was the better part of two weeks, I was certainly not aware of a single country that questions the climate science. There were specific elements of the conference and side events to consider these matters. No serious political leadership, I think, internationally questions the science. The advice governments are receiving internationally is that the science is clear that carbon pollution is contributing to climate change and the warming that is being experienced, and that the response that we need to take is to reduce our levels of carbon pollution.


The Leader of the Opposition, the member for Warringah, and perhaps the member for Tangney stand out internationally in this field. They are quite outstanding from that point of view. No-one seriously in political leadership questions the responsibility that governments have to make public policy to address this problem. We had the Prime Minister of New Zealand address the House of Representatives today. New Zealand is a country with an emissions trading scheme in operation. It is currently under review to extend the scope of its operation and, potentially, the carbon price that is in operation in their economy. I have had the opportunity of speaking with the Prime Minister about the operation of the scheme and, of course, the report is that New Zealand is still there, the sun still comes up and the economy is operating well. They have had a number of challenges and tragedies to deal with, as we all know, but emissions trading is operating within the New Zealand economy effectively and is assisting in driving down carbon pollution. I think the New Zealand government looks forward to the opportunity for their scheme ultimately to link with an emissions trading scheme within our own economy.


On the side of the international negotiations, of course it is necessary. This is a diabolically complex environmental and international economic problem. It requires an unprecedented level of international cooperation to effectively address it. Despite some of the criticisms that are made from time to time of the efforts of the international community to tackle that complex problem, there is no doubt that a lot of progress has been made. The Kyoto protocol has been a very important instrument in garnering support internationally for developed countries making emissions reduction commitments. It has provided an important basis for the development of market mechanisms and a host of other measures that are important foundations for a stronger effort internationally to mitigate the effects of climate change and reduce pollution.


The next UNFCCC conference will be in Durban in South Africa in December of this year. The government is hopeful that that will lead to further progress in the international efforts to deal with this complex problem. There has been an endeavour to popularise, by those who do not support action on climate change, the concept that the Copenhagen conference was somehow a failure. In fact the Copenhagen conference led to pledges by many countries to reduce their emissions. Those pledges have been included for the first time in a decision of the UNFCCC at Cancun in Mexico and will be the basis for the further negotiations to take place during the course of the rest of this year and at Durban for how the international community will go about dealing with this issue and identifying the responsibilities that individual countries will take on.


So it is a process that the government is very committed to, an important one from an international standpoint that this government remains committed to. Internationally, I think that there is goodwill to take this issue further. There is respect internationally for the science and there is certainly an appreciation of the necessity to get on and tackle this problem.

 (Tangney) (17:00):  Minister, you have spoken many times and have stated that the science is basically conclusive on this and that the effects of CO2on temperature are very well understood. You as an engineer in a previous life would understand that scientifically, if you have got some sort of bar and you put a certain stress on it, you know the point at which that is going to fail. Given that the science is so well understood, assume that the rest of the planet goes on with business as usual under the IPCC scenarios for all global economies apart from Australia and we have a carbon tax/ETS: can you please tell me what we are after? After all, it is not actually reducing CO2, it is actually reducing global average temperatures. Can you please tell me what effect our scheme will have on global average temperatures by the year 2100?



Next, assume that all nations actually act on climate change in exactly the same way as Australia does: what is Australia's effect on global average temperatures then by 2100?

Mr COMBET
 (Charlton—Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (17:15):  The first part of the question, as I recall it, relates to the science. I will address that first. I might need some clarification about the final part of it—the cost relating to households.




Dr Jensen:
  What is the anticipated price per tonne of CO2 in abatement as opposed to CO2 emitted in order to achieve it, and what will that cost be per household?




Mr COMBET:
  I think the best way I can tackle this is to go back to what the scientific evidence is telling us, firstly, and possibly the most convenient way to do that is to refer again to the most recent report that the government has received and that has been published, and that is the report by the Climate Commission titled The critical decade. I made some remarks in brief about the findings of that report in updating and overviewing the scientific evidence. Of course this is an international problem that needs to be tackled internationally but Australia needs to play its part. 


In part, the member for Tangney's question is essentially asking what is the point of Australia doing anything. The point of Australia doing something is that we are a contributor to the carbon pollution that the scientists are indicating is contributing to the warming being experienced and the increasing threat that climate change represents. We are the highest per capita emitter of carbon pollution amongst the developed economies, we are one of the top 20 emitters of carbon pollution of all countries internationally, and we share the responsibility, as other countries do, of mitigating the risk of climate change. The reason we need to be mitigating that risk is based on what the scientists are telling us. Again, the Climate Commission's report finds that there is no doubt that the climate is changing and that that evidence is overwhelming and clear. It finds that the atmosphere is warming, the ocean is warming, ice is being lost from glaciers and icecaps and sea levels are rising. It finds that the biological world is changing in response to the warming. It finds that global surface temperature is rising fast, and that the last decade was the hottest on record. 


Furthermore, the Climate Commission findings go on to indicate that we are already seeing the social, economic and environmental impacts of a changing climate and that, with less than one degree of warming globally, the impacts are already being felt in Australia. These are the findings of the Climate Commission, and they have relied on eminent scientists within the Australian scientific community. It also finds that in the last 50 years the number of record hot days in Australia has more than doubled and that this has increased the risk of heatwaves and associated deaths as well as extreme bushfire events. The Climate Commission has found on the evidence—




Dr Jensen:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I was not questioning the science; I was asking, accepting the IPCC position, assuming a business as usual case, assuming all the science was correct, how much are we going to reduce global warming—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Sidebottom
):  Order! It is very unusual to be asking questions in the middle of a response. There is ample opportunity to jump again and re-form your question or ask your question again after the minister or whoever is speaking has finished.




Mr COMBET:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am endeavouring to answer the question. The Climate Commission finds that sea level has risen by 20 centimetres globally since the late 1800s, impacting on many coastal communities. It finds that another 20-centimetre increase by 2050, which it finds is likely at current projections, would more than double the risk of coastal flooding. The Climate Commission finds that the Great Barrier Reef has suffered from nine bleaching events in the past 31 years, and of course that iconic ecosystem and the economy that depends on it face serious risk from climate change. 


The Climate Commission goes on to traverse the evidence about human activity, and particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, contributing to what we are experiencing. The Climate Commission finds that there is a very large body of observations, experiments, analyses and physical theory pointing to increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, with carbon dioxide being the most important as the primary cause of the observed warming. All governments have to take this into account in responding to this challenge, and Australia needs to play its part along with other nations. (Time expired)

Mr COMBET
 (Charlton—Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (17:21):  I thank the member for Makin for that very important question. About six weeks ago my counterpart from Bangladesh, the Minister for Environment and Forests, who has responsibilities for climate change was in Australia. It was the second occasion I have had the opportunity to speak with him about the issue, as I firstly met him in Mexico in December last year. In fact, we co-chaired discussions about the establishment of an international financing mechanism, a global fund, principally for the purpose of assisting developing countries to implement mitigation measures to cope with the impact of climate change.


There are many people in the population of Bangladesh who live on land that is only marginally above sea level. The risk of sea level rises is immense for the people of Bangladesh. It is one of the reasons that Bangladesh and many other nations affected in a similar manner, such as island states which also have populations living marginally above sea level, have a critical interest in international efforts to mitigate the risk of climate change. They are very mindful of the scientific evidence that I was pointing to in my previous answer and the fact that increasing carbon dioxide emissions, primarily produced through the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil, as well as through deforestation activities, are critical issues from their point of view that need to be addressed in an international context.


They are very mindful of the fact that developed countries such as our own have had the opportunity, through industrialisation and through deriving energy sources from the combustion of fossil fuels, to industrialise and develop particular standards of living that the developing nations generally do not share and enjoy. Therefore, they come to the international negotiations with some very firm and understandable views about these matters. They see it as a responsibility upon developed nations, particularly a nation like Australia which has the highest per capita emissions amongst the developed economies and is one of the 20 largest emitters of carbon pollution internationally, to take measures to reduce our levels of pollution and to contribute to international efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change. Therefore, the minister from Bangladesh was very interested in the government's carbon price plans. They see it as an important contribution to international efforts. They understand that nations acting on their own can only have so much influence to mitigate the risk of climate change, but they understand well that nations acting together and in good faith to put in place measures to reduce carbon pollution will be what it takes to mitigate risks for millions of people who live very close to sea level.


I have not had the opportunity of speaking with representatives from Tibet directly about this particular issue, but I well know and understand the concerns that they have, and they have expressed them in the international fora as well. At the end of the day, the important message for the Australian community and, I think, for the political leadership in Australia is that the scientific evidence is there. The government formed the Climate Commission to review the evidence, publish material, update the science, coordinate the scientific community and debate within Australia, and conduct public fora to discuss the foundation or policy reason for taking action on climate change and reducing pollution. That is happening. Political leaders need to take responsibility for this matter—to respect the scientific evidence that is presented and to formulate public policy responses accordingly. The public policy response that I think has to be accepted is to reduce pollution in our economy at the lowest cost way—that is, the lowest cost across the economy, households and businesses—to make sure that we are playing our responsible part internationally, and that we are able to participate in international discussions in an appropriate way and have our efforts recognised.

Why did the cash for clunkers policy not have adequate preparatory work done on it before it was announced as ALP policy during the 2010 election? Seeing that you are now arguing that the carbon tax will be introduced at a price well south of $40 a tonne, why was a scheme that would have cost $430 a tonne ever announced as policy? Surely you now concede that it was a ridiculous policy at that sort of price tag. Is it true that the industry department alerted the government to there being a clear risk that the rollout of the cash for clunkers program would replicate the kinds of problems experienced in the government's disastrously bungled Home Insulation Program?

Mr COMBET
 (Charlton—Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (17:28):  Firstly, I accept none of the contentions made by the member for Indi. I make that clear at the outset. Generally, in policy responses to climate change, when one respects the science and therefore accepts the responsibility to reduce carbon pollution, we have to look at which public policy measure is the most desirable from the standpoint of economic efficiency. Some public policy measures that have the objective of reducing pollution may also have other public policy objectives such as, for example, supporting the development of the solar industry within our economy. However, when you are looking at the principal policy response to climate change and of the need to reduce our carbon pollution we need to go about doing it in the most cost-efficient manner. That is why the government has argued strongly for a market mechanism—whether it be through an emissions trading scheme or a carbon tax—as the way of putting a price signal in our economy to achieve the emissions reductions at the least cost.


The Productivity Commission considered these issues in general in the Australian economy and in the economies of our major trading partners in a recently published report. The Productivity Commission, unsurprisingly I think for those familiar with these issues, found that the least cost way of reducing pollution is through a market mechanism like an emissions trading scheme. That is why the government have been arguing on this basis. Also, over the last 10 months and beyond and in the previous term of parliament as well, we have rationalised a number of the climate change programs and initiatives—for example, one that went back to the Howard government period in the form of subsidies and support for solar panels on domestic rooftops. If the sole purpose of these sorts of programs is to abate carbon pollution, they are not necessarily the least cost means of achieving the outcome. The government, particularly over the last 10 months while I have been in the role as minister, have been looking at these programs, rationalising them where appropriate and focusing on the principal policy response that is necessary.


If the member for Indi is seriously concerned about these matters and the most efficient public policy response is through reducing pollution, I am sure that she would recognise and accept the fact that a market mechanism is the best way of reducing carbon pollution in the economy. The Productivity Commission report that I referred to in fact found that the effective cost of the abatement measures currently in place in our economy within our electricity system—whether they are state feed-in tariffs or other programs of support for various technologies or changes—is in the range of, I think, $44 to $98 per tonne of carbon abated. It also found that across the economy, had we done it through a market mechanism, we would have achieved the same levels of carbon pollution abatement for an approximate cost of $9 a tonne. These are material matters and it is extremely important when considering our policy response to climate change that we go down the path that is going to achieve the abatement at the least cost to our economy, and as I have said before that means the least cost to households and the least cost to businesses.


In my role as minister, I certainly have no concern about looking at alternative policy approaches from the standpoint of using the most effective approaches. Contrast that with the nonsense that forms the subsidies-for-polluters policy that the coalition are advancing as a response to climate change. It is going to cost tens of billions of dollars out to 2020 in direct government subsidies for polluters to achieve no net environmental gain. Ultimately, the subsidies-for-polluters program will be funded by taxpayers to the tune of $720 per household on average. No rational economic analysis could ever justify that approach. It is not a credible policy response to this issue, and unless and until the coalition and the member for Indi accept some basic economic principles in relation to this issue—that is, that a market mechanism is the best way of proceeding—they have no credibility in criticising anything.

Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Cabinet Secretary and Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (17:34):  I thank the member for Corangamite for his question which relates to the identified impacts of sea level rise across Australia as a result of climate change that we know is certain to occur and is already occurring, and that is why various state governments have already written it into planning schemes. Notably, the Victorian state government have written into the planning schemes for the 12 coastal municipalities a projected sea level rise of 0.8 metre by the end of this century, which will of course affect parts of the electorate of Corangamite and indeed parts of my electorate on the eastern shores of Port Phillip Bay. Some of the material published by the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency indicates that with increased sea levels, it is likely that storm surge and inundation events could well threaten some 9,000 homes in the electorate of Isaacs by the end of this century. Similar events are predicted to occur right across Australia in coastal areas, particularly in low-lying areas and up the east coast of Australia that will threaten homes and businesses—all of which are likely to require very serious adaptation measures to be taken.


In addition to the mitigation policy work being undertaken both at the domestic and at the international level, the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency is also working on adaptation measures, funding research into adaptation and assisting both local governments and state governments in planning for the inevitable changes that are going to occur in Australia's coastal areas as a result of climate change that we know is going to occur. One of the reasons that the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency has published a range of material, including first pass coastal mapping exercises, is to increase awareness of the threat posed by sea level rise in the coastal areas of Australia. That mapping uses aerial photography and computer assisted calculation to map and show in a direct way the areas that are exposed to the effects of sea level rise. One of the reasons the government last week published a series of facts sheets dealing with the effects in each state of sea level rise, or indeed all of the effects that are predicted now from climate change, is to raise awareness of sea level rise. We know, for example, that sea level has already risen by 20 centimetres globally since the late 1800s. There have already been impacts on coastal communities throughout the world. There is a projected further 20 centimetre increase by 2050, on current predictions, which would more than double the risk of coastal flooding.


As already pointed out by the minister, it is not just Australia that is at risk of sea level rise; it is every coastal community in the world. It is a global problem that we are trying to deal with. As the minister mentioned in his previous answer, we have recently had a visit from the Bangladeshi minister for climate change. Their problem—somewhat different from the those faced by the large number of small island states—is that they face the potential dislocation of some 30 million of their people. Bangladesh is a populous country of 160 million people currently, and 30 million of those are at risk from the sea level rise that is predicted by the turn of the century if we do not quickly act on the mitigation task we face.

Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Cabinet Secretary and Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (17:41):  I thank the member for Indi for her multipronged question, the first part of which went to grocery prices. We have just had another example of so much of the misinformation campaign we have had to endure over the last several months from the opposition. It is the case that all that has occurred to date in the many meetings of the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee, following on from the start of those deliberations in October last year, is that agreement has been reached on the broad architecture of the carbon price scheme, the detail of which has now been in the process of negotiation since that announcement by the Prime Minister and the minister for climate change on 24 February this year. It is of course the case that we are yet to announce the carbon price. It is of course the case that we are yet to announce the precise levels of assistance to go to households, although the Prime Minister has made it clear that more than half of the revenue from the carbon price that is going to be raised from polluters is going to go in assistance to low- and middle-income households.


We have not yet announced either the price or the levels of assistance, let alone the details of assistance that is going to also be available to businesses, nor have we announced the details of exactly which industries in what amounts or what level of assistance is going to be available to the energy-intensive trade-exposed sectors. That is why it is not possible for the member for Indi or Ms Carnell, on behalf of her trade association, or anybody else to make the kind of estimate that is included in the question just posed by member for Indi, which asserted there would be a three to five per cent rise in grocery prices. Of course it is the case that the government is modelling the impact of the carbon price on food and groceries. The member for Indi would be aware, having debated in the House the carbon pollution reduction scheme legislation—and indeed the member for Wentworth is also here and he would be only too well aware—that there was very detailed modelling of the likely impact on food and groceries in relation to that scheme.


When the carbon price and its details are announced, which the Prime Minister has indicated is going to be in the middle of the year, then it is going to be possible to make detailed calculations and to make estimates with much greater precisions of the likely impact on food and grocery prices. Until then, it remains simply part of a scare campaign or a campaign of misinformation, which we have had all too much of from the Leader of the Opposition through this year. The other part of the question from the member for Indi went to Australia's contribution to financing arrangements emerging from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. I will start with the second part of the member for Indi's question, which went to what is known in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change talks as fast-start funding. I can confirm that Australia committed, in 2009-10, to contribute $599 million to fast-start funding. The figure that the member for Indi gave in her question was of approximately $470 million having been spent or otherwise committed. I can say, although I cannot say to the nearest million dollars, that that is generally correct. I can indicate to the member for Indi that, to give an example of what the fast-start funding goes to, one part of that funding was committed to and announced by the minister and me at Cancun in December last year at the United Nations framework convention talks: a $30 million contribution that Australia is making to carbon projects in Indonesia—in particular to a project for dewatering of peat in Kalimantan province. It is something that we are very pleased to join with Indonesia and Norway on in a joint project that is going to enable Indonesia, through a range of forestry and other related projects, to contribute to the carbon emission reduction task that the world faces.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (17:47):  I will make some brief opening remarks to the Committee. Through the 2011-12 appropriation bills, the government will provide the Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy portfolio with $4.1 billion to deliver its priorities. This includes $2.7 billion directly to the department portfolio to deliver its priorities, including a $2.3 billion contribution to the $3.1 billion equity injection into the NBN Co. in 2011-12, with $300.7 million of the remainder coming from the 2010-11 appropriation act and $438 million from the Building Australia Fund. There will be $990.7 million through the department to the ABC, $228 million through the department to the SBS and $112.6 million to the Australian Communications And Media Authority. The government will provide $372.4 million in new funding and $18.2 billion in equity funding over the period 2011-12 to 2014-15 to the portfolio for a range of measures, the National Broadband Network, of course, being the most significant. There will be $18.2 billion in equity funding provided to the NBN Co. over the budget in forward years, with $3.1 billion being invested in 2011-12. There will be $37.4 million over four years to support the government on the NBN rollout. The $376.5 million will be provided from 2011-12 to 2014-15 for the switchover to digital-only television. Funding will be provided to the department, the Department of Human Services and the ACMA. In 2011-12 $15.2 million will go to continuing funding for the National Indigenous Television network, or NITV. There will be $12.5 million over four years for community broadcasting to increase content production in the areas of ethnic and Indigenous broadcasting and radio for the print-handicapped and to establish a new community radio content development fund, and $2.2 million in 2011-12 to continue the current arrangements for untimed local calls in the extended zones pending the outcome of the review of telecommunications retail price controls. The budget provides $8.3 million to the department and the ACMA to facilitate the auction of spectrum in the 700-megahertz and 2.5-gigahertz bands in 2012-13 and to undertake preparatory work required in the lead-up to the auction, including the valuation, planning licence framework and auction process, and there will be $3.4 billion to the ACMA to ensure greater compliance and strengthen communications with industry.


The Australian government understands that access to affordable high-speed broadband is increasingly essential to the way in which Australians communicate and do business. The NBN will help improve education and health service delivery and connect our cities and regional centres. It also delivers a significant microeconomic reform through the restructure of the telecommunications sector. NBN Co., the company established to build and operate the NBN, has forecast in its corporate plan that $35.9 billion in capital expenditure will be spent on building the NBN. The government will make an equity investment of $7.5 billion towards the NBN. NBN Co.'s corporate plan confirms that taxpayers will get their investment back with interest and that the NBN will provide a rate of return higher than the government bond rate. 


The government is also extending its support to assist Australians to make the switch to digital television. The 2011-12 budget provides $376.5 million in funding for ongoing assistance. The household assistance scheme remains the centrepiece of the government's ongoing assistance to Australians in making the switch to digital TV. There are also a range of digital economy initiatives in the budget. The National Digital Economy Strategy launched on 31 May 2011 announced government programs that will assist Australian households, businesses and non-profit entities to enjoy the economic and social benefits that the NBN can deliver and programs that promote tele-health and online education. These measures are part of a coordinated approach to help grow Australia's digital economy and increase digital productivity. (Extension of time granted) They represent the next step in the government's commitment to strengthen Australia's digital productivity. The government will closely monitor the implementation of these initiatives and progress against the goals outlined in the National Digital Economy Strategy. Further measures may be identified and implemented over the duration of the strategy. Funding announced in the 2011-12 budget for the department, the ABC, the SBS and the ACMA will encourage a vibrant, sustainable and internationally competitive digital economy here in Australia. I commend the appropriation to the House.

"Turnbull, Malcolm, MP",LP,2011-06-20,"



Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth) (17:52):  I ask the minister to turn his mind to the National Digital Economy Strategy, which he just referred to, and in particular to page 21 of that strategy, which confirms what we know from the ABS: that the biggest obstacle to universal internet access in Australia is household income, or rather a lack of it, with 34 per cent of households on incomes of $40,000 a year or less not having any access to the internet. Internet access rises rapidly with household income. Agreeing, as I am sure the minister does and as we all do, about the virtues of universal access to the internet and the benefits it brings, affordability is an absolutely key issue.


In the NBN's corporate plan it estimates that, following the introduction of the NBN, customers on the lowest speed—that is the 12-megabit-per-second speed, which is really no more than and in many cases slower than ADSL2 speeds—would be charged in the order of $55 to $58 a month. There are many ADSL2 plans currently in the market—with 50-gig caps, for example—which are costed or priced at a similar or indeed lower price. Dodo offers a similar plan with a 100-gig limit for only $29.99 a month. The question for the minister to reflect on—and I will provide him with some more information to assist him an answering it—is going to be: given that affordability is a key issue in terms of universal access to the internet, how is the NBN going to make internet access more affordable if it is not going to offer connectivity at a lower cost, and indeed a markedly lower cost, than that which is currently offered in the market at the moment? I ask the minister, as he formulates his answer, to reflect on the fact that in the NBN's corporate plan it forecasts the prices for the 100-meg, 50-meg and 12-meg speeds, beyond which it is difficult to imagine that any residential user would have any conceivable appetite for additional speed, remaining constant over time. Yet we know from the authority of the OECD and from our own experience that between 2005 and 2008 ADSL prices in Australia fell by 45 per cent. That 45 per cent decline in prices was the consequence of technology and competition. The NBN, as I said, has forecast or predicted or stated that these access prices will remain the same in nominal terms through to 2020.


The minister should address this issue. This is a fundamental threshold issue. Nobody denies that fibre to the home will deliver faster speeds and greater capacity of data transmission. That is not an issue. But is it going to deliver more affordable access to the internet? There is nothing in the business case, the corporate plan or anything else that has been said by the NBN which suggests that it would. I would seek the minister's assistance in telling us how he believes the NBN is going to make internet access more affordable to low-income households.

Mr CHEESEMAN
 (Corangamite) (17:57):  I am very grateful to be given the opportunity to address the issues in this particular appropriation. I can recall being elected in 2007 and getting around my electorate of Corangamite and speaking to many of my communities. Of course, my seat covers 7,000 square kilometres and has many communities that for a very, very substantial period of time have not been able to access decent internet speeds. As a consequence, many kids who are studying year 12 classes cannot email projects from their schools to their homes so as to work on them in the evening. Nor can they, at the end of their evening studies, email them back to school so that they can have the material ready for when they return to school. When I talk to many of my colleagues from regional Australia they report the same things. Regional Australia has been very much isolated in many regards from the benefits that come from having reliable, decent internet.


Of course, when I was talking to those communities in the lead-up to the 2007 election and through the course of the last parliamentary term and the last election, many communities raised with me the National Broadband Network and asked what benefits might be provided to them in a practical sense by having the National Broadband Network deployed. I can report that there have been a number of visits from key groups within my community to parliament to talk to the government and to talk to the National Broadband Network company to raise with them the very tremendous opportunities that having reliable, high-speed broadband will provide to regional Australia and, indeed, to my region of greater Geelong. They certainly report to me tremendous business opportunities that will come.


Of course, when we look at the alternative policies it appears to me that there is no alternative policy being articulated by the other side. Indeed, the National Broadband Network problems within my electorate were allowed to be developed under the Howard government, who could not manage to hold onto any plan for any length of time. In fact, there was a new plan almost every year, each of which failed dismally.


Minister, I am very curious to hear your views of the benefits that might ultimately come to regional Australia, particularly electorates like mine, where we have many communities that are spread out over a large area. What opportunities might there be for new technologies to be deployed in areas like my seat? I have a very vibrant tourism economy, and tourism economies sell their wares through the internet. Many of my tourism operators cannot trade overseas through the internet as a consequence of having very poor or unreliable broadband. So I am curious to know, from your perspective, how the National Broadband Network might assist seats and communities like mine in taking advantage of superfast broadband.

It will deliver the same service access in wholesale prices in rural Australia as in our cities. We are rolling out some 6,000 kilometres of fibre-optic links connecting cities and regions from Perth to Geraldton, Darwin to Toowoomba and to Broken Hill along the Murray.


The $60 million Digital Regions Initiative is funding innovative trials in health care, education and emergency services in these regional communities. For example, high-quality telehealth trials in Armidale and Kiama, where the NBN will be rolled out this year, provide in-home services for older Australians with chronic conditions and for youths with mental illness. Four of the five first-release sites in Australia are in regional Australia, as are eight of 14 second-release sites. In Queensland, our most regional mainland state, the NBN will sustain 5,000 jobs per year, with about $7 billion of investment in that state. We have finished the backbone linking Geraldton, where families can now get speeds 10 times faster and at twice the download quota for the same price.


Indeed, there are benefits for urban communities as well. When I launched the national urban policy, it noted that one of the ways that we can deal with issues such as urban congestion is by removing the tyranny of distance, changing the way that we work and the way that we live as communities so that people who have the great benefit of living in your beautiful electorate along the Great Ocean Road can be connected in a similar way to which they are in the Melbourne CBD. That breaks down the tyranny of distance, which is of great benefit particularly to regions but also takes pressure off our cities.


With regard to the comments from the member for Wentworth, I say to the member two things. Firstly, retail prices are yet to be advised by retail service providers. The member would be aware of that. NBN Co. have indicated that wholesale prices are comparable. Secondly, the NBN is designed to transform the competitive environment for telecommunications services. This is an important microeconomic reform. This, essentially, provides the spine, just like—in another area of direct relation to my portfolio—the Australian Rail Track Corporation builds the track. On top of that, there is competition for freight service provision. You have to have the breakthrough such as the ARTC, and I give credit to the former government for the establishment of that corporation.


But we had tried 20 different plans under the former government to deal with high-speed broadband and its delivery. The market had essentially failed at that point to deliver the sort of outcome that was required. So the government made what I believe was the bold and correct decision to seize the initiative in the national interest: to have a bold initiative that ensured that we could compete with our neighbours in delivering high-speed broadband that is affordable and available regardless of where people live and regardless of the income that they are on. One of the great issues of broadband is, of course, that high-speed broadband does deliver significant productivity gains, but it is also a very egalitarian exercise as well. It provides access for students, for example, to information technology regardless of where they live. It is a transformational piece of technology; hence the whole design of the scheme, which was an initiative based upon the failure of the former government's 20 separate plans.


I notice that the member for Wentworth acknowledged that fibre to the home will be faster. That is why the government has promoted this initiative. (Time expired)

Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth) (18:07):  I am touched by the minister's remarks about the NBN conquering the tyranny of distance, but the question that I addressed to him and that he singularly failed to respond to is about the tyranny of poverty. The digital divide is marked by poverty—by lack of household income—and the affordability of the NBN or of internet access is absolutely critical. It is fine for the minister to try to brush that issue away as though it is of no concern to anybody in this place, but this is the single biggest barrier to internet access. If the government and this parliament are serious about social equity and people getting access to the internet then the issue of affordability is fundamental.


The minister said that the retail prices have not been determined. They have not been determined in the sense of being finally determined, because the NBN is not operating and the retail service providers are not in operation. However, the numbers I quoted to him are taken from page 105 of the NBN's corporate plan, and the figures that I quoted, of $53 to $58, are the estimated retail prices for the 12-megabit service with a 50-gigabit limit. There it is: page 105 of the NBN corporate plan. Those numbers, the minister should be aware, are very much at the low end of what the market participants are estimating the likely retail price will be after all of the additional connectivity and backhaul is provided by the relevant retail service provider. So I would ask the minister once again if he could actually answer this question and not seek to fob it off.


I might add to the information I provided in my previous remarks another point, and this is also a critical issue about affordability. You would not build the NBN, or contemplate building the NBN, for $50 billion or whatever it winds up being if all you were going to do was to deliver download speeds of 12 megabits per second, because many Australians now are able to get that on existing technology, and you certainly would not need to go to fibre to the home to do that. So the promise has always been that households will demand faster and faster speeds.


I refer the minister to a study that was recently conducted in the United States for the Federal Communications Commission by the US economists Greg Rosston, Scott Savage and Donald Waldman. The study is called Household demand for broadband internet service; it had quite a lot of currency at the time it was published. It found that people were willing to pay an additional US$45 a month to go from slow broadband to fast broadband but only an additional US$48 a month to go to superfast. They concluded that there is only a US$3 premium to go from fast to superfast, which would be the equivalent of, say, 50 megabits per second; it would actually be considerably lower than this, but certainly 12 megabits per second would be regarded as fast broadband. Yet the NBN's corporate plan—again, I am referring the minister to page 105—estimates that people will pay an extra $35 to go from 12 megabits per second to 50 megabits per second. The experience of all of the telcos offering higher speeds over HFC cable at the moment is that they have great trouble in getting material additional income for getting an uplift of speed from fast to very fast or superfast speeds.


So I would ask the minister to take that on board as well, because if the NBN is not going to make 12 megabits per second more affordable as a baseload ADSL2-comparable speed and if the promise of the NBN is to offer superfast connectivity, which is much more expensive—$35 a month more expensive according to the NBN—then why does the minister believe the NBN will make internet access more affordable? I would ask the minister not to dodge this question again. This is central to the whole plan.

Ms ROWLAND
 (Greenway) (18:12):  I represent one of the fastest growing residential areas of New South Wales, and some of those growth suburbs include areas such as the Ponds, Kellyville Ridge and Stanhope Gardens. I can say without any shadow of a doubt that the issue in these areas about which I receive more complaints and inquiries every single day than about anything else is broadband accessibility. These are areas where absolutely no investment has taken place in these new suburbs up until now. I have people ringing me up and saying: 'In this day and age, I am amazed that I am unable to get ADSL2+ to my home. I have a small business at home. I am absolutely unable to run it effectively because I cannot get adequate broadband accessibility.'


Minister, as you are aware, Riverstone is the site of the first Sydney metro rollout, which means that it is important for these new areas in the north-west, which have not only growing residential areas but also a huge amount of employment lands being released. These are industrial areas of Riverstone and Schofields which are being opened up to more innovative technology and are looking for affordability, accessibility and also the wide variety of applications and services which will be provided from access to the highest quality broadband, which they have not had until now.


In asking this question of the minister, I would also like to say that this is not just a poverty barrier and, if it were, I would question what the opposition did when they were in government to address that barrier. We have had whole areas of Western Sydney which had no investment in infrastructure. If you look at the maps of Mount Druitt, you see that they are areas which have been totally neglected for over a decade. These are areas which are crying out for transformational change. They had no input over the 12 years that those opposite were in government, and even today those opposite have the hide to stand up here and say that it is a poverty issue. It is not just a poverty issue. I would ask the minister whether he agrees that it is an issue of simply not having investment in these new suburbs and having no incentives to invest. There has been absolutely no incentive to invest. Even today we query whether or not there is going to be any investment in those areas without the NBN because the NBN is the investment in these new suburbs. I would say to the member for Wentworth: I do not get asked by these people why we are having the NBN. The only question I get asked is when, and it cannot come soon enough for these people.


I attended on Saturday night a house meeting in the suburb of Kings Langley of a group of residents who were concerned about their inability to obtain even ADSL2+. One of the residents called a street meeting and opened his house up to people. This is an area of Kings Langley which, as the member for Parramatta will know having once represented this area, is a pretty well developed suburb. But this particular subdivision was actually developed after the cable wars so does not have any cable running through it. These are people who have satellite dishes on their roofs and they are rightly asking, 'Why in this day and age are we unable to access the highest-quality affordable broadband services?' It is a legitimate question. So I went along to this meeting and heard the concerns of those 20 residents who were there, each of them not saying, 'Why are we getting it?', they are saying, 'When are we getting it?' For these people, it cannot come soon enough.


I will also mention in asking my question to the minister: we know that internet access is one of the applications and services that will be provided from high-speed broadband that can only be delivered through the NBN. I would like to ask the minister in terms of both the affordability of that internet access and the economic benefits, what will the NBN deliver for residents, such as those in Greenway, who are waiting to get high-speed affordable broadband services?

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (18:17):  I thank the member for Greenway and the member for Wentworth for their contributions and their questions. Indeed, I do agree with the comments of the member for Greenway. My only regret is that she did not take the member for Wentworth to her meeting in north-west Sydney so that he could actually see on the ground what has happened in terms of a poverty of infrastructure being provided in terms of telecommunications.


It is no accident in terms of the equity component that the NBN will bring that we are beginning the rollout in Sydney in Riverstone and Schofields. These suburbs will be transformed as communities because the NBN will not only transform what people can do in their own home with fibre to the home but also transform employment opportunities for high-tech, high-paid jobs. It is no accident either with regard to the equity component that was raised by the member for Wentworth—I say with some convenience—that the rollout began in Tasmania in areas that had been deprived of high-level technology in the past. Already six Tasmanian retailers are offering more competitive prices and services than many on the mainland can get. This is what Stephen Love of Galloway's pharmacy in Scottsdale had to say:


I've taken a 100mbit speed offer, that's actually very close to the cost of my previous ADSL2+ connection. The NBN will provide huge potential, for lots of new applications, especially in health which is of interest to me being a pharmacist.


So you can see what the response is on the ground. Certainly wherever I have gone, the NBN has had enormous support and indeed is one of the reasons why I am here as a minister and not as a shadow minister, because a range of the representatives on the cross benches regarded this as a critical issue moving forward.


With regard to the question about access raised by the member for Wentworth, under our system almost everyone gets access to fibre to the home. That is the basis of the system in terms of getting fibre to the home under the National Broadband Network. The NBN will not set retail prices. It is an open access, wholesale-only provider. So you will have a level playing field there. It will encourage competition which will lead to lower retail prices and better services—to give the analogy again, back to the way that freight rail system has been developed in this country. If you have a secure foundation then you are able to build competition on top of that that will allow the market to operate. I know that the member for Wentworth supports markets, unlike some of his colleagues who seem to have walked away from support for markets. I certainly support markets as well. I believe markets can be an extremely democratic way of allocating resources and providing significant benefit to more people on the ground.


The NBN Co. approach to developing its pricing model is this: the product and pricing approach developed by NBN Co. as part of its corporate plan has a number of core concepts, including a strong focus on gathering retail service providers, end-user requirements being simple and easy to understand and harnessing observable trends in end-user demand and utilisation. NBN Co. has consulted with more than 25 ISPs in developing its pricing approach. Given that the bells are ringing—

"Combet, Greg, MP",ALP,2011-06-20,"



Mr COMBET
 (Charlton—Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (16:30):  The government is committed to introducing a price on carbon, and the 2011-12 budget makes some changes to existing climate change programs to better align with that objective. Introducing a price on carbon is a key reform for the government. The budget makes a number of changes for the Climate Change and Energy Efficiency portfolio to better align with the government's objectives. One of the changes within the budget is in relation to the National Solar Schools Program, which has assisted more than 2,600 schools. The program will close earlier than had initially been planned for. It will close in June 2013, generating a number of savings, including creating funding opportunities for energy efficiency, greenhouse and energy reporting, and Solar Cities programs.


Overall, departmental operating funding, of the appropriation funding, will total $435.1 million in 2011-12. That comprises operating funding of $142.3 million, down from $218 million in 2010-11; departmental capital funding of $11.3 million, which is down from $50.4 million in 2010-11; and administered funding of $289.5 million, down from $683.7 million in 2010-11. The major components of the administered funding are energy efficiency programs including the Home Insulation Program, the solar hot water initiative, Low Carbon Communities and a number of other, minor measures. The Office of the Renewable Energy Regulator will receive appropriation funding totalling $29.6 million in 2012-12. The department's operating funding decreases significantly from 2010-11 to 2011-12 and beyond, which reflects lapsing programs and one-off funding for what was then the Australian climate change regulatory authority that had been anticipated under the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. The department's funding does not reflect any funding for establishing a carbon price regulator at this point in time.


Major new measures for the portfolio announced in the budget include the savings I have already indicated from the National Solar Schools Program closure as well as the renewable energy target and implementation of legislative amendments for the Office of the Renewable Energy Regulator, the energy efficiency functions that I have alluded to, greenhouse and energy reporting over four years, the Solar Cities program and savings for the Green Loans and Green Start programs, which were previously reported in additional estimates.


All of these changes ensure that the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency has the resources that are necessary for the work that is ahead of it in its departmental functions: the formulation of an important reform in the form of a carbon price mechanism, the important work of the Office of the Renewable Energy Regulator and the necessary departmental capacity in systems to administer a number of important programs.


Amongst those important programs, the Home Insulation Program has received a good deal of attention over the last 12 months or so. This program, of course, has been the government's focus for dealing with the issues that arose in the implementation of the program. We implemented a foil insulation safety program with regard to foil insulation installed under the Home Insulation Program. That foil insulation safety program is now largely discharged. There is a more general program for non-foil insulation, and the government committed to inspecting a minimum of 150,000 households insulated with non-foil insulation. That inspection program is now also approaching a conclusion. The government sought a range of advice and analysis from organisations, including the CSIRO and a risk assessment organisation—Booz and Company—to advise on the announcement that the government made to draw the wind-up of the Home Insulation Program to a conclusion. We are confident that that will be concluded in the not-too-distant future. (Time expired)

On an associated matter, I refer to an announcement last Thursday that the government will spend $12 million on carbon tax advertising. Is this in addition to the $13.7 million allocated for the Climate Change Foundation Campaign in the 2011-12 budget, including a carryover from 2010-11? If so, what will the $13.7 million Climate Change Foundation Campaign funding be used for? Will any foundation campaign money be available towards carbon tax advertising in a supportive manner by non-government organisations?

"Combet, Greg, MP",ALP,2011-06-20,"



Mr COMBET
 (Charlton—Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (16:36):  Firstly, of course, it is a responsibility of the department to engage contractors. I do not have the precise dates of engagement at this point in time, but it is a function of the department to engage contractors for that purpose. As I understand it, that process is still ongoing. When those contracts are finalised, they will be recorded on the AusTender site. In relation to the funding that has been announced, last week the government indicated that $12 million has been committed for a national advertising campaign. That is a new commitment. The shadow minister is referring to an amount of $13.7 million that the government had previously announced in relation to a climate change engagement campaign. That is a separate amount of funding that appeared in the budget for 2011-12. It is divided over both financial years. That $13.7 million appears as $5.5 million in the current financial year and $8.2 million in the financial year 2011-12. That $13.7 million was derived originally from what was described as the climate change foundation campaign in the previous term of parliament. There was an amount approximating, I think, $29 million allocated to that campaign. Approximately $15.3 million was returned to the budget, and the remaining $13.7 million was provided for the engagement campaign. So the $12 million announced last week for advertising is an additional commitment that the government has made.


These are measures that are important for ensuring that members of the community have access to the appropriate information at an appropriate time in relation to the measures that the government is taking in the area of climate change and energy efficiency. The engagement campaign funding is not advertising funding in the sense that it is funding television advertising, but it is providing an opportunity for working with organisations, including non-government organisations, to improve understanding of climate change issues and energy efficiency issues. The national advertising campaign for which $12 million has been committed will be to assist community understanding at an appropriate point in time. A final decision about the advertising campaign is yet to be taken and is contingent on further discussions being held and concluded, but the campaign would be intended to provide information to the community about the carbon pricing measures that the government is proposing to implement.


Of course, there has been a lot of community debate about the issue of carbon pricing, a lot of it led by the opposition—of course, extremely misleading and misrepresentative of the positions. I think the community is entitled to be informed about the important measures associated with a carbon price mechanism and in particular that, as the government has committed, at least half of the revenue generated by the carbon price mechanism would be dedicated towards assisting households to adjust to any price impacts associated with the introduction of a carbon price into the economy. Of course, other measures are also important, and the government has further committed that the carbon price revenue would also be disposed towards supporting jobs and competitiveness of the most affected industries and, furthermore, supporting other climate change programs and measures to support the investment in clean energy that we need to be able to reduce our emissions and substantially improve the contribution of cleaner energy sources to our energy supply.


So those generally are the commitments that the government has made. We are continuing to work on the detailed carbon price package. We do so through the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee. Contingent upon the outcome of those discussions, the detail of the carbon price mechanism will be announced, and I think it will be very important for the community generally to have access to reliable factual information about the carbon price itself and how it may impact upon people.

Mr COMBET
 (Charlton—Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (16:43):  Thank you to my close friend and colleague the member for Shortland. I see she is supported by the member for Gippsland in the thrust of that question. I think he was jumping up to ask it himself—almost! Of course, the government has taken a number of initiatives to ensure that the best quality information and research is made available for the consideration not just of the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee members on science and other matters but for members of the community generally. As part of the engagement strategy that generally obtains in the portfolio, the establishment of the Climate Commission is a very important part of engagement with the community.


Just quickly, though, I will point to some of the other measures before I go directly to the issue of the Climate Commission. The government, of course, commissioned Professor Ross Garnaut to update his 2008 Climate change review and in particular to focus on significant changes or improvements in expert knowledge that have implications for the key findings from his 2008 review. Professor Garnaut has concluded that update; he published eight papers and they have been consolidated into a recent book that has been published. So there is very comprehensive information about the science, the economics and the state of international negotiations contained in Professor Garnaut's work. The Productivity Commission was also asked to undertake analysis of the carbon pollution reduction policies of key countries around the world including China, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States. It found that all countries examined had adopted major policies. In fact, over a thousand policies were identified in the area of climate change intended to help reduce pollution levels. A key finding from the Productivity Commission was that a market mechanism in the form, for example, of an emissions trading scheme is unquestionably the cheapest and most efficient way of reducing pollution across an economy. Those are just two important measures that the government initiated in relation to climate change and to inform the carbon price debate and deliberations over policy.


Another important one though, as the member for Shortland has pointed to, is the establishment of the Climate Commission. It is chaired by Professor Tim Flannery, a former Australian of the Year. There are a number of other eminently qualified members of the commission, including Professor Will Steffen of the ANU, who is a world renowned climate scientist and who is also advising the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee. Recently the Climate Commission conducted a seminar within Parliament House. It was one of a series that it has conducted to date around the country. It commenced with a public forum in Geelong in Victoria and it has visited a number of other important regional areas around the country, particularly with a focus on communities in areas where there is a lot of employment in emissions-intensive and trade-exposed industries. They have been very successful fora at explaining the science and, to some degree, the economics of climate change.


In addition, the Climate Commission has published an important report updating the science which is titled The critical decade: climate science, risks and responses. There were four key findings from the Climate Commission's report. One of them was that there is no doubt that the climate is changing and that the evidence of this is overwhelming and entirely clear. The atmosphere is warming, the ocean is warming, ice is being lost from glaciers and icecaps, sea levels are rising and global surface temperatures are rising. The member for Tangney will no doubt appreciate this. He is unusually quiet while I am mentioning these matters. He is usually slightly more vociferous.



Dr Jensen interjecting—




Mr COMBET:
  The Climate Commission's document makes these changes very clear and states what the science is. Secondly, the report adverts to the fact that we are already seeing social, economic and environmental impacts from changes in the climate. Thirdly, the report traverses the area of the contribution of human activity and specifically the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation as contributing to climate change. Fourthly, it makes the point that this is the critical decision. Decisions that we make from now to 2020 will determine the severity of climate change that future generations have to deal with.

Mr COMBET
 (Charlton—Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (16:48):  When we publish the details of the carbon price mechanism and the entirety of the package, the government will make available the financials in relation to the carbon price mechanism. We are working from a set of principles that have been made public and that have been agreed in the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee. That included budget neutrality, or revenue neutrality, for the scheme for a number of the measures that were anticipated within it.


We have done an extraordinary amount of work over the last seven or eight months within the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee to devise a range of the measures that would operate for a carbon price. We published in February of this year the proposed framework for the carbon price mechanism. It is an emissions trading scheme that commences with a fixed price period of between three to five years.


There is in contemplation, within the principles that have been enunciated by the multiparty committee, the necessity for a number of things to occur. One of them is to ensure that households are assisted to meet the anticipated price impacts of a carbon price being introduced into the economy. The government from its standpoint has made clear, as I indicated in an earlier answer, that at least half of the revenue from the carbon price mechanism would be used to assist pensioners and low- and middle-income households with what we anticipate to be modest cost impacts.


In addition to that, a number of other measures generally—that I also adverted to in an earlier answer—are being contemplated within the broad description of support for jobs and competitiveness within the trade-exposed and emissions-intensive parts of the economy. This will be very important. The government for its part is contemplating a significant level of assistance for those industries that are in the emissions-intensive trade-exposed part of the economy. This will be important from the standpoint of supporting Australian jobs and it will be an important disposition of part of the revenue, as it were, of a carbon price mechanism. Further to that there will be measures, as we have generally described, to support further efforts to drive towards clean energy and other climate change programs.


All of these categories are the subject of detailed discussion within the multiparty committee context. It is not appropriate for me to go into them in greater detail at this point in time nor in relation to the financials of the carbon price package. We are yet to settle on key elements of it, including until there is a final agreement on what the starting carbon price will be. These are all matters that we are discussing within the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee at the moment. When we do settle on a package we will make available not just the detail of each of the measures but also the financial implications of the measures that are taken. That is the government's commitment. We will continue to do the work. We are aiming to finalise this in the not too distant future and make the material available for consideration by the community, which is again why it is important that the government does communicate the detail of these matters to the members of the community in the way that we have foreshadowed.


This is, at the end of the day, I think, the most significant environmental and economic reform that a government will have undertaken. It is extremely important for the country's future. It is an important investment in the country's future as well. It will operate by obliging the largest emitters of carbon pollution in our economy—they number less than a thousand entities—to pay a carbon price for each tonne of pollution that they generate. That is an important distinction from the way that it is being misrepresented by the opposition. They are the largest emitters of carbon pollution in our economy that would have a liability under the carbon price mechanism and it is the revenue that is generated by the payment of that obligation that would support the general categories that I have described: the household assistance, the support for jobs and competitiveness, and the drive towards a clean energy economy.

Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (16:53):  Recently I met with members of the Climate Commission, as did other members of the committee which I chair, and that includes the member for Shortland. I also attended the presentations by the commission both here in Parliament House and in Adelaide. Furthermore, I attended a Christian coalition on climate change forum, which the member for Isaacs and the member for Flinders also attended, where we heard from a scientist there and other speakers on the issue of climate change.


It is clear to me from the summaries provided by all of those at each of those forums that the evidence supporting the view that climate change is real and that carbon dioxide emissions are contributing to it is very strong. However, it is also clear that there is a campaign underway of some kind to discredit that science. I was very pleased to hear this morning that some of the scientists have come out in support of their fellow scientists on this very issue.


My question to you, Minister, is twofold. Firstly, are you aware—and I appreciate the response you gave earlier to the member for Shortland—of any country or any government that refutes the science of climate change? Secondly, given that it is quite often raised that carbon dioxide emissions are contributing and that what we need is a global response, can you advise as to what the next stage of the post-Copenhagen process will be?

Mr COMBET
 (Charlton—Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (16:55):  Thank you to the member for Makin for those questions on important issues. I had the opportunity, along with my colleague the Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, of attending the international conference under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change at Cancun in Mexico in December last year. During that period of time and during the various discussions over the course of the period that the conference ran for, which was the better part of two weeks, I was certainly not aware of a single country that questions the climate science. There were specific elements of the conference and side events to consider these matters. No serious political leadership, I think, internationally questions the science. The advice governments are receiving internationally is that the science is clear that carbon pollution is contributing to climate change and the warming that is being experienced, and that the response that we need to take is to reduce our levels of carbon pollution.


The Leader of the Opposition, the member for Warringah, and perhaps the member for Tangney stand out internationally in this field. They are quite outstanding from that point of view. No-one seriously in political leadership questions the responsibility that governments have to make public policy to address this problem. We had the Prime Minister of New Zealand address the House of Representatives today. New Zealand is a country with an emissions trading scheme in operation. It is currently under review to extend the scope of its operation and, potentially, the carbon price that is in operation in their economy. I have had the opportunity of speaking with the Prime Minister about the operation of the scheme and, of course, the report is that New Zealand is still there, the sun still comes up and the economy is operating well. They have had a number of challenges and tragedies to deal with, as we all know, but emissions trading is operating within the New Zealand economy effectively and is assisting in driving down carbon pollution. I think the New Zealand government looks forward to the opportunity for their scheme ultimately to link with an emissions trading scheme within our own economy.


On the side of the international negotiations, of course it is necessary. This is a diabolically complex environmental and international economic problem. It requires an unprecedented level of international cooperation to effectively address it. Despite some of the criticisms that are made from time to time of the efforts of the international community to tackle that complex problem, there is no doubt that a lot of progress has been made. The Kyoto protocol has been a very important instrument in garnering support internationally for developed countries making emissions reduction commitments. It has provided an important basis for the development of market mechanisms and a host of other measures that are important foundations for a stronger effort internationally to mitigate the effects of climate change and reduce pollution.


The next UNFCCC conference will be in Durban in South Africa in December of this year. The government is hopeful that that will lead to further progress in the international efforts to deal with this complex problem. There has been an endeavour to popularise, by those who do not support action on climate change, the concept that the Copenhagen conference was somehow a failure. In fact the Copenhagen conference led to pledges by many countries to reduce their emissions. Those pledges have been included for the first time in a decision of the UNFCCC at Cancun in Mexico and will be the basis for the further negotiations to take place during the course of the rest of this year and at Durban for how the international community will go about dealing with this issue and identifying the responsibilities that individual countries will take on.


So it is a process that the government is very committed to, an important one from an international standpoint that this government remains committed to. Internationally, I think that there is goodwill to take this issue further. There is respect internationally for the science and there is certainly an appreciation of the necessity to get on and tackle this problem.

Dr JENSEN
 (Tangney) (17:00):  Minister, you have spoken many times and have stated that the science is basically conclusive on this and that the effects of CO2on temperature are very well understood. You as an engineer in a previous life would understand that scientifically, if you have got some sort of bar and you put a certain stress on it, you know the point at which that is going to fail. Given that the science is so well understood, assume that the rest of the planet goes on with business as usual under the IPCC scenarios for all global economies apart from Australia and we have a carbon tax/ETS: can you please tell me what we are after? After all, it is not actually reducing CO2, it is actually reducing global average temperatures. Can you please tell me what effect our scheme will have on global average temperatures by the year 2100?



Next, assume that all nations actually act on climate change in exactly the same way as Australia does: what is Australia's effect on global average temperatures then by 2100? And in the Australian context, how much will the total cost of this be? What is the anticipated price required per tonne of CO2abatement as opposed to CO2—

Mr COMBET
 (Charlton—Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (17:15):  The first part of the question, as I recall it, relates to the science. I will address that first. I might need some clarification about the final part of it—the cost relating to households.




Dr Jensen:
  What is the anticipated price per tonne of CO2 in abatement as opposed to CO2 emitted in order to achieve it, and what will that cost be per household?




Mr COMBET:
  I think the best way I can tackle this is to go back to what the scientific evidence is telling us, firstly, and possibly the most convenient way to do that is to refer again to the most recent report that the government has received and that has been published, and that is the report by the Climate Commission titled The critical decade. I made some remarks in brief about the findings of that report in updating and overviewing the scientific evidence. Of course this is an international problem that needs to be tackled internationally but Australia needs to play its part. 


In part, the member for Tangney's question is essentially asking what is the point of Australia doing anything. The point of Australia doing something is that we are a contributor to the carbon pollution that the scientists are indicating is contributing to the warming being experienced and the increasing threat that climate change represents. We are the highest per capita emitter of carbon pollution amongst the developed economies, we are one of the top 20 emitters of carbon pollution of all countries internationally, and we share the responsibility, as other countries do, of mitigating the risk of climate change. The reason we need to be mitigating that risk is based on what the scientists are telling us. Again, the Climate Commission's report finds that there is no doubt that the climate is changing and that that evidence is overwhelming and clear. It finds that the atmosphere is warming, the ocean is warming, ice is being lost from glaciers and icecaps and sea levels are rising. It finds that the biological world is changing in response to the warming. It finds that global surface temperature is rising fast, and that the last decade was the hottest on record. 


Furthermore, the Climate Commission findings go on to indicate that we are already seeing the social, economic and environmental impacts of a changing climate and that, with less than one degree of warming globally, the impacts are already being felt in Australia. These are the findings of the Climate Commission, and they have relied on eminent scientists within the Australian scientific community. It also finds that in the last 50 years the number of record hot days in Australia has more than doubled and that this has increased the risk of heatwaves and associated deaths as well as extreme bushfire events. The Climate Commission has found on the evidence—




Dr Jensen:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I was not questioning the science; I was asking, accepting the IPCC position, assuming a business as usual case, assuming all the science was correct, how much are we going to reduce global warming—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Sidebottom
):  Order! It is very unusual to be asking questions in the middle of a response. There is ample opportunity to jump again and re-form your question or ask your question again after the minister or whoever is speaking has finished.




Mr COMBET:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am endeavouring to answer the question. The Climate Commission finds that sea level has risen by 20 centimetres globally since the late 1800s, impacting on many coastal communities. It finds that another 20-centimetre increase by 2050, which it finds is likely at current projections, would more than double the risk of coastal flooding. The Climate Commission finds that the Great Barrier Reef has suffered from nine bleaching events in the past 31 years, and of course that iconic ecosystem and the economy that depends on it face serious risk from climate change. 


The Climate Commission goes on to traverse the evidence about human activity, and particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, contributing to what we are experiencing. The Climate Commission finds that there is a very large body of observations, experiments, analyses and physical theory pointing to increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, with carbon dioxide being the most important as the primary cause of the observed warming. All governments have to take this into account in responding to this challenge, and Australia needs to play its part along with other nations. (Time expired)

Both delegations expressed alarm and concern about the melting of icecaps in the Himalayas, and in particular about the impact that melting is having on their future water supplies and, in turn, their ability to grow their own food—in addition to the fact that their land may well be inundated by seawater if the sea level rises predicted by some of the scientists eventuate.

Mr COMBET
 (Charlton—Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (17:21):  I thank the member for Makin for that very important question. About six weeks ago my counterpart from Bangladesh, the Minister for Environment and Forests, who has responsibilities for climate change was in Australia. It was the second occasion I have had the opportunity to speak with him about the issue, as I firstly met him in Mexico in December last year. In fact, we co-chaired discussions about the establishment of an international financing mechanism, a global fund, principally for the purpose of assisting developing countries to implement mitigation measures to cope with the impact of climate change.


There are many people in the population of Bangladesh who live on land that is only marginally above sea level. The risk of sea level rises is immense for the people of Bangladesh. It is one of the reasons that Bangladesh and many other nations affected in a similar manner, such as island states which also have populations living marginally above sea level, have a critical interest in international efforts to mitigate the risk of climate change. They are very mindful of the scientific evidence that I was pointing to in my previous answer and the fact that increasing carbon dioxide emissions, primarily produced through the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil, as well as through deforestation activities, are critical issues from their point of view that need to be addressed in an international context.


They are very mindful of the fact that developed countries such as our own have had the opportunity, through industrialisation and through deriving energy sources from the combustion of fossil fuels, to industrialise and develop particular standards of living that the developing nations generally do not share and enjoy. Therefore, they come to the international negotiations with some very firm and understandable views about these matters. They see it as a responsibility upon developed nations, particularly a nation like Australia which has the highest per capita emissions amongst the developed economies and is one of the 20 largest emitters of carbon pollution internationally, to take measures to reduce our levels of pollution and to contribute to international efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change. Therefore, the minister from Bangladesh was very interested in the government's carbon price plans. They see it as an important contribution to international efforts. They understand that nations acting on their own can only have so much influence to mitigate the risk of climate change, but they understand well that nations acting together and in good faith to put in place measures to reduce carbon pollution will be what it takes to mitigate risks for millions of people who live very close to sea level.


I have not had the opportunity of speaking with representatives from Tibet directly about this particular issue, but I well know and understand the concerns that they have, and they have expressed them in the international fora as well. At the end of the day, the important message for the Australian community and, I think, for the political leadership in Australia is that the scientific evidence is there. The government formed the Climate Commission to review the evidence, publish material, update the science, coordinate the scientific community and debate within Australia, and conduct public fora to discuss the foundation or policy reason for taking action on climate change and reducing pollution. That is happening. Political leaders need to take responsibility for this matter—to respect the scientific evidence that is presented and to formulate public policy responses accordingly. The public policy response that I think has to be accepted is to reduce pollution in our economy at the lowest cost way—that is, the lowest cost across the economy, households and businesses—to make sure that we are playing our responsible part internationally, and that we are able to participate in international discussions in an appropriate way and have our efforts recognised.

 (Indi) (17:27):  Minister, given the government has now unceremoniously dumped the cash for clunkers program, was the coalition not correct all along to maintain that this was nothing other than an ill-conceived idea? Why did the cash for clunkers policy not have adequate preparatory work done on it before it was announced as ALP policy during the 2010 election? Seeing that you are now arguing that the carbon tax will be introduced at a price well south of $40 a tonne, why was a scheme that would have cost $430 a tonne ever announced as policy? Surely you now concede that it was a ridiculous policy at that sort of price tag. Is it true that the industry department alerted the government to there being a clear risk that the rollout of the cash for clunkers program would replicate the kinds of problems experienced in the government's disastrously bungled Home Insulation Program?

Mr COMBET
 (Charlton—Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (17:28):  Firstly, I accept none of the contentions made by the member for Indi. I make that clear at the outset. Generally, in policy responses to climate change, when one respects the science and therefore accepts the responsibility to reduce carbon pollution, we have to look at which public policy measure is the most desirable from the standpoint of economic efficiency. Some public policy measures that have the objective of reducing pollution may also have other public policy objectives such as, for example, supporting the development of the solar industry within our economy. However, when you are looking at the principal policy response to climate change and of the need to reduce our carbon pollution we need to go about doing it in the most cost-efficient manner. That is why the government has argued strongly for a market mechanism—whether it be through an emissions trading scheme or a carbon tax—as the way of putting a price signal in our economy to achieve the emissions reductions at the least cost.


The Productivity Commission considered these issues in general in the Australian economy and in the economies of our major trading partners in a recently published report. The Productivity Commission, unsurprisingly I think for those familiar with these issues, found that the least cost way of reducing pollution is through a market mechanism like an emissions trading scheme. That is why the government have been arguing on this basis. Also, over the last 10 months and beyond and in the previous term of parliament as well, we have rationalised a number of the climate change programs and initiatives—for example, one that went back to the Howard government period in the form of subsidies and support for solar panels on domestic rooftops. If the sole purpose of these sorts of programs is to abate carbon pollution, they are not necessarily the least cost means of achieving the outcome. The government, particularly over the last 10 months while I have been in the role as minister, have been looking at these programs, rationalising them where appropriate and focusing on the principal policy response that is necessary.


If the member for Indi is seriously concerned about these matters and the most efficient public policy response is through reducing pollution, I am sure that she would recognise and accept the fact that a market mechanism is the best way of reducing carbon pollution in the economy. The Productivity Commission report that I referred to in fact found that the effective cost of the abatement measures currently in place in our economy within our electricity system—whether they are state feed-in tariffs or other programs of support for various technologies or changes—is in the range of, I think, $44 to $98 per tonne of carbon abated. It also found that across the economy, had we done it through a market mechanism, we would have achieved the same levels of carbon pollution abatement for an approximate cost of $9 a tonne. These are material matters and it is extremely important when considering our policy response to climate change that we go down the path that is going to achieve the abatement at the least cost to our economy, and as I have said before that means the least cost to households and the least cost to businesses.


In my role as minister, I certainly have no concern about looking at alternative policy approaches from the standpoint of using the most effective approaches. Contrast that with the nonsense that forms the subsidies-for-polluters policy that the coalition are advancing as a response to climate change. It is going to cost tens of billions of dollars out to 2020 in direct government subsidies for polluters to achieve no net environmental gain. Ultimately, the subsidies-for-polluters program will be funded by taxpayers to the tune of $720 per household on average. No rational economic analysis could ever justify that approach. It is not a credible policy response to this issue, and unless and until the coalition and the member for Indi accept some basic economic principles in relation to this issue—that is, that a market mechanism is the best way of proceeding—they have no credibility in criticising anything.

Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Cabinet Secretary and Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (17:34):  I thank the member for Corangamite for his question which relates to the identified impacts of sea level rise across Australia as a result of climate change that we know is certain to occur and is already occurring, and that is why various state governments have already written it into planning schemes. Notably, the Victorian state government have written into the planning schemes for the 12 coastal municipalities a projected sea level rise of 0.8 metre by the end of this century, which will of course affect parts of the electorate of Corangamite and indeed parts of my electorate on the eastern shores of Port Phillip Bay. Some of the material published by the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency indicates that with increased sea levels, it is likely that storm surge and inundation events could well threaten some 9,000 homes in the electorate of Isaacs by the end of this century. Similar events are predicted to occur right across Australia in coastal areas, particularly in low-lying areas and up the east coast of Australia that will threaten homes and businesses—all of which are likely to require very serious adaptation measures to be taken.


In addition to the mitigation policy work being undertaken both at the domestic and at the international level, the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency is also working on adaptation measures, funding research into adaptation and assisting both local governments and state governments in planning for the inevitable changes that are going to occur in Australia's coastal areas as a result of climate change that we know is going to occur. One of the reasons that the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency has published a range of material, including first pass coastal mapping exercises, is to increase awareness of the threat posed by sea level rise in the coastal areas of Australia. That mapping uses aerial photography and computer assisted calculation to map and show in a direct way the areas that are exposed to the effects of sea level rise. One of the reasons the government last week published a series of facts sheets dealing with the effects in each state of sea level rise, or indeed all of the effects that are predicted now from climate change, is to raise awareness of sea level rise. We know, for example, that sea level has already risen by 20 centimetres globally since the late 1800s. There have already been impacts on coastal communities throughout the world. There is a projected further 20 centimetre increase by 2050, on current predictions, which would more than double the risk of coastal flooding.


As already pointed out by the minister, it is not just Australia that is at risk of sea level rise; it is every coastal community in the world. It is a global problem that we are trying to deal with. As the minister mentioned in his previous answer, we have recently had a visit from the Bangladeshi minister for climate change. Their problem—somewhat different from the those faced by the large number of small island states—is that they face the potential dislocation of some 30 million of their people. Bangladesh is a populous country of 160 million people currently, and 30 million of those are at risk from the sea level rise that is predicted by the turn of the century if we do not quickly act on the mitigation task we face.

Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Cabinet Secretary and Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (17:41):  I thank the member for Indi for her multipronged question, the first part of which went to grocery prices. We have just had another example of so much of the misinformation campaign we have had to endure over the last several months from the opposition. It is the case that all that has occurred to date in the many meetings of the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee, following on from the start of those deliberations in October last year, is that agreement has been reached on the broad architecture of the carbon price scheme, the detail of which has now been in the process of negotiation since that announcement by the Prime Minister and the minister for climate change on 24 February this year. It is of course the case that we are yet to announce the carbon price. It is of course the case that we are yet to announce the precise levels of assistance to go to households, although the Prime Minister has made it clear that more than half of the revenue from the carbon price that is going to be raised from polluters is going to go in assistance to low- and middle-income households.


We have not yet announced either the price or the levels of assistance, let alone the details of assistance that is going to also be available to businesses, nor have we announced the details of exactly which industries in what amounts or what level of assistance is going to be available to the energy-intensive trade-exposed sectors. That is why it is not possible for the member for Indi or Ms Carnell, on behalf of her trade association, or anybody else to make the kind of estimate that is included in the question just posed by member for Indi, which asserted there would be a three to five per cent rise in grocery prices. Of course it is the case that the government is modelling the impact of the carbon price on food and groceries. The member for Indi would be aware, having debated in the House the carbon pollution reduction scheme legislation—and indeed the member for Wentworth is also here and he would be only too well aware—that there was very detailed modelling of the likely impact on food and groceries in relation to that scheme.


When the carbon price and its details are announced, which the Prime Minister has indicated is going to be in the middle of the year, then it is going to be possible to make detailed calculations and to make estimates with much greater precisions of the likely impact on food and grocery prices. Until then, it remains simply part of a scare campaign or a campaign of misinformation, which we have had all too much of from the Leader of the Opposition through this year. The other part of the question from the member for Indi went to Australia's contribution to financing arrangements emerging from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. I will start with the second part of the member for Indi's question, which went to what is known in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change talks as fast-start funding. I can confirm that Australia committed, in 2009-10, to contribute $599 million to fast-start funding. The figure that the member for Indi gave in her question was of approximately $470 million having been spent or otherwise committed. I can say, although I cannot say to the nearest million dollars, that that is generally correct. I can indicate to the member for Indi that, to give an example of what the fast-start funding goes to, one part of that funding was committed to and announced by the minister and me at Cancun in December last year at the United Nations framework convention talks: a $30 million contribution that Australia is making to carbon projects in Indonesia—in particular to a project for dewatering of peat in Kalimantan province. It is something that we are very pleased to join with Indonesia and Norway on in a joint project that is going to enable Indonesia, through a range of forestry and other related projects, to contribute to the carbon emission reduction task that the world faces.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (17:47):  I will make some brief opening remarks to the Committee. Through the 2011-12 appropriation bills, the government will provide the Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy portfolio with $4.1 billion to deliver its priorities. This includes $2.7 billion directly to the department portfolio to deliver its priorities, including a $2.3 billion contribution to the $3.1 billion equity injection into the NBN Co. in 2011-12, with $300.7 million of the remainder coming from the 2010-11 appropriation act and $438 million from the Building Australia Fund. There will be $990.7 million through the department to the ABC, $228 million through the department to the SBS and $112.6 million to the Australian Communications And Media Authority. The government will provide $372.4 million in new funding and $18.2 billion in equity funding over the period 2011-12 to 2014-15 to the portfolio for a range of measures, the National Broadband Network, of course, being the most significant. There will be $18.2 billion in equity funding provided to the NBN Co. over the budget in forward years, with $3.1 billion being invested in 2011-12. There will be $37.4 million over four years to support the government on the NBN rollout. The $376.5 million will be provided from 2011-12 to 2014-15 for the switchover to digital-only television. Funding will be provided to the department, the Department of Human Services and the ACMA. In 2011-12 $15.2 million will go to continuing funding for the National Indigenous Television network, or NITV. There will be $12.5 million over four years for community broadcasting to increase content production in the areas of ethnic and Indigenous broadcasting and radio for the print-handicapped and to establish a new community radio content development fund, and $2.2 million in 2011-12 to continue the current arrangements for untimed local calls in the extended zones pending the outcome of the review of telecommunications retail price controls. The budget provides $8.3 million to the department and the ACMA to facilitate the auction of spectrum in the 700-megahertz and 2.5-gigahertz bands in 2012-13 and to undertake preparatory work required in the lead-up to the auction, including the valuation, planning licence framework and auction process, and there will be $3.4 billion to the ACMA to ensure greater compliance and strengthen communications with industry.


The Australian government understands that access to affordable high-speed broadband is increasingly essential to the way in which Australians communicate and do business. The NBN will help improve education and health service delivery and connect our cities and regional centres. It also delivers a significant microeconomic reform through the restructure of the telecommunications sector. NBN Co., the company established to build and operate the NBN, has forecast in its corporate plan that $35.9 billion in capital expenditure will be spent on building the NBN. The government will make an equity investment of $7.5 billion towards the NBN. NBN Co.'s corporate plan confirms that taxpayers will get their investment back with interest and that the NBN will provide a rate of return higher than the government bond rate. 


The government is also extending its support to assist Australians to make the switch to digital television. The 2011-12 budget provides $376.5 million in funding for ongoing assistance. The household assistance scheme remains the centrepiece of the government's ongoing assistance to Australians in making the switch to digital TV. There are also a range of digital economy initiatives in the budget. The National Digital Economy Strategy launched on 31 May 2011 announced government programs that will assist Australian households, businesses and non-profit entities to enjoy the economic and social benefits that the NBN can deliver and programs that promote tele-health and online education. These measures are part of a coordinated approach to help grow Australia's digital economy and increase digital productivity. (Extension of time granted) They represent the next step in the government's commitment to strengthen Australia's digital productivity. The government will closely monitor the implementation of these initiatives and progress against the goals outlined in the National Digital Economy Strategy. Further measures may be identified and implemented over the duration of the strategy. Funding announced in the 2011-12 budget for the department, the ABC, the SBS and the ACMA will encourage a vibrant, sustainable and internationally competitive digital economy here in Australia. I commend the appropriation to the House.

Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth) (17:52):  I ask the minister to turn his mind to the National Digital Economy Strategy, which he just referred to, and in particular to page 21 of that strategy, which confirms what we know from the ABS: that the biggest obstacle to universal internet access in Australia is household income, or rather a lack of it, with 34 per cent of households on incomes of $40,000 a year or less not having any access to the internet. Internet access rises rapidly with household income. Agreeing, as I am sure the minister does and as we all do, about the virtues of universal access to the internet and the benefits it brings, affordability is an absolutely key issue.


In the NBN's corporate plan it estimates that, following the introduction of the NBN, customers on the lowest speed—that is the 12-megabit-per-second speed, which is really no more than and in many cases slower than ADSL2 speeds—would be charged in the order of $55 to $58 a month. There are many ADSL2 plans currently in the market—with 50-gig caps, for example—which are costed or priced at a similar or indeed lower price. Dodo offers a similar plan with a 100-gig limit for only $29.99 a month. The question for the minister to reflect on—and I will provide him with some more information to assist him an answering it—is going to be: given that affordability is a key issue in terms of universal access to the internet, how is the NBN going to make internet access more affordable if it is not going to offer connectivity at a lower cost, and indeed a markedly lower cost, than that which is currently offered in the market at the moment? I ask the minister, as he formulates his answer, to reflect on the fact that in the NBN's corporate plan it forecasts the prices for the 100-meg, 50-meg and 12-meg speeds, beyond which it is difficult to imagine that any residential user would have any conceivable appetite for additional speed, remaining constant over time. Yet we know from the authority of the OECD and from our own experience that between 2005 and 2008 ADSL prices in Australia fell by 45 per cent. That 45 per cent decline in prices was the consequence of technology and competition. The NBN, as I said, has forecast or predicted or stated that these access prices will remain the same in nominal terms through to 2020.


The minister should address this issue. This is a fundamental threshold issue. Nobody denies that fibre to the home will deliver faster speeds and greater capacity of data transmission. That is not an issue. But is it going to deliver more affordable access to the internet? There is nothing in the business case, the corporate plan or anything else that has been said by the NBN which suggests that it would. I would seek the minister's assistance in telling us how he believes the NBN is going to make internet access more affordable to low-income households.

Mr CHEESEMAN
 (Corangamite) (17:57):  I am very grateful to be given the opportunity to address the issues in this particular appropriation. I can recall being elected in 2007 and getting around my electorate of Corangamite and speaking to many of my communities. Of course, my seat covers 7,000 square kilometres and has many communities that for a very, very substantial period of time have not been able to access decent internet speeds. As a consequence, many kids who are studying year 12 classes cannot email projects from their schools to their homes so as to work on them in the evening. Nor can they, at the end of their evening studies, email them back to school so that they can have the material ready for when they return to school. When I talk to many of my colleagues from regional Australia they report the same things. Regional Australia has been very much isolated in many regards from the benefits that come from having reliable, decent internet.


Of course, when I was talking to those communities in the lead-up to the 2007 election and through the course of the last parliamentary term and the last election, many communities raised with me the National Broadband Network and asked what benefits might be provided to them in a practical sense by having the National Broadband Network deployed. I can report that there have been a number of visits from key groups within my community to parliament to talk to the government and to talk to the National Broadband Network company to raise with them the very tremendous opportunities that having reliable, high-speed broadband will provide to regional Australia and, indeed, to my region of greater Geelong. They certainly report to me tremendous business opportunities that will come.


Of course, when we look at the alternative policies it appears to me that there is no alternative policy being articulated by the other side. Indeed, the National Broadband Network problems within my electorate were allowed to be developed under the Howard government, who could not manage to hold onto any plan for any length of time. In fact, there was a new plan almost every year, each of which failed dismally.


Minister, I am very curious to hear your views of the benefits that might ultimately come to regional Australia, particularly electorates like mine, where we have many communities that are spread out over a large area. What opportunities might there be for new technologies to be deployed in areas like my seat? I have a very vibrant tourism economy, and tourism economies sell their wares through the internet. Many of my tourism operators cannot trade overseas through the internet as a consequence of having very poor or unreliable broadband. So I am curious to know, from your perspective, how the National Broadband Network might assist seats and communities like mine in taking advantage of superfast broadband.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2011-06-20,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (18:02):  To address first the contribution from the member for Corangamite about regional benefits for the National Broadband Network: because the NBN is such a transformational piece of infrastructure, it will indeed remove the current digital divide between country and city. It will deliver the same service access in wholesale prices in rural Australia as in our cities. We are rolling out some 6,000 kilometres of fibre-optic links connecting cities and regions from Perth to Geraldton, Darwin to Toowoomba and to Broken Hill along the Murray.


The $60 million Digital Regions Initiative is funding innovative trials in health care, education and emergency services in these regional communities. For example, high-quality telehealth trials in Armidale and Kiama, where the NBN will be rolled out this year, provide in-home services for older Australians with chronic conditions and for youths with mental illness. Four of the five first-release sites in Australia are in regional Australia, as are eight of 14 second-release sites. In Queensland, our most regional mainland state, the NBN will sustain 5,000 jobs per year, with about $7 billion of investment in that state. We have finished the backbone linking Geraldton, where families can now get speeds 10 times faster and at twice the download quota for the same price.


Indeed, there are benefits for urban communities as well. When I launched the national urban policy, it noted that one of the ways that we can deal with issues such as urban congestion is by removing the tyranny of distance, changing the way that we work and the way that we live as communities so that people who have the great benefit of living in your beautiful electorate along the Great Ocean Road can be connected in a similar way to which they are in the Melbourne CBD. That breaks down the tyranny of distance, which is of great benefit particularly to regions but also takes pressure off our cities.


With regard to the comments from the member for Wentworth, I say to the member two things. Firstly, retail prices are yet to be advised by retail service providers. The member would be aware of that. NBN Co. have indicated that wholesale prices are comparable. Secondly, the NBN is designed to transform the competitive environment for telecommunications services. This is an important microeconomic reform. This, essentially, provides the spine, just like—in another area of direct relation to my portfolio—the Australian Rail Track Corporation builds the track. On top of that, there is competition for freight service provision. You have to have the breakthrough such as the ARTC, and I give credit to the former government for the establishment of that corporation.


But we had tried 20 different plans under the former government to deal with high-speed broadband and its delivery. The market had essentially failed at that point to deliver the sort of outcome that was required. So the government made what I believe was the bold and correct decision to seize the initiative in the national interest: to have a bold initiative that ensured that we could compete with our neighbours in delivering high-speed broadband that is affordable and available regardless of where people live and regardless of the income that they are on. One of the great issues of broadband is, of course, that high-speed broadband does deliver significant productivity gains, but it is also a very egalitarian exercise as well. It provides access for students, for example, to information technology regardless of where they live. It is a transformational piece of technology; hence the whole design of the scheme, which was an initiative based upon the failure of the former government's 20 separate plans.


I notice that the member for Wentworth acknowledged that fibre to the home will be faster. That is why the government has promoted this initiative. (Time expired)

"Turnbull, Malcolm, MP",LP,2011-06-20,"



Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth) (18:07):  I am touched by the minister's remarks about the NBN conquering the tyranny of distance, but the question that I addressed to him and that he singularly failed to respond to is about the tyranny of poverty. The digital divide is marked by poverty—by lack of household income—and the affordability of the NBN or of internet access is absolutely critical. It is fine for the minister to try to brush that issue away as though it is of no concern to anybody in this place, but this is the single biggest barrier to internet access. If the government and this parliament are serious about social equity and people getting access to the internet then the issue of affordability is fundamental.


The minister said that the retail prices have not been determined. They have not been determined in the sense of being finally determined, because the NBN is not operating and the retail service providers are not in operation. However, the numbers I quoted to him are taken from page 105 of the NBN's corporate plan, and the figures that I quoted, of $53 to $58, are the estimated retail prices for the 12-megabit service with a 50-gigabit limit. There it is: page 105 of the NBN corporate plan. Those numbers, the minister should be aware, are very much at the low end of what the market participants are estimating the likely retail price will be after all of the additional connectivity and backhaul is provided by the relevant retail service provider. So I would ask the minister once again if he could actually answer this question and not seek to fob it off.


I might add to the information I provided in my previous remarks another point, and this is also a critical issue about affordability. You would not build the NBN, or contemplate building the NBN, for $50 billion or whatever it winds up being if all you were going to do was to deliver download speeds of 12 megabits per second, because many Australians now are able to get that on existing technology, and you certainly would not need to go to fibre to the home to do that. So the promise has always been that households will demand faster and faster speeds.


I refer the minister to a study that was recently conducted in the United States for the Federal Communications Commission by the US economists Greg Rosston, Scott Savage and Donald Waldman. The study is called Household demand for broadband internet service; it had quite a lot of currency at the time it was published. It found that people were willing to pay an additional US$45 a month to go from slow broadband to fast broadband but only an additional US$48 a month to go to superfast. They concluded that there is only a US$3 premium to go from fast to superfast, which would be the equivalent of, say, 50 megabits per second; it would actually be considerably lower than this, but certainly 12 megabits per second would be regarded as fast broadband. Yet the NBN's corporate plan—again, I am referring the minister to page 105—estimates that people will pay an extra $35 to go from 12 megabits per second to 50 megabits per second. The experience of all of the telcos offering higher speeds over HFC cable at the moment is that they have great trouble in getting material additional income for getting an uplift of speed from fast to very fast or superfast speeds.


So I would ask the minister to take that on board as well, because if the NBN is not going to make 12 megabits per second more affordable as a baseload ADSL2-comparable speed and if the promise of the NBN is to offer superfast connectivity, which is much more expensive—$35 a month more expensive according to the NBN—then why does the minister believe the NBN will make internet access more affordable? I would ask the minister not to dodge this question again. This is central to the whole plan.

Ms ROWLAND
 (Greenway) (18:12):  I represent one of the fastest growing residential areas of New South Wales, and some of those growth suburbs include areas such as the Ponds, Kellyville Ridge and Stanhope Gardens. I can say without any shadow of a doubt that the issue in these areas about which I receive more complaints and inquiries every single day than about anything else is broadband accessibility. These are areas where absolutely no investment has taken place in these new suburbs up until now. I have people ringing me up and saying: 'In this day and age, I am amazed that I am unable to get ADSL2+ to my home. I have a small business at home. I am absolutely unable to run it effectively because I cannot get adequate broadband accessibility.'


Minister, as you are aware, Riverstone is the site of the first Sydney metro rollout, which means that it is important for these new areas in the north-west, which have not only growing residential areas but also a huge amount of employment lands being released. These are industrial areas of Riverstone and Schofields which are being opened up to more innovative technology and are looking for affordability, accessibility and also the wide variety of applications and services which will be provided from access to the highest quality broadband, which they have not had until now.


In asking this question of the minister, I would also like to say that this is not just a poverty barrier and, if it were, I would question what the opposition did when they were in government to address that barrier. We have had whole areas of Western Sydney which had no investment in infrastructure. If you look at the maps of Mount Druitt, you see that they are areas which have been totally neglected for over a decade. These are areas which are crying out for transformational change. They had no input over the 12 years that those opposite were in government, and even today those opposite have the hide to stand up here and say that it is a poverty issue. It is not just a poverty issue. I would ask the minister whether he agrees that it is an issue of simply not having investment in these new suburbs and having no incentives to invest. There has been absolutely no incentive to invest. Even today we query whether or not there is going to be any investment in those areas without the NBN because the NBN is the investment in these new suburbs. I would say to the member for Wentworth: I do not get asked by these people why we are having the NBN. The only question I get asked is when, and it cannot come soon enough for these people.


I attended on Saturday night a house meeting in the suburb of Kings Langley of a group of residents who were concerned about their inability to obtain even ADSL2+. One of the residents called a street meeting and opened his house up to people. This is an area of Kings Langley which, as the member for Parramatta will know having once represented this area, is a pretty well developed suburb. But this particular subdivision was actually developed after the cable wars so does not have any cable running through it. These are people who have satellite dishes on their roofs and they are rightly asking, 'Why in this day and age are we unable to access the highest-quality affordable broadband services?' It is a legitimate question. So I went along to this meeting and heard the concerns of those 20 residents who were there, each of them not saying, 'Why are we getting it?', they are saying, 'When are we getting it?' For these people, it cannot come soon enough.


I will also mention in asking my question to the minister: we know that internet access is one of the applications and services that will be provided from high-speed broadband that can only be delivered through the NBN. I would like to ask the minister in terms of both the affordability of that internet access and the economic benefits, what will the NBN deliver for residents, such as those in Greenway, who are waiting to get high-speed affordable broadband services?

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (18:17):  I thank the member for Greenway and the member for Wentworth for their contributions and their questions. Indeed, I do agree with the comments of the member for Greenway. My only regret is that she did not take the member for Wentworth to her meeting in north-west Sydney so that he could actually see on the ground what has happened in terms of a poverty of infrastructure being provided in terms of telecommunications.


It is no accident in terms of the equity component that the NBN will bring that we are beginning the rollout in Sydney in Riverstone and Schofields. These suburbs will be transformed as communities because the NBN will not only transform what people can do in their own home with fibre to the home but also transform employment opportunities for high-tech, high-paid jobs. It is no accident either with regard to the equity component that was raised by the member for Wentworth—I say with some convenience—that the rollout began in Tasmania in areas that had been deprived of high-level technology in the past. Already six Tasmanian retailers are offering more competitive prices and services than many on the mainland can get. This is what Stephen Love of Galloway's pharmacy in Scottsdale had to say:


I've taken a 100mbit speed offer, that's actually very close to the cost of my previous ADSL2+ connection. The NBN will provide huge potential, for lots of new applications, especially in health which is of interest to me being a pharmacist.


So you can see what the response is on the ground. Certainly wherever I have gone, the NBN has had enormous support and indeed is one of the reasons why I am here as a minister and not as a shadow minister, because a range of the representatives on the cross benches regarded this as a critical issue moving forward.


With regard to the question about access raised by the member for Wentworth, under our system almost everyone gets access to fibre to the home. That is the basis of the system in terms of getting fibre to the home under the National Broadband Network. The NBN will not set retail prices. It is an open access, wholesale-only provider. So you will have a level playing field there. It will encourage competition which will lead to lower retail prices and better services—to give the analogy again, back to the way that freight rail system has been developed in this country. If you have a secure foundation then you are able to build competition on top of that that will allow the market to operate. I know that the member for Wentworth supports markets, unlike some of his colleagues who seem to have walked away from support for markets. I certainly support markets as well. I believe markets can be an extremely democratic way of allocating resources and providing significant benefit to more people on the ground.


The NBN Co. approach to developing its pricing model is this: the product and pricing approach developed by NBN Co. as part of its corporate plan has a number of core concepts, including a strong focus on gathering retail service providers, end-user requirements being simple and easy to understand and harnessing observable trends in end-user demand and utilisation. NBN Co. has consulted with more than 25 ISPs in developing its pricing approach. Given that the bells are ringing—

Mr JOHN COBB

 (
Calare
) (
18:31):  I rise to speak in support of the live export industry through the motion before the House. I have been a beef producer who has bred, raised and cared for cattle most of my working life. I believe I know that beef producers, perhaps even more than the rest of the Australian public, were horrified by the cruelty showed recently on television. I fully supported the government's initial action in banning the supply of animals to those abattoirs such as the ones that were shown on TV processing cattle inhumanely, and to implement an urgent review of the abattoirs system in Indonesia. However, the subsequent caving in to a very vocal group—admittedly a minority of voters—advocating a full suspension of live-shipping trade to Indonesia has been a massive overreaction from a government that has lost all credibility with the general public in dealing with difficult issues, who acts first and thinks later.


I understand the outcry from people who were shocked at the senseless cruelty that they witnessed, as we all were. However, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of families doing the right thing, that are being penalised. It is not just beef producers. This will be felt all across Northern Australia, through real estate, finance, insurance, transport, the trucking and helicopter industries and fuel industries, export yards, shipping and stevedores, veterinarians, animal health, Indigenous employment and training, stock agencies, hay producers, feed producers, processors and nutrition supplement manufacturers, rural contractors, local town suppliers, government department jobs—right across Northern Australia, the whole social fabric.


And it is not just the beef producers in Northern Australia. This has impacted on the beef producers across the country with prices dropping around 25c. For the uninitiated, for a well-conditioned cow, that is $150 a cow. That is a lot of money. Do not get your hopes up that this will reduce the retail price of meat, because even if we could trust the processors and supermarkets to pass on the $150 to $200 per beast to the consumer, the meat supplied impact is mostly on grinding meat for the US market, the hamburger market, so it will have little impact on our retail price for meat in supermarkets and butchers.


We have made our position on live exports clear. We support the suspension of the trade of cattle to abattoirs that are not processing cattle humanely. But we should not be penalising those who are doing the right thing. Being a player in the market and only supplying those that are doing the right thing is the best tool available for animal welfare reform in developing countries. There are a number of abattoirs in Indonesia that have state-of-the-art processing facilities with stunning facilities, and if we have the infrastructure already in Australia to track these cattle with the National Livestock Identification System, the only true cattle tracking system in the world. Every animal that gets on a boat has a tracking device and these cattle have to be checked off as arriving at compliant abattoirs. We use plenty of handheld devices for reading the tags at saleyards in Australia, which can immediately deploy to accredited abattoirs.


The fact is that industry has combined to provide the way forward, the mechanisms to ensure that Australian cattle are now always slaughtered humanely in Indonesian abattoirs. It just remains for the Gillard government and Minister Ludwig to fix the politics and to talk to Indonesia and to fix relations both in industry and in government there.


I am concerned for those Australians that oppose this industry that they are being led by misinformation from agenda-driven groups who do not even want us to eat meat at all. Have Australians become so disconnected from the social, economic and agricultural basis on which this country was built and from the farmers who built it? Farmers are the most determined to stop cruelty, but it seems that most Australians have no idea anymore how food is actually produced. Do people truly think that like an episode of The Goodies a happy cow goes in one end of a machine and sausages magically come out the other? Primitive man hunted animals and so do we, and for the same reasons, and we do it far less cruelly and wastefully than primitive man did it. Yet those who believe we should not now touch them have no problem with that.


A national school survey by the Kondinin group found that 88 per cent of children had never visited a farm and 73 per cent did not know a farmer. Let us take a quick history lesson. The Northern Territory industry really struggled in Australia until the introduction of the Zebu or Bos indicus cattle—most of you would know them as Brahman—in the 1930s. Since the 1970s these cattle have revolutionised the industry and taken it from near bankruptcy to an efficient and profitable enterprise that contributes hundreds of millions of dollars annually towards the economy, supports the whole social fabric of Northern Australia and brings in export dollars, apart from anything else. These cattle are drought resistant, great foragers and descendants of four breeds of Indian cattle. They are bred to not only survive but thrive in the tropical climate. However, the main reason for the breed's success is their resistance to cattle tick, which certainly broke early pioneers with European cattle. Traditional European breeds could not overcome the ticks and were in poor condition and susceptible to diseases carried by the ticks.


So from the onset of live exports Northern Australia has flourished. This major economic industry that has been developed has been very important to the local economy, especially for Aboriginal or Indigenous employment. It has been reported that there are some 80 large Indigenous cattle stations, employing around 700 Aboriginal stockmen, plus many other non-Aboriginal run stations. Those 80 Aboriginal stations turn off around 200,000 cattle a year.


The Indonesian market alone takes over half a million cattle, mostly from Northern Australia, worth over $340 million directly and contributes about $1 billion to the overall economic activity. The meat from these animals is different from traditional European breeds. If it comes down south, as I said earlier, it is not going to end up on our plates, because we consume a different type of animal down here. It is going to have an awful effect upon the whole beef industry in Australia. The double standards that abound are rather outrageous. We continue to have stricter standards imposed on our farmers with regard to OH&S, chemical use and care for animals by a conscientious Australian public; however, when they go to the supermarket they seem quite happy to buy the cheap imports that have not been required to abide by the same standards.


Many people believe the answer is simple: just set up an export abattoir in Northern Australia. Many have tried. Failed abattoirs in Broome and Innisfail are a testament to that. It is not as simple as saying: 'Let us put abattoirs in Northern Australia. We can send everything off in boxes chilled.' It is not like that. There is a very small window of opportunity to operate in Northern Australia. You need skilled people who are not going to put their hand up for four or five months work a year and come back in eight months time when they can work in mines for far more. It does not work like that. On the other side of the equation boxed meat will not replace live exports to Indonesia any time in the near future. Many of the places that have been provided with our cattle are rural and regional villages that have little access to electricity let alone refrigeration.


This motion provides a simple way forward that can get the trade restarted immediately. I urge the government to adopt this rational and sensible approach. All of us, particularly those who breed cattle, only want humane slaughter of cattle. It can be done. This is Australia. These are traditional Australians doing this, traditional Australians in every sense of the word. They have shown they will overcome anything and do anything that needs to be fixed. Gillard and the Labor government must proceed to get this going as soon as possible.

Ms SAFFIN
 (Page) (18:41):  I rise to speak on the issue of live exports that is facing the country and the industry at the moment. The honourable member for Calare said that it is simple. It is not that simple. If it were that simple, it could be fixed overnight. Part of the problem is you get some people saying you have to fix it straightaway and you get other people saying take the time. The fact is that it will take time. I will focus on what we are dealing with now—the cessation of the export of live cattle to Indonesia.


There are a few things I want to focus on tonight. I want to start by putting on the record what some of the people in the industry are saying. Some people in the industry feel very frustrated as well. They want to get this right so that when it restarts it starts in the right way. They have had a long time to get this right and they have not. I read in all the media coverage that major cattle producers, the Consolidated Pastoral Company, Heytesbury Holdings, the Australia live export council, AAco, RSPCA Australia and other bodies that care about animal welfare all support mandatory stunning before the slaughter of Australian cattle in Indonesia. Before that can happen we have to know that that will happen. We have to know the supply chain and that it will happen. I know there has been talk about the different standards—the OIE and Australian standards—but the fact is that the Australian community and the industry have said clearly that, whatever the legal policy practice framework is, this is what they want to happen and this is what they expect. That is the first thing.


There has also been a lot of talk about what practices are appropriate and inappropriate culturally. The fact is that stunning is not contrary to halal. That is very clear. The evidence is there. That is another debate that we do not need to have, because the evidence is absolutely clear. So stunning can happen.


I want to talk about the MLA. The Land was interesting reading this week. It is one of my regular newspapers. There is a whole debate going on in the Land. It is interesting because farmers and people on the land write to the Land. Overwhelmingly, they are saying they are appalled by what they saw on the ABC Four Corners program and they are appalled that the industry bodies did not have this in order, among other things. I would like to quote Mal Peters in The Land on Thursday, 16 June on page 30. Among other things, he says:


Equally importantly Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA) needs to start explaining why its name was all over one of these atrocious practices.


He is talking about the cruelty that we witnessed on TV.


I am particularly pleased to donate about $4000 in a year in levies to a mob that has just decimated our export trade by their sheer bloody ineptitude.


If stopping animal cruelty was the goal what the hell are the knocking boxes MLA has supplied to Indonesia abattoirs meant to do?


Any reasonable observer could see they would never fix the problem.


Some heads need to roll for what is clearly a monumental stuff up.


Mal always says it as it is. He calls it how he sees it, and he has there. He has said other things, but I want to focus on what he said directly about the MLA. I also went onto a National Party website to look at something they have put out which says: 'Blanket ban on live exports sends wrong message'. What hypocrisy! Then you read that they have said:


We support the live cattle trade ban on facilities that fail to comply with acceptable animal welfare practices …


It is just a whole lot of gobbledygook which is really aimed at maximising political support, not fixing the industry. That is what is about. It would be so nice if we could come here, actually have a sane debate and discussion and chart a way forward where people are not seeking to maximise political gain and advantage and going into the traditional 'divide and rule', which happens. The website also says:


There is a better way to handle the issue.


If there was, they could have done it. They did have 12 years in government. They did introduce self-regulation. The Nationals have also said:


We know from experience that when live exports are halted—such as the ban on cattle to Egypt or sheep to Saudi Arabia—demand for boxed meat does not rise.


Yet if you have a look at the facts and figures on the industry websites you will find:


In Egypt, the one scenario where live export was stopped, there was a remarkable growth in the exportation of meat processed in Australia. Egyptian imports of Australian processed sheep meat rose by 300 per cent between 2002-03 and 2005-06, when Australian live sheep imports were stopped.


There is so much hypocrisy around this debate and all sorts of comments that just do not stand up to scrutiny. The best article in TheLand on Thursday, 16 June was written by John Carter and is on page 31. The heading is 'Meat structure stinks of failure.' He says:


In 1997, when John Anderson announced the new meat structure, I wrote a scathing Counterpoint on its impracticality.


I am on the record in this place talking about that issue as well. He goes on:


Now, 14 years on, with $1.7 billion of our money gone, the lowest cattle prices in the developed world and a drop of more than 20 per cent in domestic consumption the hopelessness of the structure has been painfully illustrated.


Australia's beef industry has its worst crisis in 25 years.


The Red Meat Advisory Council (RMAC) is meant to advise the minister.


He goes on to talk about the MLA and he questions whether the producers have any confidence in the MLA to fix the problem. But the problem is: they are there. I have no confidence in the MLA to help fix the problem, but the fact is that they are there and we have to deal with them for the moment.


When I looked at the MLA website—as the honourable member for Kennedy said, taking everything advisedly—on 10 June 2011, in relation to one of the claims that cattle sale prices are plummeting as a result of the suspension announced, it said:


… the suspension of the live cattle trade to Indonesia will neither result in a rush of cattle into Australian processors, nor a surge of beef in coming weeks and months. Cattle placed on ships to Indonesia are typically Brahmans of light weight (less than 350kg lwt). These cattle will require much longer periods on feed to reach suitable slaughter weights for either the Australian, or more particularly, export markets.


When that cattle weight was introduced because of Indonesia's requirements and because they are moving to self-sufficiency for 2014, it had an immediate impact on the Australian live export market. The figures that I have read are a drop of between 34 and 40 per cent in exports of cattle to Indonesia. So that was happening anyway. The MLA finish by saying:


Therefore, the most impact for the entire beef industry will be felt in the medium term if the situation is not resolved quickly, as heavier cattle move through to slaughter in 6-18 months time.


There are all these claims, but we have to look at them. I know a lot of people in the industry say they would like a judicial inquiry into the MLA and I think that shows the absolute frustration with a body that they all pay levies to.

Mr HAASE
 (Durack) (18:51):  I rise to second, and speak on, the motion. This is a very serious debate, and the decision that the government has taken is very severely and adversely impacting on the lives of struggling Australians now. Northern Australian pastoral leases have one sustainable economic purpose, and that is the breeding of beef cattle for export. There is no abattoir in the area. There is no abattoir from Harvey in Western Australia right around the coast to Rockhampton. There is not one operating abattoir that handles beef cattle for export licence. The argument that this industry should have been shut down on the whim of a number of impressionable Labor members adds weight to the argument that this government has lost its way and no longer represents ordinary hardworking Australians.


We have had so much pap fed to us in this place today by the member for Page that it is almost intolerable, because it proves without doubt the level of her ignorance. It proves without doubt that she is not concerned about animal welfare; she is consumed for union members' welfare. 




Ms Saffin:

Mr HAASE:
  I hope so. 




Ms Saffin:
  That is just plain rude. It shows what a rude pig you are. 




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Sidebottom
):  Thank you, Member for Page; your point is noted. You can use other practices in the House to raise your point.




Mr HAASE:
  And when one realises that the concern here is with union members and voters in an electorate and not for the welfare of animals, it puts a level of hypocrisy into this debate that is absolutely intolerable. We have people on properties whose whole livelihood is being destroyed by a decision based on, primarily, ignorance. Some of the impacts of the decision are that kids are being ripped out of school. Families will not be able to pay their mortgage. They made their last payment on it more than 12 months ago because of the extended wet. We have truck owners who will not be able to make payments on their prime mover, which they purchased solely for the purpose of moving live export cattle across Northern Australia. We have helicopter pilots in debt to the bank for repayments on choppers that are there specifically for the muster season in Northern Australia. This decision has far deeper, more meaningful ramifications than appeasing a few members of the union. If you go around abattoirs in Australia, you will find that most of the employees are working on 457 visas anyhow. So this nonsense about taking jobs away from Australia is just that—absolute nonsense. 


If people in this nation truly want over time to achieve some improvement in the welfare of animals at slaughter in Indonesia—I underline the fact that it is necessary to slaughter animals before you eat them; it is a prime requisite, which comes as a shock to many people in suburban Australia—and if the suburban Australian population are truly concerned about improving the conditions of those animals going to slaughter, they would send bouquets to the MLA and to the livestock industry, because more has been achieved for the welfare of animals being slaughtered in Indonesia in the last 15 years by the MLA than any other institution—more than the RSPCA, more than PETA, more than Pew and more than Animals Australia. If the ignorami of Australia realised this, they would work with MLA and they would start to achieve more than just five abattoirs being convinced to use stun guns. We would start to work on the greatest majority of the 700-plus abattoirs. How members of this place can believe that 3,000 years of culture could be overturned by— (Time expired)

"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2011-06-20,"



Mr KELVIN THOMSON
 (Wills) (18:56):  I oppose this motion. It is another example of the pressure being put on the government by Liberal and National Party MPs to resume live cattle exports to Indonesia. I do not want the suspension to be lifted. I fear that, if we lift the suspension, the pressure which is now on the industry to lift its game will melt away. The suspension is doing a power of good. We are now seeing a flurry of activity on the part of the Indonesian government and the industry, which is a good thing, taking us towards an end to the cruel practices which were exposed by the Four Corners program. 


I believe the Australian people do not want the suspension to be lifted. I see the opposition leader has discovered the idea of holding plebiscites. How about we hold a plebiscite on whether we export live cattle abroad and the opposition agrees to abide by that? Failing that, I urge all concerned Australians to contact members of parliament, particularly their own member of parliament, to tell them that they do not want live cattle exports to Indonesia to resume any time soon. Every MP's and every senator's view matters, but, in particular, tell those Liberal and National MPs who are putting on the pressure to resume live exports that this is a bad idea. Send the emails, ring their offices and go and see them. Tell them the jig is up in relation to live exports. It is time to move to domestic processing. That is the future of the meat industry.


They may well raise various objections to the live cattle exports ban, but these objections are not valid. They may claim that the animals will starve and that there will be an environmental disaster. This is not correct. There are animal welfare standards in this country. People are not allowed to starve their animals or just turn them into the bush. They may claim that the industry will collapse and that people will lose their jobs—not true either. There are abattoirs around Australia, including Townsville, Mackay and Rockhampton, which have spare capacity. Animals can be fattened up and sent to those abattoirs. There are industry plans for an abattoir in Darwin. The Northern Territory government and the industry should focus their efforts on making that happen.


The truth about jobs is that jobs have been lost as a result of the industry focus on live exports to the detriment of domestic processing. In the past 30 years, 150 abattoirs have closed and 40,000 jobs have been lost. It is still going on. Last year 1,000 jobs were lost. They may claim that Indonesia will go elsewhere and we will lose the market. It seems unlikely to me. Indonesia has put out feelers to New Zealand. New Zealand, which, to its credit, has a ban on live animal exports, said no. Last year, global beef production declined. In 2006, the Howard government suspended the live cattle trade to Egypt as a result of media revelations of animal cruelty. The trade was not resumed for three years. The sky did not fall in. The Egyptians bought chilled beef killed here in Australia instead. They may claim that this action will annoy Indonesia and damage our relationship with that country. There is no evidence of that. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has ordered his health minister and his agriculture minister to personally inspect Indonesian abattoirs to improve their animal welfare standards. This is a good thing.


The advice I have received is that there is nothing inconsistent between humane animal welfare standards and halal killing. In any event, religious convictions do not give anyone a licence to depart from basic standards of decency and humanity. You cannot get out of observing basic animal welfare standards by claiming it is against your religion. The great philosopher Immanuel Kant said:


We can judge the heart of a man by his treatment of animals.


He was right.


They may claim that domestic processing is not as profitable as live exports, that there are extra costs, but overall I have no doubt that the meat processing industry will be better off. A study by ACIL Tasman concerning live sheep exports showed a 20 per cent increase in the economic value of domestic processing compared with live exports. Some things are more important than money. We should not seek to make a profit on the back of the torture, misery and suffering of powerless animals. We rejected this argument way back in 1791 when William Wilberforce introduced his anti-slavery bill. We rejected it 220 years ago; we should reject it again today.

Mr COULTON
 (Parkes—The Nationals Chief Whip) (19:01):  I am pleased that the member for Wills spoke long enough to say something that I did agree with. What I do agree with is that the mistreatment of animals cannot be accepted at any price. What I cannot agree with is the way that this government has handled this issue.


The member for Wills believes that we should stop this trade and the people of Australia should demand that. I would like it to be a prerequisite that, for every email that his constituents send around the country, they donate one year's salary with that email because that is what they are asking the people of Northern Australia to do—to donate one year's salary. As for this email flood, I am getting a lot of emails in my office too, but they all have the same words. They are all coming from my constituents at 3 o'clock and 5 o'clock in the morning. I think an investigation into GetUp! finding out how that email list is being put around would also bear not much scrutiny.


I am rather disappointed in the member for Page, who represents one of the finest beef-producing areas in New South Wales. The fact that the member for Page had a motion on banning exports on the books of this parliament for some months—



Ms Saffin interjecting—




Mr COULTON:
  It is about saving face within the left side of the Labor Party. The reality is that the cattle that are leaving Australia now will not be killed for 90 to 100 days. That leaves plenty of time to put the required changes in place. These cattle are not house bricks. They cannot be stacked up until we build an abattoir in five year's time. The wet season starts by Christmas time. Where will they go then? What is going to happen to these cattle? Are they going to go to a farm where they are going to live out their old age? This is a nonsense.


We can get this trade going. We can ban the delivery of cattle to the abattoirs that are not up to standard. But nowhere in that Four Corners report was there any question that the cattle were mistreated on the trip to the wharf. Was there any question that they were mistreated on the boat? Was there any question that they were mistreated in the feed line?


I was a cattle producer for 35 years and I have great admiration for anyone that can fatten a Brahman. Anyone who saw that Four Corners show saw that those cattle in those feedlots were in prime condition. The issue here—to the member for Wills, the member for Page and others who want to speak on this—is in the last five minutes of that animal's life. We are banning a whole trade and putting the economy of Northern Australia and the welfare of 520,000 animals at risk, and the member for Page has the hide to say that some website said that the cattle market was not going to be impacted by this. If she wants to go to the saleyards in my electorate, it is already 30c to 40c a kilo. I have to say the bottom has fallen out of the sheep market as well on the strength of the rumours that there is another Four Corners show coming on sheep.



Ms Saffin interjecting—




Mr COULTON:
  The idea that the member for Page can go on to some website and be reassured that the cattle market is hunky-dory is nonsense. Quite frankly, Madam Deputy Speaker, I have had it up to here with people in this place taking the high moral ground with other people's welfare. We have people with full wallets and full stomachs wanting to affect the livelihoods not only of individual families and companies but also of entire communities. The party on the other side is supposed to be the great carer for the Aboriginal people. What about the 700 Aboriginal people that are employed in this industry? What about the 70 to 80 stations that are owned by the Aboriginal corporations in the Northern Territory, Queensland and Western Australia? What about their livelihoods?


We have just had it up to here with the hypocrisy in this place. We need to fix up the welfare of these cattle. We need to be over there doing it. I take my hat off to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry—I think he was rolled in the first place. He has gone over to Indonesia to sort this out three weeks or probably six weeks too late from when he would have known about this. This has been a disaster at a diplomatic level and an implementation level. I want to know what is going to happen to those cattle that are stranded in Australia: where they are going to go and how the members opposite think they are going to restore some of economic balance— (Time expired)

"Parke, Melissa, MP",ALP,2011-06-20,"



Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (19:06):  It is now some three weeks since the footage of horrendous treatment of Australian cattle in Indonesian slaughterhouses aired on Four Corners. While acknowledging the difficulties faced by producers as a result of the government's suspension of the live trade to Indonesia, it must be said that the abject failure of the industry representative bodies to ensure the most basic animal welfare standards left the minister no other choice. It is critical that, during any discussions related to the reopening of the trade with Indonesia, we do not forget the scale of the brutality we witnessed in the Indonesian slaughterhouses and that, currently, there is no enforcement of laws to prevent such treatment from recurring on a nightly basis. Indeed, I understand that no Australian officials are being allowed into Indonesian slaughterhouses at present, so there is no way of knowing what is happening inside.


Indonesian animal welfare groups have expressed the view that a majority of the 6.5 million Australian cattle exported to Indonesia over the past 18 years would have been subjected to some form of appalling and inhumane treatment. A recent report in the Jakarta Post quoted a slaughterhouse worker talking openly about routinely slashing the leg tendons to bring down cattle for the throat cut in a major Jakarta abattoir. In no way was he ashamed to admit this; it was just part of the business of slaughtering cattle—as is their traditional method of roping slaughter,which isa standard practice throughout Indonesia except in a small number of privately operated abattoirs.


It is apparent that the willingness of Australia's live export industry to supply cattle has reinforced local beliefs that such cruel practices are acceptable, and we now know that the restraint boxes Meat and Livestock Australia provided in fact facilitated the inhumane roping slaughter method. We know that, on viewing the operation of MLA's boxes, the world's leading slaughter expert, Professor Temple Grandin, was appalled and said, 'I think it is just disgusting that Meat and Livestock Australia is actually helping facilitate something like this' and that the mark 1 box 'violated every humane standard anywhere in the world'.


In the past week, another internationally renowned slaughter expert, Dr Mohan Raj, of Bristol University in the United Kingdom, wrote to Prime Minister Gillard in support of Professor Grandin's findings that the mark 1 box is inhumane and should never be used. Dr Mohan Raj is an expert adviser to the European Commission and on the working groups of the OIE, the World Organisation for Animal Health. In his letter to the Prime Minister, Dr Raj concluded that the slaughterhouses documented in the Animals Australia footage are 'in breach of even the minimum standards of animal welfare adopted by the 174 OIE member countries' and, further, that it is worth noting that the 'OIE codes are not intended as auditable standards or as best practice but as basic minimum standards for developing countries'.


It is these OIE codes that are being proposed as the basis for 'acceptable standards' for the reopening of the trade with Indonesia, and this is where I take issue with the motion moved by the member for Calare. OIE standards do not exclude the terrible roping slaughter techniques that we witnessed on Four Corners and they do not require the stunning of animals prior to slaughter. Cutting the throat of conscious cattle is brutal and barbaric and subjects them to unacceptable trauma and suffering. The entire live cattle trade to Egypt was stopped by the Australian government on the basis of the cutting of leg tendons of conscious animals. Why would we consider the cutting of the throat of a live animal any more acceptable?


Religious authorities in Indonesia accept pre-slaughter stunning of animals as part of halal slaughter. This is a significant breakthrough, and it begs the question of why we would undermine Indonesian attempts to improve the welfare of livestock during the slaughter process by setting a lesser standard, especially when stunning is the ethical and legal standard required by the Australian community for the slaughter of Australian cattle. What is more, I am informed by Paul Holmes a Court that major cattle producers, including AACO, Consolidated Pastoral Holdings and Heytesbury Holdings, as well as exporters Elders and Wellard and the Australia Live Export Council, all support mandatory stunning and independent monitoring in Indonesian slaughterhouses. Why would we not support the industry in its efforts to ensure sustainability and certainty?


The remarks of Jim Anderton, former New Zealand agriculture minister and former deputy prime minister, on ABC radio last Saturday are instructive. He said that New Zealand's decision to ban live exports in 2007 was a 'combination of concern for animal welfare and concern for the economic backlash that would occur if New Zealand's reputation was harmed by evidence of mistreatment'. It would be a mistake to think that the horrors of the Four Cornersreport will fade in the mind of the Australian community. Many Australians already want the live trade to end, so they will certainly not accept the trade reopening with Indonesia without confirmation that Australian cattle will be stunned while appropriately and humanely restrained in an upright position or without assurance that abattoirs will be regularly and independently audited and that a fully accountable and traceable system is in place.

"Entsch, Warren, MP",LP,2011-06-20,"



Mr ENTSCH
 (Leichhardt—Chief Opposition Whip) (19:11):  I rise to speak on this motion. There is much in what the member for Fremantle has said that I agree with. I am somebody who has had quite considerable experience in the cattle industry and I still have an interest in it. I agree that stunning is the most appropriate way of processing and slaughtering these animals. I too was absolutely gobsmacked when I saw the types of killing boxes that were shown on that program. To me, they are totally inappropriate and, given the technology that is readily available, even on my place, where I restrain cattle with a compression crush and what have you, it beggars belief that that has not been implemented over there. So those sorts of questions need to be answered. However, there are already seven abattoirs that I am aware of in Indonesia that have all of those facilities—stand-up slaughter, stunning and the whole lot—and they process a very significant number of cattle.


It is this knee-jerk reaction. As I have said before, I have no issue with the first decision made by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in stopping these animals going into abattoirs that do not comply, but the next step is the major issue in that we now have thousands and thousands of animals stranded in stock export yards, with nowhere to go. We have to address this quickly.


I note that some of those who are arguing for the closure of the live export trade have said, 'Why don't we just slaughter them, freeze them and send them away?' For anybody who has no understanding of the industry I suppose that is a logical argument to put up. But the reality is that we have only two export-processing abattoirs in northern Australia, from the Kimberleys right through to the east coast, and the types of animals they slaughter there certainly would not meet that criteria. We would love to have more. It would certainly value-add to the jobs and create jobs in our region. However, I suppose it is that middle-class thinking on the type of consumption of beef that would be happening in these destinations in Indonesia. The reality is that it is not just the electricity issue concerning chilled beef; you also have to understand that a lot of the people that access product from these cattle do not have the capacity to enjoy what I call the middle-class cuts—and, unlike in Australia, over there they eat everything from the hoofs to the horns. There is very little that is wasted. A lot of the product that is consumed from these animals over there is stuff that for us ends up in the pits and is turned into fertiliser, but it is the only product that these people can afford. The value of that animal is much greater in relation to what is needed in that community. It is impossible to contemplate any prospect of our cutting these animals up and sending them over as chilled.


There are abattoirs over there now that are fully accredited and that comply with Australian standards, which in fact are much greater than any of the international standards, so there is no reason why we cannot start this trade again tomorrow. There are cattle sitting there that need to go somewhere. There are animal health issues in those cattle that have now been confined for several weeks. There are ships there that comply in all aspects; we have feedlots over there that comply; and we have abattoirs over there that comply with Australian standards. There is no reason why trade cannot resume tomorrow. Those abattoirs that wish to process Australian cattle—or any cattle for that matter, because I think we should be out there trying to prevent any sort of inhumane treatment—need to be upgraded before they can access them. We have an NLIS tag tracking system that is very effective in Australia and that could easily be put into place so that those animals can be traced from the paddock right through to the plate. Any suggestion that it cannot is an absolute nonsense. The government is constantly changing its position; it has destroyed the authority of the minister and has left Northern Australians asking whether or not there is anybody in the Labor government who will ever stand up for them. I think it is absolutely appalling.

Mr SIDEBOTTOM
 (Braddon) (19:17):  I do not think the position of the previous speaker, the member for Leichhardt, is very far different from where the government stands at the moment. Coming from the very southern part of this nation, I fully appreciate the importance of the live meat export trade to northern Australia. I have just looked at some of the figures for Northern Australia. The cattle industry is worth around $200 million a year—absolutely vital to the economy of the north. It directly supports more than 1,800 jobs—very important. It supports hundreds of Territory families who manage in excess of 220 pastoral leases. Pastoral properties in the north are almost totally reliant on the live export trade. There are 80 Indigenous land corporation properties across the Top End, including the Kimberley, who have a vital interest in the continuation of the trade. 


I share the sentiments of the member for Leichhardt, whom I heard in this place last week, of how he along with Northern Territory cattlemen and most people in this country were appalled by those pictures we saw on the Four Corners program, and I heard the member for Leichhardt quite rightly condemn those. We have a situation where we have a significant trade which is important to many families in Australia, and the end result of that trade is that we cannot guarantee the welfare of the animals that we send—indeed, that we breed, we feed and we send—to Indonesia. That is at the nub of this whole issue. I join with the member for Leichhardt in saying I want this resolved as quickly as possible so we can do something about that. So does the minister. The minister has said that several times and is in Indonesia now trying to do something about it. He joins the industry and most people in Australia who want something done about it straightaway.


How did we get to this situation? The member for Leichhardt spoke about this earlier. I remember back to the time when we had live export trade of sheep and cattle to the Middle East that had to be suspended because of the cruelty to the animals involved and because Australia could not guarantee what happened to the welfare of those animals when they arrived there. That is at the nub of what is going on here. I can sit here and shout—as some others shouted earlier today—and call others hypocrites, but that gets us nowhere. For instance, I know that the member for Page, who is very passionate about this, raised this issue in March, talking about the welfare of the animals. The member for Leichhardt might disagree with the member for Page in terms of the extent that they would go to to do something about it, but the member was raising the question of the welfare of those animals in March, and the parliament went about its business, as did the industry and all those involved, knowing that this would come to a head.


There has been criticism of this government on its decision to suspend the trade without giving a firm timeline about how we could resume it. I draw the attention of members in the chamber to the Land of Thursday, 16 June 2011 and an article by Mal Peters—no great supporter of our cause. Mal went on to send one in to the government, as those opposite and others may want to, but he also had some very serious words to say about Meat and Livestock Australia and its inability to take responsibility for its side of the chain of supply and what happens both from here and into Indonesia. I could sit here and rant and rave and cite that, but that gets us nowhere.


I noticed today an update on the industry animal welfare plan in Indonesia from Meat and Livestock Australia which talks about increasing stunning. The member for Leichhardt quite rightly said: 'That is what we should be doing; that is what we should insist on.' It does not in any way make halal suspect. That is what we should be doing: improved infrastructure, OIE compliance assurance programs and also traceability of cattle within Indonesia. I can tell you one thing: most people in the industry and most people in Australia want this traceability worked out now. They want it worked out as quickly as possible so we can get on with this. There is no easy solution except to say that we need to communicate this much better. (Time expired)

"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2011-06-20,"



Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Opposition Whip) (19:22):  Australian farmers take great pride in breeding and raising healthy, quality, well-cared-for animals, and they were appalled by the footage of the mistreatment in some Indonesian abattoirs. But they also know that in Indonesia there are at least seven A-grade facilities right now and a further 18 B-grade facilities that could be accredited and could be processing animals. By working government to government and putting as many departmental and industry officials on the ground as it takes to bring these up to accredited standards as soon as possible, the decision could be made to recommence live exports to these accredited abattoirs. This is a time-critical decision that cannot wait six months. Limiting trade to only those that meet our animal welfare expectations will have flow-on effects in other abattoirs through training, traceability and processing.


The first ban was the right decision, but this second, total ban has been referred to as one of the most severe trade restrictions imposed by government on local industry in living memory. The government either ignored or certainly did not plan for the broader effects of their live export ban, and they did not even inform the Indonesian government or the livestock industry here. How many people were out of work the minute the ban was announced, and how many people are now in very dire financial circumstances as a result? This is not only an agriculture and biosecurity issue but an economic issue and a foreign affairs and trade issue, and we have offended our neighbours in Indonesia. It is a regional development and sustainability issue. It is an Indigenous employment issue and it is an issue for the thousands of families, individuals, contractors, and small and large businesses that are directly and indirectly affected both here and in Indonesia. Farmers right across Australia know that this decision has or will impact on them no matter where they sell their animals. 


I went to the Boyanup store sale on Friday in my electorate. Farmers there were not only disgusted with the government's knee jerk total blanket ban; they are shaking their heads. They are also worried that meat processors will drop prices locally as a result. One farmer said to me, 'You know, if we had a problem in an abattoir in Australia, we would fix the problem, not ban the lot.' Unfortunately, the Labor government did exactly that and this decision resonates to many electorates right around the nation.


The member for Bennelong, who gave his speaking opportunity to me—and I thank him for doing so—asked me to raise the following points on his behalf. Australian live exports comprise approximately 10 per cent of the cattle slaughtered in Indonesia. The most humanitarian policy response on this issue would care for the slaughtering methods employed on all cattle in Indonesia, not just Australia's 10 per cent. Argentina and Uruguay are enthusiastic in their attempts to take Australia's place in the live export market. Neither of these nations have strong records on animal welfare. The long-haul shipping of live cattle from South America to Indonesia would only exacerbate the trauma, leading to significantly more animal cruelty compared with the short-haul trip from Northern Australia to our Asian neighbours. Argentina and Uruguay have considerable problems with foot-and-mouth disease, with Argentina currently vaccinating approximately 50 million cattle twice a year. Refrigeration facilities are rare in many regional areas of Indonesia, so the local slaughtering of cattle for same-day sale is the only option available to much of the population. Australian aid efforts were central to the eradication of FMD from Indonesia for more than 20 years as a buffer to protect our own high quarantine standards. The reintroduction of South American cattle will threaten Australia's biosecurity, potentially harming millions of Australian cattle. We provide $558 million in aid funding to Indonesia. The member for Bennelong suggests that a proportion of this aid should be redirected for the purchase and installation of stunning equipment, and halal and other slaughtering equipment. This is a long-term remedy to satisfy all parties. We have practical experience of the use of licensing arrangements for the transportation of meat to insure ethical standards have been utilised. These are the words from the member for Bennelong.


I am very concerned, but I am not surprised, that the Labor government made such a city-centric decision. There is not one member of the ministry who lives in or represents regional Australia—not one who genuinely understands the challenges faced by regional communities and families and the people in this room every single day of their lives. The government does not understand. Western Australia supplies nearly 65 per cent of the live cattle sent to Indonesia and is hardest hit—from $47 million to $60 million directly, and the multiplier effect makes it $98 million to $125 million, just in Western Australia. This is a very serious issue that needs immediate action.

Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Government Whip) (19:27):  This is an issue I have spoken on before in this parliament, and it is an issue that has engaged an enormous number of Australians. In the last speech I made on this issue before this parliament, I quoted Mahatma Gandhi: 'The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way it treats its animals.' The first part of this motion states that it deplores the inhuman treatment of cattle at some abattoirs in Indonesia, and it noted that it was unacceptable. In the entire time I have been a member of parliament, and that is nearly 13 years, there has never been an issue that people within my electorate and throughout Australia have engaged with me on more. When the Four Corners program finished, within 30 seconds I had three emails from people within my electorate. This just demonstrates how the people of Australia—because I do not think the Shortland electorate is any different from anywhere else in Australia—believe that this is an issue that we as a nation have to resolve.


I think it is also important to state that this resolution that we have before us was introduced in the Senate and was voted down in the Senate. The reason it was voted down, and the reason that it is so important that we address the issues, is that, if we allow live export to recommence to Indonesia at this stage, there are no guarantees in place that the same thing will not happen.


I think it is really important to note that Paul Holmes a Court backs ban on live exports. He has put out a media release. It is also important to note that he is one of the biggest cattle exporters to Indonesia in Australia. He states that there is no way that this live export should start until the issues that were identified in that Four Corners program have been dealt with. He points out that there needs to be a much tighter surveillance system. He also points out that Australian producers currently cannot guarantee that the standards that the industry and Australians would like to see will be met. He also says that the ban should only be lifted—I emphasise that—once we have an independent, auditable system which can allow that to happen. And that does not exist. He says that there needs to be an improved surveillance system to the extent that the National Livestock Identification System can be put in place to track animals in Indonesia.


These are very tangible things that need to happen before the live export of Australian cattle can ever be thought of. Currently we are in a situation where that cannot be guaranteed. Australians demand that animals that leave Australia be treated humanely, and that Four Corners program demonstrated very graphically that Australian cattle were being mistreated. We cannot support that. The motion we have before us today wants that trade to commence immediately to identified abattoirs; but, as I have already pointed out, the tracking system for the safety of the animals cannot be guaranteed.

I move:





That this House:





(1) expresses:





(a) its condolences to:





(i) the family of Senior Constable Damian Leeding who was shot in the line of duty on


Sunday evening, 29 May 2011; and





(ii) the colleagues of Senior Constable Leeding at Coomera CIB, Queensland Police Service;


and





(b) our gratitude to men and women who serve in our police forces across Australia for the burden


placed upon them and the sacrifices they make to protect others; and





(2) acknowledges:





(a) the risks associated with the work performed by our men and women in the police forces across


Australia and the bravery that they display in the performance of their duty; and





(b) the husbands, wives and partners of serving police officers for their support of those who serve


in our police forces.



It is not just the members of this parliament but also the Australian people who express their sadness at the death of Senior Constable Damian Leeding from Coomera CIB. I acknowledge the members speaking on this condolence motion, the members for Fowler, Riverina and Macarthur, and I thank them for that. 


Damian Leeding was shot while attending an armed robbery on the Gold Coast on Sunday evening, 29 May 2011. Damian received a gunshot wound to the face. He was then placed on life support until 1 June 2011, when his wife, Sonya, and his family made the agonising decision to switch off his life support. Senior Constable Leeding was only 35 years old and was married to Sonya Leeding, also a police officer with the Queensland Police Service. They have two children, their son Hudson, who is aged two, and baby Grace. 


This House wishes to express its condolences to Sonya and her children and to Damian's family members, including his parents. We hope that they take some solace from the fact that Damian died doing what he loved and what he believed in. He put his life on the line to protect others. That makes him a hero in the hearts of the Australian people. 


This House also extends it condolences to Senior Constable Damian Leeding's colleagues at the Coomera CIB, Queensland Police Service, who are also grieving at this very difficult time. This House wishes to convey our gratitude to the men and women who serve in our police forces across Australia for the burdens they carry and the sacrifices that they make to protect others, and no greater sacrifice has been made than that made by Senior Constable Damian Leeding and his police officer partner, Sonya. This House acknowledges the risks associated with the work performed by our men and women in the police forces across Australia and the bravery that they display in the performance of their duty. The Australian public know that, when they need help, police are there to assist, but sometimes police officers are not shown the respect that they deserve. Maybe the public are going about their busy lives and do not stop and consider the risks that our men and women voluntarily face for the sole purpose of protecting people in our community.


I believe a renewed level of respect is being shown out of this terrible tragedy. What I ask of the people in our communities is that maybe when you are being pulled over for a speeding ticket or you are complaining about having to stop for a breath test, stop and think this is to protect you and your loved ones on the road. You should also consider the other work that those officers do—for example, walking into a domestic violence situation not knowing what they might face, finding children in the house when one spouse has taken the ultimate action and ended the life of the other parent with the children present or discovering paedophilia material when that officer has children the same age as the children that have been abused, or facing horrific traffic accidents and then telling the loved ones of that fatal accident, or being assaulted while trying to protect others. 


The risk that our police officers face is evident every day and once again it is evident today. Just today it was reported by Detective Senior Sergeant Mark Proctor, officer in charge at Coomera CIB where Senior Constable Damian Leeding worked, was slashed by a glass tube during a raid on an illegal drug lab last night on the Gold Coast. Detective Senior Sergeant Proctor was a close friend of Damien Leeding. Thankfully, Mr Proctor escaped serious injury but this is just another example of the risks that our police officers face.


I would also like to acknowledge the husbands, wives and partners of serving police officers for their support of those who serve in our police forces. As Sonya Leeding said in the 60 Minutes interview last night, the knock on the door from police officers is a wife or husband's worst nightmare, especially when you know the duty that your partner performs.


Why do I move this motion tonight? I did not know Senior Constable Leeding nor do I represent the Gold Coast where he worked. I move this motion this evening because I am the wife of a police officer. I am the proud wife of a man who has served the Queensland Police Service for more than 17 years. I have had the nights worrying why my husband is not home at 3 o'clock in the morning when he was supposed to finish at midnight. I have seen him come home with bruises and blood on him. I have heard the stories of being spat on or abused when you are trying to help someone who is being assaulted. It is for this reason that I move this motion tonight. It is for this reason that I support our police forces throughout Australia and support the need for appropriate legislation and resources for them to do their job properly. We need to ensure that they have appropriate staffing levels, that they are being given the tools to protect themselves and others, and that they are treated as valuable employees and paid accordingly. I support the men and women of our police forces.


This House thanks Damian Leeding and Sonya Leeding for putting their lives on the line and our thoughts are with Sonya and her family and Damian Leeding's family as they grieve and face their future without the loving husband and father that he was. I end on the note that a fund has been set up to support Damian Leeding's family. I encourage people to support and donate to that fund and also to donate to the Police Legacy fund to support all families of fallen police officers. They are our protectors and they are our heroes.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (20:48):  I endorse the member for Petrie's eloquent and moving contribution. Every day many of us kiss our loved ones goodbye with minimal thought that it could be the last time we do so. However, for some people it is a small action they hold dear and sincerely hope it will not be their last. These are usually people who spend their day protecting others, people such as Senior Constable Damian Leeding.


On Sunday 29 May, Senior Constable Damian Leeding, based on the Gold Coast, went to work as a frontline police officer of the Queensland Police Force. He was a police officer who saw policing as his calling and vowed to take the fight to the crims on their turf. An emergency call at the Pacific Pines Tavern was placed at 2.45 am after Senior Constable Leeding was shot at close range by three armed robbers. Senior Constable Leeding was rushed to hospital and underwent surgery. In the following days his family maintained an anxious bedside vigil, hoping that something, anything, would change the inevitable outcome—holding out hope for a miracle. However, he never regained consciousness and the heartbreaking decision was made to turn off life support.


Senior Constable Leeding was 35 years young. He was an admirable police officer who had just before his death been promoted to detective. He had a good life, a beautiful wife, Sonya, a two-year-old son, Hudson, and a newborn baby daughter, Grace. He had so much to live for and so much more to give. His father-in-law, Gary O'Brien, described him as: 'A great father, just a top bloke. He'd do anything for anybody.' Sonya, also a police officer, has lost her partner on and off the beat, her shining light. Her two children have lost a dad who will live on in their memories only as the description that other people tell them—great stories but sadly not stories they got to create with their dad themselves.


Australia has lost a remarkable man and police officer in Senior Constable Leeding. He was willing to put his wellbeing in the line of fire to ensure a better and safer society, as all police do each and every day. Thank goodness for their goodness, their commitment, their duty. The public outcry at the death of Senior Constable Leeding has been extraordinary. At Coomera Police Station flowers flooded in from complete strangers, bikies and even ex-cons, at the realisation one of the good guys lost. From all around Australia to his own suburban street has come a renewed appreciation for police. Homes around the country have tied blue ribbons as a mark of respect for a man who was trying to make the streets safer not only for his family but also for families nationwide.


Blue ribbons are used around Australia as a way to commemorate fallen police officers. Police Remembrance Day is 29 September and it is a significant day of commemoration when police officers and the public can reflect on and remember those officers killed while helping to make Australia a safer society. Appropriately, 29 September has been chosen as Remembrance Day as it marks the Feast of St Michael who was always fighting evil.


New South Wales Minister for Police, Michael Gallacher, stood in state parliament last Thursday to remind the government of the risk these men and women take every day and the stark reminder of how many officers have lost their lives in the line of duty. I am pleased to say that the O'Farrell-Stoner coalition government is committed to ensuring that the police force is involved in fewer situations which place police officers in a position which results in the loss of life. The Nationals and Liberals have long said that they want to know where our police are, where they need to be and how best to use them to protect and serve the community whilst not endangering these brave men and women. We are determined to give the police the powers, resources and the backing they need to keep themselves and their communities safe, as are the people on the opposite side in their state parliaments. 


An audit being conducted currently throughout New South Wales will cover three key areas including police numbers and current allocations, authorised strength and alternative measurements including full-time equivalents and operational staff. The audit will also examine police stations, their operating hours, stations listed for closure and the effectiveness of the current local area command structure, especially in regional areas. I hope the other states will follow this procedure through as well.


I would like to finish with the words of Detective Senior Constable Leeding's widow, Sonya, who maintains that despite everything she will return to her job. Let us hope that from her husband's death her profession will be safer and better resourced. She said: 'The job we do is unique. This last week I have seen just everybody stand up and be counted and still get up and go to work and put their firearms on and know that they are going to perhaps encounter something similar. But at the end of the day—and I have always maintained this—it is our job. Everybody has their own job. We were both very proud to be a part of the job and even now everyone says, ""You don't have to come back and you can do whatever you want."" Well, I can't. This is what I do. It's who I am and it's who all of us are.'


Damian Leeding, man of courage, of honour, of sacrifice, is gone but his spirit will live on. His duty is done. May he now rest in peace.

Mr HAYES
 (Fowler—Government Whip) (20:53):  I am proud to speak today in support of the motion of the member for Petrie. This motion expresses our deepest condolences to the family of Detective Senior Constable Damian Leeding, who was shot in the line of duty on Saturday, 29 May 2011. He left behind his wife, Sonya, who is also a serving police officer; his two-year-old son, Hudson; and his three-month-old daughter, Grace. He also leaves behind his colleagues at Coomera CIB, colleagues in the broader Queensland police force and in fact the whole Australian policing community.


It is always a great loss when we lose a serving police officer while they are carrying out their duties. In this instance Detective Senior Constable Leeding was serving with great courage, integrity and honour. He was doing what he was passionate about. He was making a difference. He was out there protecting the community. Detective Senior Constable Leeding was called out to an armed robbery on the Gold Coast. Like many times before, he did not hesitate in taking on that task, risking his life for the safety of his community. This is a commitment which is shown by police officers across Australia. When the ultimate sacrifice is made it is a deep tragedy for our entire community.


The shocking events of 29 May highlight again just how difficult and dangerous police work is and why we should always honour the work that they do. All the loved ones of police officers know the dangers of the work they do and that moment that Sonya Leeding received the dreaded news shortly after that fateful shooting. The member for Petrie, being the wife of a police officer, George D'Ath—who I know does a sterling job in the Queensland police force—indicated the physical and emotional effect when a police officer does not come home at the time you expect. This motion acknowledges that police work across the nation is dangerous but is essential and it extends our gratitude not just to the police officers but also to the families—to the husbands, the wives, the partners and the children of serving police. On behalf of a very grateful community I would like to thank all of them for the support they show day in day out to our police officers. 


I would also like to especially acknowledge today the sacrifice and bravery of Detective Senior Constable Leeding's wife, who is herself a police officer. The strength and the courage that she has shown during this very difficult time are amazing. Sonya has recently confirmed that she will continue to serve in the Queensland police force, an act of unspeakable courage which epitomises the commitment that police officers all across the nation make in their respective jurisdictions. 


I have long been committed to supporting the police. I had a long association with police of all state and territory jurisdictions prior to coming to this place and I acknowledge Mr Ian Leavers, the President of the Queensland Police Union, who is sitting in the gallery tonight. He and his organisation do a fantastic job looking after the industrial and professional interests of police officers.


A tragic event such as this reminds us all of the work that police officers do. It should also remind us that as legislators we must do all that we can to ensure that our police have the tools they need as well as the legislative support to undertake the work that we expect of them—that is, to protect our community. I know the police associations have long used the term 'the thin blue line'. Quite frankly, it is a very thin blue line that protects our community from anarchy—these men and women are special types of people and possess a special type of courage to wear the police uniform. Their sole motivation is to make a difference for the better in the community they serve. Having grown up in a police family, I know the stresses and strains that that poses on a family. I am in awe of the courage of the men and women who take the oath of office and stand ready to protect our community.


Once again I extend my deepest condolences to the family of Detective Senior Constable Damian Leeding and to the Queensland police community and I congratulate all police officers on the courage they show and what they achieve in the protection of our community.

"Matheson, Russell, MP",LP,2011-06-20,"



Mr MATHESON
 (Macarthur) (20:58):  I would like to pay tribute to Detective Senior Constable Damian Leeding and offer my condolences to his wife, Sonia, his son, Hudson, and his daughter, Grace. Detective Senior Constable Leeding has been described by his family and peers as a great father, a top bloke, a larrikin, a quiet achiever, a hero, a mate who would do anything for anybody. He was only 35 years old and was shot last month after responding to an armed robbery and a hostage situation at the Pacific Pines Tavern on the Gold Coast. His death has demonstrated the dangers that members of the police force put themselves into every day to keep the community safe.


According to his colleagues, Damian was a hardworking officer with a distinct dislike for anyone dealing in drugs. He would drag a drug dealer off the street and into the police station on a daily basis. His workmates have promised to honour Damian by remaining strong and keeping his community safe. I am sure his colleagues, friends and family will make sure that his death will not be in vain.


I felt compelled to speak here today because I was a police officer for 25 years and have seen firsthand the heartache felt by families, the police force and the community when a police officer is killed on duty. I can imagine the desperation, fear and anguish Damian's workmates felt as they fought to keep him alive until paramedics arrived. There is no telling how many police officers all over Australia will be affected by his death. There will obviously be a ripple effect across the nation. I am sure many will reconsider the risks they take every day just going to work and the family members they would leave behind if something were to go wrong. 


Damian's son Hudson is only two years old and his daughter Grace is just three months old, too young to lose a loving and devoted father. Having two beautiful daughters myself, I am well aware of the sacrifices made by police officers and their families every day. Like any member of the emergency services would know, it takes a great deal of courage to leave your own family behind to protect those who you have sometimes never met on a daily basis. These men and women take great risks every time they go to work, and they deserve the utmost respect by the community for risking their lives to protect others. They join the job to make a difference, and sometimes this can be a thankless job.


I feel for Damian's wife, Sonya, who had to make the heartbreaking decision to turn off his life support. I cannot think of a more devastating and traumatic decision to make. I am sure that she is now surrounded by loving friends and family. Sonya is also a police officer and has said that she will return to work—great courage. This will take a lot of courage but the police community is a tight one. They treat each other like family, and I am sure she will be supported by her fellow officers when she returns. That is our way.


It is not just Damian and his family that will suffer as a result of this tragedy. His colleagues and friends in the Gold Coast community will all grieve alongside them for a long time to come. As a police officer, I experienced this widespread grief first hand in 2001 when Senior Constable Jim Affleck, a highway patrol officer in my electorate, was run down during a police pursuit along the F5. He was laying road spikes to stop a stolen vehicle when he was run down at high speed. I remember that day like it was yesterday, as would many others in Macarthur. After his death, Jim was awarded the Commissioner's Valour Award for his exceptional bravery. I believe this would also be a fitting tribute for Senior Constable Damian Leeding. The Jim Affleck Bridge on the F5 in Campbelltown is now a solemn reminder of the brave and dedicated police officer we lost that day. 


Like Damien Leeding, Jim Affleck was well respected and loved by his colleagues. Jim was a dedicated and professional police officer, and his death shocked not only the police force but also the entire Campbelltown community in which he served. He is in our thoughts every day and a memorial service is held each year in his honour. The 10th anniversary of his death was marked in January this year with a service next to the garden dedicated to his life at Campbelltown Police Station. Even though it has been 10 years since he was killed, more than 100 people attended the service, which shows the widespread and devastating impact the death of a police officer can have on your local community. 


I am sure the Gold Coast community will also continue to honour Damian Leeding in this way to ensure that his memory will live on. After his death Jim Affleck was placed on the police honour roll which commemorates those members of the New South Wales Police Force who have paid the ultimate sacrifice in the execution of their duty. This will also be the case with Senior Constable Leeding—a sad but fitting tribute to those brave police officers. 


I join many people in the Macarthur electorate who have the utmost respect and admiration for members of the police force. It takes a person of great integrity and character to carry on through the many tragic and heartbreaking situations that they encounter. Both Damian Leeding, Jim Affleck and their families have paid the ultimate sacrifice, and the heartache will stay with their families, colleagues and the community for many years to come. 


To the families of these fine police officers and all those who have been killed in the line of duty, I offer my heartfelt condolences. I am sure they will share with me the hope that one day society will understand and respect the great undertaking that is required to serve as a police officer. Until then, the fine members of the police force will continue to protect the safety of communities across Australia, despite the dangers they will face and the harsh reality that some may not return to their families. Today my heart goes out to the loved ones of all our fallen comrades, including Damian Leeding and Jim Affleck. May they all rest in peace.

Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson) (21:03):  I rise tonight to raise a grievance on behalf of the people of Paterson. Their will has been ignored by the current Labor government. My constituents do not want a carbon tax, and they deserve at the very least a plebiscite to make it clear to the Labor government that refuses to listen to what ordinary Australians want. I turned on the radio last week and the top national news story was a piece about seven eminent Australians who supported the carbon tax. It made me furious. Why? Not because eminent Australians do not deserve to have a point of view or to express it—of course they do. As a matter of fact, I welcome it. What made me furious was that the residents of Paterson have never been at the top of the news bulletin, yet their views matter every bit as much as any prominent Australian's. I am not talking about seven Paterson residents who do not support a carbon tax; I am talking about the seven or so people that are calling or emailing my office every single hour of every single day. The number of people who have contacted me to oppose the carbon tax is in the thousands.


I would like to read a couple of emails that I have received from my constituents. First, a bit of a tongue-in-cheek email from Peter and Janet regarding recent carbon tax advertising:


We were so pleased to see the advertisement on TV last night asking us to say yes to a carbon tax as finally the government is asking us to decide. Can you please keep us informed as to the date set for either the referendum or the election? We cannot wait to cast our vote on this incompetent and lying government. 


Judy wrote to me: 


Please let Julia Gillard know we do not believe in a carbon tax. As far as I am concerned this will just be another tax, and as a self-funded retiree we certainly cannot afford any more taxes as the standard of living for older Australians is being eroded every day. 


Then there is Colin: 


We contribute 1.4 per cent of the world's carbon emissions. The aim of the carbon tax is to reduce our emissions by five per cent. So that means we are going to disrupt and damage our economy, put many people out of work and increase our inflation by five to 10 per cent just to save seven parts in 10,000 of the world's emissions. What a great idea. 


Lastly there is Kevin, who wrote: 


If the Prime Minister believes she has a mandate to introduce a carbon tax, she should be prepared to do the following: to every enrolled voter in Australia she sends a simple question to the voters with a reply paid envelope: do you support the introduction of a carbon tax, yes or no. The result then would be to support or dismiss her policy. On a personal note, she lied and misled the public on this matter. 


These people might not get a spot on the news but they have a voice here in this parliament, and I will ensure that it is heard by the Prime Minister.


People in my electorate not only do not want this tax; they simply cannot afford it. This time last year in the Hunter, electricity prices rose between 17 and 13 per cent, gas prices went up by 13 per cent, water bills went up by five per cent, council rates went up by 2.6 per cent and taxi fares went up by 3 per cent—and that is without the rise in petrol, grocery and rent bills that have occurred across New South Wales. Now Labor wants to add $860 a year to the household budget with a $30 per tonne carbon price, and that is just the start. The Greens want a price of $100 per tonne, and there is no telling how far Labor will go to keep de facto prime minister Bob Brown happy. But what exactly is the point of putting a tax on carbon, you might ask. How will extra expense help the environment? Labor says that adding the extra cost will stop people using things, reducing energy consumption and therefore reducing emissions. But you cannot cut back on essentials, and power, groceries and fuel are essentials. You only have to look at history to see that the Labor government's theory is flawed. Between 2000 and 2008 the cost of electricity in Australia rose by 55.9 per cent. Yet over that same period, consumption rose by 10 per cent, from 10,194 kilowatt-hours per capita to 11,217 kilowatt-hours per capita. I repeat: you cannot cut back on essentials and this insidious Labor tax grab will not reduce emissions; it will only reduce the affordability for average Australians.


It is not just the household budget that will take a hit from a carbon tax. Costs for industry will also skyrocket and those costs will either be passed on to consumers, absorbed in job cuts or indeed both. In the Hunter region, thousands rely on the mining and aluminium industries for their work. That includes 1,070 permanent staff and 250 contractors at Tomago Aluminium, the 395 staff and 16 apprentices at Port Waratah Coal Services, the 540 permanent and 38 casual staff at Four Jacks, and the 537 workers at the Hydro Aluminium Kurri Kurri, to name but a few. That is not even mentioning the indirect jobs that those businesses generate, which number in the tens of thousands. Whichever way you look at it, Labor's carbon tax will cost jobs. It is going to put a huge financial strain on the companies that provide work for my constituents. 


The Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Tony Abbott, visited one of these companies just this weekend, the Drayton Mine at Muswellbrook. I note that local federal member, Joel Fitzgibbon, was absent. It is not the first time he has failed to show to such meetings. His Hunter colleagues, Jill Hall, Sharon Grierson, Greg Combet and, further north, Rob Oakeshott have all been surprisingly quiet on this issue in the local area. I fear it is because they have decided to toe the party line on the carbon tax rather than represent their constituents. It is probably because they have heard the figures. AngloCoal, for example, which owns the Drayton Mine, would invest $3.4 billion over the next decade, creating 3,000 new jobs, in the absence of a carbon tax. Those jobs would support families who would spend on local goods and services, in turn boosting the local economy and providing more jobs. Labor does not understand the flow-on affect nor the multipliers of investment. Yet despite all this, Labor wants to put a huge tax on the companies that invest in Australia. It not only wants to tax big businesses, its tax will cripple small, family-run businesses too. If power bills go up thousands of dollars a year, small businesses already struggling to cope will have no choice but to pass on the cost. Jodie who runs the Donut King in my electorate says that if power bills skyrocket with a carbon tax she will have no choice but to put up the cost of a cup of coffee or cut back staff hours. She cannot cut her electricity use any further.


Local Labor members are willing to sell out their workers and send our emissions overseas to less efficient producers, all to appease the Greens. Talk about a government that has lost its way. I want to make this clear: this debate is not about whether we should do something about the environment. It is not about cutting emissions by five per cent by 2020 because we all agree: coalition, Labor, Greens, Independents alike. That is something that needs to be done to reduce our CO2 output. In fact, the government and the coalition have the same target of five per cent reduction by 2020. This debate is about the best way to achieve that aim. A tax that will force emissions and jobs offshore is not the way.


If Prime Minister Gillard, Labor, the Greens and the Independents were convinced that the Australian people wanted a carbon tax they should put it to a vote. The people of Paterson and Australia deserve to have their say. That is why the coalition and I call on this government to hold a plebiscite because it is just too scared to call an election. A plebiscite will give our people the power to say yes or no to a carbon tax that will increase the price of just about every good and service in this nation. It would be the chance we never got before the election. If Prime Minister Gillard had been honest with the people back in August, the public would have had the chance to decide whether it would support a carbon tax. Instead, the Prime Minister stared into the camera five days prior to the polls and ruled out a tax with that famous quote, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' Former Prime Minister Rudd said that addressing climate change through tax was the greatest moral challenge this country faces. I put it to the current Prime Minister: the greatest moral challenge now is to be honest with the people she purports to represent. This government needs to call an election or at the very least hold a plebiscite to get a mandate from the Australian people for its carbon tax. To do otherwise would leave this moribund government with a moral dilemma: after all, it was the Prime Minister who said there would be no carbon tax under the government she led. Therefore, in closing, I call on the Gillard Labor government to take its tax to the people for a decisive answer.
