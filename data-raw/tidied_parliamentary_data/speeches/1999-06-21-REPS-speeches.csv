"Theophanous, Andrew, MP",ALP,1999-06-21,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I have great pleasure in presenting the committee's report entitled Military justice procedures in the Australian Defence Force , together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—The Senate referred this inquiry on 25 November 1997 and, following the federal election, re-referred the matter on 10 March 1999. The committee was asked to examine the existing legislative framework and procedures for the conduct of military inquiries and ADF military processes. In addition to military inquiries and military discipline, the committee identified a further third interrelated component of the military justice system—administrative action. The report addresses each of these three quite distinct components of the military justice system. Each of these components—military inquiries, military discipline and administrative action—is expansive and the committee has not attempted a comprehensive examination of every detail of the military justice system. Rather, the committee has sought to examine the avenues for investigative and punitive action within the ADF to determine if current procedures are unfair, inappropriate or open to misuse.
A sound framework of procedures, policy and legislation underpins the current military inquiry and discipline systems of the ADF. Existing arrangements have been in place for several years and have proven effective. However, in recent times a number of military inquiries and disciplinary matters conducted by the ADF have become the subject of 
 considerable public interest. Many of these cases involved the loss of lives of service personnel and perceived injustices to members of the ADF in their dealings with the military disciplinary system.
The considerable public attention focused on such cases has included questions regarding the effectiveness and independence of the current military inquiry system. In addition, there has been considerable public support behind calls for external inquiries—or, at the very least, external reviews of inquiries—in cases involving the death of an ADF member. The systems of discipline and administrative action employed by the ADF have attracted considerably less public attention, although aspects of the Defence Force Discipline Act have been challenged on several occasions in the High Court of Australia in recent years.
The committee acknowledged the considerable changes made to the military justice system during the course of the inquiry as the ADF moved to address the recommendations of Brigadier the Hon. A.R. Abadee's 1007 report, A Study into Judicial System under the Defence Force Discipline Act, and the Ombudsman's 1998 investigation into how the ADF responds to allegations of serious incidents and offences. However, the committee was not convinced that these ADF initiated changes will fully address both the perceived and the actual independence and impartiality of the military justice system.
Independence and impartiality in the military justice system was a strong theme throughout the conduct of the inquiry. The committee was aware that in cases involving the death of an ADF member many of those involved, particularly family members of the deceased, harbour strong feelings that the military justice system lacks independence. While the inquiry received no evidence to support an allegation of a lack of independence, there is no doubt that a strong perception exists that the military justice system lacks independence and impartiality. While acknowledging the need to address issues of independence and impartiality in the military justice system, the committee had a preference to do so without impeding the workings of the ADF. To this end, the committee 
 retained a focus on the need for the system of military justice to function effectively across the whole spectrum of conflict in which the ADF can be expected to operate.
The committee acknowledged that the ADF has unique requirements for the administration of justice commensurate with its role in the defence of the nation. Moreover, these unique requirements exist as constraints and standards additional to the justice system that pertains to all citizens of Australia. Notwithstanding that members of the ADF voluntarily accept the imposition of an additional layer of justice when they choose to serve their country, the committee was firmly of the view that the military justice system must, so far as possible, conform with community norms and be demonstrably independent, impartial and fair.
The report tabled today contains 59 recommendations. Forty-five of these recommendations relate to the military inquiry system, seven recommendations relate to the system of military discipline and a further seven recommendations relate to the administrative action process employed by the ADF. While I do not have time to go through the key principal recommendations, I hope that the other speakers will do so. While the committee is of the view that these proposals will serve to improve the independence, impartiality and overall operation of the system, it is acknowledged that this report will be disappointing for some who saw the inquiry as an avenue of review for individual cases.

"Hawker, David, MP",LP,1999-06-21,"—In joining this tabling statement by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade with its report entitled Military justice procedures in the Australian Defence Force , I too would like to say a few brief words in the short time available. The principal recommendations of the report will serve to improve the independence, impartiality, fairness and overall operation of the system. In addition, the changes proposed by the committee will address the perceived view of independence, impartiality and fairness in the system of military justice employed within the Australian Defence Force.
In arriving at this report, the committee considered, inter alia, two fundamental issues that underpin the framework of the military justice system: firstly, the requirement for military justice as a system additional to and quite distinct from the justice system that pertains to all citizens of Australia; and, secondly, who should be responsible for the enforcement of military justice. Throughout its deliberations, the committee was cognisant of the Australian Defence Force's unique requirements for the administration of justice commensurate with its role in the defence of the nation and, moreover, that the operation of the military justice system should not impede the workings of the Australian Defence Force. In short, the system of military justice must function effectively across the whole spectrum of conflict in which the Australian Defence Force can be expected to operate.
With regard to the conduct of the military justice system, the committee concluded that the current arrangements for conduct of internal inquiries meet the need of the Australian Defence Force for a rapid review of potential hazards. Moreover, the committee accepted that the factors militating against the use of an external authority to conduct a military inquiry are sufficient to justify the retention of the current practice for matters not involving the loss of life. However, in cases involving the accidental death of an ADF member, the committee was of the view that the need to demonstrate the independence of the inquiry outweighs concerns about the conduct of the inquiry by an external authority. The committee has therefore recommended that the convening of a general court of inquiry be mandatory for all inquiries into matters involving the accidental death of an Australian Defence Force member during an Australian Defence Force activity. This action will serve to remove the ADF from the investigative process and negate any issues of independence or conflict of interest.
On the issue of military discipline, the committee agreed that during deployments and on operations the ADF must have access to a discipline system that can be applied expeditiously and in such a way that service 
 discipline is maintained, operations are not impeded and command authority is supported. Moreover, the standard of military discipline should not vary, regardless of whether it is applied in peace or in a time of conflict. The committee concluded that the current system of military discipline, coupled with the Australian Defence Force's acceptance of most of the Abadee recommendations, provides for an independent and impartial framework. With these changes incorporated, the committee saw no compelling argument to amend the present arrangement and supported the continuation of the present system with minor amendment.
With regard to administrative action, the committee accepted that where behaviour, actions or performance falls short of the high standards of professionalism required by the Australian Defence Force, a commander needs the wherewithal to take action to prevent recurrence. The committee acknowledged that the Defence Force Discipline Act was framed to deal with breaches of discipline and that administrative action provides a suitable avenue for a commander to deal with matters of professional failure. Moreover, the formality of the system allows certain safeguards to ensure that the procedural fairness provisions of administrative law are met.
The recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade's report on military justice procedures in the Australian Defence Force will serve to improve the independence, impartiality, fairness and overall operation of the system. Moreover, they will do so without impeding the workings of the Australian Defence Force, allowing the military justice system to function effectively across the whole spectrum of conflict in which the Australian Defence Force can be expected to operate. I would like to especially mention the contributions of Joanne Towner and particularly Michael Ward to this report.

"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,1999-06-21,"—I would like to acknowledge that this inquiry came about through the efforts of the Hon. Arch Bevis in the last parliament, when he was shadow minister for Defence, and the Senate, which passed the motion to provide 
 the reference. Honourable members know that when an inquiry goes over two parliaments, it presents some difficulties. Nevertheless I trust that members will be well pleased with the report and its recommendations. I want to acknowledge the contributions of Wing Commander Paul Hislop and in particular Lieutenant Colonel Michael Ward, who were seconded from the ADF to assist with the inquiry.
The parliament and the people of Australia expect a lot from our serving men and women, and they deliver in full measure. The military justice system is integral to the effective command and administration of the Defence Force, yet it must, so far as possible, conform with community norms in peace and war. There is no doubt that the ADF has unique requirements for the administration of justice, commensurate with its role in the defence of the nation; however, the system must be demonstrably independent, impartial and fair. These three areas—independence, impartiality and fairness—and, perhaps more significantly, demonstrating the adherence to these principles, were the prominent themes of the inquiry. There is a need for the system of military justice to address both the perceived and the actual independence, impartiality and fairness of the process. The process must be seen to be free from any corrupting influence.
The committee has proposed a number of significant changes. Perhaps the most important of these proposals is that there be a mandatory general court of inquiry into matters involving the accidental death of an Australian Defence Force member during an Australian Defence Force activity. This will serve to remove the department from the investigative process, thus negating any conflict of interest and ensuring independence in the inquiry. Whilst the minister has always had this power within the Defence (Inquiry) Regulations, it has never been exercised. The committee accepted that the conduct of an inquiry by an authority external to the Defence Force will involve some costs in time, resources and perhaps capability. However, the committee felt that the need to demonstrate the independence of the inquiry out 
 weighs reservations regarding the conduct of the inquiry by an external authority.
The committee accepted that in most cases a board of inquiry would provide a suitable avenue to investigate major capital loss. Nevertheless, the committee believes that general courts of inquiry should not be confined to loss of life. The committee was of the view that the Department of Defence should publicly account for its decisions in discharging the recommendations of general courts of inquiry and boards of inquiry. It recommended that the Australian Defence Force should publicly account for the operation of the military justice system by the provision of an annual report to the Minister for Defence and, furthermore, that the annual report be tabled in parliament by the minister.
The committee has recommended that, following the conduct of a general court of inquiry, within the limitations of privacy and national security and at the conclusion of all resultant disciplinary and administrative action, the Minister for Defence should table in the parliament the inquiry report; the recommendations of the investigating body; details of the action to be taken to adopt the recommendations; and, where recommendations are rejected, the reasons for such rejection. The committee did not believe that the public accountability requirements for boards of inquiry should be any less than those for general courts of inquiry discharging the recommendations of the board.
The committee accepted that the post-Abadee arrangements will significantly improve the impartiality and independence of the military discipline system. While the alternative of an independent director of military prosecutions was examined in detail, the committee concluded that the option for the creation of such a body should be re-examined after the impact of the post-Abadee arrangements were effectively assessed in three years time.
The committee has also proposed some changes to the administrative action process employed within the Australian Defence Force. Perhaps of most significance, the committee recommended that the Australian Defence Force consider the implementation of 
 a revised framework of administrative censure and formal warning that makes the process applicable to all members of the Australian Defence Force and incorporates a separation between the roles of initiating officer and decision maker. These proposals will serve to improve the independence, impartiality, fairness and overall operation of the system. In addition, these proposals will strike at the perceived view of the system of military justice employed within the Australian Defence Force. I commend the report to all honourable members.

"Bevis, Arch, MP",ALP,1999-06-21,"—The Workplace Relations Amendment (Defence Purposes Leave) Bill 1999  provides for the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to include in industrial awards leave for workers to participate in activities as members of the Australian Defence Force—a fairly straightforward and, one would have thought, commonsense proposition.
The fact that it is necessary for me as the opposition shadow minister to move such a provision is directly the result of the Howard government's 1996 decisions in the Workplace Relations Act. That legislation deliberately and consciously removed from the industrial commission any power to provide leave for Australian Reserves from their private employment. It was one of the most foolhardy examples of the government's zealous pursuit of their industrial relations agenda.
It is but one of many issues that was cut by this government in its zeal on these matters. I will quickly mention others that were cut in the same process. The commission is no longer able, for example, to include in awards occupational health and safety matters; meal break facilities; amenities for people in lunch rooms; the fact that there should be first aid kits provided in workplaces; or sexual harassment matters. These and many other things have deliberately been removed from the powers of the industrial commission in dealing with workers' rights. It is an indication of this government's obsession about industrial relations that it has been willing to sacrifice good defence policy on the altar of its flat earth industrial relations obsessions. It has been a pursuit of biased and divisive industrial relations policy that has seen that agenda come first before all else.
Indeed, it is an agenda the government intends to pursue in the very near future with the second wave of amendments, which have been forecast to include further reductions in the role of the industrial commission. Specifically, things such as jury service are now to be removed from the consideration of the industrial commission. Why on earth a government would set about denying ordinary workers the opportunity to serve on juries is 
 beyond any reasonable person's thinking; but it is, in fact, in the draft bill that this government will introduce into the parliament very shortly.
Let me return specifically to the questions that this bill seeks to address. Remember that this is, if you like, simply a highlight from those other examples I have referred to, but it is an important one. The matter in this bill was first raised by me as shadow minister for defence in the last parliament by way of a question on notice in August 1997. On that occasion the then minister, Mr McLachlan, said—amongst other things—that the government was considering legislation to fix the problem. That was two years ago. There has been no legislation forthcoming from the government about this matter.
Nearly a year later, in July of 1998, I asked a question without notice of the then Minister for Defence Personnel, Mrs Bishop. She mumbled around, trying to avoid the question, clearly indicating that the government had failed to come to grips with the issue even then. In February of 1998 the then Minister Bishop wrote to the Armed Forces Federation saying:
I am well aware of the threat to reserve training as a possible outcome of the Workplace Relations Act.
She should have been, because the matter had been raised formally with her in the parliament and with her senior minister a year earlier. So what has the government done about that in the two years since this matter was first raised and the nearly three years now since its legislation created this problem? The simple fact is it has done nothing. The Defence Reserve Support Committee is an important structure within the defence establishment for assisting in resolving difficulties between Reserves and their private employers. It is chaired by Sir James Killen, a very respected person in these circles. The minutes of its meeting in November last year say this:
Sir James informed the Conference he had written to the previous government—
that is, the first Howard government—
querying the omission of Reserve leave from the 20 allowable items in the Workplace Relations Act 1996, and discussed the response to his query. He 
 stated that he was unhappy with the response and he intends to pursue the matter.
You have to remember—Sir James Killen was a Liberal government minister for defence, and they won't even listen to his advice. They won't even listen to the Victorian Liberal Council, which earlier this year carried a resolution urging the government `to ensure that defence leave for Reserve Defence Force members is included as an allowable matter in federal awards'. It will be interesting to see the response of the minister, who I imagine attended that meeting. Given that he is a Victorian Liberal member of parliament, he probably went to the Victorian Liberal Conference. I wonder how he voted on that resolution at the Victorian conference. I wonder what he said to that meeting and whether, as Leader of the House, he will allow this matter to be debated and voted on. (Time expired)

"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,1999-06-21,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	 notes the importance of food labelling in providing consumers with accurate nutritional information;
(2)	 recognises that food labelling regulations must contain enough information so that consumers can be confident a product is good value for money, meets their health and nutritional standards and falls within their cultural and religious requirements;
(3)	 recognises that nutritional and dietary related illnesses are matters of public health;
(4)	 expresses concern at the Howard Government's deregulation of food labelling controls;
(5)	 condemns the Howard Government's failure to acknowledge and respond to the level of community anxiety over food labelling deregulation; and
(6)	 calls upon the Howard Government to reverse its decision on food labelling deregulation, work towards greater protection 
 and information for consumers and maintain the health department's role in regulating nutritional and dietary matters.
I have previously spoken on this matter in the parliament, but I now have over 5,000 petitioners from my electorate who demand that this matter be debated and the government's position be challenged. Honesty is the cornerstone of consumer protection. It is the government's responsibility to make laws that ensure all sellers are honest about the products they sell. The test of honesty goes beyond whether a lie is told. It is the providing of all information that should be provided to the consumer. Food labelling must not be allowed to be misleading. It cannot deceive, nor should it fail to provide information that a consumer deserves to know about a product.
There are few things more important than protecting the quality and integrity of the food we eat. Currently, food labelling falls short of the public's expectation. Rather than going backwards, we must look seriously at ensuring that all relevant information is available to the consumers at the point of purchase. Food labels must use language that accurately describes the product. The minimum composition requirements are essential for the purposes of comparison shoppers. No-name or no-frills brands do not have a corporate reputation to protect and may therefore produce the cheapest allowable product. This means that low income families choosing the cheapest ice-cream in the supermarket could well buy the cheap substitute ice-cream confection labelled as `ice-cream'. While this product may be cheaper, if your intention was to purchase real ice-cream, then you would be ripped off.
Labelling should not just describe the product. The community also expects that important nutritional information is provided on the product. Information about the levels of salt, fats and sugars as well as vitamins, iron and protein must be provided along with a list of all the ingredients. I am concerned that some food labelling proposals will take away valid distinctions from the nutritional panel, such as the banding together of carbohydrates without a distinction for sugars as opposed to more complex carbohydrates. For example, any label that suggest that oats are 
 of equal nutritional value to Cocoa Pops is of no real use to consumers.
Any labelling of ingredients must also label genetically engineered food products. The level of community concern over GE foods cannot be dismissed. The concerns range from those who philosophically and fundamentally oppose genetic engineering—these people wish to know what foods are genetically modified so that they may avoid them completely—to those sufferers of quite severe allergies. These people have often dramatic and sometimes fatal reactions to the proteins contained in certain food groups. Therefore, when the tomato is genetically modified with the genes of, say, flounder for frost resistance there is a potential impact for the many people allergic to seafood. Only by labelling GE tomatoes or products with GE tomatoes can we ensure that these people are protected.
With GE foods, public health remains as the central issue in food regulation. With genetic engineering advancing at such a rapid pace we are all left with questions over this emerging food source, questions about genetic engineering and the environment, genetic engineering and food quality, genetic engineering and our health and also genetic engineering and our primary industries.
Food and diet are such an important part of overall health. That is why the role of regulating our food should be the responsibility of the health department. The government's proposal to shift ANZFA's responsibility away from health and into primary industries represents a dangerous realignment of focus for the government. Food laws should not be the responsibility of food producers. Food laws must be health laws.
This motion condemns the Howard government's failure to acknowledge and respond to the level of community anxiety over this issue. I have been listening to the community about food labelling, and I share their concerns. We urge the government to talk to the community about these proposals and find out why we are unhappy and why these changes cause concern. Along with the thousands of petitions sent to my office on this issue I have received many letters. All of these letters have expressed support for the 
 views I raise here. These people who have written their support for the underlying wisdom of food labelling regulation fail to understand why the government would want to remove such protection. But, instead of just my words on this matter, I wish to expose the government to some of the wisdom of my constituents. Mrs Rose writes:
I am sure none of the Australian population wish to be misled in any area. I am not in favour of the changes in food labelling or even in the new idea of genetic engineering of growing food. This will mean we will not have any idea of what we are eating.
Mrs Whiting says:
About time for a stand to be made on this matter. I know only too well the impact that will be inflicted on many of us if the Howard government is successful. I myself have allergies and sensitivities to foods, I know of many others that do also. The situation is bad enough to cope with, without having misleading labels on foods. The present situation on labelling is bad enough without the Howard government inflicting an even worse situation. For some of us it is not just an adverse reaction to foods that apply if that isn't bad enough but to some the matter is of life or death.
Mr Woods sent a short note to say he is thankful for:
. . . opportunity to protest against the proposed food regulation. I am totally against what the bill stands for. I hope that we will be successful against it.
Mrs Oostergard simply says:
If the labels do not show what the ingredients are and my nephew was to eat peanuts or egg, he will die.
Mr Davidson sent a stack of signatures and a note to say:
I work with 70 people and they are concerned at these proposed changes.
Ms Mitchell asks the government:
What I don't understand is why the Howard government is proposing these changes and why hasn't this been made public.
Ms Thorne says:
In the supermarkets many products have deliberately been labelled with an Australian sounding name when they are produced overseas.
The trickery behind low fat and lite are well known. These and other marketing strategies I have believed immoral if not illegal. We have needed for a long time stricter laws to enforce the needs of the population.  

I believe that if companies want to sell food products they have a responsibility to inform the public: where it was grown, processed, the exact contents and where the holding company is based. On past history this will only come about through legislation.
I have another letter which was received from Ms Monkman. She says:
My primary concern regarding food labelling is genetically engineered foods—GE foods—closely followed by allergies—as stated in your letter. Australians must be free to choose whether or not they wish to consume GE foods.
In Europe and the USA there has been a major outcry and many protests over GE foods entering the food chain. As a result, many foods must be labelled as GE foods. The fact that there is such a prevalence of GE foods on the market overseas, yet not widespread support for them, opens an avenue for Australia to export GE free foods.
Almost all the letters I have received from people have asked for more information to be provided to them about this issue. The lack of community consultation over this issue needs to be corrected. To this end, I have organised a public meeting in my electorate to help raise awareness of this issue and to give the people the opportunity to discuss it and ask questions. Lindsay Tanner, the shadow minister for consumer affairs, whose interest and concern about this issue is appreciated, will be there, and a leading authority on these matters, Dick Copeman, will attend to answer many of the questions put forward from the community. This meeting will also serve as a rallying point for all the people committed to changing the government's course on these matters. We want to send a message to the government that they must reverse their decision on food labelling deregulation.
The government must abandon these new, weaker food laws and instead work towards greater protection. The government must investigate the current food laws and find ways to strengthen them. This message has come through from the community loud and clear. The government must keep public health and safety as the number one objective of all food laws. The responsibility for protecting the health of the community also must remain within the health department. The whole community must be given the opportunity to debate any proposed changes to food 
 labelling laws and what is contained in our food products.

"Pyne, Chris, MP",LP,1999-06-21,"—The member for Oxley has already made a number of contributions on the subject of food labelling in this House. Indeed, I followed the member for Oxley in a grievance debate recently when he spoke and waxed lyrical on the subject of jam—a micropolicy if ever there was one. However, it is certainly pleasing to see that the current member for Oxley is concerned more with issues of substance than his predecessor, who brought great embarrassment to this House.
Food labelling crosses two broad and important policy areas: health and consumer rights. The member for Oxley has raised some interesting points covering both these areas in his motion, but it is disappointing that in it he has also chosen to make cheap, false and contradictory attacks on the federal government's position. For example, in his own speech, he talked about the moving of ANZFA out of the health area. That is certainly not the intention of the government. ANZFA remains firmly in the health department, because food labelling is as much a health issue today as it was when the Labor Party was in office.
On the one hand, the member for Oxley claims that consumers want explicit details on the foodstuffs that they purchase. In the grievance debate on 29 March, he observed that `the Australian consumer today is hungry for information on food'. The implication is that most consumers will favour purchasing foodstuffs that provide these details and information, but the member for Oxley contradicts himself by protesting that the government should establish what would be a complex, inefficient framework of rules, regulations and legislation to compel food producers to provide these details. In other words, the government should force producers to meet market demands. The member for Oxley clearly does not understand the concept of market forces. But I am not going to give 
 him a small lecture on economics because his colleague the member for Werriwa does so on a regular basis and I am sure that he can be left to do that task.
In the time remaining to me in this debate, I will outline the coalition government's reforms to date in the area of food labelling in addition to potential policy directions. The old adage `you are what you eat' is very sage advice. Like the member for Oxley, I would like to see all Australians taking an active interest in the nutritional value and exact content of the foods they eat. It is a practice that would lend itself to the prevention of avoidable illnesses and promote better health, both physical and mental. A healthier population is not just a responsible social policy outcome in terms of better quality of life, it is also a positive economic policy. A healthier population will result in greater national productivity due to the taking of less sick leave, as well as reducing demand and cost to the public and private health systems.
A food labelling policy which enforces antiquated and inefficient regulatory frameworks on food producers will not make people healthier. It will not make people who do not read the content labels of foodstuffs any more informed or aware. The government cannot force people to read labels and be product aware. A better and more productive strategy is to educate the public about nutritional standards through education and consumer awareness programs. If consumers are familiar with the benefits of better eating and the importance of purchasing foodstuffs which clearly detail their nutritional standards, then the market will respond accordingly—and that is exactly what the government has set out to achieve.
Enhanced consumer awareness is best achieved through education and marketing. Education programs that target a specific issue or initiative are an important responsibility of government. The coalition government has repeatedly demonstrated its commitment to public education and awareness programs. Whether it be informing people about the 30 per cent rebate for private health insurance, a new tax system or the debate about a national head of state, making the public more aware 
 of nutritional standards and food labelling is another responsibility of government.
Creating consumer awareness about nutritional standards will develop genuine consumer demand for food labelling. If people are aware of the many benefits of eating nutritious foods and if people know what to look for when evaluating the nutritional value of food product, then it only stands to reason that people will favour purchasing foodstuffs that make this information available. Food producers will know that, if they do not meet this demand, their sales revenue will plummet and their market share will be lost to the producer who has met the standards of food labelling which consumers demand.
To meet consumption patterns, the market for reduced fat or less sugar products has significantly increased in recent years. Food producers know that, if they want to capture a share of the market, they need to meet that market's food labelling and identification requirements. This phenomenon has also resulted in substantial product development and innovation. Other niche markets are also developing. The Organic Federation of Australia believes that the organic produce market is an industry worth $100 million a year. In fact, in my own electorate an organic supermarket recently opened on Magill Road and its business is thriving. This indicates that, in fact, on the ground, what I am saying is true.
The member for Oxley fails to recognise the significance of the coalition government's contributions to reforms in the area of food labelling. This includes amendments which were passed through the Senate in the Trade Practices Amendment (Country of Origin Representations) Bill 1998. The passing of this legislation was a great win for consumers as well as many local industries, particularly the citrus industry. The citrus industry was suffering as a result of legislation which the former Labor government presided over. That legislation included a regulatory framework that was putting many important jobs at risk.
Under the coalition government's reforms, producers have a superior competitive edge in marketing their product by clearly identifying whether the goods for sale are produced and/or manufactured in Australia. Under the 
 government's reforms, to be labelled `Made in Australia', products must be substantially transformed in Australia and the majority of the costs incurred in Australia. I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker, as a person from rural Australia, you would know exactly what I am talking about; the National Party played a crucial role in that legislation and in ensuring that Australian producers were not disadvantaged vis-a-vis overseas producers.
To qualify for a `Produce of Australia' label, the premium label, the product must be 100 per cent Australian or as near to it as possible. The coalition government has committed itself to assist in the promotion of labels in conjunction with an education program and marketing campaign which will identify products as being above the 50 per cent Australian content threshold.
Although these reforms have been successful, the coalition government is prepared to consider further reforms to food standards practice. The Australian New Zealand Food Authority has made great contributions to the development of food labelling policies. I understand that the authority is currently undertaking a review of food standards—and I am sure that the parliamentary secretary at the table would be aware of some of these issues, having been the parliamentary secretary for health in the last parliament and having some responsibility in the area of food labelling.
The member for Oxley may be interested to learn that the underlying principles of the review currently being conducted by the authority were first agreed to under the Keating government and are now being progressed by all state and territory health ministers. At present, Australia has 93 food standards in operation to ensure that our food is safe and meets strict compositional requirements. However, many of these food standards were developed over 20 years ago and no longer hold any contemporary currency in terms of meeting consumers' demands and the commercial practicalities of producers. Most of these standards are highly prescriptive, unnecessarily technical and a barrier to product development and innovation. Unnecessary regulatory demands not only add to 
 the costs to the manufacturer, they also result in financial burdens on consumers. Streamlining the food standards process whilst simultaneously maintaining its integrity will have the twofold effect of protecting consumers and reducing production costs.
The priority of the food standards review is to ensure that there are effective food composition and labelling standards in place to ensure that food is safe for people. It is essential that the standards are clear and easy for consumers to understand. Contrary to the member for Oxley's hyperbole, Australian food standards will never be compromised where there is a demonstrated risk to public safety and health. There can be little doubt that many of the current food standards that concentrate on the rigid composition of food are best managed by industry in response to consumer demand. The removal of many prescriptive food standards will see a greater range of food products as manufacturers are freed from unnecessary technical barriers.
But the member for Oxley appears to be supporting a complicated web of bureaucratic red tape to regulate the labelling of food. If that is not the case, I would ask him to clear that matter up for us, perhaps in the adjournment or 90-second statement debate. I am very sceptical of the idea that this is an efficient and productive use of government and industry resources.
The government already regulates deceptive conduct and misleading advertising through trade practice and fair trading legislation. I can see little reason to reinvent the wheel by creating a complicated web of bureaucratic rules that make industry inefficient and products more expensive. A public policy which actively promotes the benefits of better nutrition and educates the public about how to determine the nutritional value of food represents a superior strategy. I will leave the other coalition speakers to cover some of those issues to do with health and the benefits to Australians of a good nutritional policy.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Food Labelling</title>,Private Members' Business,2,1,speech
"Wilkie, Kim, MP",ALP,1999-06-21,"—I rise to support the private member's motion moved by the member for Oxley regarding food labelling. Many in our community are concerned about recent movements on this issue. 
 Seemingly, attempts have been made by this government to water down our labelling legislation. It should be borne in mind that this month over 4.4 million people will purchase food at supermarkets and grocery stores and almost $4.7 billion will be spent on various items. Needless to say, it is perhaps the most basic of human activities and it cannot be jeopardised.
A further irony in any attempt to deregulate food labelling and a matter that has been discussed in this House is that this government's attempt to deregulate the food industry could place an industry worth $42 billion, of which $16 billion are export oriented, in doubt. Instead, like many other nations, we should be invigorating the scrutiny of the food industry in terms of production, inspection and monitoring. Food labelling is the end result of a long line of effective examination of all matters pertaining to the industry.
I also feel it necessary to raise in this debate the issue of genetically modified food. As many members in this House will be aware, considerable community apprehension has been voiced over recent policy by this government on this issue. Much of what we are discussing today, especially genetic technology, is very new and complex and can be very detailed. This, of course, should not daunt this House or decision makers. With food, there can be no compromise. Decisions need to be considered at length and will require patience and education. We need to consider the benefits and also the pitfalls of a deregulated environment.
Three vital points need to be raised when discussing the food labelling and regulatory process. Firstly, there seems to be an unofficial undertaking to accept that the labelling of food should be left to the producers. In the case of genetically modified food, there is an acceptance that no interference in the marketing of these products should occur. This is ridiculous. Put simply, profits should not come first. Consumers should have both a choice of product and a choice of information on that product.
Disappointingly, the Australia New Zealand Food Authority, which incidentally had its budget reduced this year by this government, 
 claims that a mandatory requirement to label foods that are `substantially equivalent' to their conventional counterparts is not prescribed because, one, it cannot be justified on sound scientific principles—a point yet to be appreciated by many in the community; two, such foods are not unsafe for human consumption, and this is an issue that needs further open examination; and, three, it is more restrictive than necessary to achieve a legitimate outcome.
It is my understanding that the term `substantial equivalence' used by the authority is said to mean the food has three elements. It is said to be the same in physical composition, organic qualities and nutritional value. Surely consumers have the right to differentiate and choose between these products. To do so, they need to be labelled appropriately. Our success in this nation as a primary producer and exporter has been due to the consumer perception, internationally and domestically, that we supply a clean, fresh and untainted product. Food labelling reinforces these perceptions of our food. To the consumer, labelling illustrates honesty and integrity. All the nutritional advice is plain to see, and most decisions are based on this information.
Secondly, disappointingly the regulatory agencies seem to have acquiesced to the acceptance of this position, and parliament, under this government, has abrogated its responsibility to ensure a safety first philosophy on the issue. In this process, I hold the belief that there is a role for parliament in monitoring the development of some kind of regulatory scheme in which the community can have confidence that their views and concerns are being heard and dealt with. This is not actually happening. My concern goes further, as I believe the parliament has the role of ensuring that vested financial interests do not surpass those of the community.
Thirdly, I believe that food labelling is an important consumer issue. It is based on the right to choose and also the right to make an informed choice. The decision to water down the regulatory barriers will alienate the community's concerns about the food industry, in particular the concerns regarding the use of genetic technology.
I am aware of the recent Consensus Conference on Gene Technology held at Old Parliament House in March. The conference examined a number of critical elements of the food debate in regulatory and scientific issues, as well as the ethical dimensions of genetically modified food. Among other recommendations, the final report called for the mandatory labelling of genetically modified foods.
Therefore, I conclude by saying that regulatory agencies should continue with a strict nutritional and content labelling regime. In fact, the highest world standards should be benchmarked and applied in this nation, and this should include all genetically modified food. Agencies and this parliament have a responsibility to ensure that consumers are put first.

"Somlyay, Alex, MP",LP,1999-06-21,"—I accept that the member for Oxley has a genuine concern about food labelling—he is a new member of the opposition and has been in parliament for eight months or so. It is refreshing to hear that the other side is interested in this topic. It is refreshing because we must remember that the Labor Party had 13 years of government to address these issues and it did not, and those of us in rural electorates were very concerned at the lack of action by the Labor Party on this issue.
The Howard government acts on the basic principle that consumers must be adequately and honestly informed about what is in the food they buy, and that means consumers both in Australia and overseas. We have no intention of putting at risk Australia's reputation as a clean food producer. That is very valuable to us as a nation, but, again, it is particularly valuable for those of us in the regional and rural seats.
Some consumers have allergies to foods or need to keep a close watch on the nutritional content of their diet. For these reasons, accurate labelling is vital. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, I myself have late onset diabetes so I know personally the importance of accurate labelling from the point of view that diabetics and other people with health problems have to watch the content of the food very carefully.
Australia has a worldwide reputation for safe, pure and high quality food which is underpinned by a plethora of rules and regulations variously administered and enforced by all three levels of government. It is good to see that the member for Oxley acknowledged in the Hansard on 29 March this year that we have tighter controls and regulations on food products here in Australia than in most other countries. We have food inspectors, quarantine inspection services, consumer associations, the Therapeutic Goods Administration and the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals to ensure our high standards are maintained.
We also have the Australia New Zealand Food Authority, ANZFA, which works under the direction of the Australian and New Zealand health ministers to develop and maintain laws and systems that regulate food here in Australia and in New Zealand. ANZFA, which operates under the umbrella of the federal Department of Health and Aged Care—and I note that it is staying in the federal health department—must consider the needs of consumers, compliance costs for industry and Australia's international obligations and commitment to free trade.
The Australia and New Zealand Food Standards Council, as part of ANZFA, has been monitoring and regulating our food industry since 1991. At the federal level, we have the Food Standards Code which is administered by ANZFA. We have also established other international alliances for worldwide food standards through the United Nations and the World Health Organisation. This provides protection for Australians who buy imported food and also promotes international confidence in our food industry, which is worth over $16 billion in export revenue.
ANZFA's current review does not mean lower standards of food labelling or that the safety of our food will be compromised. The point is to make the new code simpler, less prescriptive and easier to understand. Many of the standards are out of date and were developed at a time when our daily diet was very different from the wide range of foods we enjoy today. I repeat that the Howard government has got no intention of putting at 
 risk Australia's reputation as a clean food producer.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Food Labelling</title>,Private Members' Business,2,1,speech
"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,1999-06-21,"—The Howard government's decision to move to deregulate food labelling controls in Australia is a regressive move, one that has the potential to have an enormous impact on the food industry, community health and trade. I believe that the Howard government needs to admit it has made a mistake and needs to reconsider its decision and reintroduce or maintain the regulations that will ensure that Australians and our trading partners know what they are buying.
Under deregulation, one of our Australian icons—the meat pie—is set to become the offal pie. Australians will not know that they are buying an offal pie instead of a meat pie because, under the new regulations, manufacturers and producers will not be required to tell the consumers what is in that pie, and that is a disgrace. That is an absolute disgrace. This will have an impact in two ways: (a) the consumers will not know what they are buying, and (b) those boutique pie shops that really put a lot of effort into preparing an excellent product, something that is very special, will not benefit from the fact that they are producing what is a true meat pie. So it is going to have an enormous impact in just that one industry, and that is a good example to show how it will impact.
Jams: instead of going along and buying some strawberry jam and knowing you are getting real fruit strawberry jam, you will be getting a bit of jelly, a bit of water with some flavouring in it, and that is not what Australian consumers deserve. Vegetarians have a real concern about this issue, because they want to know that the products they are buying do not contain any meat or animal products whatsoever. That is another area of concern.
Possibly, though, the greatest area of concern is the community health issue. Products should display their fat, sugar and salt content. You should be able to pick up a package, look at it and know immediately what you are buying. If products are not properly labelled, it can lead to an increase in cardiovascular disease and it can also lead to an 
 increase in diabetes. As a member on the other side said, late onset diabetes is a real problem in our community.
One way of combating this is through a healthy, adequate diet. How can people make a commitment to a healthy diet if they do not know what they are eating? We have a number of health campaigns in our community that are geared towards encouraging people to restrict their intakes of fat, sugar and salt, and I know that many, many consumers go to the supermarket and read those labels. Only those manufacturers who make products with a low fat content will be prepared to identify that on the label of their product because they will see that as a marketing tool. They will see that by listing the fact that their products have a low fat content, people will buy them—unlike those products with a very high fat content, which will be left off the label.
The health dollar is already stretched to its limit and, if we are going to have an increase in these types of diseases caused by inadequate labelling, I really feel this will have a very negative impact on the government. In relation to the trade issue, Australian products need to say what is in them if our overseas trading partners are to purchase the products. I believe that genetically modified food needs to be identified, too.
This government constantly argues that Australians should be given a choice. It argues that government should subsidise private health insurance and private schools to give Australians a choice, yet when it comes to something as basic as enabling Australians to make an informed choice about foods they consume the Howard government is denying that ability to Australians—denying them the ability to make this choice because the information consumers need to make that choice is not going to be available on the label. I call on the government to re-regulate the food labelling. (Time expired)

"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,1999-06-21,"—Due to my interest in aviation matters, it will come as no surprise to this House that I rise to speak about the increased flight movements in the skies above Western Sydney. I refer to several sightings on Sunday, 6 June for the first time in my 30 years residence of this area of that great Australian aviation giant—the black cockatoo. While I am not a professional bird watcher, I have become aware over the past 10 to 15 years of an increase in the number of Australian native birds that have returned to this part of my electorate. I am advised by those who take a keen interest in these things that the variety of birds that have moved back to Blacktown are the rainbow lorikeet, the red wattle bird, the butcher bird, the Australian magpie, the eastern spinebill and the Australian ibis.
I would suggest that this increase in bird life will indicate that we are winning our battle to maintain a cleaner environment in Western Sydney. We must continue our battle to ensure that industry, residents, commercial developers and the general community work hand in hand to ensure that we balance society's needs for employment opportunities with a friendly environment.

"Howard, John, MP",LP,1999-06-21,"—I am glad the Leader of the Opposition has asked me this question, and I will endeavour to address it with the seriousness that it deserves. It remains a 
 matter of great regret to me and to the government that, so far, we have not been able to secure the release of these two fine Australians, who were not spies but engaged on humanitarian work inside the former Yugoslavia.
The Leader of the Opposition will be aware from his own experience in government that when a situation like this arises there are a lot of things that are done and said behind the scenes which, if made public, might prejudice the outcome that we seek to achieve. I ask the Leader of the Opposition to accept it from me—and I am very happy to provide him with private briefings, if he so desires—that the government has, ever since these two men were taken into captivity, done everything it could do through the normal overt diplomatic channels, and also many other things through back channels, in order to bring about the release of these two men. You will also be aware of the efforts of the aid organisation CARE International.
I can inform you that the foreign minister went to Belgrade at the weekend at the express invitation of the foreign minister on the understanding and in the belief that the prospects of a meeting with Slobodan Milosevic were very strong. It is apparent from what the foreign minister has told us since the weekend that domestic circumstances inside Yugoslavia conspired to bring about a situation where Milosevic felt that he could no longer see the foreign minister. It ought not to be interpreted from that that the prospects of release in the near future have gone out the window.
But it is also self-evident that the Yugoslav state is in a very precarious condition. It has just emerged from a period of some 70-odd days where it was under the heaviest military bombing which has been embarked upon by any group of countries since World War II. The President of Yugoslavia himself is facing very serious charges in relation to criminal activity.
You will I think understand that the pressures that are operating in this situation are extremely difficult. They are quite intense. Our objective is to get the men out, not to score every rhetorical point. Our objective is 
 not to seek to win debating arguments to secure the release of Mr Pratt and Mr Wallace. As a consequence, we intend to bite our lips and our tongues in relation to some things that are said by quite a number of people who should not say them.
I ask the opposition to accept that we are doing everything we humanly can. If the Leader of the Opposition wants further information, I am very happy to make that available to him, and I extend that same courtesy to the member for Kingsford-Smith.

Let me make it entirely clear: books purchased overseas are liable to GST. In fact, I do not even know why I am asked this question, because the Labor Party opposes any GST on books purchased overseas. That is your policy. You oppose any GST on books purchased overseas. This is the Labor Party that stands up here in question time and says, `How come you are only giving rebates to 20c a litre on diesel excise when we are opposed to any rebate?' It is the Labor Party that stands up here and says, `How come you have taken food out of the growth tax for the states?' when it is opposed to any growth tax.
—Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. He has been asked a specific question about a piece of correspondence from his office which makes amply clear mechanisms by which people can avoid paying a GST on books and journals imported into this country. It is not a question by the Labor Party about whether a GST ought to be applied to books domestically. We do not think there should be a GST at all. The question is of relevance.

—Mr Speaker, if I may say so, the point was just made by the Leader of the Opposition. He says he does not believe there should be a GST on books imported into Australia, so he will get up and he will ask a question on why it is that you are able to get around a GST on books imported into Australia. Hypocrisy has no bounds in the hands of the Australian Labor Party.

"Neville, Paul, MP",NP,1999-06-21,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	 acknowledges the necessity of preserving the sustainability of the Australian fishing stocks;
(2)	 recognises the economic potential of quality seafood exports;
(3)	 commends the industry for its work on by-catch reduction devices (BRDs) and turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) and the protection of nursery grounds;
(4)	 acknowledges the value of the vessel monitoring system (VMS) as a cost-efficient method of vessel location and crew safety and especially of regulating closures by strategic area locations rather than by time; and
(5)	 calls for sanity and equity in balancing the protection of the marine environment and the legitimate expectations of fishermen, their families and those communities reliant on them.
We as a nation are blessed with the world's third largest fishing zone—nine million square kilometres—for which we have a unique cooperative management system involving industry, government and the scientific community. The industry contributes $1.9 billion a year to our economy before value adding. Seafood exports make up $1.5 billion of our trade effort. This figure is growing at 15 per cent per year, placing it in the top five food export earners after beef, wheat, wool and diary.
I want to address this motion in terms of developments in the Queensland trawl fishery and, in particular, as it pertains to my electorate and the major fishing ports of Bundaberg and Gladstone, to 1770 and, more widely, to Yeppoon, Hervey Bay and Tin Can Bay. This motion was framed out of a concern for the families involved in the south Queensland trawl fishery in particular and Australian fisheries in general. There are recent examples of where cooperative management has produced positive outcomes, but when cooperation is forsaken problems arise. Recent developments in the Queensland trawl fishery seriously question the ideal of cooperative 
 management, and I suggest it is not the fishermen who are to blame.
The trawl fishery is Queensland's largest commercial fishery, producing 10,000 tonnes worth about $150 million each year. There are 800 vessels operating, and these employ 2,500 fishers. Bundaberg is the second largest trawl port in Queensland and Gladstone is not far behind. That fishery provides an interesting case study against which to test the validity of my motion today. On Thursday, the Queensland commercial fishing organisation released a trawl management plan proposing a seasonal closure in both the northern and the southern Queensland trawl fisheries. This closely followed the release of a CSIRO report into prawn trawling in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, reaction to which has generated some angst in the industry. The QFMA plan would have severe impacts on the viability of many small family trawl operations fishing in the southern scallop and king prawn fisheries due to the timing of a blanket shut-out. The plan was handed down despite it being roundly rejected by the industry at consultative meetings from Hervey Bay to Yeppoon.
I believe—as do the majority of fishermen in my electorate—that there are alternatives to seasonal closures of the entire fishery. These alternatives will still adequately safeguard the resource itself, the environment and the livelihood of trawl operators as well as their export markets. The alternatives include spatial closures, effort restrictions and gear restrictions. These fishermen acknowledge the vital importance of preserving sustainable stocks. They also acknowledge that there are some legitimate concerns about the current stocks of prawns and scallops, but they argue it would be better to have spatial closures covering scallop nurseries and the areas where juvenile prawns mature rather than, in time, closures. Seasonal closures do little for the ecology and less still for the protection of juvenile stocks. By contrast, you can enforce spatial closures to suit the scallop nursery locations and juvenile prawn habitats. In other words, we have the technology to protect sensitive areas and keep the rest of the fishery open. 
After the six-week seasonal closure—culminating in the start of the cyclone season, I might add—fishermen with no cash flow for the previous six weeks will be forced to seek a catch at almost any cost rather than maintaining best practice to secure a quality catch in a sustainable way. Desperation will drive a practice referred to in the industry as `pulse fishing'. This is described by one industry executive as `world's worst practice'. To illustrate the point, two years ago at the Natives Sports Club in Bundaberg I attended a meeting of 150 leading fishermen from the Sunshine Coast to Yeppoon. In one of the most fiery protest meetings I have seen, the fishermen successfully countered the assertion that scallop stocks were overfished in Hervey Bay, arguing that cold currents which killed the spat or the eggs of the scallops had been the principal culprit in catch decline.
As an alternative to the major seasonal closure, fishermen proposed at the time that three nursery areas of 10 nautical miles square be closed on a permanent basis off Bustard Head, Yeppoon and the African Gutter off the Fraser coast. This resulted in a record scallop catch the following season—an example of cooperative management at its best and an acknowledgment of the practical knowledge of fishermen themselves. Another example of this type of industry driven response was seen in the Tin Can Bay prawn fishery. Fishermen there supported a year-round closure of an area 10 nautical miles by three to ensure that prawns developed to eight to 10 centimetres before migrating out of the protected zone, thus benefiting the industry and the environment alike.
These same Central Queensland fishermen have been at the forefront in adopting turtle exclusion devices, known as TEDs, to ensure that swimming turtles escape from their nets. They are also the leaders in adopting bycatch reduction devices, BRDs as they are known, to allow free swimming fish, sharks and other species to escape the net. At present, the majority of trawlers—50 per cent to 80 per cent, it is estimated—in some ports are using either TEDs or BRDs as part of their normal fishing practices, and they will shortly become mandatory.
One promising development has been the appearance of locally designed TEDs and BRDs, which have much greater appeal to local fishermen. It was for the design of one such device that Bundaberg fisherman John Olsen recently won a DPI design award. Although TEDs and BRDs reduce catch, fishermen are voluntarily using them to produce a higher quality catch of a particular species while adding to the sustainability of the industry overall. I have attended meetings where fishermen have called for lighter chains and running boards which effectively skim across the bottom of the seabed. These fishermen deplore the fact that some cowboys do not observe accepted best practice of using 400 horsepower motors, but use 500 horsepower motors to pull heavy boards and chains along the seabed like a plough. This action appals the majority of fishermen, but little has been done by authorities in this field.
Interestingly, in a letter to the minister following the release of the CSIRO prawn trawling report, Mr Olsen called for $6 million over five years to be spent on a detailed analysis of the best trawl gear—hardly the action of an environmental rapist.
I might point out that, despite the image on your television screens of bright little fish swimming in exquisite soft coral, this is not the environment fished by these fishing trawlers. The reality is that trawling goes on nowhere near these environments, quite apart from the obvious net damage which would ensue. In fact, with sophisticated sonar and radar technology, the art of net making is dying out as pilots are better able to avoid any obstacle on the ocean floor.
The industry in my electorate has also been active in pursuing the compulsory fitting of vessel monitoring systems to boats to ensure the protection of permanently closed parts of the fishery and the reef as well as other marine park areas and nursery grounds. The Queensland fishery now leads the world in the adoption of VMSs as the largest single user of satellite monitoring technology. The fitting of VMSs will become compulsory for all trawlers from 1 July 1999 and has been compulsory for scallop fishermen since 1 September last year. Since vessels can be 
 accurately pinpointed at any time, it would be much wiser to avoid seasonal closures and use strategic spatial closures protecting juvenile and nursery grounds. It is not generally well known—even after the release of the CSIRO report to which I referred earlier—how much of the reef is really available for fishing. Of the 350,000 square kilometres which constitute the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, 135,000 square kilometres, or 44 per cent, is available for fishing. But 12 per cent is not trawled at all. Of the remaining 32 per cent, 22 per cent is trawled with only one pass or sweep per year.(Time expired)

"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,1999-06-21,"—On the surface, the wording of the motion is such that everyone may agree with it, although the previous speaker obviously put a particular emphasis on one aspect of it. We certainly all recognise that in 1997-98 with a total of $1.5 billion the Australian fishing industry was, and still is, of vital importance and a major trader with Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong and China. Equally, we have the third largest fishing zone in the world, although we ourselves do not utilise a major portion of it. They are aspects that we all agree with. However, I would put a different emphasis on the aspects of this particular motion.
It was very timely that I recently read a major book called Cod by Mark Kurlansky, which has been an international bestseller. It notes some of the international phenomena with regard to fishing. On page 195, he refers to the Canadian situation. Weeks before the then fishery minister of Canada, Mr Mifflin, had talked about the revival of cod fishing in Canadian waters, a fisherman, Mr Rose, said:
We found 15,000 cod in the South Bay, and everyone said the cod are back. Hold on! Ten years ago, the biomass, the population, was 1.2 million.
The book deals with the situation in the United Kingdom. On page 209 it says:
According to the British government— 

not according to Greenpeace, not according to environmentalists, but according to the British government of the time—
70 per cent of the species in British waters are being overfished. In the North Sea, the catch dropped from 287,000 metric tons in 1981 to 86,000 in 1991. Like Canada's northern stock, British cod are now reaching maturity at a much younger age than the normal three to five years, and large cod are increasingly rare.
That book recounts the essential decline of the industry and the jobs that have disappeared over time. As early as 1995-96, the Parliamentary Library had a paper called On High Seas?—Australia's Fishing Industry . At that early stage it noted:
At the present time the fishing industry is facing the major challenge of maintaining or increasing profitability when there is little likelihood of increase in production tonnage and possibly a decline. Restructuring to reduce excess capacity and overcapitalisation is one option. Overcapitalisation and the concomitant overcapacity is a feature of the fishing industry generally.
I should refer again to Kurlansky's book for a moment and to the way in which he charts the degree to which this industry is subsidised internationally, in the European Community and by Japan. In the case of Japan, many millions of dollars have gone into credit that will never be repaid by the industry.
 So I have no dispute with aspects of the motion moved by the member. It talks about sustainability, how much it contributes to the country, et cetera. But I think we have to spend a little more time in being careful rather than in finding reasons why protection methods should be attacked. I thought the main point he was putting forward was that we are being overcautious. In contrast, I would feel that, for the long-term viability of the industry and the long-term preservation of those jobs, we have to err on the side of that caution. Similarly, in Fishery Status Reports 1998 it was commented that the previous report had reported:
3 species were overfished, 11 fully fished, 2 underfished and the status of 11 was uncertain. Of the species or fishery/species groups covered in the individual status report chapters presented in the current reports, 4 are overfished, 12 are fully fished, 1 is underfished, and the status of 13 is uncertain.  

So once again that report expressed some concerns. With the member for Lyons, who is also speaking in this debate, I have been involved in a number of treaty considerations by that committee. Another aspect there is the question of bycatch and the need to have great care in that area. That same Fishery Status Reports  says:
The bycatch of important marine species, including seabirds, turtles and dugong, is a significant issue, as is concern over the loss of benthic habitat due to dredging and trawling.
The previous speaker referred to trawling. It continues:
While these are direct impacts from fishing, the productivity of valuable stocks is also being threatened by environmental impacts arising outside the fishing sector—
and it goes on to talk about ballast water. As I say, I can readily identify with the strict wording of that motion but I would perhaps put a greater emphasis on the need for the government and the industry to be very careful in not exploiting the resource and indeed to actually—in fact rather than rhetoric—deal strongly with sustainability.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Marine Environment</title>,Private Members' Business,10,1,speech
"Nairn, Gary, MP",LP,1999-06-21,"—I have great pleasure in supporting the motion of the member for Hinkler. Fishing is certainly a significant industry within my electorate of Eden-Monaro, which, from the coastal point of view, covers from north of Batemans Bay right down to the Victorian border. Within that area we have major fishing fleets operating out of Batemans Bay, Bermagui and Eden. They operate in the south-east trawl, the tuna fishery and various other things. There is also a very large recreational fishery along the coastal part of the electorate, with Narooma, Moruya and Merimbula probably being more specifically involved in the recreational area rather than the commercial area—but certainly they have significant fleets. Fishing is a major source of income to that region along the coast and for those towns of Batemans Bay, Bermagui and Eden.
The motion gives us an opportunity to recognise the importance of this industry and also to focus on some aspects of it. The issue of sustainability is a very important one. The member for Lyons participated with me in the 
 previous parliament on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industry, Resources and Rural and Regional Affairs, which produced an excellent report, Managing Commonwealth fisheries: the last frontier, which canvassed a lot of the issues that are in this motion and put forward a number of recommendations, many of which have been taken up. I am not sure at this stage whether some have been taken up, or how far the fisheries management has taken them, but certainly they have put in place a number of recommendations we made to improve sustainability.
But it comes down very much to two aspects: the research aspect and the way in which the industry works with the research organisations. Research is probably one of the most significant aspects that needs to be considered and that aspect is included in this motion by the member for Hinkler. In that committee, we made a comment in regard to research:
It was obvious there remains some antipathy between researchers and industry. This is based on a history of generally poor relations between these groups. It is essential these problems be broken down and the communication between researchers, industry and managers improved to enhance the quality of research. The committee does not believe the industry is being utilised sufficiently by the scientific community. One of the single greatest resources of knowledge about the fisheries environment is the industry itself and it is often being overlooked during research. However, industry still feels greater use could be made of their knowledge. Importantly, industry now recognises the importance of fisheries research, which is demonstrated by their willingness to contribute financially to research programs.
That is a very telling comment from the committee about the research aspect and getting some of these things right. These all ultimately lead to circumstances where you might have closed areas at certain times or in certain fisheries.
I also support some of the comments of the member for Hinkler, in that there are many ways to skin a cat. The vessel monitoring systems that are going in are certainly assisting in that area—one of the recommendations that committee made in its report was that that system be implemented to assist in the 
 overall management. Communication between the research people, the management people and the industry is the overriding thing. It would be wonderful if we could just go out and count fish like we can go out and count a lot of other resource areas, but unfortunately we cannot. If we could do that, in some sort of giant underground laboratory, we would be able to get a better result, I suppose, but that is impossible. Therefore, all aspects of the industry need to work together to have a proper understanding of the particular fisheries. Some of the recommendations that were made in that committee have helped that. Certainly it is an aspect that we continue to support, to ensure that this vital industry for Australia—not only domestically but export-wise—is enhanced and that we do not overfish our areas but at the same time do it in a justifiable way.

"Sercombe, Bob,MP",ALP,1999-06-21,"—As the motion moved by the member for Hinkler suggests, the management of Australia's marine environment and marine resources requires careful balancing between competing needs and also between the variety of uses to which those resources and that environment can be put. The motion is important because it underlines the importance of the fishing industry as a fundamental part of the equation with needs that have to be addressed. The honourable member for Hinkler is far too loyal a member of the coalition to have directly in his remarks given a biff to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Robert Hill, but it is pretty clear that there are a number of concerns underlying the motion and underlying concerns in the fishing industry about the way the minister has conducted himself in a number of matters. There was an article in the Australian  newspaper on 27 January of this year which was headlined, `Minister cast as raw prawn in trawling row'. That article says:
ENVIRONMENT Minister Robert Hill had misrepresented a recent report into prawn trawling on the Great Barrier Reef in a bid to grab management of the industry, the Queensland Commercial Fisherman's Organisation said yesterday.
The group has called for an independent body to hold an investigation into the way the report's release was handled. 

It goes on to say that Senator Hill released a report written by the CSIRO to back up claims he had been making, but the organisation's spokesman Ted Loveday said that Senator Hill was engaging in a power grab. In more recent times we have seen the minister foreshadowing export controls on the fishing industry using the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act. The minister has claimed that he has consulted with state colleagues and the industry on the matter, but certainly the fishing industry seems to have no record of the sorts of consultations that they would deem to be appropriate. So I think it is fairly clear that underlying the matters that the member for Hinkler is bringing before the House today is a very strong concern, which the fishing industry is vigorously agreeing with, about the way in which the environment minister has conducted himself in recent times with respect to the industry.
We all agree on the need to preserve the sustainability of Australia's fishing stocks. Certainly other speakers have put forward some alarming statistics of the drop-off in catch rates and the like. Those are subject to a number of different interpretations, but we are dealing here with an industry which, as the member for Hinkler indicated, is of very considerable economic importance to Australia. The figures which I have—which I suspect are now somewhat out of date and underestimates—are that the gross value of Australian fisheries production in 1997-98 was $1.859 million, with exports valued at $1.181 million. As I said, I believe that figure is now higher. Even if those figures are still correct, it is an industry of some considerable importance to this country.
The motion does talk about the work the industry has done on bycatch reduction devices, turtle exclusion devices and protection of nursery grounds. I think there is plenty of evidence that the industry in fact has taken appropriate steps in recent times on those matters. In an article in one of the fishing magazines back in 1998, Mr Loveday—who I referred to before—had this to say about a state trawl committee conference that he had attended: 
Two weeks ago I was at a meeting of some 70 trawl fishermen from throughout Moreton Bay, and if we had said two years ago that the compulsory introduction of TEDs—
turtle exclusion devices—
in Moreton Bay in 1998 was a possibility, I think there would have been a violent outbreak.
The only response we received two weeks ago was, `Why wait until the middle of 1998, why don't we do it from the beginning of `98?
I think that indicates the developing consciousness within the industry on the importance of these matters. The same cannot be said, I do not think, in terms of efforts by the Commonwealth government. I believe the draft Commonwealth policy on fisheries bycatch, which was due to be finalised at the end of 1998, is still incomplete. So it is really pretty important for the Commonwealth to catch up in this respect and to provide the leadership, in conjunction and cooperation with the industry, that is so much needed. A whole range of balances are necessary, and the government in partnership with the industry needs to pursue them. The government needs to be looking at habitat protection; it needs to be looking at coastal development.

"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,1999-06-21,"—This motion needs support from the House. It starts off with the need to preserve sustainable Australian fishing stocks. Of course, that is something that everybody in this House would give support to. It has already been mentioned by the member for Eden-Monaro that in the last parliament some of us brought down a report which had a lot to do with bringing forward sustainability of our fish stocks, and there were recommendations in there about it. The government has failed, I believe, to act on very many of those, and we certainly have not had a report back in recognition of that report and the good work that is in it. That again highlights the failure to look at our fishing industry and our fishing stocks in a national way. One of the recommendations I pushed for was to get a state seafood council and have it funded in some way, possibly by levies, so that we had a national body that could focus on national issues and on the fishing industry on a national level.
The member for Reid spoke of some of the experiences that he had just read about in relation to the cod industry in other parts of the world. It came through from the work we did on the committee that the world's fishing industry is basically 50 per cent overcapitalised—bigger boats, more technology, you can see the fish, and we have been taking too many. There is a need right around the world for us to look at this industry and to look at the fisheries in a much more sympathetic way.
The second point in the member for Hinkler's motion asks that the House recognise the economic potential of quality seafood exports. You only have to look at the Tasmanian salmon industry to see the quality of those seafood exports and the economic pluses for Tasmania. Some of us from Tasmania have put up a fight to make sure that this government gives some recognition to the pluses that it brings to regional Australia and to the state of Tasmania.
Among other recommendations, the honourable member for Hinkler dealt with the reduction of turtle exclusion devices from protective nursery grounds; the need to protect the giant albatross in the Southern Ocean—the Joint Committee on Treaties has touched on that in its report on a treaty with Japan—and long-liners which did not seem to have much interest at all in sustainability in its by-catch and what it caught. Turtles also get caught up in that. With the technology that we have today we should be able to go about our fishing using devices which exclude those species in the sea that we are not trying to catch.
There was a recommendation that we recognise the value of the vessel monitoring system—a cost-effective method of vehicle location and for cruise safety in today's technology. I understand it is happening on some scallop boats now, but it is still not as widespread as it should be. The closure of strategic areas by location rather than by time should be investigated—the possibility not just of marine parks but of areas which we know to be nurseries which have been fished for some time around our coast and within the sea that we can exclude from time to time. 
 They may need a few dormant years with no fishing taking place within them. That sort of research needs to be explored to see if those temporary no-go areas can be a plus for us.
We should give consideration to the balance in the protection of the maritime environment and the legitimate expectations of fishermen, their families and communities. There has been a lot of knowledge built up in the fishing industry and among fishing families around the Australian coast. We should utilise that knowledge, as this report recommends. I am very disappointed that the government has not given a response to this report. Hopefully, in the future, it may give a national response to the fishing industry. (Time expired)

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,1999-06-21,"—My grievance today is not so much that the Prime Minister is stuck in the past; my grievance is that he wants the whole nation to stay back and keep him company. This is the man who, having been rejected by his own generation, has taken refuge in a previous generation. For John Howard, the prime ministership is not about the nation's future but about his own past. In getting the prime ministership, 
 his only aim was to pay back all those who had tried to stop him along the way. This is a man whose well-developed reflex is to punish like they did in the good old days. All the so-called reforms in the areas of tax, industrial relations and social security are only punitive efforts at revenge—half-hearted attempts to turn Australia into The Land That Time Forgot .
John Howard has steadfastly resisted any opportunities to allow the country to move forward. The glaring example of this is the way he has sabotaged the process of reconciliation with indigenous Australians. As Prime Minister, the one vital role he could play was to apologise on behalf of the Australian people for all the hurt and destruction caused by past government policies, including to the stolen generation. Only the Prime Minister can make this symbolically important gesture. Not this Prime Minister, though—no Redfern Park speech from him because he is just not up to it.
The politics of social inclusion and progression are anathema to him. We see it in his opposition to the republic—a historic inevitability. The fear of change is quite remarkable. It was also embodied in the Prime Minister's proposed preamble. It got a laugh, but it was one of embarrassment—the straight refusal to acknowledge indigenous custodianship of our land, the talk of mateship, the talk of being free to be proud of our country. The Prime Minister did acknowledge that there were people here prior to 1788. Big deal! He does not go further than that because he is not capable of making that step forward.
He wants us to take a giant leap backwards by entrenching his own distorted view of the past in the Constitution—once more, a list of his petty grievances, a failure to lead. It is worthy of a South Park script with John Howard as Mr Garrison always getting his facts wrong and Tim Fischer as Mr Hat chiming in with, `You can say that again, Mr Garrison.' John Howard is the living embodiment of zero tolerance, zero tolerance for social and cultural progress. He is anti-reconciliation, anti-republic, anti-multiculturalism, anti-union, anti-worker, anti-public 
 education, anti-public health—the list goes on and on.
John Howard is a mean spirited man leading a mean spirited government. He has raised mean spiritedness to an art form. Even the surviving matriarch of the Menzies era has little time for John Howard's anachronistic vision for Australia. Anachronisms belong in museums and historical texts, certainly not in parliament or in leadership positions. Dame Rachel Cleland, aged 93, is the widow of Sir Donald Cleland who, with Sir Robert Menzies, was one of the co-founders of the Liberal Party. She is the woman Richard Court's deputy leader has described as `a conscience of the party and, when she speaks out, she can do so with an authority that virtually no-one else in Australia has'. When interviewed for a recent Australian Story, Dame Rachel Cleland said of John Howard:
. . . I think he is governing an Australia that no longer exists. He's governing in his mind an Australia that existed 30 years ago.
He lives by the maxim: out with the new and in with the old. Just look at the major changes he has made to the prime ministerial suite since taking office. He got rid of the tastefully understated modern lounge suite that was expected to last for 200 years and replaced it with a good old fashioned $10,000 green leather chesterfield lounge. To paraphrase Ross Peake, he has turned his office into something resembling an old-style gentleman's club but with less style.
It is just the sort of furniture that Menzies would have approved of, so why not go the whole hog and match it with Menzies' desk as well? It has actually happened. He has taken it out of its museum setting in Old Parliament House and put it into the museum setting of this backward Prime Minister's office. It has not stopped there. Kirribilli House now has an $82,000 dining suite circa 1835, complete with black horse hair fabric covers.
We must not forget the Prime Minister's plan to bring the Speaker's chair up from Old Parliament House. The feasibility study alone cost $12,000 to tell the Prime Minister that it was a really stupid idea. Eighteen million Australians could have told him that for free 
 had he been in touch with the feelings of the Australian people in 1999 rather than 1950. No wonder the Secretary to the Joint House Department, Mike Bolton, has said that the original furniture in the Prime Minister's office would return the day John Howard left office. `A midnight arrangement—I hope it will happen,' he has said on the record. This is indeed a tragicomic government.
Under John Howard's leadership, the government hangs delicately in the twilight zone between black comedy and farce. The afternoon tea with Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven, the refusal to live in the Lodge—all scenes worthy of a Monty Python sketch. We have here a man who prides himself on being the drip tray for all the passive-aggressive tendencies that can accumulate in a society at any one point in time.
While Labor is the voice of the dispossessed, John Howard is the voice of the impotent. In generations to come, cultural historians will recall with an ironic smile that the Howard era was the period in Australian history which will be known as `The Great Stagnation'. In keeping with this inability to move forward, the name John Howard has become synonymous with the political backflip, with reneging on promises. Think of the promises made during the 1996 federal election campaign, promises that were set in concrete. The concrete obviously had too much sand or too much water in the mix, because it did not hold for too long. Once the coalition came to office, those promises became non-core promises, ones that could be broken.
Speaking of concrete makes me think of the ministerial code of conduct, another fine example of the John Howard political backflip. Hailed with such fanfare when the coalition took office, the code of conduct promised a new era in disclosure and accountability and an unprecedented standard of ministerial conduct. Unprecedented is right—seven ministers resigned in 18 months. What is the Prime Minister's response to this disgraceful showing? Did he make the code tighter? Did he insist that the remaining members of his ministry should meet the standards in the code of conduct? No. John 
 Howard's ministry seemed to have difficulty clearing the bar, so he lowered it. The code of conduct turned into a set of guidelines.
The latest outrage surrounding the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources has shown that even these guidelines are not worth the paper they are written on. The member for Leichhardt is clearly in breach of the guidelines, but the Prime Minister, stuck as he is in reverse gear, is incapable of keeping his commitment to the Australian people when it comes to keeping his own ministry in line. In fact, given the number of times the Prime Minister practises the political backflip, you would think he was in training for the Sydney Olympics. I can just see it as an exhibition event in the year 2000. So John Howard should take heart: he will never play cricket for Australia, but he would break world records representing Australia in the backflip.
In fact, John Howard deserves recognition for his unswerving commitment. We should immortalise this achievement with a new entry in the dictionary. After all, `Thatcher' has made it into the vernacular and inspired her own `ism'. What an honour for John Howard to follow in the footsteps of his muse. So it would go something like this:
Howard: noun, a political backflip; the act of breaking a commitment.
Howard: verb, to break a commitment; to renege on a promise; to regress.
Howardly: to behave in a Howard-like manner.
Howardice: lack of commitment; inability to keep a promise.
The only occasion the Prime Minister has flaunted tradition is his decision to open the Olympics, which would normally be the reserve of our head of state, the Queen. For a man who joined the criticism when Paul Keating dared to place his hand on the Queen's back, it has been a rush worthy of Mark Yeats on Dermott Brereton in the opening seconds of the 1989 grand final in the way the current Prime Minister has pushed the Queen off that podium. The monarchists should perhaps consider suspending their leader but, then again, it is hard to 
 suspend someone who is suspended in a time warp of the 1950s.
In last Saturday's Sydney Morning Herald, Kookaburra gave us another fine example of Howardice by the Prime Minister. When Australia made it into the World Cup final, Kookaburra reported Howard as saying:
""I don't think everybody will be at work first thing on Monday morning and I think everyone will understand that,"" said the sportive Prime Miniature . . . 
And later:
A follow-up question, ""Are you asking employers to be lenient?"" made Howard get all tetchy. ""No, look, I don't get into that trivia,"" he said.
This is a man who aspires to be yesterday's hero, but what else could we expect from a man who has never escaped from what Barry Humphries refers to as the `Age of Laminex'?",REPS,<title>GRIEVANCE DEBATE</title>,<title>Prime Minister of Australia</title>,Grievance Debate,11,1,speech
"Tanner, Lindsay, MP",ALP,1999-06-21,"—The Commonwealth Grants Commission Amendment Bill 1999  is fairly straightforward. Essentially it extends the powers of the Commonwealth Grants Commission to look into payments made by the Commonwealth with respect to Aboriginal affairs and the various categories of payments that come within that area. I wish to make some observations with respect to the Grants Commission and the current approach of the government to those issues, payments to the states and the like.
The substantive issues relating to this particular legislation really fall within the scope of my colleague the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs. So I will leave to him the advocacy of those particular matters and deal essentially with the Commonwealth-state financial relations issues that flow from this particular piece of legislation, the role of the Grants Commission and the government and the changes the government is making with respect to Commonwealth-state financial relations and, indeed, which it perhaps ought be making but is not.
The first observation I wish to make is that in the A New Tax System or ANTS package the government essentially is neutering the previous role of the Grants Commission in being the arbiter of the carve-up of Commonwealth payments or general purpose payments to the states as between the various states, and particularly the balance that applies with respect to the entitlements of the individual states which flow from a highly complex formula.
It was pointed out at the time by the opposition that, in the  A New Tax System (Commonwealth-State Financial Arrangements) Bill 1999 , the provision was made for the GST revenues that are to be allocated to the states to all be allocated on the basis of the decision of the Treasurer as between the individual states. This is a quite dramatic change from the traditional approach which has applied where the Grants Commission has been involved in determining the relativities that should apply as between the states.
The Grants Commission is not even mentioned in that piece of legislation. It does effectively enable the Treasurer, after consultation with the individual states, to determine what the distribution of the GST money should be between the various states. It is significant that, as a result of the deal between the Democrats and the government, some of the features of the original package which were trumpeted as being particularly important, in particular the abolition of nine state taxes, have been substantially modified. We now see that six of the nine state taxes have effectively been put off into the never-never as a result of that arrangement.
It is also worth pointing out that, under the original tax package, the proportion of state revenue which was to be derived from the states' own revenue sources was to drop from 57 per cent to 42 per cent. In other words, under the existing tax system, roughly 57 per cent of all state revenue derives from state taxes and charges or non-Commonwealth sources of revenue. Under the new tax system, as originally submitted by the government, that proportion was to drop to 42 per cent. It is not clear to me what the new proportion will be as a result of the changes that have been made to the package. The government may have calculated this figure but, given the confusion that has surrounded the proposed changes to the existing state taxes and charges and the non-abolition of particular taxes that were previously going to be abolished, I suspect that it probably is not yet clear.
Nonetheless, it is clear that, irrespective of the modifications arising from the deal with the Democrats, the new tax package will mean that a substantially smaller proportion of state revenues will come from sources over which state governments actually exercise control. In other words, we are seeing an exacerbation of the problems of vertical fiscal imbalance. Vertical fiscal imbalance is the imbalance between the raising of the revenue, the responsibility for making decisions with respect to taxation, on the one hand; and the responsibility for spending that revenue on the other.
It has been a source of longstanding comment and criticism of our federal system in Australia that there is substantial imbalance between those two responsibilities, and that tends to generate a number of problems. I am not one who gets carried away with this issue. I do think it does have some significance but, nonetheless, it has been an issue on which the Treasurer, for example, has held forth at some length in the past, so it is rather ironic to see him presiding over a new tax arrangement which will seriously exacerbate something which he has in the past said is a significant problem.
I also want to draw to the House's attention a question which was raised by the Auditor- 
 General in a recent report on payments to the states which is relevant to this legislation, and the scrutiny and management of those payments. The Auditor-General recently undertook an examination of specific purpose payments to the states, which are payments that are made attached to a particular program or with certain strings attached to them.
The Auditor-General found that, for example, in the 1996-97 Commonwealth budget year, the costs to the Commonwealth, particularly borrowing costs, could have been reduced by the sum of $32 million had the payments to the states been made in smaller and more frequent advanced payments. The Auditor-General also found that, with respect to the roughly $69 million of administration costs associated with the making of specific purpose payments to the states:
. . . significant SPP administrative cost savings may be achieved by developing appropriate SPP performance indicators that better measure SPP efficiency.
It is also interesting to note that the Auditor-General made the following observation as well:
The most disappointing aspect from the 1997-98 survey was the limited inclusion of performance indicators, targets and milestones in SPP Agreements and/or any associated documented administrative arrangements.
We are essentially dealing with a situation where the Auditor-General has identified substantial structural or systemic weaknesses in the arrangements between the Commonwealth and the states with respect to the transfer of money through specific purpose payments. This is something which the federal government has really failed to address and take any notice of, and it has failed to extract the available savings that could be sought as a result of improving the administration and efficiency of the system of specific purpose payments.
In the context of this legislation, it is rather ironic that the government is seeking to increase the powers of the Grants Commission in order to facilitate the examination of how money goes to the states with respect to Aboriginal programs and the relative balances between the states, but is failing to deal with what are much more fundamental problems in 
 the structure of the payments to the states that have been identified by the Auditor-General.
I should note in this context that a couple of weeks ago I wrote to the Auditor-General urging him to give serious consideration to the Roads of National Importance Program in his endeavours, which is a program introduced by the current government that I believe has insufficiently rigorous criteria for decisions with respect to which roads will be funded by the Commonwealth. I am pleased to say that the Auditor-General has just written back to me indicating that he already had this matter in hand and that he will be conducting an examination of the Commonwealth roads program, including the roads of national importance category, in the very near future, a matter which I am sure the shadow minister for transport and regional services will also take some considerable interest in.
I look forward to seeing the results of that examination when we see some of the roads that have received Commonwealth funding under the Roads of National Importance Program and some of the other roads which have not, and ask ourselves what we think of the relative national importance of those various roads. It will be interesting to see what the Auditor-General says about the criteria under which those decisions are actually made.
Finally, may I reiterate my concern in this context about the 1999 federal budget papers and the change to accrual accounting which saw the removal of the forward estimates with respect to functions and subfunctions in the federal budget. As a result, that has made the transparency of the budget considerably less than it has been in the past, in spite of the fact that it was possible for the Department of Transport and Regional Development to produce accrual accounting based forward estimates in its 1998 portfolio budget statement and it was possible for the Department of Health and Aged Care to submit forward estimates based on 1999 budget figures in recent estimates hearings.
So there is no question that these things can be done but, sadly, the government has determined to remove this data from the federal budget. If there have been transitional 
 problems involved in this process, I call on the government to acknowledge that publicly and indicate that it will return the forward estimates to the next federal budget. That is all I have to say on the Grants Commission legislation. As I indicated before, the opposition will not be opposing the bill in the House or the Senate, and I will leave it to my colleague the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs to deal with the substantive matters in the legislation which obviously relate primarily to his portfolio.",REPS,<title>COMMONWEALTH GRANTS COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Macfarlane, Ian, MP",LP,1999-06-21,"—Thank you to the member for Melbourne for his support for the Commonwealth Grants Commission Amendment Bill 1999 , although I must admit that I am at a loss to understand his point with regard to the near farcical method of appropriation of funds through Premiers Conferences. Whilst I do not say that in any way to belittle the important role of the Grants Commission, I think anything that moves away from the theatre of the premiers coming down here, thumping the table and pretending they are hard done by will certainly be a move for the better. What we will see under the A New Tax System that we hope will pass through the Senate in the next two weeks is a far more logical and secure process for the states in terms of their receiving their funding from the Commonwealth taxes.
To move to the more pertinent issue of the  Commonwealth Grants Commission Amendment Bill 1999 , let me say that, in the lead-up to the 1998 election, the coalition government made a commitment to indigenous and white Australians that we would work with the indigenous community to develop a fairer and more appropriate process to improve funding allocation for indigenous groups and peoples. This commitment aimed to ensure that a needs based distribution of funds was allocated to improve the position of indigenous Australians through an independent assessment of their overall need for services and programs.
In my electorate of Groom in south-east Queensland, there are approximately 3,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders living in Toowoomba, the electorate's main centre, 
 and a further 3,000 living in the surrounding area. These Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are currently assisted by a number of indigenous organisations, including the Downs Aboriginal and Islander Company, the Downs Aboriginal and Islander Women's Support Group Inc., the Goombungee Aboriginal Housing Company Ltd, the Goolburri Aboriginal Corporation Land Council, the QEB Sports and the South-East Queensland Aboriginal Corporation for Legal Services. These all allocate and administer federal government funds.
Despite the efforts of groups such as these and the efforts of the state and federal governments, as is evident throughout Australia, many indigenous people are still struggling to maintain a satisfactory standard of living, to find and keep employment and to remain crime, drug and alcohol free. Despite the years of effort and billions of dollars in funding for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander programs, the statistics are still appalling. For example, mortality rates amongst indigenous adults aged between 25 and 54 are six to eight times higher than for other Australians and are persisting at this level. Indigenous peoples have unemployment rates at more than twice that of the general population and, if it were not for the government's Community Development Employment Program for indigenous people, the rate would be four times higher. Indigenous school retention rates are half those of other students, and so the list goes on.
This bill aims to address seriously these grave issues by enabling better targeting of government funding. The bill gives the Commonwealth Grants Commission the power and responsibility to both conduct an inquiry and develop continuous measures for indigenous and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission funding so that resources can be targeted more effectively into areas of greatest need.
It should be noted that in 1995 the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner recommended that the Commonwealth government initiate a comprehensive study by the Commonwealth Grants 
 Commission on the potential application of the fiscal equalisation principle amongst indigenous communities in Australia. This recommendation came following presentations and submissions by Aboriginal people to the Commonwealth Grants Commission in December 1992 and throughout 1993 appealing for both an inquiry and an application of fiscal equalisation to Aboriginal communities, Aboriginal local governing bodies and other Aboriginal service organisations.
The Commonwealth Grants Commission is an independent statutory authority which is renowned worldwide for its independence and absolute freedom in its recommendations to federal government and, therefore, it is well placed to perform this task. The nature of the inquiry will necessitate the Commonwealth Grants Commission working closely with the departments and agencies charged with the distribution of funding for indigenous-specific programs. In addition, the inquiry will allow Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to themselves make written or oral submissions to the Grants Commission about the nature and magnitude of their concerns.
I believe the absolute independence of the Grants Commission is essential in dealing with the complex and sensitive issue of indigenous funding and relations with regard to this inquiry. This will ensure that any findings are deemed credible by both the indigenous and the general community. The inquiry aims to be concluded by December 2000 so that arrangements can be made according to inquiry findings for fair and equitable Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and other indigenous-specific funding in the 2001-02 federal budget.
However, I must stress that indigenous peoples are by no means forgotten in the current federal government budget laid down for 1999-2000. A record amount of money—some $2.23 billion, an increase from $1.98 billion in 1998-99—was committed to indigenous-specific program expenses in that budget. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs portfolio accounts for only 56 per cent of total indigenous-specific program spending. These specific program expenses will be distributed not only from the Aborigi 
 nal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs portfolio—which, as I just said, accounts for only 56 per cent of the total indigenous program spending—but also from a range of mainstream portfolios particularly targeting health, housing, education and employment.
This funding aims to fulfil the government's 1998 election commitment to indigenous Australians to assist them to move `beyond welfare'. This aim of government has been strongly supported by Aboriginal leaders, including Noel Pearson. I have met with Noel Pearson on a number of occasions and talked with him at length regarding the issues relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. I share the desire he has to see these people freed from the vicious circle of welfare dependence. I refer to an article from the Courier-Mail of Friday, 30 April of this year which quotes Mr Pearson. Mr Pearson makes a number of very pertinent points with regard to the current parlous state of some Aboriginal communities and the way he sees welfare as a poison rather than an assistance. He says in the article that he has appealed to us as the government to help break the welfare dependency of indigenous people so they can live a more healthy and dignified life—I just say `hear, hear' to that. He goes on to say:
""We have to get rid of the welfare system from Aboriginal community governance in Cape York Peninsula, and get rid of the welfare mentality that has taken over our people . . . 
The article states:
Mr Pearson advocates a changed system in which money coming into communities—
and there are 13 on the cape which he specifically refers to that cover some 12,000 indigenous people—
is controlled by ""a new interface"" between the federal and state governments and ATSIC.
He said the new administration needed to be ""holistic and de-welfared"" . . . 
Again, I can only give my full support to that. Furthermore, he said:
""Welfare is a resource that is laced with poison and the poison present is the money-for-nothing principle.""
The article concludes with Noel Pearson saying: 
""Aboriginal people should participate in the real economy—where you don't get money for nothing, you have to work. Aboriginal people lived at the lowest, most miserable end of the market economy for most of colonial history and the time has come to change all that. Welfare is a parasitic exploiter.
""The Government is paying these people to sit around the canteen to drink and destroy the prospects of their children—destroy society. The madness of that system has to stop.""
This bill will assist us to help break that welfare dependency and ensure that the assistance programs that the government puts in place are well targeted and able to ensure that the Aboriginal community becomes part of our community and grows and prospers as we grow and prosper.
With the Howard-led coalition government, I am working in my local area to ensure that initiatives which bring the financial freedom to our indigenous population are put in place. Some of the government's initiatives include a new program to address Aboriginal employment through the creation of the Indigenous Employment Program, involving total expenditure of $52 million in 1999-2000. A further $6.8 million will be spent for improving access to primary health care facilities as well as additional expenditure on current initiatives, including $6 million for better access to medicines and $3.6 million for additional assistance for residential aged care. Furthermore, there will be a growth in education expenditure of $16.3 million, which will include programs to improve literacy, numeracy and school retention rates.
One thing to note in this funding discussion is the fact that the proportion of the population identified as Aboriginal has continued to increase well in excess of natural increase. In fact, in 1996 the census showed that there were 352,970 people identified as indigenous—up from 80,000 in 1966 and 33 per cent more than in the 1991 census. This can be partly explained by the fact that a child only needs to have one parent who is identified as indigenous to claim an indigenous origin. This steep increase both places pressure on government programs and accentuates the need to make more progress in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander programs.
Ultimately, this bill and the subsequent review aim to ensure that the funding of programs and the service for Aboriginal people, through ATSIC and other indigenous agencies and specific portfolio areas, is adequate, equitable and largely effective in reducing the social problems faced by Aboriginal people. It is not my intention to regurgitate the allegations of abuse and misuse of funding for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders in the past. However, it is essential that indigenous people throughout Australia receive as much or as little as they need to confront the problems they are facing. In doing so, we need to ensure that the government, indigenous organisations—be they ATSIC, Aboriginal legal services or Aboriginal housing companies—indigenous groups and individuals are provided with avenues and mechanisms to fully justify their financial grants through a structured process of accountability.
It is not enough to offer Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders only financial support. As a government we must ensure that relevant funds reach those in need and do so in a transparent and accountable process. In my short time as the member for Groom, I have met with numerous indigenous organisations and individuals in my electorate and have developed a good working relationship with them. I have had a number of these groups and individuals approach me over the past eight months concerned and angered over allegations of misuse and misappropriation of government funds, of nepotism and of other inappropriate behaviour. If only to halt the mistrust and conflict within Aboriginal groups, let alone to assure the government and the wider community that precious taxpayers' money is being used where it is most needed, there must be a new and independent system of allocating, distributing and accounting for indigenous funds. This bill provides that system. It will also address other issues raised with me by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander representatives in Groom.
The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander region is based at Roma in Queensland and includes not only my electorate of Groom but 
 also adjoining electorates and the Aboriginal settlement of Cherbourg. Groom has a significant population of indigenous people, and in fact the city of Toowoomba has more indigenous people residing in it than many other indigenous townships such as the one I just mentioned, Cherbourg, yet it does not receive a fair distribution of funding, in my opinion, in regard to this factor. Under this bill, it is envisaged that the commission will be able to inquire and compare the relative needs of indigenous Australians in key areas by geographical region. This will ensure that where there is an alleged or apparent anomaly the commission will be able to establish the facts of the situation. This will be of great assistance in removing the politics and controversy which seem to always surround the allocation of funds in not only my electorate of Groom but also, I understand, right around Australia.
 In a related issue being considered and addressed, it is my experience that some Aboriginal individuals, groups and organisations charged with administering indigenous funds do not have the directorship experience or expertise and/or are not knowledgeable in the processes of proper financial and company management. As a result, the processes of these boards sometimes leave something to be desired in terms of good corporate governance. I say this not to accuse or lay blame on persons or organisations but rather to highlight a further area to be addressed and one which relates to the billions of dollars spent by government on behalf of taxpayers to specifically address indigenous needs. Within the community, questions and allegations of wastage and misappropriation of taxpayers' money are continually raised in regard to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander funding. In fact, any alleged corruption within these ranks may be no more to do with corruption than to do with innocent mistakes and a lack of proper knowledge of proper processes. I think we need to help where we can in this area.
It is unfair to the general tax paying public and to those charged with impossible responsibilities to continue to allow financial decisions to be made by those who, by their own admission, are not adequately skilled or 
 trained in corporate governance or trained in the allocation, management or distribution of government financial assistance. I have taken the first step of working with an Aboriginal housing company in my electorate to see if we cannot address this problem. They have made it clear to me that they are keen to ensure they operate in the best and most accountable method possible, and I am currently working with them to ensure that they are able to upgrade their skills in corporate governance and acting as directors of the housing company.
I state this example to illustrate to this House that the board may be only one of many in my electorate, in Queensland and perhaps throughout Australia who inadvertently are not operating to the best of their potential. As such, these boards could improve the quality of service to the people they have been elected to serve through some extra training and some extra gaining of skills.
The  Commonwealth Grants Commission Amendment Bill 1999 , by allowing the commission to inquire and set down measures for indigenous funding, for the first time in Australia's history will only heighten the importance of improving the skills and accountability with regard to indigenous funding. The commission's reputation as a fully independent body can only assist this inquiry, and the measures that arise from it will ensure that funding is received by those indigenous organisations, groups and individuals who are most in need. I certainly will be informing the Aboriginal groups in my region about this bill and its subsequent inquiry and urging them to submit their facts, views and ideas to the Commonwealth Grants Commission so that the results do indeed benefit those in need on the Darling Downs. My constituents in Groom will welcome this bill, and I very much look forward to the positive results it will bring to the indigenous people in Groom and throughout Australia.

"Melham, Daryl, MP",ALP,1999-06-21,"—The explanatory memorandum for the Commonwealth Grants Commission Amendment Bill 1999  states:
The amendments to the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act allow the Government to ask the Commonwealth Grants Commission to develop measures of relative disadvantage that could be used to target resources for the indigenous community more effectively to the areas of greatest need.
I say at the outset that I and the opposition welcome this amendment bill and give it our total support. The particular section that is to be inserted into the act is section 18, headed `Inquiries relating to indigenous persons'. That section reads as follows:
The Commission must inquire into and report to the Minister upon any matters that the Minister refers to the Commission relating to:
(a)	 works and services in respect of indigenous persons that are provided or funded (directly or indirectly) by the Commonwealth or an authority of the Commonwealth or;
(b)	 a grant of financial assistance under section 96 of the Constitution to a State for the purpose of being applied by the State, or an authority of the State, to pay for works and services in respect of indigenous persons in the State or;
(c)	 a grant of financial assistance made by the Commonwealth to a Territory, or an authority of the Territory, for the purpose of being applied by the Territory or the authority to pay for works and services in respect of indigenous persons in the Territory.
This amendment is overdue. There is a bit of a history to it, and I am indebted to the Parliamentary Library for again producing an excellent digest on the current bill. I will, with the appropriate acknowledgment, draw on that digest to give a bit of the history. I think it sets it out much better than I can.
A workshop was organised by the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation on 18 and 19 November 1998. Mr Bob Searle, the Secretary to the Grants Commission, explained that Aboriginality is one of the disability factors behind the commission's recommendations on how Commonwealth general revenue grants should be distributed. His paper, `The Threshold of Benchmarking', states:
Aboriginality is a specific disability factor in 18 of the 40 state functions the commission analyses as it attempts to equalise the capacity of each state and territory to deliver the average standard service.
The workshop also identified problems with the state of available data regarding indigen 
 ous disadvantage. The executive summary said:
Since reliable data is an essential tool of effective benchmarking, this is clearly an obstacle that must be overcome as quickly as possible.
The workshop reflected that there had been misinterpretation of the role of ATSIC, and the executive summary said:
Within current resources ATSIC is hard-pressed trying to meet its core obligations as a source of policy advice and as a monitor of program delivery to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It is certainly not in a position either through its legislative charter or in terms of its capacity to fill the gaps left by mainstream providers at either the state or Commonwealth level.
The guide goes on to say:
These statements indicate that arguably there are advantages to the commission having statutory authority to investigate the equities in the funding of works and services for indigenous people.
The guide also points out that another issue to be noted regarding the bill is the role of the commission in monitoring issues of indigenous disadvantage and that that has been on the agenda for some time. In `Going Forward: Social Justice for the First Australian', a submission presented to the then Prime Minister, the Hon. Paul Keating on 17 March 1995, there was a recommendation that the commission should be given the power to establish measures to assess the performance of state and territory governments in addressing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander needs. Indeed, the footnote says:
This submission was identified as the first major task of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation in its second term, and its recommendations were based on extensive consultations with indigenous communities organised jointly by the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation and ATSIC.
I am the Labor party's representative on the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation and I can recall also receiving material from the current Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Senator Herron, in the last term of the parliament where he did highlight the question of benchmarking. I do commend him because I believe it was on his initiative that this benchmarking came through. I remember that at the national ALP policy debate in Hobart last year we also 
 supported the idea of benchmarking and testing the states as to where the money was going.
I just give this history to show that this government has delivered on what were recommendations in the previous Labor government. This is above party politics. It has cross-party support because it is the right thing to do. Too often we have a situation where ATSIC is regarded as the sole provider, and it is often criticised when the truth of the matter is it is only part of the equation. ATSIC needs to be there in partnership with state and territory governments and the Commonwealth government, but there is a lot of money going from the Commonwealth to the states and the territories. We hear about accountability for ATSIC. This is a method of providing accountability for the money that we give to state and territory governments.
Quite frankly, in the past state Labor governments have been remiss in not spending the money that has been given to them by the Commonwealth appropriately. I put it on the record that it is my view that we should be targeting the money more directly to this area. I do not believe in giving money to the states unfettered. There needs to be the partnership arrangement, and we need to benchmark. I applaud this amendment to the Grants Commission because it will, hopefully, provide the Commonwealth government with professional and timely information as to where the money is going and the ability to decide needs.
The bill will extend the powers of the Commonwealth Grants Commission to enable the commission, on reference from the Minister for Finance and Administration, to inquire into and report on works and services carried out with direct or indirect Commonwealth funding through a Commonwealth grant to the states and territories. I repeat that the opposition welcomes the initiative which we believe will be useful for gathering information to better target Commonwealth funds while also assisting the analysis of the effectiveness of state and territory programs funded by Commonwealth money. It is my view that people do not mind money going to indigenous causes; they just want to make sure that it is properly spent, that it is not being wasted 
 and that it is being done appropriately. I think that is a noble cause, and this goes part of the way to allaying those concerns.
The idea regarding the role of the commission in monitoring issues of indigenous disadvantage is not new. As I have already said, a submission by the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation was presented to the former Prime Minister, Paul Keating, on 17 March 1995 recommending that the commission should be able to assess the performance of state and territory governments in addressing indigenous needs. The then Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, Mr Michael Dodson, included in his 1995 report a summary of submissions made by a number of Aboriginal organisations to the commission during its 1993 review of the relativities of the distribution of funds between the states and territories. All government agencies involved in the provision of services and programs to indigenous Australians will benefit from information resulting from the commission's proposed reporting powers. This information will assist in clear benchmarking for services provided across any level of government services which involves Commonwealth money.
Of particular interest for the opposition is the potential for the commission to investigate the effectiveness of Commonwealth funded services provided by states and territories. Benchmarking the achievements in indigenous services has always been difficult, especially with those services provided by the states and territories. The states and territories have an appalling record on the provision of some of the most basic services to indigenous Australians, services that the rest of the community takes for granted. This has often resulted in the disadvantageous conditions in which many indigenous people have to live. Some of these jurisdictions have improved their handling of indigenous services while others are in dire need of improvement. This amendment bill offers the opportunity to benchmark the achievements of the states and territories in the use of funds originating from the Commonwealth, ensuring that Commonwealth money is spent appropriately in both its purpose and outcome. The amounts of money 
 are not insignificant. Identified Commonwealth specific purpose grants to the states and territories for indigenous programs was estimated at nearly $220 million in 1998-99, down from the 1997-98 figure of nearly $237 million, mainly in the vital areas of health, infrastructure and education.
The information provided by the commission would also be of value to ATSIC, providing the government is prepared to use these proposed powers in a constructive rather than a critical way. The recent performance audit by the Australian National Audit Office on the delivery of housing and infrastructure to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities was favourable to the work done by ATSIC in providing Aboriginal housing services. However, the report noted at page 13:
While ATSIC collected appropriate performance information from NAHS projects for 1997-98 it was not adequately analysed or reported at the state/territory and national levels.
In other words, reporting was identified as an area for improvement and of importance for future strategic targeting. With ATSIC's limited funding, the Commonwealth Grants Commission could complement ATSIC's own evaluation of its program results. I previously mentioned the workshop and that quote. But, again, we come back to the need to be monitoring ATSIC programs through not only the commission reporting process but also, and perhaps more importantly, those essential services that should be provided by the states and territories.
The opposition therefore wholeheartedly welcomes this initiative to gather, analyse and interpret further information regarding the effectiveness of indigenous programs involving Commonwealth money, whether directly or indirectly. It will add to the future delivery of these programs and make benchmarking more effective and achievable. I do, however, have one concern. That is also outlined in the `Concluding Comments' in the Bills Digest. It basically says that there is no compulsion in the legislation for the reports gathered by the commission to be tabled for public consumption, only where legislation relevant to the subject matter of the report is to be 
 introduced. Such information should be available regardless of its relevance to immediate proposed legislation. This measure seems to fly in the face of indigenous self-determination by the possible constriction of information to the commission and the office of the minister for finance, away from indigenous people themselves and those who provide services for them.
There are several research facilities, including those with a specific indigenous focus such as the Australian Institute for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies and the Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research at the Australian National University, which would also find such information of great value to their research. These organisations provide an invaluable body of information on which we all rely for the formulation of public policy in the area of indigenous affairs. In short, I am saying the commission should be given these powers to inquire but we should not hide the results of the report.
—It does not hide it.
—No, I am not saying it does. But I say to the honourable member that we support the bill but we are saying, `Let's make it transparent; let's make it more publicly available.' That is all we are saying. We are worried that it might not be as readily or freely available as it should be. I think the best way to overcome the problem of ignorance is to get the material out to as many organisations as possible. That is why we welcome this bill. As I said, it is an initiative that was being worked through by the previous government. We lost office before we brought it in. So I commend this minister for continuing down the track and taking the advice.
The problem in recent years has been the misinformation that is out there in the community—the view that ATSIC is the sole provider. We are conducting a review into the Land Rights Act of the Northern Territory at the moment and what staggers me is the reviewer, John Reeves QC, giving evidence to the committee the other day and then doing a press conference talking about health, housing, education and other needs, when that is not the function of the Land Rights Act. 
 That is not the history of the Land Rights Act. He is someone with supposed talent and education. He is someone at that level who has got it badly wrong and is justifying that as the basis of his report, when the truth is that state and territory governments should have been providing this service. We have been giving them money for years but we have never held them accountable. We have never said, `How have you spent the money?' We have never benchmarked them. We have never looked at whether it is going to those most in need. So John Reeves QC has got it badly wrong.
That is why I say to my friends opposite that we need to encourage inquiries of this sort, to gather the information and then to make it publicly and widely available. This is where I disagree with my friend opposite—only in this respect. People should not have to require it under freedom of information. We should be publicising it for all to see. My view is that this is an area outside politics. There are people of goodwill on all sides of the political fence in relation to this. The way to overcome the prejudice and ignorance in the community is to have this information freely available and publicly available. As I go round to the communities I find that there is goodwill towards our indigenous brothers and sisters but there is this scepticism and worry: is the money being properly spent? ATSIC at the moment is a nice whipping tool for the rednecks and the others out there: `Let's blame ATSIC'.
There is not enough money going to ATSIC to provide these services. But who has asked for accountability from the Territory government for what they have been doing in relation to literacy levels? Bilingual education is a big issue that my friend from the Northern Territory talks about. And I know that my friend, Mr Lieberman, the member for Indi, and I have been through this review on Reeves. I have seen a change of attitude in government members of the committee as we go out to the coalface. But there is a lot of misunderstanding out there. A lot of people are blaming the land councils, ATSIC and others for non-provision of these services. This bill will help us with that.
Maybe the Territory government or the Queensland government will come out of this smelling like roses, in terms of the provision of their services. If it is the case that I am perpetuating a myth—that they are not properly spending their money or whatever—this professional body, the Grants Commission, will be able to deliver a report to us and then we will know. Maybe they have been providing these services in a timely and effective way. Maybe they have been spending all their money. But we are not going to be in a situation where we do not have the information. That is why the opposition supports this legislation wholeheartedly.
If and when we are returned to government, and if I am in this portfolio or another portfolio, I will be encouraging the continuing use of this provision in the act, to continually monitor the provision by state and territory governments of services to our indigenous brothers and sisters. We have to get it right. It is not appropriate that we continue to go down a path where we just give money to the states and territories. We have a constitutional obligation under the 1967 referendum to work in partnership with the states and territories for the betterment of indigenous Australians. This bill helps us down that path. I commend it to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMONWEALTH GRANTS COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Wakelin, Barry, MP",LP,1999-06-21,"—The Commonwealth Grants Commission Amendment Bill 1999 had its genesis during the 1998 election campaign when Senator Herron, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, said the government would work with the indigenous community and ATSIC to develop and adopt arrangements to improve the allocation of funding for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander persons. As the member for Banks, the shadow minister, has acknowledged, there is this tension in the community about how effectively that money is being spent and whether we are making the sorts of improvements the community generally—Aboriginal and European—and the government and the opposition would like to see Aboriginal communities make. This is one small step in endeavouring, through the Grants Commission, to develop a method that 
 could be used to target resources more effectively to the areas of greatest need.
The bill provides the minister with the power to ask the commission to inquire into matters relating to the financing of works and services for indigenous persons. At present, the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act 1973 restricts the commission to inquiring into matters relating to the relative needs of the states and territories for general revenue funding and to advising on the needs of the small island territories. The budget provided funds for the commission to conduct an inquiry to develop measures of relative need for groups of indigenous people.
The Grants Commission is a highly respected body that has much experience in assessing the relative needs of different communities. It is well established in the Australian system of government to be able to undertake this task. Of course we would understand that the Commonwealth Grants Commission is an independent statutory authority that prepares its recommendations to government objectively after considering all relevant facts and perspectives on matters before it.
Consistent with its method of operation, any inquiry into the distribution of funds for indigenous programs would involve extensive consultation with government agencies currently involved in distributing those funds and with the indigenous community. A commission inquiry will give the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community greater assurance that the distribution of funds for indigenous programs is based on need. A commission inquiry would relate to the distribution of funds, not the quantity of funds available for distribution. The member for Banks touched on the current parliamentary inquiry into land rights in the Northern Territory and mentioned John Reeves QC.
—An ex-Labor member.
—I understand so, Mr Parliamentary Secretary. That is quite right. But can I just say that in public evidence last week I think Mr Reeves endeavoured in a very learned way to try to explain to the members, to the Commonwealth and to the community generally that there has been tension between a very narrow focus on just 
 land rights and ignoring the issues of social justice, health, education and all of those issues of disadvantage. That is where we are currently, 23 years or so after the introduction and passing of the original Commonwealth land rights act for the Northern Territory.
So we have moved on significantly, and John Reeves was endeavouring to explain to the committee and to the community that perhaps the land rights legislation has achieved almost as much as could reasonably be expected—that is, something like 50 per cent of the Territory is in the control of Aboriginal people, owned by Aboriginal people—yet we see the significant disadvantage and significant issues of poor health, poor literacy and poor unemployment rates for Aboriginal people. So Reeves was really just trying to open up the debate to a point where we needed to think of land rights in conjunction with those overarching issues of disadvantage.
As for the general funding program for Aboriginal people, we spend in specific Commonwealth assistance to Aboriginal Australians now something around $2.2 billion annually. So we have in the new initiatives a radical—some say—and innovative $52 million program to tackle the fundamental economic problem facing Aboriginal people, and that is unemployment. I will not give the figures; they are well documented. Everybody understands they are very much higher than the national average.
On the extension of Aboriginal health expenditure, we have $6.8 million for improving access to primary health care, $6 million for better access to medicines and $3.6 million for additional residential aged care. We have an expansion of the education expenditure—remember, this is the additional expenditure—for indigenous students to a total of $16.3 million to improve literacy, numeracy and school retention rates. And we, of course, have an extension of the ATSIC-Army Community Assistance Program worth $41.2 million over four years. The expansion of this very successful venture has gone down very well, particularly in the remote Aboriginal communities of Australia.
Some observers may have suggested in the past that the sheer scale of disadvantage faced by indigenous Australians is such that we cannot afford to observe normal prudential and economic arrangements in allocating funding. However, I believe that the opposite is plainly true—that is, the sheer scale of the disadvantage in question means that the Commonwealth and Aboriginal agencies need to be even more effective and prudent but certainly maximising the value of all taxpayer dollars. Because the need is so great, we just cannot afford not to use those dollars well. So, by improving the basis of government analysis, we can allocate funds more efficiently and derive greater benefits for Aboriginal people and for Australia as a nation.
The Commonwealth Grants Commission, as I have said earlier, is acknowledged as a world's best agency in its field. I really want to emphasise this point, because the Bills Digest—and members who have read it will have noticed this—dwells to some degree on the issue of division, tension, between the government and certain Aboriginal groups. I do not accept that the basis of this tension from either side of the fence is as bad as some would have us believe, because I believe there is a vested interest, a political interest, in maintaining the heat.
Nevertheless, I do not think that sort of activity, that sort of approach, gets us anywhere over the longer term. Therefore, in the sense of lowering the temperature on the Aboriginal issues of Australia, it is important to remember that the Commonwealth Grants Commission will retain its valued freedom as a statutory authority to make recommendations and will continue to operate in this manner when it joins with ATSIC and other relevant agencies and authorities to examine the present distribution pattern in the forthcoming inquiry.
In conclusion, I support and welcome the comments of the shadow minister, the member for Banks. The need to move forward in this debate and the need to reassure the community of the proper expenditure and the maximum effectiveness of this expenditure for Aboriginal people are key issues for all of us, 
 wherever we sit. I welcome this legislation and wish it a speedy passage.",REPS,<title>COMMONWEALTH GRANTS COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,1999-06-21,"—I rise this evening to support this legislation. In doing so, I want to make some comments and perhaps place some caveats on the level of my support in the context of the target that seems to be the objective of the legislation, at least in terms of where the government is coming from and from the speeches I have heard during the course of the debate.
As other speakers have indicated, this bill will amend the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act 1973 to enable the Minister for Finance and Administration to request the Commonwealth Grants Commission to inquire into and report on (a) works and services provided to indigenous people funded directly or indirectly by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority; (b) grants made under section 96 of the Constitution to a state for works or services provided to indigenous Australians; and (c) grants made by the Commonwealth to a territory to pay for works or services for indigenous Australians.
As other speakers have said, this is indeed timely. But I am a little bit concerned by the tenor of some of the contributions. Clearly there is a view—at least held by some—that the purpose of this legislation is to make Aboriginal organisations and Aboriginal people more accountable for the expenditure of Commonwealth funds. I have had a lot of experience, over many years, through working with Aboriginal organisations, through being a member of this parliament and having administrative and executive responsibilities for Commonwealth funds being expended to and through Aboriginal organisations. I do not think there is any doubt now that, in terms of accountability, most—if not all—Aboriginal organisations which are funded from the Commonwealth purse, either directly or indirectly, are the most accountable organisations in this land. The audit functions of ATSIC are very strong; far stronger than those prevailing for other Commonwealth bodies for the expenditure of Commonwealth funds in other areas—for example, in community services.
In a sense, part of this debate and part of this bill is addressing something which I do not think exists. There is no doubt that there are organisations which may need some work, but I take you to the words of the member for Groom, who made a contribution earlier this evening. He talked about the need for people to be trained and to understand their roles as directors of organisations and the concepts of good corporate governance. I have to say there is a measure of hypocrisy in that assertion. The hypocrisy comes of course because, on the one hand the government would argue that Aboriginal organisations and Aboriginal communities should be cognisant of the needs of good corporate governance and acknowledge and be aware of their legal responsibilities under the various acts of parliament in relation to money.
Yet Mr Entsch, one of the government's own members, is not asked to have the same measure of accountability. For him it is appropriate, it appears, not to worry about the laws of good corporate governance, not to be concerned about the functions of a director or a company secretary. He can act with disregard to the law, but not so Aboriginal organisations. I say to those opposite that whilst you are thinking about the merits of this legislation, you should ask yourselves this question: should the rules you want to apply to Aboriginal people and Aboriginal organisations around Australia apply to everyone?
—Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: the standing orders are quite clear as far as casting improper imputations or actions on members of parliament. If indeed the member for the Northern Territory does have criticisms of any member, then he could do so by substantive motion.
—I have listened to the member for the Northern Territory and I think he is straying fairly close to that point. I would suggest to him that if he wishes to bring up a substantive motion, that would be the way to do it.
—I am happy to, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I make the point that you were here during question time today when this very question was asked of the government. And I am saying to you that there are 
 double standards which prevail in this House in the attitude of government members and their leadership to issues of corporate governance and directorships. The same level of scrutiny and public accountability that they want Aboriginal people to be aware of should be applied to their own members of parliament—it is as simple as that.
And let Aboriginal people and Aboriginal organisations and every other Australian now have the comfort of the new legal principle of inadvertence—so that, if they happen to make a mistake, if they do not fill in a form properly, or they do not lodge the right form, they can say they overlooked something, or they anticipated they did not have to do it, and thereby be forgiven for whatever error of judgment they might have made—whatever law might apply to their culpability. Because that is exactly the standard the government is now applying to its own members.
I just wanted to make that point, because when I sat in my office this afternoon watching this debate I thought the member for Groom was sailing very close to the wind in terms of hypocrisy about the measure of public accountability and probity that people expect of agencies which are expending government funds and the level of probity that the government expects of its own members.
There are a range of other issues which I think bear close examination. I note from the minister's second reading speech that the government's intention is:
. . . to ensure that funding for programs aimed at improving the situation of Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island communities is distributed on a needs basis.
Mr Deputy Speaker, I want you to contemplate what that means. I am aware of the role of the Grants Commission in making assessments of government expenditure. I ask you to contemplate, when making judgments about needs based funding, whether or not any account is taken of the way in which funds are expended by state and territory agencies once they are received from the Commonwealth government in the form of general purpose payments. I say that because I understand that the objective of this legislation is 
 to particularly address specific purpose payments as well as other payments made directly or indirectly for the purposes of funding Aboriginal programs.
In saying that, I note that in the Northern Territory, of which I am very much aware, we ought to be contemplating these sorts of issues. I wonder whether or not they will be contemplated by this review. Around 78 to 80 per cent of the Northern Territory government's budget revenue emanates from the Commonwealth in the form of specific and general purpose payments. To be precise, of that percentage, 76.9 per cent is in the form of general revenue payments and 23.04 per cent is in the form of specific purpose payments.
I understand from the tenor of this legislation that this will give the Grants Commission the capacity to examine and review that 23.04 per cent of specific purpose payments funds. That is that part of the total amount of federal government outlays which forms 80 per cent of Northern Territory government budget revenue. It is the proportion of those budget government revenues that emanates from specific purpose grants.
I wonder whether it will take account of the fact that the Northern Territory takes out in administrative fees 46.1 per cent—that is 46.1 cents in every dollar—of the money made available to the Northern Territory government for the purposes of education. Will this inquiry have the capacity to review those items? The Northern Territory government also takes out for administrative purposes 52 cents in the dollar of every dollar that is spent by the Commonwealth in the Northern Territory on health.
You do not have to be Einstein to work it out. This financial year, the government is making available to the Northern Territory $19.8 million for IESIP, the Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Program. Of that $19.8 million, 46 per cent will be taken out in administrative costs by the Northern Territory government on the way through to its Aboriginal recipients. If we are talking about accountability in this place, let us understand what the mark should really be.
This government and successive Commonwealth governments have made available general purpose revenue grants to states and territories for the purpose of ensuring that there is appropriate horizontal fiscal equalisation. We all know the importance of horizontal fiscal equalisation. I take you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to two paragraphs in volume 1 of the Grants Commission's own report on general revenue grant initiatives for 1999. I will quote from part of paragraph 1, which refers to the principle of fiscal equalisation:
The concept is seen as part of the fabric of nationhood—that better endowed States or regions contribute to the capacity of those whose resource bases are not as abundant or whose needs are greater, for reasons beyond their own control.
Paragraph 17 states:
Horizontal fiscal equalisation thus serves an important equity objective. It also says something about the value that Australians place on nationhood; it has been described as `the glue that holds the federation together'.
I note that there may be some concerns about the way that has been expressed. It is from the Grants Commission's own report. If it is the glue that holds the nation together, we as the guardians of the nation's purse strings would want to know how the funds which supply the glue are actually expended. We need to ensure that they are properly accounted for by those state and territory governments.
But they are not, because general revenue assistance is, by its nature, untied. Once it gets out of the hands of Treasury and gets passed on to the state and territory governments, we have no idea where it will end up. It may end up in areas such as Aboriginal education or health, but more often than not it does not. There is plenty of work to indicate that Aboriginal Australians are missing out on their share of general purpose revenue.
Mr Deputy Speaker, I take you to two reports. I will not go into any detail about them. I am sure that you will refer to them at your leisure. You will seek them in the library with a great deal of zest and fervour when learning more about the way in which government funds are allocated and spent in this country. The first report is entitled Expenditures on health services for Aboriginal and 
 Torres Strait Islander people. It is by J. Deeble, C. Mathers, L. Smith, J. Goss, R. Webb and V. Smith and is dated May 1998. It is a very good expression of the way in which moneys are being misused by state and territory governments. Resources are made available as a result of funds from the Commonwealth government in the form of general revenue grants to the states and territories. It examines how they should be spent to ensure that the element of disadvantage which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people suffer in this country is properly addressed.
The issue is not properly addressed not because ATSIC, the Aboriginal health services or the Aboriginal legal services do not spend their dollars wisely but because state and territory governments do not accept their proper responsibility in this country. It is worth pointing out that, just on this issue of general revenue assistance, the Northern Territory government receives five times the national average. It properly receives five times the national average because of the elements of disadvantage referred to by earlier speakers and the way in which the Grants Commission makes its recommendations. If the Northern Territory gets five times the per capita average in Commonwealth general revenue payments, the Northern Territory government has a responsibility to account for those resources. However, it does not distribute those resources according to the same principles of horizontal fiscal equalisation because it sees them as untied grants to be used as it wants, the same as every other state or territory government.
The situation will worsen if the government's tax package comes into being. Whilst there will be a three-year transitional period, after that transitional period there will be an increase in this revenue base of untied grants, effectively using the same formula but with no accountability. There is no way for this parliament to oversight the way in which these general revenue payments are being spent by state and territory governments in the context of addressing the dire need of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Austral 
 ians in terms of health, housing, education and employment.
It is all very well for the member for Grey to get up here and talk magnanimously about $52 million being made available in this latest budget for employment services. For the member for Grey's information, and for the information of other members of the government, all but two of those programs are rebadged programs initiated by the Labor government. I know this because I was responsible for their administration in the 1993-96 period. The expenditure of the then Labor government was twice the $52 million figure that this government now says is a generous contribution to alleviate unemployment for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. I welcome the contribution, but let us dispense with the fairy tales about how great a gesture it is, because it should be a lot more in the general context of this issue.
As a parliament, we have a responsibility. We have already referred to specific purpose payments. I mentioned the question of moneys which are currently made available in the Northern Territory. The amount for this financial year is $322.1 million. Of course, what will happen—and I hope that I am right in my analysis of this bill—is that it will give the Grants Commission the capacity to review the way in which these funds are utilised by state and territory governments; in this case, the Northern Territory. I hope I am right because, if I am wrong, this legislation will need to be amended again to ensure that it can be done. I might also say that the difficulty we will have subsequent to the enactment of the government's new tax system will be that, over time, these specific purpose payments will diminish as we get more general purpose payments paid out in the form of the GST revenue being raised by the state and territories based, roughly I assume, on the Grants Commission formula. That will mean that the ability to make state and territory governments accountable for the use of these funds will be further diminished.
Let us not get too carried away about how successful we will be in our fight to make sure that Commonwealth government resources, taxpayers' funds, are properly utilised 
 by state and territory governments if we are not prepared to hold the state and territory governments to account for the general purpose revenue payments that they receive currently from the Commonwealth government. It is clear to me that they are not. Effectively, they say to the Commonwealth government, `These funds are ours to dispense with as we will,' despite the fact that, in the context of the formula which the Grants Commission uses, the Aboriginal indigenous disadvantage is an element that is not secure in the way in which these funds are made available.
I was going to make some reference to Mr Reeves. All I can say is that the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act was never designed for the purposes for which Mr Reeves now wants it to be designed, and it still has a long way to go to serve its full functions, as it is presently described. I do not think it is appropriate to use the land rights act as a tool to address this disadvantage. The way to address this disadvantage is not only to top up funds which are already made available for these purposes but to ensure that not only Aboriginal people and organisations are accountable but state and territory governments are made to do their job and that they are properly accountable for every dollar they get from the Commonwealth government through the processes of the Grants Commission in assessment of general revenue grants.",REPS,<title>COMMONWEALTH GRANTS COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Kelly, De-Anne, MP",NP,1999-06-21,"—I base many of my comments on the Commonwealth Grants Commission Amendment Bill 1999  on my experience with the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, which is looking into the matter of indigenous health. I will not pre-empt the findings or the decision making of that committee, but I would like to draw on some of the experiences and some of the situations that the committee has faced during the 3½ years that I have been privileged to be a member.
I would like to talk very generally about the bill and the introduction to it. This financial year, 1999-2000, a record $2.2 billion has been provided by the Commonwealth for specific programs for indigenous people. By 
 any measure this is a very significant allocation, just over half going to the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio and the remainder going to health, employment, education and family and community services. It is astounding that there has not been more improvement, given the sums that have been poured into progress for indigenous people over the past two decades or so.
Despite all of these billions of dollars and all of the hard work and good intentions, the result nationally has been overall a disappointment. The facts speak for themselves. Indigenous people have a life expectancy 15 to 20 years less than other Australians. Their babies are still two to four times more likely to die at birth, and their mortality rates for those aged 25 to 54 are six to eight times higher than for other Australians.
The member for the Northern Territory has been very fulsome in his criticism. However, I think the epitaph for his government is that given by the prominent Aboriginal leader, Noel Pearson, who spoke only a few weeks ago about the ongoing crisis facing his people in Cairns. He described welfare largely brought in by the previous government as a `poison' which had turned many of his people into `drunken parasites'.
Mr Pearson also challenged indigenous leaders to cease disempowering their own people by continually depicting them as victims. Most of all, he accepted that along with rights come responsibilities—to themselves, their wives, husbands, children, elders and the general community. These insightful and very thoughtful comments were not just true, they were courageous. It is an undeniable fact that, had any non-Aboriginal said them, the accusation would have been made immediately that such a person was a racist. That, very sadly, is how debate on this fundamental issue has been so corrupted.
The stark statistics reveal a community that is depressed and dysfunctional. Indigenous school retention rates are half those of other students. Indigenous households are larger, with a greater proportion of single-parent and multi-family households with more overcrowding. Income levels of indigenous people, particularly those in non-urban areas, are 
 significantly less; and only one-third—compared to 70 per cent generally of other Australians—own or are buying their own homes.
But while the community is in crisis it continues to grow. The 1991 census revealed a population of 345,381 indigenous people, with the 1996 census revealing a population of 386,049—an increase of 11.8 per cent. While improved census-taking procedures and an increased self-identification made their contribution to this significant jump, nevertheless the estimated rate of increase is 2.3 per cent per annum—double that of the total population. Indigenous women tend to have more children than others, with more than 13 per cent having five or more children compared with just over five per cent of all Australian women.
Almost uniformly, the statistics paint a picture of unrelieved gloom and little hope. Here and there, there are some rays of promise. Can I say, after having visited remote Aboriginal communities, some really are leading the way and they give one a great deal of inspiration and hope. One of the statistics that is encouraging is that indigenous children are staying at school longer, with the proportion leaving school at 17 and over having almost doubled from 11.5 per cent in 1986 to 20.8 per cent in 1996. The proportion of indigenous people attending technical, further education, university or other tertiary institutions also more than doubled in that decade from two per cent to 4.1 per cent. While these figures are still abysmally low, they are headed in the right direction and do give encouragement.
However, the simple stark and undeniable fact remains that the billions of dollars spent by federal, state and territory governments over the past two decades or more have, by and large, not produced anywhere near the desired result. It was that realisation that led to this bill. As the minister said when introducing it, the bill is central to the government's intention to ensure that funding for programs aimed at improving the situation of indigenous people is distributed on a needs basis. Frankly, one only need travel—as I have in the last 3½ years—to remote commu 
 nities or even look around the major cities to know that there is something very badly, very seriously wrong with the current funds distribution process.
Allow me for a moment, if I may, to pick on two examples. I will not name the councils concerned, but these certainly struck a chord with me, bearing in mind that these councils receive a disability payment from the Commonwealth in their Financial Assistance Grants, or FAGs. In one council, young children from an indigenous community were continually ill because of the water. It was discovered by our committee that a small amount of funding from the local council would have provided a filter that would have cleaned this water. The cost was in the order of four figures, or possibly less—a very small sum for several hundred young children suffering quite severe illnesses through contaminated and poor water.
—Has it been fixed?
—I will get to that shortly. This was a matter where I felt the local council really had behaved in a very, very poor manner. In another, we saw a local indigenous community that had a settlement some 10 or 12 kilometres out of town. It had a local school; it was a very nice little community with nice homes that were well cared for. The council, however, had decided to build its dump in the hills that drained down onto the community. Frankly, I cannot think of anything more appalling, and this had only been done in the last few years. It was an absolutely disgraceful situation. How any shire council could in all conscience build its town dump in the hills such that it drained down onto its local community members, indigenous or otherwise, really fails my understanding. So not only are there matters of distribution of funds that need addressing, I think there are matters of conscience and responsibility as well.
I would like to move on to the bill further. The bill will allow the Commonwealth Grants Commission, a body respected by all sides of politics, to become involved. The commission, an independent statutory body, will be able to take submissions from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and thus be able to get 
 to the vital grassroots and learn of real direct and immediate problems, such as those we have seen during our 3½ years of travel. The commission will then report to the government on how best to respond to these needs and better direct funding. I am confident that this will bring not just a better financial accountability and a better delivery of funding but, equally important, a genuine sense of ownership of programs amongst indigenous people. They will be given the key responsibility that Noel Pearson spoke of recently.
I said earlier that there were some rays of promise. One initiative which has even won some praise from the opposition—although not entirely from the member for the Northern Territory—is the $115 million comprehensive employment policy for indigenous people. It was launched on 25 May by the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Peter Reith. The policy and its program are practical yet innovative, and the minister is to be congratulated for his practical, commonsense approach.
As with everything else, sadly the statistics on employment for indigenous people are depressing. Their labour force participation rate is 63.8 per cent for males and 42.65 for females, compared with 71.4 per cent and 52.85 per cent respectively for the general population. Their unemployment rate, according to the 1996 census, is 22.7 per cent, more than double the then general rate of 9.2 per cent. If it were not for the Commonwealth's Community Development Employment Program, which provides work in many places where labour market opportunities are limited or non-existent, the unemployment rate would be four times higher.
It was against this challenging background that Minister Reith and the government devised the program announced on 25 May. It has three principal elements: an indigenous employment policy, an indigenous small business fund and a more focused Job Network. As outlined by the minister, the centrepiece of the policy is a new $52 million indigenous employment program, which has a very strong emphasis on private sector employment. 
In all, there are seven elements of the new program. They are wage assistance for employers of disadvantaged indigenous job seekers; a placement incentive for community development employment projects; a package involving major private sector companies wishing to recruit indigenous Australians; projects providing structured training and employment opportunities for indigenous people in the private sector and with indigenous community organisations; a voluntary service to the Indigenous Communities Foundation which will aim to meet the needs of indigenous communities for skilled business advice, mentoring and other specialist assistance; a national indigenous cadet program which will provide opportunities for indigenous undergraduates with private and public sector employers; and a public awareness program aimed at indigenous communities, employers and the broader Australian community to support the policy.
The small business fund, jointly funded by ATSIC, will provide funds to help establish new indigenous businesses and develop existing businesses by providing access to management, technical and other support services. It will receive funding of $6 million over three years from the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business and $5 million over three years from ATSIC. Job Network will remain the principal means through which indigenous people will find work. It is estimated that $63 million would be the share of services that indigenous people would receive through Job Network. The Indigenous Employment Program in particular will support the Job Network in achieving a better share of outcomes for indigenous job seekers.
This is what real assistance is all about. It is based on recognising a need, on respecting and cooperating with the people it is aimed at helping and on a clear policy and philosophy that seeks to break the welfare mentality so criticised by Noel Pearson. The coalition has previously demonstrated its hands-on, no nonsense approach to fixing problems.
The ATSIC-Army Community Assistance Program has provided a number of very needy remote communities with high quality health 
 related infrastructure and the training needed to maintain it. I was most impressed with the work that the Army had done in communities such as the Maralinga community in South Australia. Obviously their work and their infrastructure have made a big difference to the lifestyle and the comfort of those communities, and there is a good deal more to be done.
Last year, the Prime Minister announced a project specifically aimed at reducing the high incidence of eye disease in remote Aboriginal communities where the rate of blindness is 10 times that of the general population. There are many other shining examples and I hope that, from the work that our committee does and from the sound policy underlining this bill, there will be many more shining examples in the future. The importance of this bill cannot be underestimated for it marks a new beginning for indigenous people.",REPS,<title>COMMONWEALTH GRANTS COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Hoare, Kelly, MP",ALP,1999-06-21,"—I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the Commonwealth Grants Commission Amendment Bill 1999 . As members here would be aware, I hold a great passion for issues and government policy which affect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and I will oppose with vigour any decisions made by this government which could be detrimental to indigenous people. The bill before the parliament amends the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act 1973 to enable the Minister for Finance and Administration to request the Commonwealth Grants Commission to inquire into and report on works and services provided to indigenous people funded directly or indirectly by the Commonwealth or Commonwealth authority, grants made under section 96 of the Constitution to a state for works or services provided to indigenous people and grants made by the Commonwealth to a territory to pay for works and services for indigenous people.
In his second reading speech, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration stated that this bill is aimed at improving the situation of Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities by ensuring that funding for programs is distributed on a needs basis. I 
 have no doubt that the speakers who have gone before me and the speakers who will come after me all agree with that great philosophy. If the government's intent is genuinely based on the establishment of a decent and acceptable standard of living for indigenous people, I would applaud it and support it.
As part of my current involvement with the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, I have had the opportunity to travel with my colleagues—the honourable member for the Northern Territory, the shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, the other members of the committee and the honourable member for Indi, who is the chair of that committee—to remote communities in the Northern Territory to speak with the people who live there.
During those visits, however, I found it appalling and obscene that suggestions were made by some conservative quarters—and this was also alluded to by the member for Grey during his contribution to this debate—that Aboriginal people should spend their royalty income on areas such as health, housing and education. Health, housing and education services provided to Aboriginal communities must be provided by the state or territory government just as health, housing and education services are provided by those governments to non-indigenous communities.
If the Commonwealth Grants Commission finds in the future that, for example, the Northern Territory Country Liberal government has failed in its provision of these services to Aboriginal communities, then I would support the government's actions to rectify any anomalies. However, if this bill is an integral part of the government's current agenda in indigenous affairs, then I believe that we in the Labor Party and the Australian indigenous communities have every right to be sceptical.
The role which this bill is outlining for the Commonwealth Grants Commission centres on one of the roles which has been traditionally the responsibility of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. One of ATSIC's core obligations has been to provide policy advice to the government and to 
 monitor program delivery to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. ATSIC is currently not in a position to pick up areas of neglect left by mainstream providers at either the state or the Commonwealth level. Within its current resources, ATSIC is facing difficulties trying to meet core obligations.
The Howard government's record on the treatment of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and issues relating to indigenous affairs has been nothing short of abysmal. Let me just outline some features of that record. On 10 April 1996 at a Parliament House press conference, the Prime Minister announced that the government would introduce legislation to amend the ATSIC Act to provide for the appointment of the ATSIC chair and reduce the number of regional councils. He also announced the appointment of a Special Auditor to determine whether prospective grantees were fit and proper persons to receive public money and proposed to amend the ATSIC Act to enable an administrator to be appointed if the minister was satisfied there had been fraud, gross mismanagement or failure to respond to a general directive of the minister. I think the member for the Northern Territory spoke quite eloquently on similarities to that situation.
In the federal government's August 1996 budget, federal expenditure in the area of indigenous affairs was cut by $470 million over four years. ATSIC expenditure fell from $968.5 million in 1995-96 to $894 million in 1996-97. This was not a result of a transfer of any significant function to another portfolio area. Indeed, overall indigenous specific expenditure fell dramatically in the 1996-97 financial year. Expenditure in some other areas fell dramatically and some programs—for example, the Community and Youth Support Program—were terminated altogether.
In September 1996 Minister Herron announced that the special audit of ATSIC had been suspended after being ruled invalid in the Federal Court. However, he rejected calls for the government to pay the $830,000 bill, saying that ATSIC had gained considerable benefits from the audit. The Special Auditor was still required to report and did so in October 1996. There were 1,122 ATSIC 
 funded organisations reviewed and 95 per cent were cleared for funding.
In April 1998 a bill to reorganise the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission was introduced into the parliament. Under the bill, HREOC will be renamed the Human Rights and Responsibilities Commission and will consist of a president and three deputies. One of the deputies will deal with both race discrimination and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander social justice, whereas previously there were two commissioners for those two areas. In May 1998 ATSIC chairman Gatjil Djerrkura responded to the government's budget by saying:
Of the four priorities constantly emphasised by this Government—health, housing, education, and employment, only health has received a significant increase in funding . . .
No more funds have been provided for housing, despite an estimated $4 billion deficit in housing and infrastructure in Indigenous communities across Australia and despite the impact of poor living conditions on the health of our communities.
In the face of a looming crisis in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander unemployment, growth of ATSIC's Community Development Employment Projects (CDEP) scheme will be tightly restrained.
And overall expenditure on Indigenous-specific programs by the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs appears to have been cut next financial year.
As a matter of fact, DEETYA expenditure on indigenous specific programs fell from $416.3 million in 1997-98 to an estimated $384 million.
In July 1998 ATSIC chairman Gatjil Djerrkura tried to seek an early meeting with the Prime Minister about the implementation of the Native Title Amendment Act. He said:
I am concerned that the Prime Minister did not appreciate the value of gaining our input before proceeding to sign off on his agreement with Senator Brian Harradine, despite the fact that this element of the legislation contained limited gains for us.
. . .              . . .             . . .
Mr Howard heads a Government which is in retreat on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs.
In July 1998 Minister Herron issued a press release expressing his deep concern over media reports that a two-day conference in 
 Broome organised by the Kimberley Land Council was costing over $150,000 of taxpayers' money. Minister Herron sought a special audit from ATSIC's Office of Evaluation and Audit into ATSIC conferences. In an address given to the UN Working Group on Indigenous Populations, Gatjil Djerrkura said:
Recently the tabloid press mis-reported the cost of a conference organised by the Kimberley Land Council in West Australia. 
The Government did not wait to check the facts, which showed the cost was within industry guidelines.
It seized the opportunity to publicly justify a Special Audit of all conferences, seminars and meetings resourced by ATSIC over the last two years.
No such accountability requirements are imposed on the activities of mainstream agencies.
The Special Audit is a dangerous and costly act of discrimination against our people.
. . .              . . .             . . .
No matter the findings, it will perpetuate the myth that every black dollar somehow ends up in the red.
The ATSIC budget fell from $973 million in 1997-98 to an estimated $960 million in 1998-99. Overall indigenous specific expenditure increased slightly but, after adjusting for the CPI, it actually represented a slight fall.
In August 1998 Senator Herron alleged that ATSIC-funded organisations attempted to keep their books closed to examination by the Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations. Also in that month in a joint statement the Prime Minister and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory announced an in-principle decision that the Northern Territory become a state on 1 January 2001. The announcement was opposed by many indigenous groups, and Aborigines were concerned that they were being left `sitting in a gum tree' while decisions were being made on their behalf. In September 1998, again without consulting ATSIC, the coalition government announced a proposal to mainstream responsibility for indigenous heritage protection. The policy would transfer responsibility for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act to Environment Australia.
In September 1998 Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer described the Northern and Central Land Councils as `blood sucking bureaucracies'. In January 1999 cabinet agreed to abolish Abstudy and move indigenous students on to the means tested youth allowance. The minister was reported as saying that `ATSIC seems to have lost its way' and he would advocate that cabinet approve removing control of housing from ATSIC. In March of this year the Attorney-General, Daryl Williams, dismissed the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination report which found that the Australian government is committing racial discrimination and is in breach of Articles 2 and 5 of the International Treaty on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.
In summary, the main concerns expressed by ATSIC and other indigenous organisations are the devolution of Commonwealth involvement in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs to state and territories, in particular the native title legislation and the heritage legislation; the government's rejection of ATSIC as the government's principal adviser on indigenous issues, for example through the expansion of the Office of Indigenous Policy in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and through a lack of consultation on major issues; a fear that ATSIC will be gutted, for example quarantining parts of the ATSIC budget, lack of consultation, removal of heritage administration and threats of removing housing and CDEP to mainstream departments; and a diminution of social justice and cultural issues and an overemphasis on accountability and economic issues.
The government has not responded to the previous government-initiated social justice report and instead has stressed `practical, commonsense' policies. There have also been examples of what might be termed `symbolic silence'. These include the failure to speak out against or counter statements by Pauline Hanson and One Nation, the refusal to apologise to the stolen generation, the refusal to accept the concept of self-determination and the refusal to use the term, the refusal to accept that reconciliation might take the form 
 of a treaty because this would imply separate nations, and the refusal to recognise anything further than prior occupation in the preamble to the Constitution.
As I stated in the beginning of this speech, I sincerely hope the government is genuine about ensuring the advancement of Aboriginal people. I am sure I will be joined in this hope by the honourable member for Indi when he follows me in this debate. He has shown his sincerity and his social conscience on these issues as chair of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs committee. I would hope that in any contribution to this debate Minister Herron will stop saying no to Aboriginal people, will stop saying no to a treaty, will stop saying no to Abstudy, no to housing, no to an apology, no to a memorial, no to indigenous administration of cultural heritage. I would hope that Minister Herron would say yes to any future steps proposed to advance toward true reconciliation.",REPS,<title>COMMONWEALTH GRANTS COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Lieberman, Lou, MP",LP,1999-06-21,"—I commend the minister, Senator John Herron, for bringing this legislation to the parliament, and I look forward to it being enacted quickly. I welcome the speech from the shadow minister, the member for Banks, supporting the legislation. Why do I support the legislation? I do not know the answers totally to the problems of addressing disadvantage for indigenous people, but like many Australians I am passionate in wanting to see those things addressed and wanting to see their disadvantage overcome as a matter of urgency.
This bill will ensure that, on the advice of the best independent statutory body we have in this country, a world respected body, the Commonwealth Grants Commission, funding from the Australian taxpayer to improve the future of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians is distributed on a needs basis. In fact, all taxpayer funding for non-indigenous people should also be distributed on that basis. If it is not, this parliament should be doing something about it. What I am looking for is an equal approach to these things. That is why this legislation gives us a chance to bring out, through the independent body in consultation with indigenous people and service providers throughout Australia, a 
 proper scientific assessment of the best way to address the needs of indigenous people.
Our aim is to improve the situation of our indigenous people, a third of whom die earlier than any other Australian group of people, a third of whom are sicker than any other group of Australians, and whose unemployment rates are in the vicinity of 60 per cent to 70 per cent—unacceptably high in every respect. The need for an independent assessment is one that I see as absolutely urgent and paramount. I want this government to be recognised for taking leadership, and bringing the legislation to the parliament so that this need can be met.
It will not provide all the answers. Let us not fool ourselves; it will not. But it will provide a proper basis for this government, future governments and indigenous people to form a proper understanding and partnership, and to build trust and confidence between each other on issues of prioritisation and allocation of taxpayers' funds. Might I say that the taxpayer will benefit substantially, because the taxpayer does not mind paying taxes to Australian governments if they are going to be used wisely and are going to bring about outcomes that we can all be proud of. It is terribly important that this process be in place so that we can be rewarded by the benefits of its advice and assessment from time to time and so that taxpayers' confidence can also be strengthened.
Certainly there have been a lot of fevered statements from many people in Australia, some of whom do not know what they are talking about, about the allocation of funding and the like. That has caused taxpayers to suffer a lack of confidence in continuing to fund some programs. I am somewhat restrained in what I say because I am Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and I am currently involved in chairing a major inquiry into Northern Territory land rights and I obviously have to keep an open mind, but I think you can understand what I am thinking.
I conclude by saying that these measures by the government, supported by the opposition, are very welcome, but there will be a lot 
 more for us to do because at the moment in Australia there is a hell of a lot of suspicion between indigenous and non-indigenous people and communities. But there is also a lot of goodwill and a lot of potential for forging worthwhile partnerships between Aboriginal people and non-Aboriginal people, between governments and between community organisations to deliver an outcome for all Australians and to overcome the disadvantage that we want to see addressed. The policies we have in place in some parts of Australia are too paternalistic. They have forced the indigenous people to rely too much on welfare, and that has sapped their confidence and energy. And why wouldn't it if you have generation after generation of families being told that they must rely solely on welfare? That is a terrible thing to sentence anyone to.
Many programs have been inadequately targeted or not targeted at all, many of them have lacked in coordination in many ways and many of them lack the element of mutual responsibility—that is, there are two sides to all of these policies: there has to be a giving and a receiving. People receiving have to give. They have to also make a commitment to make sure that it all works for the benefit of all Australians. There has to be a true partnership. I am very optimistic. My final view is that this bill will help to bring about the outcomes that we need and create the right environment.
I am very happy to see the opposition supporting this legislation. This is a turning of the page. We should put behind us some of the bitter words of politics we have heard uttered tonight and we should concentrate on the positives, the things we can do together, such as supporting this legislation, getting it in place urgently so that we can address the disadvantage that should have been removed, quite frankly, many years ago in Australia but which has continued to get worse because of the lack of policy. The policies are now in this legislation.",REPS,<title>COMMONWEALTH GRANTS COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,1999-06-21,"—in reply—At the outset I would like to thank honourable members for their contributions to the debate. 
 The Commonwealth Grants Commission Amendment Bill 1999  delivers on one of the government's 1998 key election commitments when during that campaign Senator Herron, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, said that the government would work with the indigenous community to develop and adopt arrangements to improve the allocation of funding for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander persons. Specifically he said that the Commonwealth Grants Commission will be asked to develop a method that could be used to target resources more effectively to the areas of greatest need. This is a vital step forward in meeting the commitment given by the minister. I thank all honourable members on both sides for their commitment to this particular bill.
The bill provides the Minister for Finance and Administration with the power to ask the commission to inquire into matters relating to the financing of works and services for indigenous persons. At the present time, the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act 1973 restricts the commission to inquiring into matters relating to the relative needs of the states and territories for general revenue funding and advising on the needs of the small island territories.
The Commonwealth Grants Commission is world renowned, greatly respected throughout the community, and it is not a matter of controversy that this commission has done its job in an outstanding way. In fact, the ringing endorsement by the honourable member for Banks of this legislation is positive proof that the government is all about improving the situation of indigenous people, and it is widely recognised that this bill is all about making sure that we have better outcomes. The budget has provided funds for the Commonwealth Grants Commission to conduct an inquiry to develop measures of relative need for groups of indigenous people. 
The commission is an independent statutory authority and it prepares its recommendations to government objectively after considering all relevant facts and perspectives on the matter before it. The commission inquiry will give Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
 community people greater assurance that the distribution of funds for indigenous programs is based on need and a commission inquiry would relate to the distribution of funds. What we are really talking about is not the quantity of funds but rather how those funds will indeed be distributed.
Reference has been made to the inquiry into indigenous health being conducted by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs. I was the chairman of that committee at the time we sought and obtained the reference. I think all of us would like to see improved health outcomes for indigenous Australians. Really we cannot be proud of the fact that indigenous peoples have a life expectancy of some 15 to 20 years less than for other Australians. Indigenous babies are still two to four times more likely to die at birth. Mortality rates amongst indigenous adults aged 25 to 54 are six to eight times higher than for other Australians and are persisting at this level. Indigenous people have much higher levels of unemployment. The school retention rates are half those of other children. Fewer indigenous families own or are purchasing their own home—30 per cent compared with about 70 per cent of the general population—and the list goes on.
Having said that, this is the situation which, after 200 years of European settlement, confronts indigenous Australians. The Commonwealth government, through this minister, is responsible for ensuring that indigenous specific programs are being funded at record levels. In fact, some $2.2 billion will be expended in the year 1999-2000. The Aboriginal Affairs portfolio accounts for a little over half of these funds, with the rest going to the Health, Employment, Education and Family and Community Services portfolios.
It really is important, however, that we see sustained improvements in the socioeconomic position of our indigenous people as a result of expenditure of this magnitude. The honourable member for Banks and other members alluded to the fact that the Australian community does not object when money is being spent on indigenous affairs. However, there is 
 a demand in the community that that money be spent wisely and that we receive better outcomes. At the moment, we have these appalling statistics with respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians at a time when spending is at record levels. That is why this government is absolutely determined to make sure that the Aboriginals and the general Australian community receive better outcomes for the dollars being spent in the area of indigenous affairs.
The honourable member for Melbourne referred to the accrual budget and that landmark reform which sees Australia being one of the first countries in the world to bring about budget reform which has openness and transparency. The honourable member for Melbourne wrongly suggested that we have removed the forward estimates; indeed, the budget papers provide greater transparency than ever before. So the member for Melbourne is quite wrong on that particular count. The member for Melbourne claimed that under our new tax system we would be neutering the role of the Commonwealth Grants Commission. The role of the Commonwealth Grants Commission in Commonwealth-state financial relations will not change. It will still provide advice to government on the distribution of funds amongst the states and territories. The arrangements specify that fiscal equalisation as applied by the Commonwealth Grants Commission will continue to be used in distributing funds amongst the states and territories.
The honourable member for Groom referred in his able contribution to prior contact between indigenous communities and the Commonwealth Grants Commission. I want to confirm that the Commonwealth Grants Commission has a long history of direct consultation with Aboriginal communities and, given the eminence of the membership of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, I am confident that the passage of this legislation will see indigenous outcomes very substantially improved.
The honourable member for Banks referred to the tabling of reports of the Commonwealth Grants Commission on indigenous affairs. The simple fact of the matter is that reports by the 
 Commonwealth Grants Commission with financial implications must be tabled in parliament under the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act 1973. The Commonwealth Grants Commission believes in full and free disclosure and would recommend to the Minister for Finance and Administration that the report should be tabled. I am not aware of any report by the Commonwealth Grants Commission which has not been tabled, and so the concerns expressed by my colleague the honourable member for Banks are concerns that he ought not to worry about.
The honourable member for the Northern Territory, like the honourable member for Charlton, mounted a spirited defence of ATSIC. I do not want to criticise ATSIC in any way. The purpose of this legislation is not to gut ATSIC, as has been suggested by some; it is all about finding a better funding mechanism so that the Australian community and the indigenous community within Australia are able to achieve better outcomes in response to the record spending which the government is allocating to indigenous areas.
The honourable member for the Northern Territory also sought to criticise expenditure in the Northern Territory on indigenous affairs, and he asked whether this legislation would in some way monitor the performance of the Northern Territory government. I want to refer the honourable member for the Northern Territory to the Scales committee—that is, the steering committee for the review of Commonwealth-state service provision. That committee already reports annually on the comparative performance of state government services. If the honourable member for the Northern Territory is in some way unhappy with the performance of the government of the Northern Territory, then he ought to make an approach to the Scales committee with his concerns, because the government is very interested in making sure not only that funding mechanisms are appropriate but also that when the moneys are allocated to state and territory governments and agencies those funds are spent wisely so that indigenous Australians benefit greatly.
The honourable member for Charlton introduced the only discordant note into this 
 debate. I think it is eminently regrettable that she saw fit to play politics with this legislation when the honourable member for Banks actually claimed that this legislation had its genesis during the time of the former Labor government. It may be that the honourable member for Charlton ought to go home and talk to her father, her predecessor. He would obviously counsel her against her lack of wisdom in criticising very sound initiatives of the government.
Also, there was criticism from the honourable member for Charlton suggesting that we were in some way seeking to inhibit the ability of ATSIC and seeking to remove ATSIC. ATSIC is a principal force of advice to the government on indigenous affairs and, indeed, will remain so under this particular legislation.
This is a bill which is strongly supported by both sides of the House. We have had speaker after speaker commend the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, my good friend and parliamentary colleague from Queensland Senator John Herron. We aim to spend money on Aboriginal affairs, but we also wish to make sure that the funding mechanisms are what are best for our indigenous Australians. I commend the bill to the House.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

That the bill be now read a second time.
The Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Bill 1999  will enact a regime which balances the need for the government to meet legitimate community concerns about the publication of illegal and offensive material online that is commensurate with the regulation of conventional media, while ensuring that the regulation does not place onerous or unjustifiable burdens on industry and inhibit the development of the online economy. Following the report of the Senate Select Committee on Information Technologies on the bill and further consultation with industry, the government made a number of amendments to the bill in the Senate to ensure that the intent of the bill is clear and its operation effective.
The main elements of the proposed framework are the following. A complaints mechanism will be established, under which any person can complain to the Australian Broadcasting Authority about offensive material online. Material that will trigger action by the ABA will be defined on the basis of current National Classification Board Guidelines for film as material refused classification and rated X, and material rated R that is not protected by adult verification procedures. The ABA will be given the powers to issue notices to Internet content hosts, ICHs, aimed at preventing access to prohibited material which is subject to a complaint if it is hosted in Australia. Where material is hosted overseas, the ABA will be able to direct Internet service providers to comply with provisions in an industry code of practice registered by the ABA or with an ABA standard or, where there is no code or standard, to take reasonable steps, which are to be technically and commercially feasible, to prevent access.
The framework will not apply to private or restricted distribution communications such as intranets or communications not in a stored form, nor to private emails, although industry codes of practice will be expected to cover emails that direct the recipient to highly offensive or illegal materials, and current provisions of the Crimes Act 1914 in relation to the offensive or harassing use of a carriage service will continue to apply. IPSs will be exempted from access prevention notices in relation to prohibited overseas hosted material where an offensive alternative arrangement is in place to prevent access by particular end users. Indemnities will be provided for service providers to protect them from litigation by customers affected by ABA notices.
There will be a graduated scale of sanctions against service providers breaching ABA notices or the legislation will apply. A community advisory body will be established to monitor material, operate a `hotline' to receive complaints about illegal material and pass this information to the ABA and police authorities, and to advise the public about options such as filtering software that are available to address concerns about online content. The Commonwealth will be responsible for regulating the activities of ISPs and ICHs and the Attorney-General will encourage the development of uniform state and territory offence provisions complementing the Commonwealth legislation, including section 85ZE of the Crimes Act, that create offences for the publication and transmission of prohibited material by users and content creators. The government will establish a review of the legislation in three years.
The use of online services is growing rapidly in Australia. There are now over 650 online service providers providing access to the Internet and other online services. The ABS estimates that more than 3.6 million Australians have accessed the Internet at some time. It is clear that the information accessed through this medium is increasingly influential in the community. Concerns have been expressed, both within the community and at government level, about the nature of the material that may be accessed by means of online services, specifically in relation to 
 perceived ease of access to material that is either illegal, pornographic or unsuitable for children.
The bill amends the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to provide for the regulation of ISPs and ICHs. Schedule 2 to the bill makes a consequential amendment to the Crimes Act. It will introduce a regulatory framework for ISPs and ICHs and forms part of a two-tiered approach to online content regulation in which it is anticipated that the states and territories will enact complementary legislation creating offences for the publication and transmission of objectionable material by end users. This regulatory framework will be complemented by non-legislative initiatives directed towards educating and advising the public about the management of Internet content.
For the Commonwealth's part in the national regulatory framework, the bill will ensure that ISPs and ICHs are not held liable for content of which they are not aware. Prohibited content that will trigger action by the ABA is defined in the bill on the basis of current National Classification Board guidelines for film, as material refused classification and rated X, and material rated R that is not protected by adult verification procedures.
The bill provides for a classification procedure for Internet content that is separate to that applying to conventional media in the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995. This is on the basis that the classification act may not encompass all forms of Internet content. The Classification Board will, however, be required to classify Internet content subject to complaint in a way that corresponds to the way in which a film would be classified under the classification act, that is, in relation to the classification criteria that apply in relation to RC, X and R rated classifications.
Internet content is defined as information that is stored and that is accessible to the public. Restricted access systems such as intranets and private communications such as ordinary email are excluded. Ephemeral content, such as chat rooms and real-time services such as streaming video and audio, are also excluded, except to the extent that 
 they are stored or archived, given that it would not be possible to classify `live' material. However, this content will continue to be subject to section 85ZE of the Crimes Act that provides for an offence for the knowing or reckless use of a carriage service in a manner that would cause offence to a reasonable adult in all the circumstances. The bill amends the Crimes Act to put its application in this regard beyond doubt.
The cornerstone of the regulatory framework is the complaints mechanism in part 4 of the bill. This will allow the ABA to take timely action to investigate complaints from the public and notify ISPs to prevent access to prohibited content. The bill provides that complaints can be made by Australian residents about prohibited content carried or hosted by ISPs and ICHs and breaches of industry codes, industry standards and online provider rules, directly to the ABA. A process for direct complaints to the ABA recognises that material subject to a complaint will not generally be originated by the ISP or ICH and that it would be unreasonable to expect them to adjudicate complaints about material for which they are not responsible or make judgments about whether particular material is prohibited. It would provide certainty for the industry, in that their responsibilities in relation to complaints will be limited to complying with ABA notices to prevent access to content.
Complaints will not be able to be made about something that occurs before 1 January 2000. This is intended to afford ISPs and ICHs the opportunity to put arrangements in place to enable them to avoid contravening the regulatory regime proposed in the bill and to enable the ABA to ensure that it is in a position to deal with complaints. If in the course of an investigation the ABA is satisfied that Internet content hosted in Australia is prohibited content, the ABA will be required to give the relevant ICH a written notice directing the host not to host the prohibited content. This notice is called a final take-down notice and is intended to have ongoing effect.
The ABA's decision will be based on a classification of the Classification Board. If 
 the ABA is satisfied that, if the Internet content were to be classified by the Classification Board, there is a substantial likelihood that the Internet content would be classified RC or X, the ABA will be required to give the relevant Internet content host an interim take-down notice directing the host not to host the Internet content until the ABA notifies the host of the Classification Board's classification of the Internet content and requests the Classification Board to clarify the Internet content.
If an industry code or ABA standard deals with procedures which Internet service providers will follow in dealing with overseas hosted Internet content notified by the ABA, the ABA must also notify the content to the Internet service providers. As a transitional default provision, the bill provides that, if there is no code or standard dealing with procedures in relation to a notified overseas host content, the ABA must give each Internet service provider known to the ABA a written notice directing the provider to take all reasonable steps to prevent end users from accessing the content. In determining whether particular steps are reasonable for this purpose, the ABA will be required to have regard to whether particular steps are technically and commercially feasible and to the regulatory policy of the bill. Particularly, regulation should be in a manner that enables public interest considerations to be addressed in a way that does not impose unnecessary financial or administrative burdens on ISPs and ICHs.
The government does not propose to mandate any particular technological solutions to blocking overseas sourced material. ISPs will be exempted from access prevention notices in relation to prohibited overseas hosted materials where an effective alternative arrangement is in place to prevent access by particular end users. Such arrangements might include services providing access for a cache of material intended as family friendly and secure networks operated on behalf of schools. These arrangements will need to be specified in the approved industry code or ABA standard or otherwise approved by the ABA. 
Within this overarching complaints mechanism, to deal directly with prohibited content the bill takes a co-regulatory approach in which three interdependent levels of regulation apply. The government considers that this approach will best utilise industry expertise and the development of workable and practical codes of practice with which compliance is more likely, while ensuring that there is a legal framework to deal with any irresponsible industry behaviour. Therefore, the first level of regulation is self-regulatory, in which the industry will have the opportunity to develop its own procedures and codes of practice that are responsive to community concerns and that assist members of the community to manage their use and their children's use of the Internet.
At a second level, the ABA will be able to intervene by directing compliance with industry codes or, if necessary, determining standards in relation to matters that would be dealt with where codes of practice are not developed by the industry or are deficient or fail. At the third level, generic service provider rules will apply to the whole industry and will underpin compliance and enforcement of the regulatory framework, including the complaints mechanism.
In relation to industry codes of practice, ISPs and ICHs will each be expected to develop a single code dealing with matters specified in clause 60. The code specifically excludes matters that are covered by codes of practice developed under other relevant legislation, such as the Telecommunications Act. However, there is no impediment to these other matters being dealt with in a single document, as long as the document makes clear which module deals with the requirements of specified legislation and the regulatory body which has registered that module.
The bill intends that the next level of regulation—ABA standards—will come into play where an industry code is not in place, is deficient, has partially or wholly failed, or where the ABA has requested an industry body to develop a code and it has failed to do so. Standards must relate to the same criteria as specified in the bill for codes of practice. 
 The intention is that an industry section has had an appropriate opportunity to develop its own practices in this regard through the development of a code before regulatory intervention by the ABA. Standards will be disallowable instruments, and the minister will be able to give the ABA directions as to the exercise of its standard making powers.
While the bill will commence upon royal assent, as a transitional measure the bill recognises that development of industry codes of practice—or ABA standards if a code is not developed by the industry—requires lead time. While some industry groups are well advanced in code development, these codes will need substantial modification to meet the requirements of the bill. This is particularly the case in relation to the requirement that a code be developed for procedures to be followed for notified overseas hosted content. It is therefore proposed to treat codes of procedures for overseas hosted content separately.
The bill requires the ABA to make reasonable efforts to ensure that either an industry code is registered by 1 January 2000 or, if a code is not registered, an ABA standard is in place by 31 March 2000. The later date for possible determination of an ABA standard is intended to reflect the co-regulatory intent of the bill in which industry is given the opportunity to develop its own procedures before any regulatory intervention by the ABA.
At the final level of regulation in the framework, the bill sets out the online service provider rules applying to all ISPs and ICHs. These will require compliance with ABA notices and directions. The ABA will be able to make additional service provider rules, but only in relation to a matter specified by regulation.
The bill includes a range of enforcement mechanisms and sanctions that are intended to allow flexibility in dealing with breaches, depending on the seriousness of the circumstances. Codes of practice developed by the industry can be expected to include compliance mechanisms, such as the withdrawal of industry association rights or privileges, and compliance incentives, such as the right to display compliance symbols administered by 
 the relevant oversighting industry body. Such mechanisms will need to be approved by the ABA through the code registration process. At the second level, in relation to breaches of codes, standards and rules, the ABA will be able to give formal warnings to indicate its concerns before taking other action. This might be appropriate where a breach, for example, was inadvertent or there were other extenuating circumstances.
At the next level the ABA will be able to take intermediate action—for example, directing an ISP or ICH to comply with the code of practice. Failure to comply with this or failure to comply with a take-down notice arising from an ABA investigation could lead to more serious sanctions. Contravention of online service provider rules which require ISPs and ICHs to comply with ABA notices and directions will be a criminal offence, and a continuing offence for each day the contravention continues with penalties of $5,500 for an individual and $27,500 for a corporation. In cases of serious, flagrant or recurring breaches of online service provider rules, the ABA will be able to apply to the Federal Court for an order that an ISP cease providing a service or an ICH cease hosting content. This is intended as an extreme, last resort measure which, it could be expected, would be rarely if ever required.
Proposed Internet specific state and territory legislation will apply with ISPs and ICHs only to the extent that they act as content creators. Clause 91 will give effect to this principle. The minister will also have the power to exempt a state or territory law from the operation of this provision and to declare that a specified state or territory law has no effect to the extent to which the law has an effect on an ISP or an ICH. This is intended to allow the finetuning of the limitation of ISP and ICH liability under state and territory laws. However, the bill also ensures that, other than in respect to this limitation in relation to ICHs and ISPs, state and territory laws such as laws of general application, like crimes and censorship legislation operate concurrently with the bill. The amendment of the Commonwealth Crimes Act in schedule 2 of the bill also makes it clear that this is not 
 intended to limit or exclude the concurrent operation of any law of any state or territory.
The government acknowledges that the unique characteristics and rapidly changing nature of the Internet presents specific difficulties in regulation of Internet content. It recognises that there are technical difficulties with blocking all illegal and offensive material that is hosted overseas but considers that, where it is technically feasible and cost effective to block material, this should be done. It is not acceptable to make no attempt at all on the basis that it may be difficult. Nor is it acceptable that community standards applicable to conventional media do not apply to the Internet. What is illegal or controlled offline should be illegal or controlled online.
Recognising these difficulties, the government approach does not rely on regulation alone. The government, along with the community advisory body and its hotline service will be encouraging parents and educators to become better aware of means and tools to manage use of online services by minors. It will also encourage the development of content labelling by Australian content creators and the development of labelling standards to encourage service providers to offer a choice for consumers to subscribe to services that allow access to a cache of permitted material only or services that are filtered by the service provider on the best efforts available. The government will also actively pursue collaborative arrangements internationally in relation to online content codes of practice and online labelling of content. The ABA and the community advisory body will also be encouraged to develop information sharing and other collaborative arrangements with their equivalent bodies overseas.
As part of this multifaceted approach, the bill will ensure that there are regulatory means to assist with the control of Internet content that is illegal or harmful to children. It does not attempt to place primary onus on ISPs or ICHs who are not responsible for content. It gives them certainty in relation to action to be taken when made aware of prohibited content and encourages the industry to develop its own procedures, responsive to the community.
The government is confident that the bill and its overall approach to assist individuals to manage their own and their children's use of the Internet strikes the right balance between ensuring industry development is not stifled by overzealous laws or inconsistent or unpredictable regimes which could result in Australia's economic marginalisation while also responding to the needs and interests of the community. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.",REPS,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (ONLINE SERVICES) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Evans, Martyn, MP",ALP,1999-06-21,"—I am not leading for the opposition in this matter; my colleague the member for Perth and shadow minister for communications will do that at a later stage in the debate. He will, of course, more formally set out the opposition's response to the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Bill 1999 . However, it is my intention at the conclusion of my remarks to move on his behalf the second reading amendment which has been circulated to the House.
I think it is important initially to look at what lies behind this bill. The community would be entitled to be very cynical indeed and very suspicious of the government's motives and timing in this legislation.
—Why don't you oppose it?
—The honourable member will have to restrain himself and await the outcome of this debate to see what will occur in relation to the opposition's action on this. Ultimately, we opposed the bill in the Senate where the government refused to accept our very reasoned and reasonable amendments in this matter. I am sure the honourable member for Perth, in his capacity as the shadow minister for communications, will set out much more clearly than I can the opposition's response to the government's political motives in this bill. However, when one looks at the timing and the urgency with which the government has pursued this matter, one would, as I say, be entitled to be quite cynical about the way in which it has done so.
This is an issue which the government discovered very suddenly—just at that crucial moment when it sought additional votes in the 
 Senate for other legislation, for example, in relation to the sale of Telstra. One would be entitled to assume that there was some link between these items and that it was not entirely coincidental that the government was keen to rush through legislation to impose a censorship regime on the Internet at the very moment it wanted the vote of a certain Tasmanian senator.
Far be it from me to be that cynical. The reality is that there is a reasonable proposition behind this legislation. It is not unreasonable to say—the opposition does not say it is unreasonable—that we should place some roadblocks in the way of children accessing unacceptable content on the Internet. It is a perfectly reasonable objective. To complain about the way that the government has handled itself in relation to this bill is not to suggest that we want to see children accessing unacceptable material on the Internet. That is not the case. It would be wrong to characterise perfectly reasonable opposition to some of this bill's terms and provisions, the cynical way in which the government has promoted it and the timing of this legislation as anything other than just that.
The opposition is certainly aware of the need to review content on the Internet. It is aware of the need to ensure that illegal and unacceptable content by community standards is not too readily placed in the sight of children in this community. We all understand the need for that. The government has no monopoly on concern for young people. Indeed, it is quite improper of it to suggest that that is the case or to characterise opposition to this legislation as in any way condoning child pornography or pornography generally or, indeed, promoting such adverse community standards.
However, it is quite wrong of the government to suggest that in some way this legislation will seek to address those kinds of concerns. The government comes in here and admits at the conclusion of the parliamentary secretary's speech that this is only an effort on its part and that it is only trying to do something. In fact, one could paraphrase what he said as, `The government is keen to be seen to be trying.'
—No. You are putting words in our mouths.
—I said that one could paraphrase his remarks. I did not say that they were his actual words.
—And they're not accurate.
—They are very accurate. In the concluding remarks of the parliamentary secretary's introductory speech, he quite clearly says, `The government says that just because it is almost impossible to achieve our objectives does not mean we should not try.' In other words, he was saying, `We want to be seen to be doing something about this not only in the community but also in the Senate'. This was particularly so a few weeks ago, when it really mattered. For that purpose, the government rushed this legislation in. It was hastily drafted. It was forced through a Senate committee process with unseemly haste. It was equally forced through the Senate with unseemly haste because the government knows that on 1 July, in all probability, the numbers in relation to this matter will change somewhat. Indeed, the government itself will probably be a lot less interested in this legislation after 1 July than it was before 30 June.
The reality is that the Internet is a very new technology. One should look at new technology to see what concerns there are about it, what areas of criminal activity might exist on it and what things governments might necessarily have to do to regulate that content. It is not something we want to do. Naturally, information is out there. Members of the public are entitled to participate in what is perhaps the world's greatest library in history and to do so freely and as they choose.
But sometimes regulation is necessary. It is not inappropriate that the government should have reviewed the position to see what is occurring on the Internet. As I say, it is very new technology, but it is technology that is expanding at an unprecedented rate. It is worth reviewing the extent to which technology has penetrated the community in some of the earlier important technologies, such as radio and television.
It took 38 years for radio to reach 50 million users. It took 13 years for television to reach 50 million users, 10 years for cable television and only five years for the Internet. In that time, the population has grown, but not by that much. You can see by comparison that radio took 38 years to reach 50 million users while the Internet took five years to reach 50 million users. Obviously, there is an unprecedented growth in that technology and an unprecedented explosion in both the content available and the number of users.
Indeed, Internet traffic is doubling roughly every 100 days, which means that the growth rate is something like 700 per cent in annual terms. We had well over 100 million users of the Internet in 1997, which had grown from three million in 1993. Indeed, I personally remember the days before the World Wide Web browser came into effect, when one was forced to use the Internet just as an email communication tool. That was not so many years ago. Some eight or nine years ago, the whole graphical user interface of the Internet did not exist. It has exploded in the last decade in a way which the government, I suspect, is only now starting to come to grips with.
The reality is that Internet commerce—that other very vital and growing part of the Internet—is projected by the OECD to reach something like a trillion dollars in revenue by the early part of the next century. That is very massive growth indeed, and Australia is very much part of it. The three countries with the very highest number of Internet users per 1,000 people are Finway, Norway and Iceland. One might suspect that it has something to do with the climate or the fact that they want something to do on long, dark winter nights. They have in the order of 240 users per 1,000 people.
Next in line at No. 4 is the United States, with 203 users per 1,000 persons. Australia comes in next. It is No. 5 in the world, with 178 users per 1,000 people. That was roughly one-fifth of the community in 1999. When looking at the exponential growth rate of the Internet, that number will obviously expand very quickly. One can see that early in the next century a majority of families will have 
 some connection with the Internet. Certainly they do at school now. Many people now do in the office or at work. Increasingly, our homes are wired for the Internet.
Obviously, in that context, we need to look very closely at the kinds of issues taking place on the Internet that might need regulation. Pornography is only one of them. Online gambling is a very serious issue. Recent reports in the United States have indicated that that community is seeking to take steps to regulate online gambling. Australia is at the forefront of online gambling. With revenue reaching a trillion dollars in e-commerce early in the next century, obviously fraud over the Internet is going to be a very serious issue.
The government has rushed into this parliament legislation relating to pornography and the classification of material on the Internet. However, where is the equally important legislation—in fact, it is far more important—on electronic commerce? The government can see fit to rush through legislation on the issue of classification on the Internet and what pictures people can see on the Internet. However, where is the legislation in relation to commerce and consumer protection from fraud? Where is this government's consideration of gambling on the Internet? They are very substantial issues which the government has not yet found time to grapple with in any serious way.
The government is acting contrary to some means that would protect consumers on the Internet. Its reluctance to allow the public to use strong encryption, for example, prevents the accessibility of digital signatures, the verification of identity, the protection of privacy and the protection of commercial data and financial transactions on the Internet. This government does not encourage the use of encryption. Indeed, I think many of its legislative decisions have been against it. The government has looked to see what it can regulate on the Internet, and it has been driven entirely by its need to placate the interests of some senators before 30 June. It has not taken a rational view about what the important issues on the Internet are, what needs to be regulated, what it should do first 
 and how it should address community priorities in that respect.
This technology is very much global technology. As the parliamentary secretary admitted, very much of the content on the Internet, including the objectionable content, is indeed not in Australia. As we look at the tens of millions of host sites on the Internet—and early in the next century there will obviously be hundreds of millions of sites—I will defy the Australian Broadcasting Authority to sit down and comb through those sites. Unless individuals are going to sit there and do nothing but search for objectionable material on the Internet—in other words, look for the very things they think ought not to be there—no-one is even going to have any practical proposition of addressing that content. The number of sites on the Internet, the ability with which they can be moved from country to country, the ability with which the address of sites can be changed, the ability to change the Internet host merely with the click of the `Enter' button on your keyboard are such that it is absurd to realistically imagine that you are going to be able to police this content.
Much of the highly objectionable content is, of course, already very much illegal and strongly sanctioned in our communities. There are very strong laws against the exploitation of children for sexual purposes. Those laws should be rigorously enforced and the strongest possible criminal sanctions imposed against those who would seek to use children in such a fashion. For example, the community will demand that the government protect their standards in that respect but, of course, if that material is on the Internet, it can be hidden in many ways. It can be hidden in news groups, for example.
There are something like 25,000 to 30,000 news groups which are continually broadcast around the world. They last on the Internet for 24 to 48 hours, depending on the host, although some sites archive them for a much longer period. The reality is that they move from computer to computer. They are very transitory in nature, and thousands of such messages are exchanged every day. Indeed, on a given Internet archive for news groups, you might find half a million to a million 
 messages archived after only a few weeks of continuous operation. No-one is going to be able to filter that kind of content. It is utterly impractical.
If you find an objectionable site and someone reports it to the ABA, by the time the ABA actually looks at it and finds that site, the host could well have been changed. When someone finds that that host site is taken down, it is a trivial matter to move that to a free Internet server in the United States, where First Amendment rights protect the content of that site; yet it is just as easily accessed from Australia. No-one would even know where that content is residing in the world. Because the United States offers so much Internet content and so many resources in this regard, because the United States has that First Amendment freedom, naturally that will become the prevailing global standard, no matter how much we might try to pretend otherwise.
Where does this leave the government's bill? Obviously in chaos. The government is seeking to make a point and to do nothing more than that. This is not a realistic or a real attempt to actually address the evil which the government refers to. The reality is that, if we wanted to do that, we would have to explore a number of other options. The fact that the government pretends to the community and to the parents of Australia that it has actually done something about this content is the real crime in this bill. Parents who are not properly informed about this issue may well now think that there will be legislation in place to make the Internet safe for 10-year-olds. That is not going to be the case because almost all of this content is inaccessible to the government's regulation and, indeed, inaccessible to almost anyone's regulation.
Therefore, we have to look at what makes the Internet different. In the past, we have regulated print content, we have regulated newspapers, we have regulated the cinema, we have regulated magazines and we have regulated print publications such as Playboy and the like with various degrees of success. They are centralised publications; they are controlled centrally. There are very strong barriers to entry into the industry. The parlia 
 ment can regulate the content of the print media and cinemas because those things have very limited points of distribution. They are controlled by large corporations, and it is very easy to regulate the limited number of outlets.
By contrast, the Internet turns this whole distribution paradigm on its head. The Internet allows everyone to be a publisher; the Internet allows everyone to produce their own films; the Internet allows everyone to put photographic content and text content up on the Internet. The freedom of the press used to belong to those who owned the presses. The reality is that we are now all publishers, and that is what the government has failed to recognise in this legislation. The Internet is a totally different paradigm of distributed computing power, of distributed intelligence, of distributed technology. It empowers individuals in a way that no prior publishing technology has. That is the difference which this bill completely fails to comprehend; it is a difference which I suspect this government completely fails to comprehend. It is what makes this bill largely unworkable, and it is why the opposition will be addressing a number of amendments to it.
The real tragedy of this is that the government seeks to pretend to the parents of Australia and to the Australian community that it has actually done something about content on the Internet. What it should have done, of course, is to look at ways of empowering parents, families and schools to use this technology in a sensible and responsible way, educating parents as to the nature of the content that might well be found on the Internet and providing them with software tools—which are indeed now readily available for installation on home, school and office computers—to block access to sites from the impetus of the computer itself. In other words, it should follow the technology of the Internet. The Internet is distributed technology. Therefore, any attempt to block content must be done on a distributed basis. You cannot tackle this in a centralised fashion as we have done with all these previous technologies like the cinema and print.
If you were to attack this from the bottom up, if you were to attack this from the per 
 spective of empowering families, empowering parents and allowing them to regulate content from their computer out rather than the Internet service provider down, you might indeed have some chance of achieving your objective. You would also achieve a community which would be much more educated about the value of the Internet, about the dangers of the Internet, and you would allow parents to make decisions for themselves about what is appropriate in their family situation.
—We are doing that as well.
—But you are failing in that regard because you are principally focusing on a centralised control regime which I would have thought a government led by market forces would have seen the folly of. The minister is treating this industry as if it were a traditional print or cinema industry. The reality is, Minister, that we have moved on from there, and it is time that you moved—
—You have no solution.
—The minister has just spent the last five minutes listening to my solution to this. The reality is that his solution does not work at all. He admits that it is merely for effect. It is just a chimera; it is out there to tell people that the government is attempting to do something. The government wants to be seen to be trying. Well, it is very trying, and it is failing.
The problem is that the government is denying empowerment to parents. In its enthusiasm to pass some centralised regulatory control which ultimately will not be effective, the government is missing the opportunity to empower parents and work with the community to address this problem at the household level where some degree of control might well be effective and where the reasonable objectives that the opposition shares with the government and the community in this area could possibly be brought into effect. That is the only way, historically and into the future, we will be able to make this technology more reasonable and accessible to children—and, indeed, safe for them to use as the world's greatest library, as it should be.
With that, I would like formally to move the second reading amendment which has been circulated in the name of the opposition, and I would place on record our intent to contribute even further in this debate. I move:
That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""the House:
(1)	 expresses its concern that:
	 (a)	 the legislation is being dealt with in indecent haste and with inadequate consideration;
	 (b)	 the Government's claim that the legislation will `solve the problem' of unacceptable content is not supported by the reality that the vast bulk of internet content is generated outside Australia;
	 (c)	 the proposals, including the idea of mandatory internet service provider filters, are unworkable and easily by-passed;
	 (d)	 the application of the narrowcasting classification regime to the regulation of internet content has not been thoroughly analysed and may well require revisiting in the future, in view of rapidly changing and converging technology; and
	 (e)	 the legislation does not include a sunset clause, or provision for review, given the speed of technological change in this area; and
(2)	 recommends that:
	 (a)	 efforts should be made by the Government to pursue international agreements on the regulation of internet content; and
	 (b)	 substantially more emphasis should be placed on end-user empowerment through information and education campaigns for parents, schools and guardians about the use of the internet and of end-user filter devices"".
—Is the amendment seconded?
—I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.",REPS,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (ONLINE SERVICES) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Billson, Bruce, MP",LP,1999-06-21,"—I listened with interest to what the member for Bonython had to say, and what struck me most about his contribution was how little he had to say about the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Bill 1999  now before the House. He gave us the potted history of the technology's development over the last 10 years and told us how we should 
 be relying on other acts—and I assume he meant the Crimes Act remedies. Having said that one act will not work, Labor believes that another act might. It just underlines the computer industry saying of `garbage in, garbage out'.
I suspect that the member for Bonython might do well to have a read of what actually is in the government's proposal. He shared with us a number of glib and comforting comments as he walked that very fine line of looking unhappy with what the government is doing but not daring to oppose it, holding up some straw ideal and some counterfeit logic as a substitute for action on this subject. He would do well to find that in this package the government has embraced a number of the useful complementary steps he alluded to in his contribution—and perhaps by the time we do hear what the opposition has to say its members may realise that fact by actually looking at the content of the bill. That would be a very good start, I suspect.
I am probably one of the less censorial type characters in this place. When suggestions about `censoring content' and things like that come before me, I take a very sceptical view. It is not easy to offend me, frankly, and I suppose in public life that is something that is quite comforting.
Opposition members interjecting—
—It is good that my colleagues over there agree. But I also believe in the capacity of competent adults to choose between right and wrong and to make choices about what sort of entertainment/information service they might be interested in. Having said that, though, on the Internet are large scale examples of what can only be described as `cyber-septic'. It is not those competent adults who cannot make the choices that I think many of us in this place grant to our citizens—it is not those people who are our main concern—it is people who are not in a position to make those sorts of judgments and the impact that some of this cyber-septic has on them.
I will give an example. My little boy is 18 months old, and I hope one day he will be as interested in technology as I was in my former life in IT before coming to this place. 
 He likes animals. He may one day think, `Gee, I've heard about giraffes, I've never been to Africa, but I wonder what one looks like.' He might go to AltaVista or any other search engine one could think of and type in `animal pictures'. As his father, I would be happy for him to have a look at some of the work there, such as wild animal pictures, our world's endangered species, or other `critters', as they are described. We have the Pico Ranch Trophy Animal Place, where they can show us photos of animals. We even have animal pictures from the Four-Wheel Drive Hire Service, an Australian picture gallery. But, even when going through an innocuous inquiry like that, you start finding sites such as `Sex with animal pictures'. I will not go through the way they market the product, the content, to be picked up by an inquiring mind. I will not go through how they present this part of the `wonderful world information library' that the member for Bonython talked about. That is an innocuous inquiry. That is inadvertent exposure to something most reasonable people would find absolutely offensive. But he might then go to the next step—
Mr Martyn Evans interjecting—
—And it is great that you have plenty to say about this because you said nothing in your contribution, Member for Bonython. So, nice line, you tried very hard to make it sound as though you were concerned. But my son might go on with his search. He might get to school years and type in any search engine you might like `school fun'. I will not go through the examples of what is in there but—considering the baloney that the member for Bonython went on with about this enormously useful tool, this great library being delivered to 20 per cent of households across our country—with an innocuous inquiry like that I would hate to tell you of the sites it dreams up.
We will go on a bit further. Maybe Britney Spears is a big celebrity by this time. My son might think, `Well, I wonder what Britney Spears is about; I'll see if I can find a story about her career in teen magazines.' You would have to go through page after page to find anything under that search engine refer 
 ence that is anything other than smut and pornography.
Those opposite seem to want to come in here, give a potted history of the technology and ignore the reality out there of what sort of content is available in response to innocuous inquiries. You could go and look for an Offspring poster under `teen stars'. Again, it is a litany of filth and cyber-septic that people are up against. You could go through any of these otherwise innocuous search engines in the way I have outlined and you would understand what I have put to you.

"Crosio, Janice, MP",ALP,1999-06-21,"—When I first heard last week that the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources had issued a press release on behalf of himself and the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business to announce their decision to jointly consider how to guarantee workers' entitlements, I have to admit I was more than a little cynical. But I did harbour just a glimmer of hope that the minister's release would give an indication that the government was on the threshold of some level of concrete action over this matter—not just initiating another round of talks, not just beating-up what little it has done over the previous year into something that it could possibly call progress.
Having read the minister's release and taken on board its contents, even that hope has been completely dashed. The minister for industry's press release is an admission of failure. It is an admission that this government has wasted over 12 valuable months when it could have been making real gains towards protecting the entitlements of Australia's workers. The minister for industry said in his statement that discussions `at a ministerial level directly with business organisations are needed' with regard 
 to the question of protecting workers' entitlements.
But, wait a minute, does this not sound strangely familiar? The minister for workplace relations said in a press release on 6 April last year, when he announced that the government would look into workers' entitlements:
The government will consult the business community on the issue.
Then, in answer to one of my questions on notice, received from the minister in February this year, he listed both the Business Council of Australia and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry—the two peak bodies for large and small businesses in Australia—as two of the organisations his office had consulted with. He said he also discussed the issue with the Insurance Council of Australia, the Law Council of Australia and the ACTU. Yet here we are, another year later, and the minister for industry is saying exactly the same thing—same press release, just reworded.
So what has the minister for workplace relations been doing for 12 months? What kinds of discussions did the minister for workplace relations have with the Business Council of Australia and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry? What use were they? Apparently they were of no use whatsoever, if the minister for industry is going to have to hold his hand and start all over again.
The Prime Minister has led us to believe that his government was making headway in solving this problem, but it looks like we have spent the last 12 months treading water and we are back at square one. The Prime Minister also gets up in question time today and talks about what the minister for workplace relations has done through the Labour Ministers Council to address the protection of workers' entitlements. The Prime Minister either is living in the dark or has an inflated opinion of the minister for workplace relations because the LMC's discussions have been, to be frank, almost a complete waste of time. At its last meeting in May, total discussion of this subject amounted to a meagre five lines in the minutes.
As for the Treasurer, neither of the two suggested changes to the Corporations Law recently put forward by him at the Ministerial Council for Corporations that will do anything to protect the entitlements of workers in the event of employer insolvency. They may go some way to dissuading employers from restructuring their company and moving their assets to avoid paying workers their entitlements, but they will do nothing to get workers back their entitlements when company insolvency strikes.
As for the Prime Minister's repeated use of the Cobar mine settlement and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission's role in that dispute as an example of how the system does not need fixing, that argument needs debunking once and for all. I am sorry, Mr Speaker, that you called me to order today when the Prime Minister was elaborating on that answer to the question. The only reason that the Australian Securities Commission was able to chase Ashanti and make sure that it met the financial obligations of its junior company, Cobar Mines Pty Ltd, is that Ashanti sent Cobar mines a `letter of comfort' saying that it would cover its debts. That is what the union was able to get a hold of. Without such a letter, the Cobar miners would have had no recourse to assistance and no recourse to getting their money back and ASIC would have looked on helplessly.
Take a look at what has happened to the workers from the Woodlawn mine near Goulburn. The Prime Minister instructed the Securities Commission to look into the loss of their entitlements as well, and so far they have received absolutely nothing. The commission has been powerless. Over 700 miners and their families are expected to converge on Canberra tomorrow. They will demand answers from this government as to what it intends to do to guarantee workers' entitlements.
So far what the government has done does not amount to a pile of beans. The miners and their families will not be put off by weak homilies, as were given by the Prime Minister in question time today. They will not be fobbed off by the minister for industry and the minister for workplace relations when they 
 say they are going to look into it. The government said it was going to look into this problem 12 months ago and yet ordinary workers like the Oakdale miners are still being robbed of their legal entitlements. These people demand real answers. They need real assistance.
Alan Jones, of all people, asked the Prime Minister last week how many more companies would have to go under, leaving their employees in the lurch, before someone tells them that they cannot do this. The Prime Minister answered, `I can't answer that.' Prime Minister, you have to answer that. It is your job.

"Hoare, Kelly, MP",ALP,1999-06-21,"—I am pleased to take one of the final opportunities to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1999-2000 . The 1999 budget, brought down on 11 May, was Treasurer Costello's fourth budget. This is a budget which is extreme in its conservatism. It is brimming with the conservative ideology of those who sit on the government benches. This is a budget which, like its predecessors, reflects this government's pursuit of the free market agenda. This is a budget which is reliant on the highly improbable future full sale of Telstra to preserve its bottom line.
The first issue I will address tonight is that of the sale of Telstra—part of this government's ideological obsession with the sale of government assets and its relentless pursuit of economic rationalism. I take this opportunity to express my concern about the way in which and the extent to which governments around the world, including this coalition government, have embraced the notion of economic rationalism and have instituted the process of privatising government assets.
I believe that economic rationalism is better described as economic fundamentalism, because there is often very little about it that is rational. Economics is supposed to be a social science, but to the fundamentalists it has become purely a study based on market processes. Whilst I do not totally oppose economic efficiency, I firmly believe that its pursuit must be tempered by recognition that it will not necessarily provide the best social outcomes or the outcomes which are in the best national interest.
For example, in the region in which my electorate is located, market forces and private managerial decisions have caused coalmines to be abandoned before the coal reserves have been exhausted. In many cases the coal that remains is lost forever. That may be the best decision for the bottom line of the mining companies, but failing to secure a finite national resource is criminal from Australia's point of view.
In conjunction with lost revenue for Australia, the families of the miners who lose their jobs as a result of these managerial decisions do not even have the security of the knowledge that they will receive their just entitlements. This government has just appropriated $350 million for a stevedoring fund to pay out those unfortunate workers who bore the brunt of the failed Reith-Corrigan campaign to bust the MUA. Now that workers in the coalmining industry find themselves without jobs and robbed of their benefits following the closure of their mine, this government seems unwilling to establish a similar fund for these workers. If it does not, the workers of this country may have the perception that the stevedoring levy fund was established to try to distance Reith from the stench of that waterfront dispute.
Failing to secure finite national resources is a crime. Failing to secure workers' just entitlements is a crime. If Telstra is fully sold by this government, it will fail to secure quality, 
 efficient and accessible communications resources for all Australians, and that will also be a national crime.
This coalition government only in the past week has secured Senator Harradine's support for a further 16 per cent sale of Telstra by rolling out the pork barrel in the senator's home state of Tasmania. The bribes offered to Senator Harradine by the Prime Minister include $40 million earmarked to develop Tasmania as what the government has dubbed `an intelligent island', although I fail to see how this announcement by the Prime Minister can be explained effectively to Tasmanians by Senator Harradine or indeed by any of my five Labor colleagues from Tasmania, given that it seems to call into question the current perception of Tasmania and its people held by this government.
While the government is talking about developing and promoting a clever state, we must really question what has happened to the development of the clever country. The Prime Minister tried to claim that this is an education budget. However, it includes no extra funding at all for further or tertiary education for young Australians. What this budget does do in the area of education is to provide an extra $210 a year to every child in a private school, but it provides less than $10 a year to the 70 per cent of children in government schools.
While Dr Kemp and his government pursue the concept of so-called choice in the free market environment of competition, the wealthiest schools providing education to children from affluent families increase their government revenue base while Australian children in public schools enjoy a greatly diminished education equity. This point was emphasised very eloquently and forcefully by Sharan Burrow, the Federal President of the Australian Education Union. While condemning the disparity between the budget funds for private and public schools, she said:
The 30 per cent of children in private schools get three quarters of the budget increase while the 70 per cent of our children who depend on public schools get a mere one quarter. Private schools get the cake and the public schools get the crumbs.
Australia will never become a truly clever country while conservative governments continue to downsize the public education system from kindergarten through high schools, TAFEs and universities.
Over the past four budgets, the Howard government has shown its pure contempt and hostility towards the public education system. This budget does not even go close to filling the $2.7 billion education hole that John Howard dug in 1996. It is quite unacceptable to us in the Labor Party, to families who have children in the public school system and to those who work in that system that in 1996, the first year of this government, there was 54c in recurrent expenditure going to public schools for every dollar that went to a private school. This amount has been reduced to 42c in 1999, which equals a loss of $800 million to public education. And all of this after we have just celebrated the 150th anniversary of the first public education act in Australia.
The scorecard of this government in relation to public education includes, starting in 1996, a $350 million cut to public education and the deregulation of private schools. In 1997 we saw the equity programs abandoned. In 1998, despite increased numbers in public schools, the enrolment benchmark adjustment took effect and stole $11.9 million from public schools to pay for increased enrolments in private schools. And in 1999, as I have mentioned before, we see around $800 extra per child for private schools by the year 2003 and around only $100 
 extra per child for public school students, plus the enrolment benchmark adjustment takes a further $21 million from public schools and sends it off to the private education system.
Another area I would like to address tonight in speaking to this appropriation bill is that of health. This government has shamelessly embarked upon a process of enticing Australian families to opt out of the public health system and to opt for private health insurance. Two of the major implications of this disgraceful policy direction are: first, universal access to quality health care is being undermined; and, second, it places increased medical expenses on many families who are least able to afford them.
Over the past two years, Australians have been faced with a government which spends millions of dollars to prop up private health insurers at a time when waiting lists in public hospitals are months long. Last year, 1998, the cost of the government's failing private health insurance rebate was $1.5 billion. The government's own union of doctors, the AMA, forecast that this would increase to $2.25 billion per annum. At that time the government needed only to spend half a billion dollars and public hospital waiting lists would have been eliminated.
This budget continues to ignore the public hospital system. The Prime Minister and the minister for health continue to try to save their previous bad decisions in the search for a further resurrection of private health insurance. The current rescue package has been named the `Lifetime Health Cover', something which I understood all Australians should receive under Medicare. The `Lifetime Health Cover' is just another admission by the minister that his private health insurance rebate scheme is a debacle and a sham.
Any government with a social conscience should have the health appropriations focusing on public hospitals and public health. Private health insurance companies are large enough and wealthy enough not to need government support or government funding. Those families who choose to take out private health insurance can usually afford to do so without the necessity for Australian taxpayers to foot their bills. As for the AMA, the only union tolerated by this government, history has shown that its members are resourced well enough to be able to look after themselves and those of their ilk.
First we had the $1.5 billion windfall for the privately insured and now we have a scare campaign to blackmail Australian families into taking out private health insurance under the threat that unless they do so by 1 July 2000 they will be paying up to 70 per cent higher premiums for the rest of their lives. These threats have been aimed at those least affluent families who would never consider, or be able to afford, private health insurance in their lifetimes.
The position of the 1950s, which the Prime Minister embraces in most areas of social policy, continues to undermine the national government's responsibilities of accessibility, affordability and equity for all Australians. The Labor opposition espouses social reform policies which foster equity and fairness for all in the community. Those who recall the tremendous social reforms initiated during the Whitlam era will look on this budget with dismay and horror, for this budget represents a return to the pre-Whitlam days, to the dour, dank conservative rule of the 1950s.
At the 1972 election, Gough Whitlam became the first Labor Prime Minister for 23 years. Initially he and his deputy, Lance Barnard, and then his government, embarked upon an extensive, ambitious, almost revolutionary program of reform. Let me remind members of some of those reforms for which Whitlam will always be remembered. His government took over financial responsibility for tertiary education and abolished fees. His government introduced 
 welfare payments for single-parent families and homeless people. His government set up language programs for ethnic minorities, improved employment opportunities for women, and his government established Medibank.
Gough Whitlam changed the focus of government. Under Whitlam, government became more people focused, more involved in providing people with opportunity, choice and justice. The reforms he introduced have been taken for granted by Australians for decades and they have remained intact under successive Liberal and Labor governments. We now see this government systematically dismantling those reforms in its efforts to be economically rational. Let there be no mistake, economic rationalism is not people friendly.
I recently had the pleasure of joining with many others to pay tribute to Gough Whitlam at a dinner held in his honour in Sydney. The opportunity to reflect on the reforms Whitlam initiated was more than just an indulgent reminiscence; it was an opportunity to reaffirm what it is that we in the Labor Party believe in and continue to fight for. I look forward to participating in the budget preparation by a future Labor government which is both socially and morally responsible.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 1999-2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Rudd, Kevin, MP",ALP,1999-06-21,"—An appropriation debate should be a debate about the public priorities of the nation: our priorities for the economy in which we work, our priorities for the society in which we live, as well as our priorities for the international community of which we are an integral part. It should not, therefore, be simply a narrow exercise in fiscal policy, important as fiscal policy might be. It is a broader exercise in how we deploy the public resources of the nation and, as such, it is a reflection of a government's vision—and, yes, I have dared use the `v' word; it has been some years since using the `v' word has been fashionable in this place—but a vision for the nation, the type of nation we wish to be.
If there is a basic difference between the government's view of the budget and that of the alternative government, it is this: this government defines budget success in terms of what a government does not do; the alternative government defines budget success in terms of what government actually can do. This government defines budget success as decreasing the size of government, decreasing the role of government, a celebration of the doctrine of government in retreat. The alternative government defines budget success in terms of how we can harness the energies of government to build the nation, to build its physical infrastructure, to build its human infrastructure, to contribute to what the literature describes as national capacity building.
When it comes to a vision for the nation, this government proudly proclaims that it does not have one. If you think this is an extravagant, partisan claim, then I would draw members' attention to what can only be described as the stunned mullet expression on the face of the Treasurer of the Commonwealth, Mr Costello, when asked on ABC television on budget night what vision underpinned the government's budget strategy. He simply looked bemused at the nature of the question. He had no response to that overarching question, `What is your fiscal strategy serving in terms of an ultimate blueprint for the nation?'
By contrast, we on this side of politics do not apologise for the `vision thing' because we believe that, when framing the budget for the nation, it is not only valid but necessary to ask fundamental questions as to why and how we are raising and expending some $150 billion in Commonwealth revenues. We believe it is both valid and necessary to ask what impact the taxation architecture of a nation will have on individual and corporate incentive, and therefore the impact that that will in turn have on national economic efficiency and performance. We 
 believe it is valid and necessary to ask what the taxation architecture of the nation will deliver by way of revenues and whether those revenues will be sufficient to ensure that we protect the weak and provide equal opportunity to the strong. We believe it is valid and necessary to ask whether we are providing educational opportunity based on ability and not just background, whether we are caring for the sick, whether we are giving shelter to the homeless, whether we are offering aid to the destitute, be those destitute at home or abroad.
All these are valid and necessary questions because they go to the heart of the question of who we are as a people, not just as individuals; what values we hold as a people, not just as some collectivity of self-interest. They also ask the question of who we wish to become as a nation. Budgets are huge resources for governments to build nations with. Nations are not just built by individuals. They are built by individuals as well as the collective resources of individuals reflected in the energies and resources of government. To believe somehow that the allocation of the resources of government is some minor bagatelle, some irrelevancy, and that the ultimate burden simply depends on individual incentive, and individual initiative in the economy at large is a radical misreading of economic reality.
I would like to address briefly just three elements of this overall equation. First, in terms of this government's vision for the future of the nation, what is its taxation vision? Second, and briefly, what is its education vision? And, third, how does this government seek to reflect its vision for the nation's engagement with the region and the world?
Firstly, on tax: in designing the tax architecture of the nation, it is reasonable to ask what national objectives are to be served by the architecture of taxation which the Treasurer has articulated in the various tax bills currently before the parliament. It is reasonable to ask whether this tax proposal will increase economic growth. It is reasonable to ask whether, perforce of that, it will also increase total factor productivity in the overall efficiency of the economy. It is reasonable to ask whether this tax initiative will increase employment. It is reasonable to ask whether it will maintain price stability. It is reasonable to ask what impact this overall tax proposal will have on overall government revenues. It is reasonable to ask what impact it will have on the overall efficiency of the taxation collection system, just as it is reasonable to ask what impact it will have on the federation itself, fiscally and functionally. Finally, it is reasonable and critical to ask what impact this new tax architecture—this new taxation vision for the nation—will have on basic Australian fairness.
All these questions go to the heart of the sort of Australia that this government wishes to create. In the absence of a formally articulated vision, the tax policy or the tax proposal that we have before the nation at present is something like a vision by default. It is the vision that you have when you are not having an articulated vision.
Let us look at its constituent elements. What impact will this tax proposal that is core to the appropriations which are before us at the moment have on future growth in the Australian economy?	If you look at the collection of evidence before the nation, both before the Senate inquiry and in the public discussion beyond that inquiry, you will find that the impact on economic growth which will occur as a result of this package being implemented will at best be negligible and, on the basis of a substantial slice of the professional literature on this subject, it will be negative. The maximum positive projection contained in any of the literature on what additional increment will be added to national economic growth as a consequence of this package being implemented, which would not otherwise occur as a result of other factors out there in the economy, is 0.2 per cent per annum in the long term. The long term 
 is defined at the five- to seven-year point. That is a long time to wait for a small and marginal dividend indeed.
The second element I said we should touch on when looking at this vision for the nation as reflected by the tax proposal before us is: well, if it is not going to grow the economy hugely, what will it do for the efficiency of the economy? What will it do in terms of what the economists describe as the total factor productivity in the economy? This is a critical equation. It is basically a question about whether, by bringing in new price signals through the income taxation system in the country, combined with the impact of the consumption tax, people are going to allocate and use the economic resources at their disposal more efficiently than they have in the past.
If you turn to the professional literature, again we find that there is not a single shred of evidence, either in the publicly argued case by the government or in the evidence presented before the Senate inquiry on the GST or elsewhere in the public debate on this issue, which suggests that factor productivity in this economy will increase as a consequence of this package being introduced.
The third thing that I said we would touch on is: what will its impact be on employment? Here the impact will not be negligible; it will be decidedly negative. Consider again the evidence before the Senate inquiry—and the member for Fairfax just shakes his head in disbelief at this, but if he reflects on the constituency from which he comes, one which I am most acutely familiar with because I was born there, it is a constituency where in fact tourism is one of the primary employment generators. If there is a sector of the economy which will be torpedoed amidships by this tax proposal, it will be tourism. The projections before the Senate inquiry are that the national loss to tourism employment across the nation in both Queensland and the other states will be something in the range of 50,000 to 100,000 jobs over a several year period. If that is the definition of a positive dividend from a proposal of this order of magnitude, then the government's definition of `positive' frankly escapes anything contained in the Oxford Concise Dictionary.
We look at price stability, a further test of what vision is somehow encapsulated in this tax proposal before us. The heroic boffins of Treasury project that the price impact of this overall proposal will be maximally 1.9 per cent. No other credible economist—correction: no other economist—in the country accepts that proposition. The range of projections which are contained in the professional literature on this subject suggest that the price impact of this package once it flows through will be in the order of four to six per cent. If that is a useful contribution to price stability in the economy—and price stability, as the Governor of the Reserve Bank repeatedly reminds us, is critical to the future macroeconomic management of the Australian economy—then I do not think, again, that the government and the rest of the professional community are speaking the same language.
A fifth test of this government's taxation vision is what its impact will be on revenues. The underlying presupposition which the government has somehow managed to sell, to part of the community at least, is that the existing taxation system is broken in terms of its ability to deliver adequate future supplies of revenue to Commonwealth coffers to fund the future social requirements of the nation.
Once again, if you look through the tax package and the formal documentation attached to it, do we find any shred of evidence anywhere where the government says, `Stick to the existing raft of tax measures and you'll find that revenues fall in a heap in three years, five 
 years, seven years or nine years'? No. The evidence is not there at all. Why is it not there? It is not there because it is not true. The existing revenue system of the Commonwealth as demonstrated by the ballooning in government revenues in the last three years is perfectly adequate to deliver our future revenue requirements. In fact, if we look at the revenue impact of this new proposal before us, this new tax system for the nation will represent a further increment in government revenues. What you will find is that the Commonwealth coffers will in the future be even more flush because this consumption tax proposal is an absolute beaut when it comes to guaranteeing the delivery of revenues to the Commonwealth. The people who will be dancing in the streets—quite apart from the accounting industry of the nation which will, of course, provide services necessary to assist businesses comply with the most complex tax package which has been introduced since taxation measures were first introduced in the Babylonian Empire—are the Australian Taxation Office because it is a huge additional increment to the future revenue delivery to the Commonwealth. This additional revenue delivery is not necessary given the fact that the existing system not only is not broken on that count, but has not been proven or established to be broken in the debate to date.
I spoke also of the impact on the federation. ANTS mark 1—the first version of this taxation vision for the nation—in fact proposed that a system of arrangements between the Commonwealth and the states which could only result in the exacerbation of what is described as vertical fiscal imbalance, that is the greater reliance by the states on the Commonwealth for revenues as a proportion of the total revenues of the states and relative to the total outlay responsibilities of the states.
That was the old package. Now we have a new package as a consequence of the deal done with the Democrats. A deal which has been described by that great advocate of Labor Party causes, the Premier of Victoria, Mr Kennett, when he said that the current tax package as it affects the states is unacceptable and should be taken back to the drawing board. The bottom line is, if you look at the fiscal and functional architecture of the Australian federation, this does not do a single thing if the vision is to return to the states a capacity to raise revenues which are approximate in strength and size to the revenue responsibilities of the same states. In fact, it heads in precisely the reverse direction. If we aggregate the arguments, we find in fact that the package before us achieves very little by way of positive vision.
On fairness itself, we come to the kernel of the argument. If this tax package fails the test of economic growth, if it fails the test of adding to economic efficiency, if it fails to add to the employment of the nation, if it fails to ensure price stability, if it does nothing to add to the functionality of the federation and if it does nothing about and in fact heads in the reverse direction on questions of fairness, we might well ask, `Why are we doing it?' And that is where we come to the core of the argument. The often unstated reason we are doing this is that what we have here, in its essence, is the Robin Hood tax in reverse. This is a tax which redistributes the taxation burden of the nation away from the rich and towards the poor. It is a massive wealth redistribution tax. That is the core of the argument; that is the core of the logic which underpins this entire package; that is the core of the government's vision. It is a vision based, in the end, on what I can only describe as the worst forms of accentuated individual greed because it fails all the broader tests of economic efficiency and of overall economic benefit to the economy at large as well as any passing test of social justice.
When a vision for a nation says that `greater taxation rewards should be delivered to the rich'—and that is the summation and conclusion of that vision—and that vision is somehow a risk worth taking when measured against the other risks, I think it is a vision which the 
 nation does not need. What the government is saying about its vision for the nation is that, by embarking upon this enterprise to deliver greater taxation benefits to the richest in our community, it is at the same time worth risking future certainty in terms of the growth of the economy; it is worth putting at risk inflationary stability in the economy; it is worth putting at risk the unemployment situation within the country; it is worth placing in jeopardy that which remains of basic fairness in our society. It is worth putting all those things at risk, in the government's vision, simply in order to deliver this taxation windfall to those in our society and within our economy who least need it. Here I speak of those at the wealthiest end of the Australian taxation spectrum. If this is this government's vision as reflected in the guts of this taxation proposal—in the essence of its architecture—it is a poor and shrivelled vision indeed. It is one which is as economically irresponsible as it is socially unjust—and all in the cause of individual greed.
I said I would touch briefly on education and the region. When we look at education and what this government does through the budget for education, we see a higher education sector which has had $800 million ripped out of it. On one further measure, it is a sector which has had $2 billion ripped out of it, if you add to that the $1.2 billion which has been delivered to the sector through the increase in HECS charges. When we look at literacy and numeracy— that matter which the federal minister for education trumpets loudly each time he performs in the House of Representatives—and if you unpack the reality of all that, you have a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing, because the numbers underpinning it in fact suggest that very little by way of additional resources has been delivered to that sector at all. To do something serious and substantial about literacy and numeracy in the school system—and I speak from my experience of having worked for many years in a state government in this country—requires significant resources. The additional funds allocated separately and individually by the state Labor government in Queensland since 1995 on literacy and numeracy programs exceed by a country mile that which the federal education minister proclaims and boasts of as representing his concrete contribution to literacy and numeracy programs across the nation.
You cannot educate a nation on the cheap. You cannot equip the next generation of Australians with the skills that they need for the economy to perform efficiently and for them to obtain the benefits necessary for them and their families on the cheap. You cannot equip our work force with the skills for the next industrial revolution—the revolution in technology—on the cheap. These are essential investments in the nation's future, in the future efficiency of our economy as well as the equity of our society.
In conclusion, I draw attention in this appropriations debate to the question of the pattern and texture of our international and regional engagements. I simply say this: if we are serious about projecting this nation's interests in the region, how can we emasculate and kill an organisation such as Radio Australia? How can we emasculate and kill an organisation such as Australian Television International? Are these not worthy of the public resources of the nation? They are, and they are a thousand times so. The vision for the nation requires investment across these fronts, not the retreat from them.

"Martin, Stephen, MP",ALP,1999-06-21,"—My friend and colleague the member for Griffith has just talked about vision. He has talked about vision in terms of the lack thereof contained in the government's budget delivered some weeks ago. Tonight, I want to focus my remarks in respect of the budget and the appropriations on what that question of vision, or the lack thereof, means for Australia's defence. 	 Defence policy in Australia is very much a bipartisan 
 issue and rightly so. The defence of this nation is above politics, or at least it should be. That is why on different occasions, since I have been the spokesperson for the Labor Party on defence issues, I have found it necessary to agree with the minister on issues associated with defence or, indeed, on a couple of occasions actually to lead the minister in respect of issues associated with the defence of this nation and our strategic circumstances.
It is also important that, with that bipartisan approach to defence issues, the opportunity should not be lost for some introspection: looking beyond what the present government believes is appropriate, as we enter the next century, for the defence of our nation and what it means for the strategic environment in which we find ourselves. It is that lack of vision which, to some extent, worries me, as Labor spokesman on defence, about this continuing bipartisan support that we give to this very important element of government for all Australians.
Defence is the sort of area where—and, Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis, you would know this certainly from our adjoining electorates in the Illawarra—if you go and talk to any of our constituents and talk to them about defence issues they really do not have a great deal of understanding. They are, rightly, more concerned with issues such as those mentioned by my colleague the member for Griffith. They are concerned about the effect the GST will have on their lives in the future, family payments, the cost of living and employment.
But, equally, of course, they should be concerned about the defence of their nation. They should be concerned about the fact that we still live in a free democracy, and about the fact that they can tune in their television sets most evenings and see images from different parts of the world where people, regrettably, do not enjoy the sorts of benefits that we here in Australia take so much for granted. But to get to those circumstances requires a coherent policy for the defence of this nation; to continue those circumstances requires a vision for the future for our defence.
Why do I say this? I say this because, the government having moved to a new accounting process during the course of this last budget period, it is very easy to get wrapped up in just the bald numbers—in dollars and cents terms—that were directed towards defence. At the end of the day, if you add it all up, I think you will probably see that there is about $19 billion that has been directed towards defence in this budget. People could sit back and say, `My God, $19 billion for the defence of this nation—that must mean that there are some terrific programs under way.'
But, Mr Deputy Speaker, as I know you are aware, with the accrual accounting process, when you pare it back to the actual amount that is going into defence expenditure, there really has just been a maintenance in the barest possible way of expenditure on defence in real terms. Again, people might say, `What is wrong with that? This government said that it would retain expenditure in defence in real terms in this coming budget.'
The difficulty in real terms is that there has not been major growth in defence expenditure to meet the needs of Australia into the next century. With the back of inflation having been broken by the former government led by Paul Keating and maintained by this present government—and inflation is continuing to be extremely low—that increased amount of money is not going to be that great when you start talking about the expenditure necessary to retain real expenditure terms. But, sadly, in a number of ways, that does not reflect a vision for the future. Let me go on to explain what I mean by that in a number of important issues in defence.
It is a fact of life that Australia's strategic circumstances and environment are changing dramatically. No-one in the defence white paper—the paper set the strategic overview for Australia's defence planning and was introduced by the former Minister for Defence, Ian McLachlan—talked about the Asian economic crisis. No-one in defence made any plans on the effect that might have on what Australia would need to expend in its defence or what it would mean for our neighbours who equally were proposing some fairly massive expenditure on defence items. I am talking specifically here of the capability that we as a nation must develop—and by that I mean the platform that we have—whether it be naval, on land or in the air. We are a middle-ranking but important power in this region, which means that for us to continue that dominance to some extent—we should have enough firepower so that people say, `We are not going to mess with Australia'—we need to ensure that we have that firepower and that it is at least equal to that of our neighbours.
With the Asian economic downturn a number of our neighbours had to put off purchasing some pretty sophisticated equipment and some pretty sophisticated platform, particularly for their air forces. This would have meant that the capability we possessed through our FA18 fighter aircraft and the F111 bomber was likely to be eclipsed, which highlights a very real problem for Australia. I know the minister is aware of this and that he has called for another strategic review. I think that is appropriate in view of the comments I have made about defence not factoring in the Asian economic downturn or even seeing it coming, as evidenced in the last white paper produced by this government. It is significant because, in meeting our strategic needs from a defence perspective, we are going to be faced with a massive problem, that of block obsolescence.
Block obsolescence is a process whereby we have come to the end of the economic life cycle of the platform that we use to defend this nation. It is regrettable but it is a fact of life that both the FA18 fighter aircraft and the F111 bomber will come to the end of their economic life at the same time; therefore, we have to make some strategic decisions about what aircraft we are going to need in our own Air Force to meet the circumstances of the future in the defence of Australia. There is no doubt—and this is again demonstrated by the bipartisan nature of the defence policy—that we as a nation will have to effectively defend the air-sea gap against any hostile incursions. Like everyone, we hope that something like that will never happen; nevertheless, we have to have a plan for our own security as a nation, a plan for our regional security and a plan for our region as part of a major defence relationship. Unfortunately, as I said, in the budget that has been handed down for defence we do not see a lot of that vision or that plan.
That block obsolescence is not just going to go to issues associated with our aircraft. Regrettably, similar sorts of problems are going to confront some of our naval vessels, and we will have to look at replacement there. At the present moment there is debate about a new attack helicopter for the Army, and we will have to give consideration to one of three tenderers that are going to put forward their views as to which one we need. One of the helicopters is the Apache helicopter, which has been used in Kosovo. Really it did not get used; they lost a couple, I think, in training exercises.
But the question is: do we need something like that, which is really a tank buster, or do we need something else? Are we going to see amphibious tanks or something like that coming across the Torres Strait to Australia at some stage in the future? If we are, then maybe we need a helicopter of that type. These are the sorts of strategic decisions we are going to have to 
 make in the not too distant future, based on a very clever and a very succinct assessment of our security arrangements.
The fact of the matter is that Jindalee coming on line shortly will give us something of a technological edge, too. That is going to be extremely good for the defence of Australia. We talk about the role that satellites now play in the defence of nations as well, and I think it is fairly common knowledge that that is going to be and will continue to be significant for Australia.
When we start talking about the fact that we are now looking through the knowledge edge—which is, I guess, defence talk meaning that technology has advanced pretty rapidly—when we start to give consideration to the type of capability that is available to people who might want to be hostile, we have to make some fairly careful decisions about how we are going to defend this nation. As Admiral Barrie, the Chief of the Defence Force, said in a speech some few months ago, we have to redefine how we defend this nation. In the future the type of defence we have to prepare for might well be a hostile force coming with aircraft or with ships of some description, but it might also be people landing at Sydney airport carrying weapons of biological warfare—perhaps not at Sydney airport; maybe flying in undetected over this incredibly large coast that we have—and in some way causing terrorism activity to take place in this nation.
When you start to get into some of the smart bombs and the I-bombs and the technology that is out there now for disabling computers through developments taking place under this knowledge edge, it can become fairly scary. At some stage we might not see anybody killed other than the massive computer at the Australian Stock Exchange. We might see somebody walk into the Reserve Bank of Australia and blow all their computers away simply by putting something down in the middle of the floor, concealed as a briefcase, which actually sends out electromagnetic pulses that wipe out the entire memory of the computers in the Reserve Bank of Australia. Can you imagine what that would do to Australia in terms of everyday commerce?
These are the realities of the future. Whilst it is important that our Army, Navy and Air Force heads and people at Russell Offices sit down and start thinking about our strategic environment in terms of what people would regard as traditional warfare, there are other issues which have to be addressed, and I think it is appropriate that the Australian Defence Force turn their attention to them.
But we do not see a lot of that recognised in this budget, save for $10 million put aside for the creation of something which has been called the Office of Revolution in Military Affairs—a touch Stalinist for this government, I would have thought. Nevertheless this revolution in military affairs is a name which the United States use to describe what I have referred to as the knowledge edge and all this smart technology that is going on at the minute. But I have to say that I think that only $10 million for something like that is not really appropriate: I think we should be investing a lot more in that aspect of our defence relationship.
So our strategic circumstances, the sort of capability that we will need, the platform that will be required in the future to ensure that we can defend this nation, need to be improved. At some stage down the track people might start thinking about missiles or unmanned aircraft. We are buying some reconnaissance aircraft shortly as well, to go with the helicopters for the Army; we are talking about upgrading the frigates; we are talking about the Collins class 
 submarines coming on line progressively over the next 12 months, and most of the issues associated with the difficulties encountered there have been worked through.
On that, I might just say in passing that, instead of people going out and bagging the Collins class submarine project, which is leading edge technology, and which is having an industry base in Australia develop, we should be saying, `Isn't it terrific that we are doing something that will give us the best conventionally powered submarine in the world,' and `Isn't it good that it is actually going to be an effective part of the deterrence and the strategic defence of Australia?' Wouldn't it be good if, just for a change, somebody started saying, `Australian Defence Industries is terrific?' Wouldn't it be good if somebody overseas suddenly said, `If they are making them in Australia, maybe we might like to have some of those as well; maybe we could buy some of those from Australia?' Wouldn't it be terrific if the Australian Submarine Corporation could continue to make those down in Port Adelaide?
I think it is ridiculous that, in the defence community overseas, we are something of a laughing stock because, instead of our praising our ability to manufacture something like the Collins class submarine, we are being knocked by our own, and the defence community overseas is saying, `You blokes must be mad. You think you want to sell that down the track? No way will anybody buy that now because of what people have been saying about it.' Yet, as I say, technically the glitches have been remedied, the Navy is satisfied with the progress on it, and I think that when they do go fully and operationally into service, Australia will have a fabulous platform for its future.
Australian industry also is something which I believe needs to be continually refined and addressed when it comes to defence issues. I talked about block obsolescence and the economic life of many of our platforms coming to an end at the same time, and the sad fact is that so too is defence industry, with three specific maritime platforms all going to end at the same time. We will finish manufacturing the mine hunters at Newcastle, the frigates at Williamstown in Melbourne and the Collins class submarines in Port Adelaide, all at the same time. There are going to be three shipyards completing—all over, red rover in terms of what they are manufacturing—all at the same time.
In defence planning, they are the sorts of issues, from an industry point of view and a regional employment point of view, that have to be considered. At Williamstown alone there are 1,000 people employed at that naval dockyard. What happens when the frigate project is all over? The New Zealanders said that they would not take the third. They are going to buy some second-hand junk aircraft from the United States instead. So another one could have been built there and people could have continued to be employed—but what are we going to do about that? Where is the vision statement from Minister Moore about this?
I will say one thing about Minister Bronwyn Bishop when she was Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel. She did bring down a document on defence industry, which set some guidelines for the future. We disagreed around the edges on some of the things contained within it; nevertheless, it was a blueprint, and it could give some guidance for the future. I would like to see that built on, but I am afraid we do not hear the former industry minister—now the present defence minister—John Moore, saying much about that. I will certainly give him bipartisan support on it. In developing Labor's policy on defence into the future, I am going to point very heavily to some issues associated with that.
Finally, I think it is important—although, these days, not necessarily in my area—to make some comments very briefly on personnel issues. The minister, in a statement in the House 
 some few weeks ago, talked about the way in which all the changes in the Defence Force were leading to savings which were being redirected to the pointy end of defence. I have to say that we are a little sceptical about the savings that are proposed to be engineered from the Defence Reform Program. Why? Because it was predicated on a defence force of 42,500, the lowest in about 30 years. What is the real circumstance? Unbeknown to many people, this government has decided that it is going to keep the Defence Force at 50,000; therefore those savings cannot possibly be realised. As a consequence, we see the sorts of headlines that were in the Canberra Times today, `An Army in retreat, if not quite disarray', where it goes through chapter and verse of how unhappy many people are in Australia's defence forces, why morale is so low.
These are issues of vision for Australia's defence. These are issues of vision for Australia. I think the government, rather than simply saying that we are maintaining expenditure on defence in real terms, needs to address these issues. We are happy to enter into that debate with the government because defence policies are largely bipartisan, but we want to see that vision.

"Livermore, Kirsten, MP",ALP,1999-06-21,"—I wish to participate in the debate this evening on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1999-2000 . With this budget the government helped me to keep a promise I made to the people of Capricornia, going into the last election. I warned the voters of Capricornia last year that this government did not have a plan for us in Central Queensland, or indeed for Australia; I said that it had a plan for a new tax.
Every word the Treasurer said on budget night, and just as importantly every word he did not say, reassured me that I had been totally honest with the people in my electorate. There is no plan; there is the GST and there is the sell-off of Telstra. Well, the people in Capricornia have heard that one already and they did not like it the first time.
This is a lazy and complacent budget from a government that is more interested in earning pats on the back from the big end of town than doing the hard yards to meet its obligations to the Australian community for now and into the future for wherever people happen to live in this country. It is a budget that shows that this government is completely out of touch with the needs and concerns of the Australian people, and in particular with the needs of those of us who live in regional areas.
When I read through the budget papers and when I listened to the Treasurer and the Prime Minister sell the budget in the parliament and in the media, it was painfully obvious to me that there are whole sections of the community and whole sections of our country that just do not appear on this government's radar screen.
In this budget the government continues to fail the people in the community on average and low incomes. When the Prime Minister can talk about the difficult choices facing people in choosing between visiting an extra country on their next overseas holiday or taking out expensive private health insurance, it is pretty clear that he is out of touch with ordinary people.
The arrogance of this government is truly breathtaking. All over my electorate people's jaws were hitting the floor when they heard that little gem from the Prime Minister. He is out of touch with ordinary people, and more than that, he does not understand their lives.
His government does not care about the real choices people living in my electorate have to make. They are not choices between overseas holidays or private health cover, but between a new pair of school shoes or a family outing for a meal at the leagues club, a service for 
 mum's car or a school camp for the kids. People ring my office in Rocky with a whole range of problems, but a toss up between overseas holiday destinations is not one of them.
It is clear from this budget that the government's radar is still faulty when it comes to recognising regional Australia. I say that because there is nothing in this budget to indicate that the government sees the potential of our regions or the need for a coordinated strategy to maximise each region's strengths to ensure a strong and sustainable future.
It appears that in this government's mind set, regional means rural and the two constantly get lumped together. I am fairly sensitive to the distinction between the two, because the electorate of Capricornia represents a fair proportion of rural and remote communities included in the broad region of Central Queensland, as well as the region's key centre, the city of Rockhampton.
While there are definitely a number of measures directed at the rural sections of Capricornia, there is no sense that it is part of a comprehensive strategy for our Central Queensland region, a strategy that identifies what industries and activities are going to form the foundation of our future growth, and more importantly, ensures that every part of our region has the capacity, both in terms of physical infrastructure and skilled people, to participate in that development and benefit from it. Instead, there are examples all the way through the government's policies of opportunities that are going to be lost because of the government's lack of strategic vision and obsession with its new tax at the expense of good policy.
There are two opportunities in particular that I see going begging as far as the future development of Central Queensland is concerned, opportunities to make our mark as a region in two emerging industries that will complement our traditional strengths in primary industries and mining. The two areas I am thinking of are tourism and education. Instead of pulling out all stops to support these industries, the government is taking them one step forward and then two steps back, recognising their importance on the one hand but then making it impossible for them to flourish.
As far as tourism is concerned, the step forward is the commitment in the budget to extend the runway at the Rockhampton airport. This is a commendable decision and one that holds great promise for the tourism industry around Rocky and Central Queensland. However, at the same time the tourism industry is threatened with the wipe-out of the GST. That is more like one step forward and 10 steps backwards for the tourism operators around Central Queensland.
The impact of the GST on tourism was not even looked at by the Treasury when they did their modelling of the government's package, but everyone else who has analysed the effects has forecast disaster. It does not matter whether you look at international tourists or domestic tourists, whether they are travelling by car, plane or train—every combination faces a job destroying downturn as a result of the GST.
The idea of extending Rocky airport's runway is to open up opportunities for attracting international tourists to Central Queensland. On current trends, that should succeed. The most recent Queensland visitor survey available from the Capricorn Tourism and Development Organisation found that international visitors account for 11 per cent of tourists to our region annually—a total of 89,700 visitors from around the world. That is a significant proportion and not a number easily overlooked, or so you would think. But, despite the growing significance of tourism as an export industry and employer in Australia, Treasury did not think tourism was important enough to look into when modelling the GST. Instead, it was left to 
 those who understand and value the contribution of tourism to our economy to do the work on that front.
The Inbound Tourism Organisation of Australia said in its submission to the Senate inquiry:
Monash University Economics Professor Peter Dixon has forecast a 10 percent decline in international visitors to Australia as a result of the GST. This equates to the loss of $1.6 billion in export earnings. Queensland stands to suffer the greatest loss of income and employment.
The competition for attracting international tourists is fierce and, according to the analysis presented to the Senate inquiry, very price sensitive. That is bad news for Central Queensland when you look at the breakdown of international visitor figures. For example, 61 per cent of international visitors came from Europe and the United Kingdom, so it is a pretty fair bet that most of those were backpackers trying to see the country as cheaply as possible. How are they going to feel about paying a GST on every bus ride, hostel room and souvenir?
Unfortunately, the story does not get any better for domestic tourism. I just spent the last weekend travelling around the western parts of Capricornia, through the gemfields and out to Barcaldine. Everywhere you looked there were caravans on the roads and tourists enjoying the sunshine and the atmosphere of friendly country towns. Almost all of the tourists were from within Australia and were taking extended driving holidays on carefully managed budgets. All of the locals I talked to told me that numbers are growing every year and they are all hopeful that tourism will grow to add a new dynamic to the region's economy. I would like to think that their hope is well founded, but why is the government risking that bright outlook by hobbling it with the GST?
Of course, it is not just the west that is looking at domestic tourism as part of its future prosperity. Most of the visitors to the Capricorn Coast are from within Australia and are looking for a moderately priced holiday. According to the Tourism Council of Australia:
The analysis shows that prices for Australians travelling at home will rise by 5.2 % if the trip includes an air component and 4.8 % if travel by car.
This is backed up by the Tourism Task Force in its submission to the Senate inquiry:
The Tourism Task Force estimates the overall impact on domestic travel is at least a fall of 4.4 %, due to the net impact of increased prices of domestic travel and decreasing prices of travel to overseas destinations.
There is nothing to feel very hopeful about in that outlook. Maybe people will be able to think about an extra stopover overseas as well as their private health insurance in such a scenario, but they will certainly be thinking twice about flying, driving, camping, caravanning or any other holiday activity in Central Queensland because the cost will undoubtedly go up under the government's GST. So, on the one hand, we get the runway, but the other hand deals us a tax on a developing industry that will see jobs, revenue and opportunities lost to Central Queensland.
The development of Central Queensland as a centre for education and research is another opportunity that the government has the power to either make or break. The University of Central Queensland's innovative Smart City project has the potential to position the uni and Central Queensland as a leader in distance education, in the use of interactive technology in teaching and as a major exporter of education. Following a large investment by the Beattie government and a commitment by the federal opposition to gift the Commonwealth building to the uni, the government was dragged into an agreement to sell the building to the university.
The university, and indeed the whole community of Rockhampton, welcomed the government's belated embrace of the Smart City project, but again we see one step forward and two steps back. Instead of handing over the building, the government is making the university pay for it. The government continues to limit the ambitions of universities and students in Australia due to its failure to restore funding to tertiary education. The government's spending on higher education this year is still $800 million behind Labor's spending in its last year in office.
The lack of vision and strategy in this budget is bad enough when you think of the options that would be open to the government and this country if it was not squandering the surplus on pay-offs for the GST. It is made even worse when you recall how the surplus was arrived at—it was paid for by cuts to regional services and education. We saw our government services in Central Queensland shut up shop in the name of producing a surplus. Now that there is a surplus, what do we get? We do not see our services being returned: we get a GST that increasing numbers of people in Capricornia—whether they are the pensioners at the supermarket or the bloke running the servo down the road—are telling me that they definitely do not want.
The tax office in Rocky is a classic illustration of how this government operates. Obviously, it is not about what we want or need in Central Queensland but what the government's GST obsession dictates. In 1996, the tax office in Rocky closed its doors as part of the government's budget slashing to community services. Now we find out that Rocky will get an office staffed with GST field officers. So again, one step forward and two steps back. Sure, we welcome the extra jobs that the field office represents, but there is no way we are getting back what we lost in 1996.
It is far from a fully equipped tax office, open to take all inquiries that the general public would like to be able to take directly to a tax officer rather than waiting on the phone to Townsville for every request. Instead, we are getting a cubbyhole from which field officers will travel around visiting businesses to implement the GST. So we lost our community's tax office in order to get a surplus that we are now told is going to be spent on a tax office that is not for the community but for the GST. I think the people of Central Queensland are entitled to feel pretty ripped off by that equation.
I do not like to let a speaking opportunity in here pass me by without mentioning the government's performance on jobs. Whatever I say about employment now, it will certainly be more than the Treasurer said on budget night. I was waiting quite expectantly for the Treasurer to announce some initiatives for creating jobs and cutting the unemployment rate. I could not really believe it when his time was almost up and he still had not touched on the issue. Then right at the end, almost as an afterthought, he shrugged his shoulders and said, `The unemployment rate should remain around its current level'. Just like that. Not, `We're the government and we should be committed and passionate about ensuring that every Australian has a chance at gaining the education and skills to get a job'. Not, `We're the government and we should be working with communities and businesses to identify opportunities and problems to ensure that development occurs right across Australia'. No; all we got was that the unemployment rate is just going to sit on 7.5 per cent indefinitely without too much concern from the government. And, of course, the rate in Capricornia, being a regional area, is higher than that figure—up at eight per cent. But I guess the Treasurer would just shrug his shoulders at that, too.
This government's approach to unemployment is another example of where programs and services were sacrificed in the name of producing a budget surplus, only for the surplus to be wasted on achieving a GST that will only harm the creation of jobs. The government seems quite comfortable with spending $20 billion on the GST over the next three years and not producing an improved unemployment outcome. It is quite hard to believe. Their one concession to the 700,000 unemployed people in Australia, including almost 5,500 unemployed people in Capricornia, is the Work for the Dole Scheme—the Work for the Dole Scheme with a 32 per cent success rate for participants finding employment compared to the rate of 50 per cent to 60 per cent under Labor's Jobstart wage subsidy program.
The disappointing thing here is that the government knows what it could be doing for unemployment in this country because it only has to look at the final months of the Labor government when the creation of full-time jobs was double that currently being achieved by this government. The government knows what it needs to do—provide training and wage subsidies—and it would have the resources to do that if it was not spending the surplus on a new tax.
This is a government with the wrong priorities—a GST ahead of jobs and education, and the sell-off of Telstra instead of a commitment to providing a high level of accessible and affordable telecommunications infrastructure to all Australians, both city and country. The government offers no vision for this country, and the people of Capricornia know it. All this government does offer is an unfair and job destroying tax, and the people of Capricornia know that as well and they do not want it.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 1999-2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,1999-06-21,"—I rise in this appropriation debate to address one issue of vital importance to my electorate, and that is the complete failure of the government in this budget to allocate vitally needed funds to upgrading the Princes and West Gate freeways which connect Melbourne and Geelong. This is an issue of vital concern to my electorate because it is bisected by this road, which we call locally the Geelong road. Let there be no doubt about the importance of this road. A few simple statistics quickly paint that picture. Make no mistake, these are statistics which are no doubt known to the government, particularly as I have referred to them in this place before.
Fact 1: the Geelong road carries up to 132,000 vehicles a day, with traffic increasing by almost five per cent a year. After the construction and connection of the western ring road, traffic volumes have increased and indeed we have already exceeded the 2005 projections for traffic flow. Fact 2: it carries more than six million tonnes of freight a year and services more than 30 per cent of Australia's exports through the ports of Melbourne and Geelong. Fact 3: the freeway services one of Victoria's fastest growing population and economic regions and is the key link to export markets for primary producers throughout the western district and South Australia. Fact 4: it is a gateway to one of Australia's premier tourist attractions, namely the Great Ocean Road and the various tourist venues which lie along it. Fact 5 and most important of all: it is Victoria's most deadly road, with more smashes on its 63-kilometre length than were experienced on the 1,000 kilometres of Victoria's federally financed highway system in the same period. Since 1990, 86 people have died on the road. There have been 6,000 crash victims in total and 1,000 of them have been injured.
At the Maltby Bypass in my electorate, which is a severe accident black spot because a design flaw causes traffic moving from Werribee to Geelong to merge into the fastest moving lane of traffic rather than into the slowest moving lane, we have suffered 11 deaths and 300 
 accidents in the past eight years. The road needs to be included in the national highway system and upgraded to national highway standards, and Labor promised to do just that in the last federal election campaign. Labor did so because it recognised the clear economic and social benefits of upgrading this road. Specifically those benefits include cutting costs to businesses which use the road by at least $50 million per annum, therefore stimulating investment, employment, tourism and regional growth; enhancing Australia's export performance, given the volume of exports which use the road; creating 4,500 jobs both in the construction phase and as a result of the efficiencies gained from improving the road; reducing traffic jams; linking Melbourne and Geelong in a more productive and time-certain way to allow goods to be shipped out of the port of Melbourne and the port of Geelong more efficiently; ultimately moving from Avalon airport in more time-efficient manner and, of course, most importantly of all, saving lives and reducing serious accidents.
But despite the clear case for upgrading the road to national highway standard, this vital issue seems to be trapped in the swirling and apparently poisonous currents of Liberal Party politics. Out of this noxious brew, my constituents and all of those who use the Geelong road are now being asked to accept an extraordinary proposition. They are being asked to accept half a road at a second-rate standard.
First of all, why are we being promised half a road? In the last election campaign, Labor promised that an incoming Victorian Labor government and a Beazley Labor government would jointly fund an upgrade of the Geelong road and that, after the upgrade, the road would become part of the national highway system and thereafter be part of the federal government's responsibility. The Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett, always keen when he sees an electoral winner, decided to jump on Labor's bandwagon and promised that his government would put $118.5 million into upgrading the road and would seek the matching $118.5 million from the Howard government in this budget.
Indeed, so full of fight was Premier Kennett that on 19 March 1999 he attended a business breakfast in my electorate in Werribee and promised that, if the federal government failed to allocate money to the Geelong road in this budget, he would start a campaign against them and would not give up until the money was allocated. We all know what the state of relations is between Premier Kennett and the Prime Minister and his Treasurer. The Prime Minister has frequently been driven to exasperation by Premier Kennett's tendency to have an opinion on everything but a solution to nothing. Of course no-one in Australian politics would easily forget the scandal that surrounded the colourful terminology used in the Kennett-Peacock telephone call.
—What was it?
—It is not terminology one could easily repeat in this place, although I am being invited to.
—Give it a go.
—I would not use words like that. The animosity between Premier Kennett and the Treasurer is also well known and becoming increasingly so as the preselection spats in the seats of Brighton and other places fill the pages of Victoria's newspapers. While Premier Kennett was talking tough about beating up on the federal government and getting the necessary matching funds to upgrade the Geelong road, the minister for transport was busy pointing the finger at Jeff and saying that it was all his fault. Indeed, in the run-up to the budget in a letter to me dated 27 April, the minister for transport said:
Geelong Road and its upgrading is the responsibility of the Victorian government. As you are aware, over the past six years the Commonwealth has provided to Victoria over $500 million in untied funds, previously forming part of the Commonwealth's road funding program. At any time during this period the Victorian government could have directed these funds to upgrade Geelong Road.
What are the electors of Lalor to make of this division in the Liberal Party, with the Premier of Victoria threatening fire and brimstone if federal funds are not made available for the Geelong road and the federal minister apparently saying, `It is all Victoria's responsibility'? We will never know what role the poor set of personal relationships between Premier Kennett, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer played on the decision making that led up to this budget. We will never know what that poor set of personal and political relationships cost us. But we do know one thing for sure: in this budget not one cent of the $1.6 billion allocated to road funding was allocated to the Geelong road. The fact that there would be no money—despite some press speculation that perhaps the government, in a cynical electioneering sleight of hand, was actually holding back the announcement about the Geelong road until the Victorian election was called—was clearly confirmed by the minister for transport when he answered a question I asked him on the day after the budget. My question was quite comprehensive: it went to the fact that the budget did not allocate any money to the Princes Freeway; it referred to his letter to me dated 27 April, which I have just taken you to; it referred to discussions between the Prime Minister and the Premier on the question; and it asked the minister whether it was his view that the road was solely a state responsibility or whether he would contemplate allocating some federal funds. In answer to this the minister for once chose to actually direct his answer to the question and gave quite a plain answer. He said:
The government has no plans to make any announcements in relation to matters that are not included in the budget for this year.
If the minister is as good as his word—and I repeat, if the minister is as good as his word—then, of course, we will not see any federal funding for the Geelong road. One would have thought that, given his complete rebuff by the federal government and his fighting words at the Werribee business breakfast and in other places, the Premier of Victoria would immediately have started his promised campaign of action against the federal government to try to force the money out of them. I am sure there are many ministers who would have been worried about that prospect. But not so. On this occasion `tiger' Kennett turns into a sleepy pussy cat. On 13 May, two days after the federal budget, the Premier is publicly reported as having told the federal Treasurer and the Prime Minister that he did not require money to be allocated to upgrade the Princes Freeway in this federal budget. So much for the promised campaign.
Clearly Premier Kennett tried to get the funds out of the federal government, failed to do so and decided to try to disguise the failure by pretending he never really wanted the money anyway. This is all very interesting in terms of psychology, personal politics and a bit of face saving. But where does it leave my constituency and the users of the Princes Freeway—who are not interested in Premier Kennett's attempt to save face and who believed that he would stand up for Victoria when he came to Werribee and promised to do so?
It leaves us in the ridiculous position where, according to Premier Kennett, work will start on the Princes Freeway upgrade—he will spend the $118.5 million that the Victorian government has made available—but when funds runs out half way, work will stop. As completely crazy as it may seem, the federal coalition government and the state coalition government have allowed the stupid backbiting of their own internal party politics to result 
 in a situation where a major and vital infrastructure project in Australia is about to start, with only half of the necessary funds guaranteed. This is where the budget leaves us.
This sorry and stupid saga about half a road does not stop there. Not only are we to have only half a road but we are, apparently, to get that half road at a second-rate standard. The Victorian government has approved a plan to allow two service centres and an interchange to be built on the Geelong road near Avalon. The national safety standards—that is, the standards applicable to highways within the national system—demand that the distance between a pair of service centres and an interchange be not less than two kilometres. This allows for an adequate distance where traffic, particularly heavy vehicles accelerating on to the freeway from a service centre, does not interfere with decelerating traffic intending to leave the freeway at the upcoming interchange. This is a clearly logical concept which avoids creating an accident black spot where traffic is trying to both accelerate and decelerate at the same point.
In contrast, the standards for rural highways are of a lesser dimension, as one would expect given the lesser volume of traffic that they hold. In that case, the standard for the distance between service centres and an interchange is only one kilometre. Commonsense would tell you that the Geelong road would not be treated as a rural highway, carrying as it does huge volumes of traffic, including commercial traffic servicing, amongst others, the port of Melbourne, the port of Geelong, Avalon airport, Ford, Toyota, the petrochemical industry, the Laverton North industrial estate and a major agricultural precinct. Indeed, commonsense would tend to dictate that a road that carries that volume of traffic would be treated as part of the national highway system and would have standards that reflected that. Yet the Victorian government, with a clear lack of commonsense—in fact doing something that absolutely defies commonsense—has said that in respect of this particular development near Avalon the rural highway standard is good enough.
Indeed, on 5 May in the Victorian Legislative Council, the Minister for Roads and Ports, Mr Geoff Craige, who was very keen to be seen with the federal minister for roads at a photo opportunity on the Geelong road—but who has not been so keen to do anything else in respect of the Geelong road—said, when he was asked about this clear safety issue, in a breathtaking display of intelligence, that, `Even Freddy can see it is not a national highway.'
Indeed, Minister, it is not a national highway because currently funds have not been allocated to upgrade the road to national highway standards. It is not a national highway because the Commonwealth government—this coalition government—has refused, yet again, in this budget to allocate the necessary funds to upgrade the road.
With due respect to the Victorian minister for roads, my constituents believe it should be a national highway. With due respect to the Premier of Victoria, if he is afraid to campaign on the issue, my constituents are not. With the respect due to the Prime Minister, his Treasurer and to the minister for transport, this budget simply is not good enough. The Geelong road should be upgraded—but not by making it half a road at half a standard. The Geelong road should be upgraded so that it becomes part of the national highway system at national highway system standards.
The campaign to achieve this result will continue. Since the budget, the Princes Freeway Action Committee has already erected signs on the Geelong road which say `Caution—No Federal Road Funds Ahead', a little further along, `Caution—No Federal Road Funds here either' and, finally, as you come off the freeway, `Caution—No Federal Road Funds behind 
 you'. It is nice clear language and it makes the point. The point that those large black and yellow signs make to every commuter every time they use the road is that this government, in this budget, failed to allocate the necessary funds to upgrade the road to national highway standards.
Perhaps even more graphic than this signage on the road for every commuter to see every time they use it is a display which has been put together by an ordinary Victorian, a Victorian courier, Mr Leo Gleeson, who uses the road every day and who is sick of encountering accidents as a result of the problems with the safety on the road. He has mounted his own unique form of protest by placing a cross near the road for everyone who has died on the road. If that statistic—chilling as it is—increases, he is intending to add a cross for every further death on this road. We also have Robert Mitchelson, who is continuing his campaign for the service centres and the interchange, which I spoke about, to be dealt with at national highway standards rather than at the rural highway standard being proposed by the Victorian government.
To these noted campaigns and campaigners, you can add the hundreds—indeed thousands—of Victorian commuters who have signed the petition, who have sent the Prime Minister a note on the issue, or whose cars sport the `Fix the jam' sticker. None of them will go away until this issue is resolved. Perhaps more importantly, we have regular metropolitan coverage of this issue in the Herald Sun, which itself is campaigning for this road to be dealt with appropriately and as part of the national highway system.
In conclusion, I would like to use the words of the Herald Sun in an editorial that it published late last year about the attitude of this minister and this government to the Geelong road. The tragedy is that, even though we have had a budget come and go in the period since this editorial was published, every word of it remains true today. The editorial read:
John Anderson must mend his ways—and Victoria's deadliest road—if he wants to win back support from the bush for the Howard Government. By refusing funds to rebuild the Melbourne-Geelong freeway, the federal Minister for Transport and Regional Services ignores the fact that this narrow, overcrowded 50km stretch of bitumen has claimed 86 lives in the past eight years.
Yet Mr Anderson shows callous indifference towards the families of the dead as well as others injured since 1990 in the 6000 crashes on this section of highway.
The minister will not explain why his government refuses to provide the $100 million needed to match a similar contribution the Victorian Government would make to fix our worst killer highway.
Instead, the people of Geelong and the commuters of Melbourne's outer west—
namely, my constituents—
have been told by the minister's official spokesman that the Herald Sun 's Fix our Deadly Highway campaign is a `wonderful beat-up in true tabloid fashion'.
Some beat-up, some spokesman, some minister, when 86 people are dead.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 1999-2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Fahey, John, MP",LP,1999-06-21,"—I am pleased to bring this debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1999-2000  to a conclusion. I have noted that there have been many contributions throughout the course of the several days of debate on this legislation. In fact I am told that 101 speakers have participated in this debate, and that indicates the importance that the parliament places on debate on the national economy and on the management of the national economy by the government. I think it is fair to say that all members expect to see many problems in the Australian community addressed through the appropriation of funds by the Commonwealth, and I indicate that 
 perhaps the honourable member for Lalor might fall into that category with her contribution to this debate.
Appropriation is a complex process. Roads are a complex process as well. It is simply not a case of saying, `Let's spend money here, there or anywhere.' It is about ensuring that the spending of public moneys is prioritised correctly and that, where spending occurs, it is within the government's means. We, as a government, have continued to ensure that we do not spend outside our means. That has highlighted and underpinned the administration of the public accounts in the time that the coalition has been in government since 1996. It is also about a government putting together a budget, underpinned by the appropriation bills, which is in accordance with the objectives that the government has set out to achieve, and I would like to touch on those objectives.
The 1999-2000 budget builds on our achievements and it addresses our key priorities. Those key priorities are to deliver on our election commitments. I can say that all members of the government were delighted to listen to the Treasurer on election night and to know that, as that budget speech was being delivered and those bills were being tabled, all of those promises put to the Australian people before October of last year were contained, on the first opportunity for such promises to be contained, in a set of bills called the appropriation bills—delivering to the Australian community as promised.
The second objective is to promote an economic climate conducive to high levels of sustainable economic and employment growth and to provide a social safety net for those in need. A further priority is to build a modern, fair and efficient taxation system, and the Australian community, heaven knows, needs a modern, a fair and an efficient taxation system. It seems that all Australians acknowledge that, except the Australian Labor Party. Even the Democrats acknowledge that.
Another priority is to deliver increased services to rural and regional Australia, and that of course is something which is paramount for the Australian community as a whole. It is a priority for the Liberal Party and the National Party and, as a coalition government, the Liberal and National parties have focused very much on the needs of rural and regional Australia. Lastly, by way of priorities, is the priority of ensuring that government resources are used as effectively and as efficiently as possible.
Let me go back to the strong economy. The Labor Party has made much of the social impacts of the budget. Many of those 101 contributions to this debate have continued to address the so-called lack of social impact from those appropriations bills. It seems that Labor continues to take the view that there is a capacity of government to address the social needs. The first role of any government in securing the welfare of its people is to provide sound economic foundations. Far from being mutually exclusive, a government's social and economic goals should support each other. Time and again members will say to you, `You can afford social policies only when you have the economic side of government in order,' and that is something this government has addressed over its 3½ years in office. Without those strong economic fundamentals, there can be no guarantee of fulfilling and lasting employment, there can be little hope of security for individuals and families and no stable revenue base to provide the social safety net which all communities demand.
These are all reasons why the government acted resolutely to put the budget back into surplus after its election in 1996, why the government moved to put an end to the spiral of 
 deficit and debt left by Labor and not only to bring the budget back into surplus but to keep the budget in surplus.
For the third year in a row, the budget will be in surplus, a surplus of more than $5 billion. We have already paid, or repaid, some $24 billion of Labor's debt, and we are now in a position to pay off more debt. In the last four budgets, in net terms, we have not borrowed one single dollar. We are moving steadily towards a debt free Commonwealth, a Commonwealth which was labouring under the burden of some $90 billion of additional debt under the previous Labor government. That was the legacy that Labor left this country in 1996.
Sound economic management has protected Australia from the regional economic crisis that many predicted would draw us in. In the face of that regional crisis, our economy continued to grow. In fact, it grew faster than economies in the countries of Europe and faster than economies in the developed world as a whole, even faster than the economy of the USA. And unemployment fell; in the past year 180,000 new jobs were created.
The restoration of the fiscal position, along with the government's success in lowering inflation, has provided an environment for the lowest housing interest rates in almost 30 years, and unemployment—which we will acknowledge is still too high—has fallen to its lowest level since the start of the decade. Just as the economic reform of three years ago gave us the strength to ride out the challenges of the last year, the reforms of today will determine how we ride out the challenges of tomorrow. If we want growth, if we want the living standards and jobs in the next decade, we must rise to the challenges of today. The reform of the Australian taxation system is our greatest reform challenge.
I will touch on that taxation system, which has been the subject of much debate in the course of dealing with these bills. For Australia's sake we put forward a plan to reform the current outmoded, outdated, complex and unfair taxation system which is holding Australia back. Anyone who is serious about welfare reform must also be serious about taxation reform. Without a fair and sustainable tax system, the long-term viability of the social safety net must always remain in doubt.
Without a broadly based goods and services tax, there can be no guarantee of a secure revenue base for the Australian states and territories to provide the schools, the hospitals, the roads—even, for that matter, roads such as the Geelong road. Without a broad based tax, there can be no guarantee of any roads—or the police. We all know that those things are the needs of the Australian community.
Without a broadly based goods and services tax, you cannot abolish 10 unfair taxes including the unfair tax `bed tax' in the state of New South Wales. You cannot cut personal income taxes. You cannot catch more than the $3 billion that is estimated to be in the black economy, and you cannot reduce the tax on health, education, child care and charitable institutions. The Australian Democrats have recognised this. They have demonstrated a commitment to the national interest by sitting down with the government and working out a way to deliver reform that is in the national interest. Sadly, that once great party, the Australian Labor Party, has vacated centre stage. They have taken a one-way ticket to policy oblivion, and it is has been left to the Democrats to occupy that centre stage in the national interest.
This plan will deliver great economic benefits to Australia. What it will deliver is that 80 per cent of Australian taxpayers will be on the top marginal rate of 30 cents in the dollar, and we will be reducing business costs by about $10½ billion per year. This tax plan will guarantee that no states will be worse off during the transitional period. Further, it guarantees that, after 
 the transitional period, the revenue gains to the states will be such that they will be much better off than if the existing arrangements continue.
There are many in this chamber who formerly had a state background and who would know only too well the difficulties that the states faced with the Premiers Conference year after year, wondering what the take would be after the trip to Canberra and knowing always that there was no certainty about whether there would be growth in the revenue of the states, because the Commonwealth had the first say, the Commonwealth had total say, and the states were at the mercy of the Commonwealth when it came to that return of the Australian people's taxes. That will cease. That will cease because there is growth built into the new tax plan, and in the end we are going to have a much better tax system.
Let me touch briefly on rural and regional Australia. As I indicated earlier, we are strongly committed to rural and regional Australia and we have delivered a number of important initiatives in this budget. They include a series of measures to improve rural health services in the short and the long term, measures to ensure that students from rural and regional areas have much better access to education, and measures to defeat the distances that make it hard for rural and regional Australia to access government and community services, through the establishment of the regional transaction centres.
In the area of education we will spend some $4.8 billion on primary and secondary school children in government and non-government schools. We are committed to the provision of choice in education, again for the benefit of all Australians. And whilst many speakers have addressed this issue, I have noted with some interest that there has been some conjecture about the contribution to non-government schools. The contribution which the government stands firmly behind and is very proud of will bring an additional $553 million over five years to the Catholic systemic schools, and that implements once again an election commitment made last October.
This decision came out of an independent assessment of the needs of the system which was conducted by the Non-Government Schools Funding Review Committee. The budget announced a new formula for distributing recurrent funding to non-government schools based on the needs of the parents and taking into account the resources of the community that a school serves.
In 2001, non-government schools will be funded according to a measure of the socioeconomic status, known as the SES, of their school communities. The new funding arrangements replace a system that was widely seen as unfair. It was complex and it was inadequate as a measure of need. We are going to have a much better and a fairer education funding system. Government schools have not been neglected. In the five years ahead an additional $1 billion has been provided for government schools.
I referred in the priorities of government to effective and efficient government and the need to ensure that all that a government does achieves those objectives. Our public finances are reported and presented on a world class basis. Our Charter of Budget Honesty is now advocated internationally as a model for other countries.
This budget represents a major shift in the way the federal government budgets for and manages its resources because for the first time the Commonwealth based its budget on outcomes and outputs and accrual accounting principles. But this entails much more than a technical change in accounting policies. The new framework puts outcomes and outputs—that is, results and deliverables—at the centre of how agencies plan, how they budget, how they 
 manage and how they report. It marks a strategic and more businesslike approach and it incorporates standard financial statements with a strong emphasis on results. After all, surely that is what it is about. It is about outcomes, it is not about process.
Traditional cash budgeting makes it difficult to assess the financial position of agencies or to compare performance from one financial year to another. It simply does not promote best practice management by agencies or true accountability. Accrual budgeting is recognised internationally as a more accurate tool. It is based on full costs as they are incurred. It changes both how and what is measured for budgeting, for accounting, and for reporting purposes. All in all, it means government having a better handle on knowing precisely how much it costs agencies to do business.
The critical element is changing the performance focus to budgeting, managing and reporting on the outputs and the full costs required to achieve the outcomes that the government wants. The object is clarity: it is clear accountability; consistently applied and clear performance measures; realistic goods and services, planned and delivered; and, ultimately, the financial results that are achieved. The result is more transparent, and more transparent government is in fact something all of us would seek to achieve. The move makes Australia a world leader in government budgeting practices and positions Australia at the forefront of the international community for public sector resource management.
The Labor Party has suggested that the move to accrual budgeting is an important change, but not important enough to mark as a major achievement of this budget. In one sense, and one sense only, this is true. Accrual budgeting is a tool to achieve the real end of an efficient and effective public sector, one that achieves the outcomes government wants, at the lowest possible cost. This allows the government to direct its resources to the areas of highest needs. The strong economic foundations which we have built, and continue to build upon, are the best guarantee of employment growth, security for individuals and families, and a stable revenue base to provide that social safety net I referred to earlier that the community demands. I thank all members for their contribution and I commend the bills to the House.
