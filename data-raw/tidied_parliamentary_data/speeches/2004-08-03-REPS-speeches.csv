"Howard, John, MP",LP,2004-08-03,"—I move:
That this House record its deep regret at the death on 27 July 2004, of the Hon Dr Henry Alfred Jenkins, AM, former Speaker of the House of Respresentatives and Member of this House for the Division of Scullin from 1969 to 1985, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.
Harry Jenkins, or Henry Alfred Jenkins, was born on 24 September 1925 in Caulfield, Victoria. He was educated at Ivanhoe Church of England Grammar School, going on to study medicine at the University of Melbourne. Dr Jenkins worked as a general medical practitioner until 1961, when he entered the Victorian state parliament as Labor member for the Legislative Assembly seat of Reservoir, holding that seat until his resignation in 1969. He also served two terms in the Victorian state executive of the ALP, from 1958 to 1961 and from 1964 to 1968. Dr Jenkins entered federal parliament in 1969 after successfully standing as the ALP candidate for the electorate of Scullin. In May 1983, on the election of the Hawke government, Dr Jenkins was elected as Speaker of the House of Representatives, a position he held until his retirement from the parliament in 1985.
As one of the, I guess, reducing number of members who served in this parliament under Dr Jenkins' speakership, I personally associate myself very strongly with this motion. He was a person of good humour and considerable dignity, a friendly man who brought a great deal of skill and commitment to the post that he held. In the later years of his life he suffered indifferent health. In associating myself and my colleagues with this motion, I particularly want to extend my sympathy to his son, the current member for Scullin. As in the tradition of many families on both sides of this parliament, it is a case of a son following a father into a seat. I remember the by-election very well. I think it was the first by-election I fought as a fairly new opposition leader. I was profoundly unsuccessful, but, given the composition of the seat, it was barely surprising. I will not be uncharitable, and say that part of my lack of success was due to the quality of the Australian Labor Party candidate on that occasion.
He will be remembered as a Speaker with a good sense of humour and a firm hand when needed. He had some novel experiences to deal with. He is probably the only Speaker to occupy the chair who had to deal with the appearance of a member wearing a chicken suit in the chamber.
An opposition member—Name him!
—No, I will not do that. I do not think it would be charitable or in the spirit of the occasion for me to do that. I do not think for a moment that your friend, also from Tasmania—I am referring to `you know who'—would like that to be done.
A major innovation during his term as Speaker was reviewing the rules governing the televising and broadcasting of parliament, allowing a film library to build up, and the televising of budgets and responses for excerpting by news services. Dr Jenkins once said he would like to see a unit which continuously televised both houses, with various media outlets able to use what they wanted when they wanted. After leaving politics, Harry Jenkins was appointed as Ambassador to Spain, a post he held until 1988. In the 1991 Australia Day honours he was appointed a member of the Order of Australia and he was a recent recipient of the Centenary Medal. On behalf of the government, I extend to his wife, Wendy, their children, Harry, Tim, Mark and Jane, and to other family members and friends our most sincere sympathy in their sad loss and bereavement.

"Latham, Mark, MP",ALP,2004-08-03,"—I second the motion and thank the Prime Minister for his kind words in honour of a well-respected and well-regarded Labor member, the former Speaker Harry Jenkins. Harry's service to this parliament was part of a lifelong commitment to the community, especially in Melbourne's north. Harry Jenkins senior was from a relatively humble background, not privileged in any particular way, apart from the greatest privilege of all: he had loving parents who helped and encouraged him to succeed in life. He was a product of state primary schools, plus Ivanhoe Grammar and the University of Melbourne. He became a medical doctor, a member of two parliaments and the Speaker of this House.
He was also a part of that special generation who entered this parliament in 1969 signalling the rise of Labor's fortunes under Gough Whitlam. He was also one of no fewer than five medical doctors in the Labor caucus during the Whitlam government—this at a time when university educated MPs on both sides of the House were much rarer than they are today. But, with so many doctors in the House and the Senate, it was not surprising that Labor became the party of Medibank and then Medicare. As a GP who served in the working-class community of Melbourne's northern suburbs in the 1960s, no-one knew better than Harry Jenkins why Australia needed a universal health care system.
Harry Jenkins represented a type common to our party: he was the good man, the scholarship boy who worked hard and used his education for the benefit of those whom society had left behind; climbing the ladder and helping those less fortunate than himself do the same. I note from his maiden speech a concern to teach our young people not just work skills but also community mindedness and moral values, something he took seriously as an active long-time member of the Lions Club and a board member of hospitals and local charities. He was an environmentalist, an active member of this House's Standing Committee on the Environment and Conservation for 10 years. During this time, he promoted the importance of recycling and raised awareness about the effects of car emissions and smokestack pollution on the residents of his industrial constituency.
Harry Jenkins held many offices in our parliament. He served as Deputy Speaker, Chairman of the Parliamentary Labor Party and secretary of the Labor caucus between 1976 and 1978. The historians in the chamber will be aware of the circumstance by which the caucus minutes for those years disappeared, seemingly in suspicious circumstances, from the National Archives. Clyde Cameron subsequently accused Gough Whitlam of stealing them. He did that until Senator Faulkner found them years later filed in the wrong place—or so he reckons. Harry Jenkins was a very good minute taker—no wonder Clyde and Gough were so worried about those particular caucus minutes.
But most of all we remember Harry in this place for his role as a fine Speaker and Deputy Speaker. Mungo MacCallum wrote that Speaker Jenkins `had an ability to defuse potentially explosive situations in the chamber' through `a special relationship with both sides of the House.' Behaviour in the House deteriorated whenever he was absent and, as you know, Mr Speaker, it has not improved since.
Harry was a tolerant Speaker with a good sense of humour. He was the first Speaker to allow male members of the House to enter the chamber without wearing a tie, but he sensibly drew the line when Peter Staples came in wearing what was described as a lurid knitted cardigan instead of a jacket. There was of course the time when he had to deal with a member, referred to by the Prime Minister, who turned up on the Liberal benches late one night dressed in a chicken suit. The Australian reported that even Speaker Jenkins could not keep a straight face when at question time the next day the government whip asked the Minister for Primary Industry whether a certain amount of good luck was needed to remain in the chicken and egg business. The Canberra Times said that Harry Jenkins was `far too good a man to have to waste his valuable time subduing the loons and larrikins of the House', something I am sure, Mr Speaker, that you can relate to. 
In the serious part of his work, Harry cared very much about democracy and the parliament. The dismissal of the Whitlam government, especially the refusal of the Governor-General to meet the Speaker after the House passed its no-confidence motion, very much shook his belief in parliamentary sovereignty. So when he became the Speaker himself, he was zealous in protecting the independence of the parliament from the executive. He was not afraid to let Prime Minister Hawke know who was boss—not the easiest thing to do in its day. The current Prime Minister might remember being named and thrown out of the House during that time as well when he was still the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Harry agreed, probably unsurprisingly for someone in his position, that Speakers should be unopposed at federal elections. Of course he did not have to worry, holding a strong Labor seat like Scullin. We are fortunate to have had a good man like his son and namesake succeed him in this place, continuing the great family tradition of service to the people of Australia.
On behalf of my party and I am sure all members of the House I offer my warmest sympathies to the current member for Scullin for his loss, and I extend those sympathies to Harry senior's wife of 53 years, Wendy Jenkins, to his four children, eight grandchildren and great-granddaughter. We share their loss, we share this loss at this difficult time and we extend our condolences in this time of grief to the Jenkins family and right across this House.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Jenkins, the Hon.

"Anderson, John, MP",NATS,2004-08-03,"—I rise to express my condolences to the Jenkins family and to express solidarity with the remarks made by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. I note that upon Dr Jenkins' election as Speaker, Doug Anthony, the then Leader of the National Party, commented:
It is a pleasure to know that you have been elected unopposed. It is a pleasure because it shows the mark of respect that we on this side of the House have for you as a person. We have seen the way you have acted for the Speaker on many occasions during the past seven years. You have done that with great capacity, with great competence and in an unbiased manner.
He left the parliament some years before I came here but his good reputation as a thoroughly decent human being and a trustworthy member of the parliament were certainly still extant in this place when I came here. Without wishing to repeat unnecessarily those kind remarks that have been made, I would like to associate myself and my party with the motion before the House and to extend to the current member for Scullin and his family sincere sympathies.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Jenkins, the Hon. Dr Henry Alfred, AM</title>",Condolences,0,1,speech
"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2004-08-03,"—Yesterday the service of thanksgiving, celebration and farewell for Dr Harry Jenkins was held at the Plenty Ranges Arts and Convention Centre at South Morang on the outskirts of Melbourne. The location and the nature of the service were a very fitting tribute to a man who gave so much to his family, his local community and his country. You will recall yourself, Mr Speaker, the huge gum trees that surround the arts centre that we looked out on, which epitomise Dr Harry, his life and his contribution. As the Reverend David Peake said yesterday, the death of such a public figure is `the sharpest time, when the intimate and family part of a person's life come together with their public life.' For Wendy, Harry, Tim, Mark and Jane, their grandchildren and their very new great-granddaughter both yesterday and now today in the parliament are times of private sadness, but of course they also give us all a chance to celebrate a long life well lived. 
Dr Harry, as he was certainly known locally, was, both before he entered the parliament and after he left the parliament, a great community activist. As his daughter Jane said yesterday, Dr Harry was a great advocate for the Preston and Northcote Community Hospital and for the right of people with very little to have the very best health care. He continued this commitment as an active member of Lions. Dr Harry used his skills as a doctor and an advocate to pursue improved services, especially for people addicted to drugs. He was a member of Lions for a very long time, as Wendy has been, and they have both made a very significant contribution to community life through Lions. Dr Bob Coulthard described this very well yesterday.
Dr Harry started his political career in the state parliament and then moved to the federal parliament. Reading his first speech gives me a certain sense of deja vu. In 1970, he emphasised the critical importance of affordable higher education and spoke against what were then proposed university fee increases. In his first speech he said:
Bold thought is confined to the election platform and bold action is never seen, yet thousands of young people qualified for entry to tertiary institutions are turned away.
How true it was then and, unfortunately, is today. In 1982, he spoke passionately about implementing needs based funding for our schools. He said:
If we have a look at the resource level that is available now we see that many schools have been brought up to and beyond the appropriate resource level. But still a large number of government and parish schools are below the level of necessary resources.
...	...	...
I think there is a strong argument that we look at the needs principle and re-establish it on a reassessment of what the minimum resources should be.
I could not agree more. As we all know, Dr Harry was the Speaker of this House and, as Peter Morris said yesterday, he brought both his patience and sense of humour to the job. I am sure, Mr Speaker, both you and other Speakers would agree that these are essential qualities. Dr Harry's grand-daughter Stephanie Jenkins delivered what I would have to say was the most heartfelt speech yesterday on behalf of her grandmother Wendy. Apparently, Wendy had not wanted to marry either a doctor or a politician, but she got both, and they were together for more than 50 years. To Wendy and all the family, especially Harry, our thoughts are with you as we celebrate and give thanks for the life of Dr Harry.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Jenkins, the Hon. Dr Henry Alfred, AM</title>",Condolences,0,1,speech
"Costello, Peter, MP",LP,2004-08-03,"—I too want to associate myself with this condolence motion to Dr Harry Jenkins and especially to his family. As we have heard from the Prime Minister and others, Dr Harry Jenkins was elected to this House in 1969 and served through until 1985, when he resigned, and in a by-election the seat of Scullin was won by his son, Harry junior. The first time I met Dr Harry Jenkins was when I was handing out how-to-vote cards for the Liberal candidate in Scullin in the 1972 election. The Liberal candidate was Graeme McEwen, the then Young Liberal president, who subsequently became the Labor candidate against the member for McEwen in 1998, I believe. It was a wet day in Melbourne, and I was very unhappy to be handing out Liberal cards in the seat of Scullin, but I do remember Dr Harry Jenkins coming around the polling booth and being very polite and very kind to those of us who were stuck out in the cold. He need not have worried, because the coalition was going down in the 1972 election. I looked up the figures. He scored 62 per cent of the vote to the Liberal candidate's 26 per cent of the vote on first preferences. I do not think much has changed in Scullin since those days, but it has been a great seat for Dr Harry and for his son. 
When we were in opposition, we always used to favourably compare Dr Harry Jenkins as a Speaker to some of his successors. It was a favourite technique of ours to hold Dr Harry up as a model of a Speaker that could be emulated by some of his successors, and he always had a reputation as being one of the fairest Speakers. In fact, he actually claimed that, in order to overcome his bias, he had been too tolerant on the opposition, that he was giving them too much leeway—something I do not believe had that much basis in fact, because he also took the decision one day, I think in 1984, to eject the member for Bennelong, the member for Mitchell and the member for O'Connor all at the same time.
A government member—And none of us were guilty!
—Whilst I am prepared to say that at least one of those three may have been guilty, all three of them got taken out. Not all that much changes in this House. Dr Harry was somebody who advocated the Westminster tradition of a Speaker resigning from his party and not being challenged in by-elections. He said at the time he thought it would be a worthwhile reform but the parliament was not yet ready for it. And that was over 20 years ago—so whether the parliament will ever be ready for it is an open question.
Most parents see their greatest contribution to society as being their children, and I think any parent would be very proud to have a child follow them as a member of the House of Representatives. I know it must have given Dr Harry Jenkins great pride to see his son follow him into the seat of Scullin and into this parliament, and I think I can say that his son is somebody who commands a great deal of respect on both sides of this House. So to his wife, Wendy, and to the children, on behalf of the Liberal Party and this side of the House we offer our deepest condolences on the death of a very fine member of parliament and a fine Speaker.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Jenkins, the Hon.

"Jenkins, Harry, MP",ALP,2004-08-03,"—Mr Speaker, I had always hoped that I would not have to be placed in the position of speaking on a condolence motion for my predecessor as member for Scullin—not that I wished eternal life upon him but, selfishly, that mine would be a private not a public grieving. On behalf of my mother, Wendy, and the rest of the family, I thank the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Treasurer for their remarks today.
Yesterday I talked of the rich tapestry which was Dad's life and of the fact that there would be opportunities to share more memories, and today is one such occasion. When I look back on a number of the aspects of Dad's life that he shared with us that transcended both public and private, I reflect that one of the ideals that he was faithful to was the pursuit of global cooperation, believing that peace is achievable if as nations we better understand each other. In all facets of Dad's life I believe he tried to achieve this. 
Whilst it might seem a minor and trivial thing, he gave each of us as kids the opportunity to travel. We were all exchange students or had opportunities to live in another culture. And in return our house was host to a number of exchange students. So over the past few days it has not been surprising that we have received emails from the Philippines and all parts of North America because of that—from people who as part of our extended family have shared in our grief.
The Treasurer interestingly has raised the election of 2 December 1972. I was going to speak about one aspect of that but I now will be talking about two aspects. On the night of the election, as was Dad's tradition the victory party was in the backyard of the house and, of course, because of the result you can imagine what type of victory party it was. But I always reflect upon how generous Dad was in taking in any of the people that we had accumulated as friends. So on this night a bunch of boozy med students who were colleagues of mine from Monash arrived and wanted to join in the festivities. I was a little bit worried about Dad's attitude because they sort of descended upon us, but he was open, warm and, as they were mates of mine, he allowed them to stay.
The interesting thing for them was that they had come upon the rough and tumble of Labor politics in Reservoir in the celebration in Scullin, but earlier in the night they had been in the leafy, more genteel suburb of Middle Park where they had been celebrating with the family of the then member for Melbourne Ports. Dave Crean was one of my university mates at that time. That year was my third and last year as a med student; Dave went on to greater success. But I was very pleased that Frank, David and Simon Crean, amongst a whole host of other people, joined with us yesterday at the service. I am indebted to a number of colleagues in this place that attended: to you, Mr Speaker; to the President of the Senate; and to a number of former colleagues both of mine and my father's from both sides of the House that joined with us. It is interesting that, if we look at the Labor representation, they represented all sorts of groupings and tendencies and all sorts of machinations, and I think that that was a reflection on the way that Dad was looked upon.
The other aspect of the election of 1972 is that I congratulate the Treasurer on being honest about the candidate that he was supporting and, of course, say to him that unwittingly two elections ago, when that same candidate stood for the Labor Party, I campaigned for him. It was not until a bit down the track that I and a number of people remembered that he had a track record. I can only say that that was probably something my Dad brought me up to have: a great deal of forgiveness—and I think we displayed that on that occasion.
The final public appearance that my Dad made was last Remembrance Day when I was overseas—some people will say that I have inherited that from my father. I was in China; as I significantly found out, it was one of the few places that he did not actually visit. The event was a community celebration for the re-erection of a flag pole in a commemorative garden at the Epping Memorial Hall, which in the past had been the major memorial to those from the local community that had lost their lives. Because the RSL had moved, it had been a bit lost that the Epping Memorial Hall had some significance. The government was good enough to give us a grant under the Saluting Their Service program, and we were able to re-erect this commemoration. Because I was overseas, I asked Dad if he would be able to deputise for me. So the local RSL made sure that transport was arranged to pick him up from the nursing home that had become his home, and he went there to act on my behalf. I have to say—and I probably should not say it—that the Epping RSL was probably more pleased to have him than me at that particular occasion, but I was always grateful that even up to that late stage in his life he could take those things as something that he saw as part of his duty. 
I do not think that there is the need for me to add any more because there will be other occasions, as I have said, when we can remember the significance that he made to this place, the significance he made to the nation, the significance he made to the community, but most importantly the significant effect he had on the whole family. So we thank everyone who over the last few days has paid tribute to a fine and admired husband, father, grandfather, great-grandfather, friend, mentor, mate, colleague and comrade. Reverend David Peake in a private moment, when we went for the private cremation, advised the family to walk gently with our grief and to be kind to ourselves. The support that I have received and that the family has received from parliamentary colleagues has made that all the easier. I thank the House for this condolence motion.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Jenkins, the Hon. Dr Henry Alfred, AM</title>",Condolences,0,1,speech
"SPEAKER, The",N/A,2004-08-03,"—It was my honour yesterday as Speaker of the House of Representatives, along with a number of colleagues, to represent all colleagues at the funeral of the Hon. Dr Harry Jenkins. I rise now because this is the one occasion when as Speaker I have had a motion before me which recognises the life and role of a former Speaker. I want to join all members in expressing the sympathy of the House to the Jenkins family. Dr Jenkins as a former member for Scullin, former Speaker, former Ambassador to Spain and former prominent member of the association of Australian Lions clubs had an impact on all of those people with whom he worked. There was a real sense in which yesterday's funeral service had about it an appropriate note of celebration that caught us all.
I wanted to rise because in 1983 when I entered this chamber Dr Jenkins had just become the Speaker. Only the Minister for Science, the member for Gippsland, and I came in as new members of the opposition. Dr Jenkins ensured that we were made as welcome as any other member and that the courtesy, wise counsel and unselfish advice he extended to members of his own party were extended equally to those in the opposition at the time, particularly to the Minister for Science and me as two new members. As previous speakers have said, he maintained the proud traditions of the chair and had a reputation for impartiality that all of us who have followed him would envy.
For all that was eloquently said yesterday about his role as a local GP, as a member of the state and federal parliaments, as Speaker, as ambassador and as a member of Lions International, what I will never forget—let me say this sincerely to the member for Scullin, my colleague as Deputy Speaker—is the tribute paid to him by his daughter Jane, by his grand-daughter Stephanie, who was reading remarks that her grandmother had written, and by Harry, the member for Scullin, in his fine speech to his father.
Harry, yesterday and again today you have indicated why it is that your father is remembered so fondly by everybody, for he is remembered not only as politician and as Presiding Officer but also as parent. The contribution of the family yesterday and the celebration of his role in family life is something that will live with me forever and something that marks this particular condolence motion as one which is special and one with which we all want to be identified. On behalf of all members of the House, I extend to the member for Scullin and to his family, particularly to his mother, our sincere sympathy.

Does the Prime Minister also concede that this problem can be addressed through amendments to the enabling legislation in the Senate, especially through the creation of a new penalty regime for dodgy patents?

"Howard, John, MP",LP,2004-08-03,"—In answer to the Leader of the Opposition, no, I do not concede that. If we had conceded that, we would never have approved the agreement in the first place. What the Leader of the Opposition has got to do is finally make up his mind where he stands on this. I read the statement put out by the Leader of the Opposition before his press conference following the caucus meeting and there was no mention of conditionality in that statement. Yet, in answer to questions, he inferred that Labor's support for the free trade agreement was conditional on the government putting forward amendments along the lines that the Leader of the Opposition has suggested, and also in relation to local content. Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition: I would have thought that after five months he would have finally made up his mind, but it seems as though he has not.
Our position is clear; it has been clear for 5½ months. We support this agreement because it is good for Australia. It was good for Australia when it was signed. It would not have been signed if it had not been good for Australia. It would not have been signed if it carried within it the seeds of any diminution in the high quality of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The Leader of the Opposition knows that we have a robust patent regime in this country and if companies make applications which are spurious and ill based for extension of patents those applications will be thrown out. That is the position at the present time and nothing that the Leader of the Opposition has said suggests to me that amendments or changes along the lines that he has in mind are necessary. The Leader of the Opposition should finally get off the fence, take a decision and stick up for Australia.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Trade: Free Trade Agreement</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,answer

The questions before the parliament are these: is this nation more or less secure than it was before the Iraq war, is the nation more or less secure from terrorism than it was before the Iraq war, is the nation more or less secure in South-East Asia than it was before the Iraq war, is the nation's intelligence machinery in first-class working order, and are the nation's intelligence-sharing relationships with our friends and allies in the region and beyond in first-class working order?
These are reasonable questions to ask eight long years into the history of the Howard government—the self-proclaimed party of national security. Regrettably, the answer to each of the questions I have just asked lies in the negative. It is a puzzling thing that, when it comes to this party proclaiming itself to be the natural party of national security, the Prime Minister is permanently draped in the Australian flag but when it comes to the crunch, whenever there is a doubt, the Prime Minister will always be found down there, playing politics with the core questions of national security before our nation. When it comes to national security under the Howard government, our experience in this place is that we are always up against the Howard doctrines. 
The first Howard doctrine is: never tell the truth. Honest John is loose with the truth. That is the first cardinal principle, the first Howard doctrine. The second Howard doctrine on national security is: always blame somebody else. The doctrine of ministerial accountability in this government has become the doctrine of the ministerial hospital pass. We saw it with `kids overboard'. We remember `kids overboard'. It was not the Prime Minister's responsibility; it was the responsibility of those 16 officials and advisers who mysteriously knew that there was a problem. It was never the PM's responsibility; it was always someone else's. We saw it with Iraqi POWs: do not blame the Prime Minister; just blame Defence, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the 10 situation reports from Baghdad which detailed prisoner abuse in that country. Do not blame the Prime Minister; blame the Public Service. And now we see it with Iraqi weapons of mass destruction: do not blame the Prime Minister; just blame the spooks—blame the Australian spooks, blame the British spooks, blame the American spooks, blame Iceland, blame French Guiana, blame Uncle Tom Cobbly, blame anybody except the Prime Minister, because he is not responsible for anything these days. The core element of the Howard doctrine is this: when there is policy failure, it is always the responsibility of the Public Service; it is never the responsibility of the Prime Minister. It is the doctrine of the ministerial hospital pass.
But here is the problem: the Flood report, for all its limitations, makes it very difficult for the hospital pass to be sold when it comes to our intelligence agencies over Iraq as the Prime Minister has sought to do. The Prime Minister is well skilled in these crafts. Of course, we saw what he tried to do when the Flood report came out, and that was engage once again in setting up a straw man. What was the straw man on this occasion? Ask: did I, John Howard, personally influence the intelligence bureaucracy to produce each of these reports? Add a Philip Flood who says, `No,' then John Howard self-proclaims innocence, closes down debate and the situation is over. John Howard created the straw man, then said, `There is the test. Wacko, I happen to have passed it. No problem.'
Leave aside a few complications, including that the Jull committee report warned about the intelligence bureaucracy being subject to policy running hard—that is, policy decisions already taken and therefore potentially influencing intelligence assessments. Leave to one side also what Jull reported in terms of the conclusions of the DIO in its testimony, when it said that the Americans were going to go to war anyway in Iraq, irrespective of what the intelligence said. Of course, if that was the case, here in Australia the intelligence bureaucracy would have concluded: `Oh no, our John Howard will be completely independent. If the Americans have decided to go to war, our Prime Minister will not automatically go to war.' Of course these conclusions fell into the collective consciousness of the Australian intelligence bureaucracy as they shaped their analyses. That is the point that was made, sensibly, in the Jull committee report. However, the whole point of this debate is that John Howard constructed that as a straw man to distract us from the core elements of the entire proposition before us. That is what he has done in his eight years as Prime Minister, because he sought to absolve himself of any responsibility—any attention in this place or beyond—for what he should have done as Prime Minister. 
You are Prime Minister of Australia, and you are about to take a country to war in a country in which we have not often been to war. It is called Iraq. It is a fairly novel experience for this country to go to war, so there are a few basic questions for the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, who was responsible for ensuring that your own intelligence agency had enough assets in it to deal with this problem? We found out that it did not have enough assets. Prime Minister, why were the ONA's total appropriations higher in Labor's last year in office than in each of the Prime Minister's subsequent seven years in office? How could that have been? Prime Minister, who was responsible for the fact that in the lead-up to the Iraq war there were only three—one, two, three—individuals in the Office of National Assessments responsible for providing, on behalf of the Prime Minister himself, a totally independent intelligence assessment of this mountain of material coming in from Washington and London? According to Flood, none of those three had one skerrick of WMD expertise—not one.
This is our Prime Minister, underresourcing his own intelligence agency and not allowing there to be sufficient staff to handle the material and tasks they were given, and then they were expected to somehow produce an independent assessment. Prime Minister, who was responsible for the fact that there were no more staff in the ONA in Labor's last year in office than in any of your subsequent eight years in office? Prime Minister, who also was responsible for not initiating a national assessment on Iraq? This is made play of in the Flood report—and quite rightly so. Why is it an important matter? It is because, when it came to not calling for a national assessment on Iraq, plainly in the lead-up to the Iraq war you had varying opinions from the ONA, the DIO and other elements of the international intelligence community. This Prime Minister, who has a formal responsibility to draw the threads together, did not see it as his job to say: `We need a formal and final national assessment on Iraq before we go tripping off into war.' He failed to do that as well. He failed to do the things that were contained in the question which the member for Brand put to the Prime Minister before. As Flood also notes, there was a lack of intelligence assessment on such key things as:
... the strategic cost implications for Australia of contributing to military action against Iraq, the likely strategic costs and issues involved in post-Saddam Iraq and the impact of military action on the safety of Australia and Australians.
I would have thought that the Prime Minister of Australia had some responsibility to undertake these tasks. Instead, the prime ministerial doctrine of non-responsibility takes over. Whack! The hospital pass. It is over to the intelligence community. It is their job, and their job alone.
So where do we get to as far as the Prime Minister's handling of this matter concerning the war is concerned? He failed to resource his intelligence agency to meet the demands they faced; he failed to ask the intelligence community for a formal pre-assessment in Iraq; on the basis of the intelligence he did have on Iraq, which Flood said was `thin, incomplete and ambiguous', he then decided to take the country to war; then we have a Prime Minister who exaggerated the intelligence information he had in his possession. If you wish to find evidence of that, you only need to go again to the Jull committee, which found: 
... the case made by the government was that Iraq possessed WMD in large quantities and posed a grave and unacceptable threat to the region and the world, particularly as there was a danger that Iraq's WMD might be passed to terrorist organisations.
And Jull's conclusion—remember, it was a Liberal chair and a Liberal-dominated committee—was:
This is not the picture that emerges from an examination of all the assessments provided to the Committee by Australia's two analytical agencies.
There you have Jull on behalf of that Liberal-dominated committee saying that basically the Prime Minister exaggerated the case. So far we have a very sobering record indeed for the Prime Minister. Where does all this leave us? Well, we have seen the first Howard doctrine in full flight: never tell the truth. We have seen the second Howard doctrine in full flight: always blame the Public Service; never blame the Prime Minister. Remember, the doctrine is the doctrine of the ministerial hospital pass, not the doctrine of ministerial accountability. But when all else fails—when doctrine 1 fails and doctrine 2 fails—there is always the government's secret weapon. The government's secret weapon when they find themselves in a national security jam, the weapon of last resort, is Alexander John Gosse Downer—lion of Manila; hero of Madrid; friend of East Timor. That is him, right over there: this nation's answer to Talleyrand.
You would think that after a few failures in the foreign policy field he would have a bit of modesty about him—a bit of intelligence failure here, a bit there; some problems with Bali; some problems with Iraq; what happened with Brigitte—well, it is not going too flash overall. You would think our foreign minister, with all of that happening, would say, `I think it is time we just toned it down a little in terms of providing moral lectures to our friends and neighbours,' but, oh, no—not our Alex. What does he do? He declares war on the Spanish socialist government. Not content there, he heads rapidly eastwards to Manila. We are off to Manila, because we are in the business of Alexander Downer's school of diplomacy called `Winning friends and influencing people'. We are off to Manila, and there he applies his same craft to the poor old Filipinos. Here we have Captain Cream Puff describing the Filipinos as a bunch of marshmallows. I have to conclude that when it comes to Labor policy—
—Ms Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I request that members be referred to by their correct title.
 (Ms Corcoran)—Member for Griffith, I ask that you take the point.
—Labor policy, like the government's, is this: we do not believe in negotiating with terrorists. But I tell you where we do not have the same approach as this government; our approach is this: when you are a diplomat, the job is to use diplomacy to convey a message. This is a novel doctrine for the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I had thought, until recently, he was our chief diplomat. No. Instead he takes out the megaphone, holds it up to our friends in Manila and blasts them for their recent actions. Why does this matter? The reason it matters is that we have a fundamental continuing challenge to Australian security called terrorism in South-East Asia. There are two countries in the front line of this: one is Indonesia and the other is the Philippines.
In the Philippines there are three significant organisations of great interest to Australian intelligence and security authorities: MILF, Abu Sayyaf and Jemaah Islamiah. We are told in reports which are declassified that Jemaah Islamiah has recently re-established two training bases—where? In the Philippines. And my question to Talleyrand opposite is this: how, without the political cooperation of the government in Manila, does he expect to deal with this terrorist threat in the Philippines? Is he going to take a leaf out of John `Lionhearted' Howard's textbook by adopting again the doctrine of unilateral military pre-emption and going in there and sorting out the mess himself? Is that his view? 
I thought that the correct policy approach was to work with your friends and partners in the region. Pardon us, Minister, for just being a little old-fashioned on these things. It certainly brings back some memories, Minister—memories of when the Prime Minister some time ago announced his doctrine of military pre-emption. Do you recall what happened then, only a couple of years ago? Reactions from the Philippines, reactions from Malaysia and reactions from Indonesia put our bilateral security intelligence cooperation arrangements with these governments into the sin-bin for several months, at a time when we had a responsibility to deal with these things at the front line.
And why is it important? How many Australians travel through South-East Asia each year? In the year 2002-03, one and a half million Australians travelled to or through South-East Asia. How many Australians live and work in South-East Asia? Forty-five thousand Australians. I would have thought it was smart to get on with our neighbours; to work with our neighbours rather than against them. The minister's response to ambassadors being called in, told to pull their heads in and warned of breaches in the bilateral relationship is, `It's all perfectly normal.' Minister, when you stand up at the dispatch box, tell us how many times our ambassador in Manila has been hauled in in the last eight years to be formally diplomatically reprimanded by the government of the Philippines. Tell us how many times that has happened in the last eight years when it comes to Madrid.
Minister, the bottom line is this: you are out of control. You are not doing your job. You are not up to your job any more. The bottom line is, when it comes to you exercising the high office of foreign minister of the Commonwealth of Australia, you act as a permanent commentator on the Labor Party and a permanent commentator on other governments around the world, when your central tasks as foreign minister of the Commonwealth of Australia remain unattended to—challenges of terrorism here in South-East Asia, an emerging crisis in the Taiwan Strait, the Korean peninsula and unresolved humanitarian crises in Sudan. Minister, it is time you went! (Time expired)",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Intelligence and National Security</title>,Matters of Public Importance,13,1,speech
"Downer, Alexander, MP",LP,2004-08-03,"—One of the things that has amused me about the member for Griffith recently is his complaint that occasionally I may criticise the Labor Party. This is the pattern of Latham Labor: they can dish it out, but they cannot take it. To criticise the Labor Party is to cross the Rubicon for the Australian Labor Party. This matter of public importance is yet another desperate attempt by the Australian Labor Party to smear the government. But the member for Griffith does more than smear the government. He smears Australian public servants and, in particular, he smears the reputation of officers working in the Australian intelligence community. And obviously, in passing, Mr Flood gets a bit of a flick as well.
I think, after the production of the Flood report, the Butler report, the Hutton report and the United States Senate report, it is about time the Labor Party apologised for some of the things it has said and for some of the claims that it has made in relation to Iraq and national security because they have been found, not surprisingly, to be completely untrue. One of the observations I would make about the member for Griffith is that included in the usual fusillade of personal abuse and denigration is the lack of a forensic mind. He is a man who is unable to drill into an issue forensically and get the argument right. That is one of the reasons why so much of his ranting and raving does not cut through to the people who should matter to the member for Griffith, the Australian people. I do not think they are listening to the member for Griffith. 
—They listen to you!
—They do listen to me; you are quite right.
—They don't like it.
 (Ms Corcoran)—The member for Griffith has had his turn.
—The member for Griffith has made several claims over the last few months which have been found through a series of investigations, including the Flood report, to be completely false. The first claim which has been made over and over again by the member for Griffith—and occasionally by the Leader of the Opposition, though it is pretty clear his staff have stopped him saying this more recently—and which has not, I suspect, been made by the member for Brand is that the government went to war in Iraq on a lie; that the government lied to take Australia to war in Iraq. In other words, we knew what we were saying to be manifestly false and we went out and said it all the same. That is what the member for Griffith has claimed. That in itself is a lie, and that has been proved to be a lie not just by the Flood report but by the Hutton report, by the United States Senate report and by the Butler report.
I think the Labor Party—or, more specifically, the member for Griffith—owes the Australian people an apology because he has been grossly dishonest with the Australian public. The Flood report and other reports have cleared this government, the American government, the British government and the Polish government of deliberately misleading our people, including the Australian people. Mr Flood said:
... the only government in the world that claimed Iraq was not working on, and did not have, biological and chemical weapons or prohibited missile systems was the Government of Saddam Hussein.
The second claim is that the intelligence agencies resorted to policy driven analysis and had concluded, `We had better not serve the government up something too difficult.' This is a constant claim made by the member for Griffith, and he made it again today. In other words, he claims that those people beavering away in a series of different agencies—some of them are analytical agencies, not intelligence collection agencies; there is some confusion about that—like the people who work in the Office of National Assessments or the Defence Intelligence Organisation, and the people who collect intelligence for ASIO and the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, are just political cronies of the government. He claims that they are so weak, so shallow and so vacuous that all they do is the bidding of the government.
That is an obscene thing to say about good public servants. I think these people have a great deal more backbone than that and, in my experience—I have 8½ years of experience; the member for Griffith has not had any experience as a minister and, although he was a junior diplomat, he has not had experience of dealing with high-level intelligence—I have never come across an example where our intelligence agencies are just acting as the fools for the government. These are highly professional, highly educated and highly sophisticated people who do excellent work, not just for the government but for Australia. Nobody is hired or fired in our intelligence services, or threatened in our assessment agencies, if they do not happen to agree with the government. The Flood report said there is: 
... no evidence of politicisation of the assessments on Iraq, either overt or perceived.
You can take Mr Flood's word or you can take the member for Griffith's word, and one of them is not telling the truth.
—What about Mr Jull's report?
—And the member for Griffith says Mr Flood is not telling the truth.
—What about Mr Jull?
—In the court of public opinion, I would stack up Mr Flood's reputation against the member for Griffith's any day of the week.
—Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The minister just said that I said that Mr Flood was a liar. I did not interject that at all. I interjected about whether he was challenging Mr Jull's credentials.
—You had your time. There is no point of order.
—Nor is there evidence—and I quote the Flood report:
...that any analyst or manager was the subject of either direct or implied pressure to come to a particular judgment on Iraq for policy reasons, or to bolster the case for war.
I make the same point again so that this time the member for Griffith does not misunderstand. Either that statement by Mr Flood is true or what the member for Griffith says is true. One of them is not telling the truth, and the member for Griffith is clearly making the argument that Mr Flood is a liar, that Mr Flood is not telling the truth. That statement is either true or not true, and the member for Griffith has been making the argument that it is not true.
Claim No. 3 is that the government sent troops based `on a purpose that was not true in search of weapons of mass destruction that did not exist'. This claim was made by the Leader of the Opposition on 12 July this year. What does the Flood report say? It says that the assessments:
... reflected reasonably the available information and used intelligence sources with appropriate caution—
and that the obverse conclusion—and this is very important to understand—that Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction, `would have been a much more difficult conclusion to substantiate'. And what about this:
There is no debate or dispute as to whether Saddam Hussein possesses weapons of mass destruction.
He does.
That was not said by me or by the Prime Minister; that was said by the member for Griffith on Lateline on 24 September 2002. He makes the argument that he was telling the truth then, but that if we ever made that point we were not telling the truth.
You do not need to be forensic to work out that that is a very dumb argument. You do not have to be Inspector Clouseau to see that that argument does not stack up. The member for Barton, who is a lawyer, would understand what I am saying only too well. Your argument does not stack up. The fact is you cannot argue that if the government said that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq the government is lying, but if the member for Griffith says it he is telling the truth. I think not! I do not think that argument actually works. More than that, the member for Griffith does have a fig leaf of defence. His fig leaf of defence is, `I only said that on the basis of the briefings I had been given by ONA.' ONA are a pack of liars anyway, I suppose. He also said, `No, actually, I checked.' That is not true either. The date of 24 September 2002 was the day before the member for Griffith had his first briefing on Iraq and weapons of mass destruction from ONA. Oh, dear! 
Claim No. 4: the government misled the Australian people. I remember this; I was up in Queensland. Mr Rudd claimed that the government `misled the Australian people on the Iraqi nuclear program', particularly in relation to the claim that Iraq had sought to import uranium from Africa. That was said by Rudd on 10 July 2003. We had this over and over again in the middle of last year—during winter last year when I was in Queensland—that we had lied about uranium from Niger. This is the old line of the Labor Party: if you do not agree with the Labor Party you are a liar, even if the Labor Party is making the same argument.
The Hutton and Butler reports both concluded that the intelligence was `reasonable' and that statements that Iraq sought uranium from Africa were `well founded'. Oops! We are told here that the government had lied and now we are told that the assessments made by the British government were reasonable and well founded. Oh, dear! The ALP's unfounded attacks on the government are bad enough, but they are besmirching reputations. Not all of them—the member for Barton does not do this and other members do not, like the member for Brand. But the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Griffith—deeply inexperienced—besmirch the reputation of Australian intelligence agencies without reason or justification. Mr Flood said:
... Australian intelligence agencies are performing well overall, and represent a potent capability for government. All have adapted to the major challenges posed by global terrorism and increased requirements for support to deployed Australian forces ... the quality of assessment provided to government has been generally very good and, just as importantly, independent of political influence.
Either these intelligence officers are tools of the government, are the fools of the government—as claimed by the member for Griffith—or, as Mr Flood has said, these people do an excellent job for Australia. Again, given the integrity of Mr Flood versus the integrity of the member for Griffith, I know which side I would come down on in those assessments.
There is no hiding from a simple fact, and that is this: if the Labor Party had its way today and the world had listened to the Labor Party—a rather improbable proposition—then in those circumstances Saddam Hussein would still be in office today. Saddam Hussein would still be running Iraq today. Do we care? Does that matter? Would the Iraqis be better off with Saddam Hussein? Ask the Iraqis. Ask the Iraqis whether they would rather have Saddam Hussein in office. I know the opposition thinks that it is nice to get rid of Saddam Hussein, with a `pity we had to do it' kind of approach. I know the Iraqis will be eternally grateful for the fact that Saddam Hussein has been expunged from power. The fact is that he was a brutal and terrible man. He had weapons of mass destruction. He used them against his own people. He attacked and invaded his neighbours. I think there has got to be a point in international affairs where the world says, `Enough is enough.'
What does the Labor Party say? The Labor Party, particularly under the relatively new Leader of the Opposition, makes up policy on the run—just like it did today, by the way, on the free trade agreement with the United States; it came up with another idea. In this particular case, it has had nine different positions on the so-called `troops out by Christmas' policy. The Labor Party says it will not negotiate with terrorists and that we should be firm and stalwart. But the Labor Party also seems to be blind to the signal that its cut-and-run policy sends to these thugs, to the Iraqi people, to the leaders, to the United Nations and even to Senator John Kerry, who have all sought our continued support for Iraq's security. 
So the fact is that the Labor Party offers only an erratic hand on the tiller. If there is any doubt about that, one only has to look at the Leader of the Opposition. I saw the scratchie ad that it was putting out. On the scratchies, you scratch off John Howard and then you scratch another one and out comes Peter Costello. On a Labor Party scratchie, you scratch off Mark Latham and underneath appears Mark Latham. For the second year, you scratch off Mark Latham and underneath appears Mark Latham. In the third year, you scratch off Mark Latham and underneath, who appears? Mark Latham. If you vote for Mark Latham, you get Mark Latham.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Intelligence and National Security</title>,Matters of Public Importance,13,1,speech
"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,2004-08-03,"—I think the strongest point in the minister's argument—which is one that the government repeatedly return to—is that if there had been no invasion of Iraq Saddam Hussein would not have been expunged, I think the word was, from world politics. The trouble with that argument, of course, is that in early March 2003 the Prime Minister said—and I think it was in this House—that if it were not for the threat of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, or words to this effect, the prospect of regime change would not in itself justify the invasion of Iraq. The problem that we face in the world, but that we specifically face as an Australian people, is that there was no game plan for that scenario—that is, the regime game plan.
In what I think it is fair to say is a pretty soft critique of the government's actions, what I believe are nonetheless the most damning passages in the Flood report indicate that we essentially invaded Iraq on the basis of two joint reports prepared by ONA and DIO. As noted, those two joint reports were short pieces: one was two pages and one was 3½ pages. Private security agencies advising clients with interests in Iraq were doing much more than the Australian government required before making a decision to send Australian men and women to risk injury and possible death in a war in Iraq. In terms of the game plan for expunging Saddam Hussein from the international political scene, the Flood report says frankly in respect of those two documents, one of two pages and one of 3½ pages:
One or both of these documents might have also covered areas relevant to Australia's interests on which there was little intelligence assessment: the strategic cost implications for Australia of contributing to military action against Iraq, the likely strategic costs and issues involved in post-Saddam Iraq, and the impact of military action on the safety of Australia and Australians.
The member for Brand today asked the Prime Minister why those agencies were not required to advise the government on what one would think, in terms of any basic management of a military action, had to be questions. The trouble is that those questions were never asked, because we went in there on a false premise. Again in question time today the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs hung their hats on the Flood report's conclusion that `on the basis of the available information, ONA and DIO drew the most likely conclusions'. This is the problem: we are talking about the inadequacy of that available information, which again was criticised by the Flood report as being `ambiguous and incomplete'. The Flood report did conclude—and this is unquestionably a fact in the document: 
ONA's judgment, while reasonably argued, has not been borne out by what has been found in Iraq ...
It is a fact that there have been no weapons of mass destruction found in Iraq. Clearly the government went to war on a false premise. There is no escaping that logic at all.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs accused us of attacking public servants. There is no attack of public servants, because again, in respect of issues of accountability of our intelligence agencies, as must necessarily be the case, the Flood report said:
... fundamentally it is ministers—with their high level of control over agencies—on whom much of the responsibility will fall.
That is in terms of issues of accountability. The Flood report goes on to say that ministers and their staff:
... should be alert to signs of sub-optimal practice, both in terms of propriety and efficiency.
If a government is requesting advice about whether we send Australian men and women to war and does not ask those obvious questions about the scenarios after the hot conflict is over, it is gross inefficiency, not on the part of the public servants but on the part of those ministers who have responsibility over those agencies, including the Minister for Foreign Affairs.
In terms of spin, there is no hesitation about using these organisations. If you read between the lines of the Flood report, there is a subtle critique which refers to the Prime Minister seeking ONA's assistance in vetting his speeches on, I think, five occasions. If you read between the lines, the Flood report is somewhat critical that those drawing on the material—that is, material checked by the intelligence agencies—should be clear about the role played by the intelligence agency so that there is no room for inference that the speech as a whole, or all the conclusions drawn from the intelligence, have the intelligence agency's imprimatur. So, if there is any argument that our security agencies have been compromised in terms of the use made of their services, that statement—again, reading between the lines—is a criticism of the government for seeking to endorse its political rhetoric by reliance on those agencies.
In terms of the ultimate outcome, we are entitled to frame these questions: have the war in Iraq and Australia's participation in the war in Iraq made the world less safe or more safe? Indeed, has our involvement in the war in Iraq, on a premise that was clearly wrong on the basis of the facts as identified in the Flood report, made Australians more or less vulnerable to terrorist attacks? Quite frankly, I think that to pose those two questions is to answer them. We are seeing spin on the part of this government, not only in terms of foreign policy and military action but also, as I have indicated in my statements today, in terms of the measures that the government is continuing to announce in respect of homeland security. Of course there has been a significant increase in funding of national security measures since the September 11 attacks. In particular, as the Flood report identifies, we probably did not pull our fingers out sufficiently hastily until after the Bali bombings. Be that as it may, it would be the grossest of neglect on the part of any modern government not to increase resourcing of national security measures.
What we resent, however, is the government shamelessly claiming in headlines enhancements to national security measures when in fact all they are doing in many instances is announcing a continuation of existing programs and in some instances, indeed, camouflaging reductions in programs by bundling some programs up into others. There was a classic example just last week when the Prime Minister with great fanfare flew into Karratha—indeed, probably diverting the activities of Coastwatch surveillance aircraft—and held the relevant press conference under the heading `Strengthening Australia's border protection' to announce a $135 million commitment to Coastwatch. The trouble is that later that day the Minister for Justice and Customs, responding to one of my comments, said, `There has been no reduction in funding of Coastwatch.' In other words, all this fanfare to claim a strengthening of Australia's border protection, which included diverting planes from their task, was merely to commit to an extension or a lack of reduction of an existing program. We are seeing that repeatedly with a number of issues that I have identified in a press release today. 
When it comes to national security, Australians are entitled to the facts. Australians are not fools. They will not be taken for mugs. They expect and are entitled to expect additional national security measures—but they are entitled to know when they are additional and not simply a gilding of the lily by the reannouncement of an existing program.

"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,2004-08-03,"—I have listened to the two previous speakers and to the fairly personal, somewhat hysterical, attack by the member for Griffith in terms of this issue and have observed his credibility on it. I have watched his various permutations on issues which vary from those of his leader. One suspects that at the bottom line his view of Iraq and what should be done, especially about keeping troops there, is very different from that of the Leader of the Opposition. You only have to watch the performances of the member for Griffith on television to recognise that that is the case. On the night after the announcement of the withdrawal of the troops from Spain was made, he was to be seen on television saying, `Well, we need to leave the troops in there. We might have disagreed with being involved in Iraq; nevertheless, as part of the coalition of the willing, we have a responsibility towards Iraq to stay there.' That was about 24 hours after the Spanish had announced their position. And of course we watched as the somewhat precipitate announcement was made by the Leader of the Opposition that the Labor Party would withdraw the troops by Christmas—if we have the misfortune of them coming into power—and the opposition spokesperson for foreign affairs, the member for Griffith, certainly fell into line with that position. It is interesting to listen to him in terms of credibility; from watching his position vis-a-vis that of the Leader of the Opposition, there seems to me to be some degree of chasm between the two in terms of credibility.
Let us go to the issues before us. First, we can ask whether there was an alternative view at the time in relation to the weapons of mass destruction: was there a credible world view that these weapons of mass destruction did not exist in Iraq? If we look at all of the world authorities at the time, each of the countries around the world—including France and Germany, which opposed involvement in Iraq—said that they believed weapons of mass destruction existed in Iraq. Looking at United Nations Security Council resolutions adopted under chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, in particular resolutions 678, 687 and 1441, it can be seen that they provide clear authority for the use of force against Iraq for the purposes of disarming Iraq of weapons of mass destruction and restoring international peace and security to the region. That is the UN view on it. That is the world view in relation to weapons of mass destruction.
The member for Griffith says that we should have some special knowledge which is totally distinct from that. We can look at his own statements. He said on Lateline on 24 September 2002: 
There is no debate or dispute as to whether Saddam Hussein possesses weapons of mass destruction.
He does.
He comes into the House today and attacks the Minister for Foreign Affairs for his position on weapons of mass destruction when he himself agreed with the position on the WMDs. He was not alone in doing that. I participated in debate on Iraq with none other than Richard Butler. Richard Butler at that time, I remember well, said, `There is no argument that weapons of mass destruction exist in Iraq and it is a concern for everybody that that is the situation.'
The second part of the question is: would the world be better off if Saddam Hussein were left in Iraq? One thing that the member for Griffith has not mentioned is the gross human rights record of Saddam Hussein—some 300,000 of his own people were found, through the unearthing of mass graves, to have been butchered, tortured, destroyed by Saddam Hussein. Would it have been appropriate for him to be left there? In terms of the argument today, we would conclude from the member for Griffith that, yes, it would have been all right to have left him there—so it would have become 500,000 people who were killed; perhaps one million people. Is there no basis on which we can say enough is enough with this tyrant who was in place in Iraq and who the world is very glad to see has been removed?
I was in Indonesia. Dr Rais, the president of the upper house in the Indonesian parliament, when asked about Saddam Hussein, said—and this is before the war in Iraq began—there was no doubt that the world would be far better off if Saddam Hussein were removed. He questioned whether we should go to war but nevertheless said Saddam Hussein should be removed. He said, `I wish there were some other way he could be removed.' This came from a Muslim country, one of our partners, who made that very clear.
The third question that should be asked in relation to this debate is: does the ALP have any better record in terms of their position on Iraq? The fact is that we have seen seven different positions in relation to the withdrawal of troops from Iraq by Christmas. We have the redefinitions, as the member for Griffith becomes somewhat agitated about his leader and what he says actually means. First of all, we are to have no troops left, then some of those who are involved in civil aviation are to remain and now it has gone on to where something like 500 troops will be left there—but it is an ongoing process.
So it comes down, at the heart of it, to the credibility of the ALP in this regard. They claim that the government lied in regard to taking us to war in Iraq. But the Flood and parliamentary inquiries clear the government of deliberately misleading the Australian people. The Flood report, for example, said:
... the only government in the world to claim Iraq was not working on, and did not have, biological and chemical weapons or prohibited missile systems was the Government of Saddam Hussein.
The member for Griffith went on about the politicisation of these intelligence authorities. I think it is a disgrace that the opposition have so consistently attacked the intelligence bodies in this country that have performed so amazingly well over a number of years. They have attacked public servants who clearly have the best interests of this country at heart and are very professional in their approach. Mr Flood said there was `no evidence of politicisation of the assessments on Iraq, either overt or perceived'; nor was there evidence that `any analyst or manager was the subject of either direct or implied pressure to come to a particular judgment on Iraq for policy reasons, or to bolster the case for war.' So the argument that the agencies were totally politicised just does not measure up; the Flood inquiry makes it very clear. 
Finally, on the allegation that the government sent troops based on a purpose that was not true, in search of weapons of mass destruction that did not exist, Mr Flood said the assessments `reflected reasonably' the available evidence and `used intelligence sources with appropriate caution'. The obverse conclusion, that Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction, would have been much more difficult to substantiate. So here we stand, in August 2004, making an assessment, and what is clear from the evidence available is that it was more logical to conclude that Iraq did possess weapons of mass destruction than the reverse.
Bear in mind what would have happened if there had been a significant failure. Iraq, having had all these orders from the UN to allow inspectors into their country, had refused to do so. There had been problems over a number of years. If they had nothing to hide, they certainly made it very difficult for anyone outside to make that judgment. If they did possess weapons of mass destruction, consider the implications given the volatility of the region and the vulnerability of Israel and Iran. Iraq had already been involved in incursions on Iran. They had used mustard gas. There had been many thousands upon thousands killed by Saddam Hussein's aggression in the region.
The member for Griffith has today stood up and attacked the government's position, but he is totally out of line with every government position around the world and that of the UN. The UN consistently attacked the government of Saddam Hussein; it consistently pointed out its concern about Iraq harbouring weapons of mass destruction and the implications for world order. The credibility of the ALP is in question when the member for Griffith himself said on Lateline:
There is no debate or dispute as to whether Saddam Hussein possesses weapons of mass destruction.
He does.
That was on Lateline on 24 September 2002. Here he is some two years later and he seems to have reversed his thinking. This is totally out of line with the credibility of the argument. (Time expired)

"Cox, David, MP",ALP,2004-08-03,"—The Labor Party has been campaigning for relief for small winemakers from the wine equalisation tax since the WET was introduced by the Howard government as part of the GST package. That was five years ago. Labor was the first to propose a rebate from the WET for cellar door sales. It was proposed by Joel Fitzgibbon, who is the member for Hunter and was then the shadow minister for tourism. He was concerned about the effect of the WET on tourism in wine regions. At the time—1999—the wine industry was in uproar because it had been promised an equalisation tax but found that the tax burden on premium wines had been significantly increased. What the government had promised was to equalise the effect of the new and old tax regimes at the value end of the wine market. With ad valorem taxation, that increased the burden on premium wines significantly.
Labor established a wine tax committee, of which I was the chair, to examine the problem and develop an appropriate policy response. The other members of the committee were Senator Nick Sherry from Tasmania; the member for Hunter, Joel Fitzgibbon; the member for Bass, Michelle O'Byrne; and the member for Cowan, Graham Edwards. We consulted widely, visiting small and medium sized winemakers in the Hunter, Swan, Tamar and Yarra valleys and in Margaret River. 
However, the meeting that stood out in my mind was the one at the Winemakers Federation of Australia's office in Penfolds' old champagne cellar at Magill. When the CEO of Southcorp and the chairman of Hardys turned up to talk to a committee of backbenchers, I concluded that the whole industry recognised it had a problem. And, when one of those two most senior representatives of the wine industry told my Tasmanian colleagues that their company spilt more at the crusher than Tasmania produced, I understood why the industry had been divided on the issue of wine tax for some years.
The fault line was that the large wineries needed to maintain ad valorem taxation for the overwhelming majority of the industry's sales—and this is critical to the irrigation areas that supply grapes for value wines—while a vocal group of small winemakers, particularly in Western Australia and Tasmania, wanted volumetric taxation because it would provide them with the tax relief that many of them desperately needed.
It had not taken me long to work out that an appropriate exemption from the WET could resolve this dilemma for the wine industry. Collectively the industry needed ad valorem taxation. An exemption set at an appropriate level would remove the extra burden the WET placed on small premium wineries, and they would therefore be able to survive within the existing ad valorem regime. It would be preferable, for a number of design reasons that I will go into later, to determine the exemption as a WET-free threshold set at an appropriate number of litres of production, not alcohol content. That was the proposition my committee consulted on in the Hunter, Swan, Tamar and Yarra valleys, in Margaret River and with the major wine companies. Over the more than a year that we consulted, the wine industry adopted four different tax policy positions of its own. These included cutting the WET rate and, later, only paying the GST. Both of these options would have been expensive to the revenue and made value wines even cheaper, neither of which we were prepared to contemplate.
The Prime Minister was eventually forced to promise the Australian Democrats an exemption to get the GST through the Senate. The Treasurer tried to ignore that commitment for many months, and the Democrats, but not the Labor Party, had all but given up on it ever being delivered when the Treasurer was instructed to negotiate an arrangement. The result, having been negotiated by a reluctant Treasurer and a pair of Democrats, was an inconceivably complex beast. The cost of the rebate was shared with the states and the Commonwealth's contribution phased out above a threshold. That is a difficult arrangement in terms of tax administration and compliance.
The Labor Party never thought it was adequate and never gave up on providing something better. I realised that we had the basis for an agreement with the wine industry on a specific policy the day that the then President of the Winemakers Federation of Australia, Alister Purbrick, and its then CEO, Ian Sutton, visited me in my Parliament House office and said that the federation had decided it could live with the WET rate of 29 per cent if it could have an appropriate number of litres as a WET-free threshold. The industry had been able to unite on that. They had originally wanted a one million litre exemption but had settled on a 600,000 litre exemption.
At the 2001 federal election, Labor offered an exemption from the WET for wineries producing up to 50,000 litres. The industry would have preferred more; however, the government did not even match that and instead offered a review. After the election, when the terms of reference for the review were released, they did not include the issue of taxation. The industry had been led up the garden path. David Trebeck from ACIL Tasman very ably conducted the review. He found that all anybody in the industry really wanted to talk about was tax, so he wrote a very good chapter on that but felt constrained by his terms of reference, and those who were paying him, not to make any recommendations. 
The industry continued to campaign for a 600,000 litre exemption. Two budgets went by with the government refusing to respond. Small wineries' profitability continued to be low, and the viability of many was threatened. It was not until an election year budget with nine marginal seats with significant wine industry interests spread on either side of the electoral pendulum that the Howard government reluctantly decided to act. The only thing that has changed the government's mind is that Labor has made it an issue and some of the coalition's regional seats are vulnerable. The proposition that they have brought forward is for a rebate on the WET for the first $1 million of wholesale value. At a 29 per cent WET rate, that has a value of up to $290,000 for each winery.
The new Chief Executive of the Winemakers Federation has written to me. I will read the letter into Hansard because I have seen that there is a rather long list of speakers from the other side and I suspect that they will be wanting to claim all the credit for having pushed the government, or, more particularly, the Treasurer, into doing this. Stephen Strachan writes:
Dear David,
The Winemakers Federation of Australia welcomed the reforms to the wine equalisation tax recently announced in the federal budget as recognition of the financial pressures on small wineries and a boost for regional Australia.
The federal government policy of a WET rebate for the first $1 million of domestic wholesale sales falls short of the WFA policy proposal for a 600,000 litre WET exemption for domestic sales. Nevertheless, the policy is a substantial result for Australia's small wineries and will benefit wine regions across the country.
The WFA is now working with the Treasurer's office and relevant government agencies to ensure implementation is streamlined and consistent with our objectives for targeted wine tax reform. Of special importance for winemakers is retention of the state cellar door rebate scheme for those wineries with sales above the $1 million domestic wholesale sales threshold. If we are able to maintain this scheme, we will satisfy our three key policy principles: WET reform targeted for small wineries, no winery will be worse off and a whole-of-industry solution.
I would like to acknowledge the significant body of work undertaken by the ALP in addressing the wine tax issue and, in particular, your efforts in advocating on behalf of small wineries. The ALP recognised the importance of reforms to the WET targeted at small wineries at a very early stage, as outlined in the policy released in October 2001.
Your commitment to wine tax issues has been instrumental in shaping ALP policy, which in turn has been crucial in keeping this issue at the forefront of government considerations over the last few years. On the basis of the ALP's strong support for small and medium wineries I would hope that you will support the passage of the legislation through the House.
David, thank you again for your support for the Australian wine industry, and I look forward to continuing to work with you and your colleagues on behalf of Australia's winemakers.
Yours sincerely,
Stephen Strachan
Chief Executive
I would also point out that we continued our interest as a caucus in wine tax issues with the appointment not just of a wine tax committee but a wine committee immediately after the last election. That committee has been very ably chaired by the member for Ballarat, Cathy King, who I have to report got up at her first caucus meeting and asked the shadow Treasurer, `What are you going to do about relief for small wineries from the WET?' 
Let us have a look at the government's rebate and how that relates to the value of a WET exemption expressed in litres. That depends on the average value of a winery's production. For small winemakers producing a premium product, that is the equivalent of a WET-free threshold of less than 100,000 litres. For large wineries producing a preponderance of value wines, it is the equivalent of a WET-free threshold of over 250,000 litres. So the government has not delivered to the industry the industry's policy either in terms of tax design or quantum. It certainly puts the policy that the Labor Party put forward at the last election in a more realistic light than some sections of the wine industry were prepared to believe before that election, although I personally have had a lot of feedback from the very many wineries who have production under 50,000 litres who thought that was a spectacularly good policy which would have solved all their problems. When you look at how many wineries that would have taken out of the WET net, that was a very significant first step. The government's rebate does provide an effective exemption for a majority of small wineries producing below the rebate limit.
—All small wineries.
—It depends on how you categorise what is a small winery and what is a medium sized winery. These things tend to blur and merge, and beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
—Ninety per cent of them.
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—The member for Barker will have his opportunity, or he may miss out if he continues to interject.
—For the major wineries, the value of either an exemption threshold expressed in litres or a rebate expressed in dollars is insignificant to their overall tax position. However, they will tend to view the concession relative to the cost of running their cellar door operations. Cellar door operations are difficult to run. They are expensive. Some wineries are now charging for a cellar door experience; some are not. If you are a major wine company such as the one which has its head office in my electorate and you are running 13 of those cellar door operations around the country, they are another cost issue, and that is probably one of the reasons why the Winemakers Federation is taking a big interest in the continuance of state cellar door rebates above the $1 million wholesale value threshold of the Commonwealth rebate.
The value and design of the exemption or rebate are most sensitive for small and medium wineries whose production exceeds the threshold or rebate. I believe there are three good reasons for sticking to an exemption set as a litre threshold. First, an exemption set as a litre threshold will not require indexation to maintain its value. It must be remembered that the Howard government has given no commitment to index the rebate, so its value will be eroded over time. I, and I think the industry, do not look forward to an argument about indexation at every budget between now and eternity. Second, a WET-free threshold set in litres allows small wineries to move their wines up in value either by improving the quality of their product or its marketing and so get more out of the exemption, which they could not do once they reached the level of a rebate set in dollar terms. Third, for a given cost to revenue an exemption set in litres will give more value to small and medium sized wineries than it will give to the major wineries producing predominantly value wines. It needs to be remembered that the exemption is primarily for small wineries. The large wineries already receive their primary benefit having an ad valorem tax regime. One of the principal objectives of proposing an exemption five years ago was to preserve ad valorem taxation for the wine industry. 
For these reasons Labor are sticking to our own policy of providing an exemption set at an appropriate number of litres. We believe we can provide the wine industry with a better tax regime than this rebate. We will not, however, be opposing this rebate either here or in the other place. Indeed, it is not entirely clear why the Howard government has decided on a rebate. I expect it is partly to do with wanting to differentiate itself from Labor Party policy and, unfortunately, from the Winemakers Federation of Australia's policy. It may also be because it is simpler for the ATO to deal with a value based rebate on a value based business activity statement. Unfortunately, it means that the value of the rebate will be eroded significantly over time unless it is indexed periodically. I know enough about the attitude of the Treasurer towards the wine industry to know that that may be one of his objectives in itself.
The rebate is intended to replace Commonwealth and state rebate arrangements for the first $1 million of wholesale value. The Treasurer has written to the states requesting that the value of the state rebates be returned to the Commonwealth to offset part of the cost. The states all agreed to do this when they wrote in support of the WFA's policy that would have provided the exemption for the first 600,000 litres of production. While that 600,000-litre exemption has not been provided and detailed arrangements for the return of the state rebates below the first $1 million of wholesale value have not been agreed, I assume that the states will be cooperative on this issue.
The wine industry position is that the state rebates should be retained in some form to ensure that no wineries are worse off under the new arrangements. The Howard government has given no explicit or implicit acceptance of that principle. The states are currently working cooperatively with the industry on developing arrangements to provide rebates above the Commonwealth rebate, and the South Australian Treasury is taking the lead in that process. It will be a complex procedure because some wineries or related entities have cellar door operations in more than one state, so the states will want to come up with some rules for allocating their rebates.
I had a briefing from Treasury on this bill on Friday. Unfortunately, the officers present were unable to tell me whether the costing for the rebate provided in the budget papers was a gross figure or a net figure after removal of the current Commonwealth rebate arrangement. I had assumed that it was a gross figure and that, from it, you would deduct both the Commonwealth rebate and that part of the state rebates under the $1 million of wholesale value. Treasury suggested it was probably a net figure after deducting the Commonwealth, but not the state, rebate. Since they have not clarified that, I have been forced to refer the bill to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee to examine only that issue on Monday. That would allow the committee to report next Wednesday so the bill could be dealt with in the Senate before the end of this two-week sitting period—in case the Prime Minister calls an election. I am mindful of the need to get the bill through before 1 October, which is the start date for the new rebate.
There are some small wineries that are in a fairly desperate state. They have been waiting five years for some relief from the WET, and I suspect there are some whose viability could be threatened if they are made to wait much longer. The government has this afternoon advised of some late amendments to make cider, mead, perry and sake fall within the definition of rebatable wine. We need some advice from Treasury as to how that will affect the costing of the measure. 
The bill also contains three integrity measures. First, the bill provides associated entity rules to prevent wineries claiming multiple rebates or a winery splitting its operation when it reaches the limit of the rebate. This is critical to containing the cost to the revenue of a rebate or exemption arrangement. Second, the bill closes a loophole in the present act that would allow a winery to avoid the WET by exporting and then reimporting wine. There is no evidence that this has occurred and, indeed, in most cases, given Australia's geography relative to even our nearest neighbours, this would be prohibitively expensive except for small quantities of very high-value wine. The third measure requires all packaging costs to be included in the WET cost base. Obviously, if the wholesale value of the wine is held down by artificially excluding the packaging costs then the value of the rebate can be extended to cover more product. Labor supports these three integrity measures.
The bill also contains a measure to remove the concession of accelerated depreciation for vineyard plantings. This concession has existed since 1993, when it was part of an agreement between the then Labor government and the industry on future tax arrangements for the wine industry. I presume it was intended to encourage plantings when the industry was in a rapid phase of expansion. I have to declare an interest here as I am a grape grower. I have to say, it has always amazed me that I could plant a grapevine and watch it grow and depreciate at the same time.
There is a view in the industry that this concession has contributed to oversupply of grapes, and there has been some consensus about getting rid of it. In fact, the last time that I addressed a dinner of winemakers, on the Mornington Peninsula, when I said that I had it in mind that the Labor Party would get rid of this concession I was greeted by more than polite applause.
—Good people.
—They are very good people on the Mornington Peninsula, and it is the first time that I have ever been to a Labor Party fundraiser which was attended by Baillieu Myer, who, of course, was the person who first had the foresight to plant grapes on the Mornington Peninsula. I think that the Labor Party and the people of Flinders would be very well served if they were to elect Simon Napthine at the next election. He is very prominent within the Mornington Peninsula winemaking community. He has a great range of skills and he would look after that electorate very well.
So Labor will be supporting the removal of the concession of accelerated depreciation for vineyard plantings. I understand that anybody who is planting a vineyard this year—that is, before 1 October—will still be able to avail themselves of that accelerated depreciation but anybody who is planting next year will not. Depreciation for grapevines will henceforth be on a non-concessional basis, similar to other horticultural industries, and the specific terms of depreciation will be worked out by the tax commissioner. I move the second reading amendment standing in my name:
That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House:
(1)	notes that the relief delivered in this bill from the Wine Equalisation Tax is a non-indexed rebate and not the wine industry's preferred policy of a threshold of exemption from the WET expressed in litres; and 
(2)	calls on the Howard government to provide a threshold of exemption from the WET set at an appropriate number of litres”.
When considering this bill, I think we all should remember what a magnificent job the wine industry has done over the last 15 years to revitalise a lot of depressed rural areas in this country. When you think about the prosperous regions in Australia, you think of two industries—one of them is the fishing industry and aquaculture, and the other is the wine industry. I think the wine industry has, in some sense, been a victim of its own success, and the current Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia has fallen into this trap, judging from all of the conversations I have had with him.
The Treasurer's attitude to the WET has been that they can afford it, that the wine industry is very prosperous and that, if people in this industry are concerned about the WET, they should export more wine. There are real constraints on the extent to which all small wineries can do that. Some of them can do it and do it very well, but others are struggling. They have low profitability. They retain very little of the value from a premium bottle of wine which they sell themselves. They do not have the economies of scale in either production or marketing that the big wine companies have. They therefore struggle, but they are the foundation of the wine tourism industry.
These small wineries provide a prosperous air in all of these towns that have been revitalised. When you are on the main street of McLaren Vale or the main street of Clare, you can see the activity and prosperity that was not there 15 years ago. These people are not making supernormal profits, and this is not a concession for the affluent. Set at an appropriate level, an exemption will make the difference between subviability for many of these operations and viability. They are good employers. Typically, their operations need to be integrated into the tourism and food industries to make a go of it, and they certainly deserve our support.
I look forward to seeing this measure implemented. I look forward with some certainty in the future to the Labor Party introducing its policy, which will be an exemption from the wine equalisation tax set at an appropriate number of litres for small wineries. If we can get that policy right, it will be a set and forget policy. We will not have to tinker with it; we will not have to wonder about the appropriate indexation arrangement. We know that it will make the difference in terms of the viability of many of these small wineries and that they will go on to ensure prosperity for those country towns and wine regions in the years to come.

"Panopoulos, Sophie, MP",LP,2004-08-03,"—I rise in support of the Tax Laws Amendment (Wine Producer Rebate and Other Measures) Bill 2004, which implements the reforms of wine taxation announced by the Treasurer in this year's budget. I am pleased to be speaking on this bill. I am even more pleased that an industry that is so pivotal to the economic strength and diversity of my electorate will be fortified through the passage of this legislation.
It is well worth looking at the context and history upon which we debate this bill. Prior to the implementation of the GST, wine was taxed under the wholesale sales tax on an ad valorem basis. Under the new tax system arrangements, there was an option to tax wine on a volumetric basis against a particular wine's alcohol content, as is the case with other alcoholic beverages. This approach, however, had the consequence of increasing the amount of tax paid on less expensive wines, thereby increasing prices. At the time, the Winemakers Federation of Australia argued against this approach and stated their united support for the ad valorem approach. As part of these changes, the wine equalisation tax was introduced to offset the removal of the wholesale sales tax and the introduction of the goods and services tax. 
During the implementation of the new tax system, the government introduced other concessional arrangements for wineries—which were particularly beneficial to those with a high proportion of cellar door traffic—through the cellar door rebate scheme, which combined with the state and territory subsidies and made the first $300,000 of cellar door sales free from the imposition of the WET. Also, under the cellar door rebate scheme, small winemakers with turnover of less than $50,000 did not have to register for either the GST or the WET, allowing for the exemption of more than $20,000 in tax payments.
Earlier this year—as has been the case many times, even prior to my election as the member for Indi in November 2001—I met with a delegation of local winemakers and representatives of their peak body to hear more about their plans for refinements to the current wine taxation regime. I am sure many of my colleagues have heard similar stories from the industry in a united voice—that is, that the industry needs help; not necessarily a handout but a hand up.
The delegation painted a scenario of the difficulties that lay ahead without the amendments to the legislation that we are fortunately debating today. The problems of grape oversupply, particularly of red varietals, the value of the dollar and low profitability for some growers had created something of an uncertain climate for some winemakers. The industry is the highest taxed rural sector. Some 57,000 people are either indirectly or directly employed by the viticultural sector across the country. It is an industry that is reliant on tourism and other industries to excel. These compelling and very engaging arguments which also affect so many other employers in the industry were of particular concern to me.
It was noted in my discussions with local winemakers that Australia did have relatively high wine taxation levels when compared to our international competitors. There was some concern about the future viability of wineries in my electorate and there were also quite in-depth discussions about how best to address these problems. I joined with many of my parliamentary colleagues in forming an alliance of members to do what we could for our constituents in the wine industry and to lobby for changes to the current taxation regime.
This background brings us to the amendments that we are debating today in the Tax Laws Amendment (Wine Producer Rebate and Other Measures) Bill 2004. The measures in this bill have been welcomed by the Winemakers Federation of Australia, who—as stated in their media release of 11 May this year—`raised a glass' to the budget and said:
... the introduction of an exemption from the 29 per cent WET on the first $1 million in domestic sales was a substantial outcome for the wine industry ... leading to further job growth, tourism growth and export growth.
The most significant amendment in this bill is the introduction of a rebate of up to $290,000 to help offset the WET. This is by far the most important measure contained in the legislation, but the other measures to reduce the paperwork burden, reduce tax minimisation and abolish accelerated grapevine depreciation have also been welcomed in my electorate. With this renewed confidence, the wine industry is set for further growth. This week we have had some sectors of the Labor Party come to their senses and back the free trade agreement with the United States. This agreement will also have significant benefits for the wine industry in the years ahead. 
Once this bill we are debating today is passed, the wine industry can look beyond taxation as a hindrance. This particular aspect was covered in the wine, tourism and exports review report released in late 2002, which showed something of a renaissance ahead for our innovative and successful winemakers, particularly our small- and medium-sized boutique wineries. This particular report is a good resource for wineries about managing and extending their businesses. The report was the result of an election commitment from the Howard government in 2001 to review the main issues affecting the wine industry.
The measures contained in this year's budget far surpass the Labor Party's plan for wine tax relief released in 2001, which would have made a WET exemption only for wineries with a production of 50,000 litres or less. As far as I am aware, the Labor Party, through its proposals, supports the WET being applied to the majority of wineries in the north-east and will maintain the WET in government. We are yet to hear detailed policies from the Labor Party, and I am sure many of the winemakers in my electorate will be interested to know the Labor Party's proposals.
Let us not forget that, in its 1983 election policy, Labor promised it would not impose a sales tax or excise tax on wine. Only months later in the August budget, Treasurer Paul Keating imposed an excise on fortified wine, then replaced it a year later with a 10 per cent sales tax on all wine and then increased it further to 20 per cent in August 1986. We need to look at Labor's behaviour and its actions in government and in positions of responsibility to test its credibility on the taxation of wine. Clearly, the past shows that Labor has no credibility on the taxation of wine.
The wine industry in north-east Victoria has a very proud history of achievement and innovation. Through the government's sensible rebate policy contained in the budget and associated measures, the wine industry can once again look forward to continued periods of growth, particularly following the prolonged effects of the drought and last year's disastrous bushfire season—namely, the significant smoke-tainting of grapes in fire affected areas.
About 10 days ago I visited one of the local Indi winemakers, Trevor Knaggs from the King River Estate in the King Valley. He was delighted with the amendments announced by the Treasurer on budget night. As I was practising putting labels on his 2002 merlot, he told me that these amendments would mean that he was able to employ another person. In practical terms, wineries such as this one could not have received a bigger boost. Another winemaking constituent from the King Valley, Mr Otto dal Zotto from dal Zotto's winery, with whom I spoke on budget night to inform him of the changes to the WET announced by the Treasurer, stated that evening:
... it will be a big help to the smaller wineries and those selling 10,000 cases or less. For all other wineries, at least they'll get back $290,000 of the WET which is a big help.
From a local perspective, the comments I have received in relation to these reforms, reveal that these reforms have been warmly welcomed right across Indi. Effectively, for many of the wineries in my electorate, the rebate will completely offset the WET liability. Many small producers, family businesses, retired couples and those with a modest number of vines on their properties who have gone in at the deep end and tried to make something out of beginning a small winery in retirement stand to benefit. I am pleased that the government has acted to reduce the tax burden on wineries in the north-east and I am pleased that a large section of my constituency will benefit from these changes. We should pass this legislation as soon as practically possible. The rebate is set to come into effect on 1 October this year, and we should not delay any of these measures. 
I consider myself very fortunate to be a representative of an electorate which is renowned not only for its natural beauty and landscape but also for its industries and the innovation of its inhabitants. The wine industry is front of the pack in this regard. Be it Giaconda, Brown Brothers, All Saints, Campbell's, the King River Estate, dal Zottos, Pizzinis, Tabilk, Delatite, Plunketts, Ciccanti, or Boggy Creek, the commitment to making our wine region renowned throughout the world through these quality vintages remains consistent.
I am hopeful these changes to the wine taxation regime will bring forth even better results for Indi's winemakers, from the Upper Murray to Nagambie, from Rutherglen to Mansfield. The flow-on effects, importantly, for tourism, hospitality, agriculture and particularly employment will be significant for my electorate. I congratulate the Treasurer for listening to the industry, the coalition backbench and the united voice of winemakers and presenting such a much-needed boost for such a renowned industry. I commend this bill to the House and look forward to the continued growth of the wine industry, not only in north-east Victoria but right across Australia.",REPS,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (WINE PRODUCER REBATE AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2004-08-03,"—I welcome the contribution of the member for Indi on the Tax Laws Amendment (Wine Producer Rebate and Other Measures) Bill 2004. I have visited many of the areas she mentioned in her contribution and indeed many of the wineries she mentioned, and I am very pleased that she is spending her time in her electorate productively—getting out amongst her wine producers and even doing a little bit of labelling.
I visited those regions she mentioned in, I think, mid to late 1999, when the wine equalisation tax was a hot topic within the wine industry. The winemakers in Indi and other regions were very angry, of course, that the government had at that time proposed a wine equalisation tax which was not revenue neutral but was going to reap an additional $147 million—I think—from the industry than had been the case prior to that proposition. The government argued at the time that the introduction of a wine equalisation tax was a socially responsible thing to do. It argued at the time that you could not take wine tax from 40-odd per cent down to only 10 per cent—that would have all sorts of economic and social knock-on effects. The Labor Party, the opposition of the day, did not have any difficulty with that prospect. But we were surprised to learn at the time that indeed this wine equalisation tax was not going to be revenue neutral—it was not just going to be an offset to ensure that wine tax under the GST did not fall—but, rather, was going to raise an extra $147 million per annum.
Regardless of the merits or otherwise of the particular amendment we have before the House, the fact is that the government has been reaping that additional windfall for the last five years. It is five years now since we debated the wine equalisation tax bills in this House. I thank the member for Kingston for acknowledging the fact that at that time I proposed a policy which I thought was very important to the wine industry and which the government has embraced in a sense. It was a policy to provide a cellar door exemption from the wine equalisation tax for all small wineries in the regions. This was a means of promoting wine tourism, particularly in regions that had been through economic adjustment and had in a sense been struggling, and in regions where small wineries needed a kick along. An exemption from the wine equalisation tax would certainly have provided that assistance. 
The member for Indi today made the same mistake as the member for North Sydney, who is now the Minister for Small Business and Tourism, made at the time of that debate, suggesting that wineries with a turnover of $50,000 or less were exempt from the GST and therefore exempt from the wine equalisation tax. That is a silly contribution and a silly thing for the member for Indi to repeat here today, because a winery with a crush of about 50,000 tonnes would have revenue in the order of at least $300,000 per year. The margins are very small, of course, but the turnover would be in the order of $300,000-odd a year at least. Therefore, of course, they would be in the GST net.
It has been five years since I introduced amendments into this place to exempt small wineries from the wine equalisation tax. What happened from there, of course, is that the government rejected my amendments in this place. But, after weeks of burning on the issue, the government finally moved in the Senate to introduce not an exemption for small winemakers, unfortunately—and not a proposal to remove the enormous amount of red tape and paperwork that one does not face under an exemption—but a rebate, which had with it all the associated red tape and paperwork.
Here we are, five years later, and the government still does not have it right. It still cannot get this tax design right. There is nothing more important than this for a region that has wine tourism as a large slice of its economic base. For such regions, getting the tax design right is absolutely critical. I will not go back over all the fine aspects of that, as the member for Kingston has already shared that with the House. The member for Indi made some mention of the state of the industry. This is an industry facing enormous pressures. It is also putting some great runs on the board, particularly in the export market, but we have an oversupply of investment in plantings, of course, and a big squeeze is coming from the major supermarkets in this country and the pressure they are putting on wineries and other players further down the chain.
A perfect example of this lately is the move by Southcorp to reconfigure their operations as part of a rationalisation process, which is something, I should say, that flowed from poor corporate decision making a couple of years ago. Southcorp have reconfigured their operations. At their Rosemount winery in Denman, in my electorate in the Upper Hunter, they now intend to close down their packaging, bottling and distribution processes. That will cost 100 jobs in the Upper Hunter. It will have an enormous impact on the township of Denman and it is another reminder of how important it is that in this highly competitive world we in this place get the tax design right in those areas.
This is a critical issue for me. I represent an electorate which has gone through enormous economic adjustment over the course of the last 10 or 15 years. It is an area which once had as its major base coal mining, power generation and aluminium smelting. They are still very much present, but in coal mining, for example, we are now producing twice as much with half as many people as was the case 10 years ago. So our great economic saviour and job creator to offset those job losses in other, more traditional, industries, has been wine tourism. It is critical that we get this design right. 
I am disappointed that, notwithstanding what I thought was good news on budget night, we were later to learn—not so long after budget night—that the government still had not got the rejig of the design correct and had not adequately consulted the states. Indeed, the announcement as it stood—and as it still stands, technically—on budget night is going to severely disadvantaged medium-sized wineries, including many in my electorate. As I said, my original amendment in this place was specifically designed to assist small wineries at the cellar door. It was a means of attracting visitors from capital cities like Sydney into wine regions like my own—the motivation being, of course, the opportunity to get excellent wines at a cheaper price because of the cellar door exemption. That was the original proposal.
What the government proposed on budget night secured assistance for very small winemakers, but it will disadvantage medium-sized wineries and, indeed, large wineries. For example, the proposal as it stands will cost Tyrell's Wines in my electorate some $340,000 annually—that is, if the Commonwealth is not able to sort out the conflict with the state government with respect to the state rebate which has been in existence up until now. For medium and large winemakers—those with a turnover of $1 million wholesale or $2 million retail—this current proposition will make them worse off if the government and the industry are not able to resolve those differences with the states.
Members will remember that the state rebate has existed for some time—indeed, since the court struck down the licensing fees imposed by various state governments, and that has been an area of confusion for wineries ever since. If the states do not retain their rebate—and there was obviously no consultation with the states prior to this announcement on budget night—those medium to large wineries in my electorate, those with a wholesale turnover of $1 million or more, will be severely disadvantaged. It is important to target small wineries. They are the real attractors of tourists to our regions, including my own region, but medium to large wineries are great contributors to employment, and they have to be assisted and protected as well. I implore the Treasurer to get that state rebate sorted out with the various state governments, including the New South Wales government.
It is good to see that the government are still trying to get it right, after five years in the making. I do not think the wine industry has much to thank them for, given that this win has been coming from its original design for the last five years. I do not think the industry has much to thank the government for, given it has taken five years for the government to have another go at this, and of course they still have not got it right. I  support the amendment put forward by the member for Kingston. We all hope and wait with bated breath to see that this latest amendment goes through and that this time we get the design right. We all hope that the Treasurer is able to sort out the state rebate so that we are not only assisting the smaller wineries but also ensuring the protection of medium to larger businesses.",REPS,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (WINE PRODUCER REBATE AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Secker, Patrick, MP",LP,2004-08-03,"—In the debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (Wine Producer Rebate and Other Measures) Bill 2004, I have listened with interest to all the speakers so far—two from the opposition and one from the government—and I find that the amendment that has been put forward by the opposition is quite unsupportable. I say that not for political reasons—that is, they say it's black and I say it's white—but because I have always seen real problems with having a volumetric tax, or a taxation exemption level based on volume, on litres, alone. 
I know that the Labor Party went to the last federal election with an exemption for 50,000 litres. The problem that arises from that, looking at the worst example, is this: is that 50,000 litres of Grange Hermitage at $400 a litre or is that 50,000 litres of bulk wine at $2 a litre? Not only does that bring an unfairness into the whole wine taxation debate but it would also make it virtually impossible for Treasury to estimate what sort of taxation reduction would result. As a result of this legislation and the $1 million exemption level, the Treasury can quite clearly estimate that there would be something like $343 million in taxation exemptions, which they could not do with a volumetric tax arrangement.
We can go back to when we as a government were talking over with industry the whole idea of whether we should have an ad valorem or a volumetric tax. It was in fact the industry itself that came to us and said, `We should have the ad valorem taxation system because the volumetric system could have a quite drastic effect on wine sales for cask wine and bulk wine.' It was at the suggestion, the prompting and the encouragement of the wine industry itself that we adopt the WET tax system as it was.
We can go back in history and have a look at the whole wine tax system. The Labor Party certainly has form on wine taxation, which I can remember because I grew up in the wine industry. In fact, my parents had about 200 acres of vineyards in Happy Valley, which we had until I was about 20 years of age. I sort of wish we had that still, but of course that went to subdivision at the time. I can remember picking grapes for threepence a bucket, so we know how far back that is. There were four buckets to the hundredweight and 20 hundredweights to the ton. Probably only those of my age and older would recognise those sorts of figures. I am sure that Mr Deputy Speaker Causley would remember the sorts of figures that we worked with at that time.
It was also a time when there was no taxation on the winemaking industry whatsoever. I think it was the Hawke government that brought in the first taxation of 10 per cent, even though the wine industry and the grape growers at the time said that the sky would fall in if we brought in a 10 per cent wine tax regime in this country. It did not, of course. It would have been pretty hard to say that we should not at least tax wine at the moderate level of 10 per cent at a time when there were higher taxation levels for beer, scotch and spirits and all sorts of things. It was, after all, another form of alcohol and deserved to have some sort of taxation.
It was not until the Hawke-Keating government decided to raise the taxation level first to 22 per cent, then to 24 per cent and then to a 26 per cent wholesale sales tax plus the 15 per cent excise that we had a taxation regime of 41 per cent. That 15 per cent was on top of the 26 per cent. Obviously, as the member for Hunter explained, when we were bringing in the new tax system we could not sustain a 10 per cent GST on the wine industry. That certainly would not fall into what was considered to be good policy making, especially if it made cheap grog cheaper for people with a drinking problem. We all know that a moderate amount of alcohol is actually quite good for you—it is far better for you than being a teetotaller.
We have this history of the Labor Party having a 41 per cent taxation regime. In conjunction and consultation with the wine industry, we brought in a wine equalisation tax—WET—of 29 per cent plus the 10 per cent GST. That worked out to be about 39 per cent. You might think, `That is less than the 41 per cent of the Labor regime,' but it was not; because of where the tax was put on, it worked out to be slightly more. It was designed to increase the taxation level by 1.8 per cent—I think those were the figures—which was in line with the general inflation spike that was going to happen as a result of the GST. In the end I think actually it happened to be a bit more than that, but the wine industry still continued to flourish. 
But this situation had to catch up with the industry at some time. I have certainly been very active on this matter for the last four or five years. In fact, I went to the last election—in print, on radio and on TV—saying that I wanted to do something about the wine taxation system to make it fairer. I had people telling me at the time: `You're mad to go out and try for that, because you won't get it through. Why try and promise something that you do not have a hope of delivering on?' I am proud to say that I did deliver on it, in conjunction with many of my colleagues. We worked very hard to ensure that the Treasurer and the Prime Minister were made aware of the problems in the wine industry, especially for the small wine producers. Quite clearly the figures showed that, even though medium and high producing wineries were doing okay, smaller wineries were actually in trouble. That was the last thing that we as a government wanted to see happen.
I note that the member for Kingston read out a letter, perhaps to give himself and the ALP a pat on the back. But can I tell the member for Kingston that I think every member of the Liberal Party who was involved in putting pressure on for this got a very similar letter. I think that was just very good PR by the wine industry and should not be taken as an example of the ALP being the big mover and shaker in this regard. The decision was made in government and I saw very little pressure from the opposition in this area.
The member for Hunter said that he was concerned about the problem that might exist with the states' taxation regime. As many of you would know, there was a set-up where we gave a 14 per cent rebate on cellar door sales and the states gave 15 per cent. That worked pretty well except for the paperwork. I acknowledge that there was too much paperwork. But that regime was set up through consultation between the states and the federal government. I think all that is needed to fix the problem that the member for Hunter raised is for him to go and see the Premier of New South Wales and say to him, `Why don't you give the same exemptions that you were giving before the budget announcement?' That is what I am saying to the state government in South Australia. They gave a 15 per cent exemption for cellar door sales and there was no limit to the amount of wine that was sold at cellar doors. It did not matter whether it was $400 Grange or $4 cheapo plonko—not that there is much of that in Australia now.
As you probably know, Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay, I have a very proud heritage with the wine industry. As I said, I grew up with it. I am also very pleased to say that I have a substantial wine cellar. That is my only conflict of interest in this whole thing. I prefer wine to beer or any other form of alcohol, in moderation. Certainly that is something that I encourage.
Since being elected, I have had the privilege of representing many winegrowing areas, including Langhorne Creek, the Lower Murray, Coonawarra, Padthaway, Wrattonbully—an area that I think is up-and-coming—lower Fleurieu Peninsula, Kangaroo Island and Mount Benson. Those are some very substantial areas. With the redistribution, the new seat of Barker not only has all of them—minus Kangaroo Island and Langhorne Creek—but also now takes in the Barossa Valley and the Riverland. I represent an area that covers something like 40 per cent of Australia's wine production and I am very proud to say that. Not only that but, like all members, I think I am pretty right in saying that I represent the best wine areas in Australia, if not the world. 
Coonawarra is recognised worldwide as being one of the premium red wine areas, if not the premium red wine area, in the world for cabernets and shirazes. I take the point that many other colleagues will quite rightly extol the values of the wines in their area. But when people talk about wine and recognise the quality wines that are coming out of the Barossa Valley, Coonawarra, Mount Benson, Padthaway, Wrattonbully and so on—and some very good wines are coming out of the Riverland and Lower Murray as well—I think they recognise that I represent areas of wine production in Australia not only with quantity but also with quality.
It is one of the great pleasures of being the member for Barker that I am almost the member for wine production. Because I grew up with the industry and have had an ongoing connection with the industry all my life, I think I can say without boasting that I do know something about the wine industry and the grape industry, having grown and picked them, and having seen how the industries have developed over the last 48 years of my life. I probably have a longer connection with the wine industry than any other member of this House.
The wine tourism industry is a great industry, so it is with great satisfaction that I rise this afternoon to support the Tax Laws Amendment (Wine Producer Rebate and Other Measures) Bill 2004, which is designed to provide much-needed WET relief to Australia's great wine industry. As honourable members would be aware, I have risen in this chamber on many occasions to add support to providing a fairer deal to our wine industry, and today is no exception. I have said many times previously and I still maintain that I represent a great industry. Over the past six years, I have dealt closely with the wine industry both as a consumer/purchaser and as a local member of parliament. I have held vigneron evenings showcasing the fantastic products right here in Parliament House. I have facilitated meetings with winemakers, grape growers, their representatives and key government people, including the Treasurer and many other ministers, and I have worked hard to ensure that their concerns are voiced here in Canberra as well as at home.
With regard to the Wine Equalisation Tax, or WET as it is known, I have never remained silent on the impact that it has had on the industry even though it was very similar to the exorbitant taxes that were put on by Labor when they were in government. In fact, I remember the day during the last election, nearly three years ago now, when I was asked what I would be working for if re-elected. I said, `No. 1: a fairer wine tax system.'
I spoke on many occasions to Treasury officials. I hosted many of those meetings. As recently as this year's budget in May, I was still fighting for changes to WET, working with more than 40 of my colleagues and lobbying the Prime Minister and our Treasurer to consider a threshold exemption from WET to enable the abolition of cellar door sale concessions. So it was with great satisfaction and really not much surprise that, following the years of lobbying, on budget night 2004 my fighting and that of my colleagues finally paid off with the announcement that this year's budget would deliver exactly that. In my announcement of this budget measure I included what I called fast facts on the wine industry in Barker, and I would like to reiterate some of those facts here in the chamber today to show how important the region is to the industry and the industry is to the region and how important this legislation is in supporting our region. 
The electorate of Barker is home to more than 150 wineries nestled across the four main wine regions of the Barossa, the Limestone Coast, the Lower Murray and the Riverland. We are lucky enough to have big producers such as Wynns in Coonawarra, Jacobs Creek in the Barossa and Southcorp all over the place, right through to the numerous smaller wineries—the boutique wineries—producing what I consider to be absolutely superb wine; `nectar of the gods', as I am very fond of saying.
Barker's wineries are responsible for around 40 per cent of the nation's production, about 5.3 per cent of local employment, and they contribute in no small part to the outstanding tourism figures of the various regions. In fact, in 2002, the Barossa attracted the largest number of cellar door visits at 2.4 million, or 60 per cent of the total in 1999. There were 133,000 international visitors—37 per cent of all international visitors—to the Barossa on either a daytrip or a longer stay, and around 36 per cent of domestic visitors who stayed in the Barossa in 2002 visited a winery as well.
During the same period, the Limestone Coast attracted some 290,000 cellar door visitors. If we add these figures to the figures for those who travelled to the other wine regions in the Barker electorate, and if we look further into statistics other than just the tourism figures, we begin to get a real picture of how big this industry is and the economic and social impact that the industry has on the regional electorate of Barker. With this in mind, my view was and still is that any changes which benefit the vital industry to allow it to continue to contribute to our regions in the way that it does should be pursued and obtained wherever possible. I would like to pay tribute to the Prime Minister for his willingness to listen to our concerns and to the Treasurer. I thank many of my colleagues who came together in a very strong band of backbench support to bring this issue in front of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. They were very receptive and I am very pleased that was shown in the budget.
In a nutshell, the Tax Laws Amendment (Wine Producer Rebate and Other Measures) Bill means that nearly 90 per cent of all wine producers throughout the nation, including those in Barker, will offset their entire WET bill with the exemption of the first $1 million of each producer's domestic wine sales per annum. In fact, for the larger wineries this is actually a better deal than the WFA, the Winemakers Federation of Australia, was seeking. The bill introduces a wine producer rebate of up to $290,000 for every wine producer in each financial year. This compares quite favourably with the $42,000 rebate that they could have received under the old scheme. The rebate will apply to all sales, not just cellar door and mail order sales, and that is very important for the small producer. Before they have a cellar door outlet, they are often just selling at a wholesale level, so it is very important for those small producers. I think 85 per cent of the benefit will be received by small wine producers in rural and regional Australia, and that is fantastic news for Barker.
 (Mr Lindsay)—I thank the member for Barker. I am sure that the member for Paterson will take a right of reply after the member for Perth has spoken. ",REPS,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (WINE PRODUCER REBATE AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Smith, Stephen, MP",ALP,2004-08-03,"—I want to speak briefly on the Tax Laws Amendment (Wine Producer Rebate and Other Measures) Bill 2004 tonight to associate myself with the remarks of the shadow Assistant Treasurer and member for Kingston. I do so in my capacity as the federal member for Perth. In that capacity, obviously I have had contact with the Western Australian wine industry generally. Most Australians not from Western Australia would probably think of Margaret River in that context, but there is a very important part of the Western Australian wine industry which is near my electorate—that is, the Swan Valley, which has a long and proud tradition of producing wines of quality. It is one of my regrets that at the last redistribution in Western Australia portions of the Swan Valley were removed from my electorate to help form part of the seat of Hasluck. Whilst they are now geographically dislocated from me, my interest has not waned. As members of this side of the House would know, I have over the years taken an interest in health matters. I have often recommended to my colleagues that red wine is a popular and well-known pharmaceutical, which they should partake of in modest quantities four or five days a week.
The Swan Valley, as I say, has a long and proud history of wine production. Historically, that wine production coincided with our post-World War II migration program. Very many of the vignerons and producers from the Swan Valley are people of European stock who came to Western Australia and the Swan Valley in the aftermath of World War II. The focus of the Swan Valley wine industry is essentially small and medium sized producers, very often with cellar door sales—indeed, occasionally cellar-door-only sales. These predominate in the Swan Valley because it is a hospitality and tourism centre and focus. The premium wines and the value adding that we find in the Swan Valley are a hallmark of that area and a great attraction for tourism to Perth and Western Australia. For those people who are interested in wine and wine tasting, it is not uncommon to spend a couple of days in the Swan Valley before going further south to Margaret River and beyond.
The thrust of my concern is that the wine equalisation tax—or WET, as it has become famously known—has always punished and adversely impacted upon small and medium sized producers whose focus is on value adding and quality. That has been the case ever since it was introduced with the GST. The government has never responded fully or appropriately, and that is reflected by the legislation today. It does not appropriately reflect the issues, concerns and focus of the small and medium sized producer with a focus on premium and quality, a focus on service and hospitality and a focus on tourism and local jobs. That is reflected by the second reading amendment moved by the member for Kingston, which says:
... “whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House:
(1)	notes that the relief delivered in this bill from the Wine Equalisation Tax is a non-indexed rebate and not the wine industry's preferred policy of a threshold of exemption from the WET expressed in litres; and
(2)	calls on the Howard government to provide a threshold of exemption from the WET set at an appropriate number of litres”.
Adopting that approach will give much greater encouragement, support and incentive to the small and medium sized producers of the Swan Valley and the nation generally. Indeed, in the run-up to the last election, Labor had as a formal election commitment an exemption of 50,000 litres—an exemption for those small and medium sized producers producing up to 50,000 litres. That provides an incentive to small and medium sized producers. It also provides an incentive to move up the quality, premium or value adding chain. There is a great deficiency in the government's proposal—and, in passing, not least because it has always struck me that if you are going to announce a measure such as the government is proposing it is always best to implement it quickly, rather than waiting from budget night until 1 October. There is no doubt that that has had some adverse implications so far as the industry is concerned. 
As the shadow Assistant Treasurer and member for Kingston made clear in his remarks—and I think they are worth referring to—there are three good reasons for setting an exemption as a litre threshold rather than taking the government's approach. The first point is that if you set a litre threshold it will not require indexation to maintain its value, which the government's approach will. Secondly, it allows the small and medium sized producers to move their wines up the quality or the value added chain. Thirdly, if you set a litre exemption then you give more incentive to the small and medium sized producers or wineries rather than to the major producers, who in the main produce quantity without necessarily relying on smaller volume and higher premium or being higher up the quality chain.
So, in terms of bang for your buck and value for effort and in terms of providing an incentive to a great industry in Western Australia and nationally, by far the preferred approach is for the government to take stock of where it is at and—after five years of being lectured by small and medium sized producers and by the Labor Party—to move to a litre exemption level. That is the best mechanism of providing incentive. It is in my view the best way of ensuring through the use of taxpayers' funds that you have an incentive for small and medium sized producers to produce quality and to link that quality to service and hospitality, tourism and local jobs. Indeed, it was this side of the parliament that first made the suggestion that a rebate should occur for cellar door sales. Those sorts of mechanisms are the best public policy mechanisms to provide incentives to the small and medium sized producers of quality wine in the Swan Valley in Western Australia.
While I am not proposing to get into the competition between various other valleys—the Barossa or the Hunter—the quality of wine production in the Swan Valley stands in its own right. The Swan Valley can claim the longest continuous commercial production of wine in Australia. I have chosen my words carefully: the longest continuous production has occurred in the Swan Valley. It is a fine tradition and it is part, as I referred to earlier, of the great contribution that the post-World War II migration effort made to our nation's economic and social existence. My call is again for the government to revert to a litre exemption. That is the best mechanism for providing incentives to small and medium sized producers, providing incentives for local tourism initiatives and providing incentives for local jobs. I commend the amendment to the House.",REPS,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (WINE PRODUCER REBATE AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Baldwin, Robert, MP",LP,2004-08-03,"—I rise tonight to talk on the Tax Laws Amendment (Wine Producer Rebate and Other Measures) Bill 2004. This is a bill that I know has been well received by wine producers in the Hunter region. It has been strongly supported. This bill will implement the new wine producer rebate, which was announced in the May budget. This rebate is a $290,000 wine equalisation tax rebate per annum to every wine producer, effectively exempting the first $1 million of each producer's domestic sales every financial year.
What does this mean for the Hunter? Richard Owens, the owner of Oakvale Winery, has worked out that this means around $58 million to the Hunter if our wine producers qualify for the top amount. This $290,000 is a dramatic increase—of around a quarter of a million dollars—on the $42,000 that was available to wine producers under the cellar door rebate. This bill also introduces measures in relation to other certain compliance and administration arrangements. 
On budget night, the Treasurer had this to say about the wine producer rebate which comes into effect on 1 October this year:
This initiative will particularly support small wine producers with domestic sales. It will replace cellar door rebates and reduce tax on the industry by $338 million. This measure will effectively exempt 90 per cent of Australia's wine producers from the Wine Equalisation Tax.
That is an enormous amount of wine producers in Australia—including those in the Hunter Valley, which is famous for its good quality wines and attracts a lot of tourism as a result.
The President of the Winemakers Federation of Australia, Peter Barnes, had this to say after the budget announcement of the rebate:
Lower taxes will lead to higher investment by wineries into growing all facets of this successful regional industry, leading to further job growth, tourism growth and export growth.
In the Newcastle Herald, Richard Owens, from the Oakvale Winery, said:
It is a big win for the small family wineries for the Hunter and Australia and will give us an opportunity to compete better with the larger producers than previously. The Government should be thanked for it.
And for the Hunter region, our wine industry is very important. According to the latest report from the Bureau of Rural Science, it is growing and will continue to grow. The report found that the Hunter topped the list for the designated wine areas in 2002 for the number of wineries operating cellar doors, with 121. It was second to the Barossa Valley in the number of wineries that are exporting their product. There are 65 wineries in the Hunter doing that. The report highlighted the growth of the wine industry in the Hunter, with the number of wineries almost tripling from 1992 to 2002 and with an increase of 81 per cent in the tonnage of wine grapes.
There have been continual concerns about the oversupply of red wine in the market from that bumper crop in 2002. I note that a review of the year 2002-03 says that that is not actually the case because our red wines achieved an export growth of 36 per cent. In fact, our domestic sales of bottled red wine grew by 8.3 per cent and domestic sales of bottled white wine grew by eight per cent. These rates are well up on the previous year.
The benefits from the wine industry in my electorate are immense. Wine should not be seen in isolation; it is part of a total tourist package. The benefits from the wine industry are evident from the growth in employment, with the number of people employed in wine manufacturing and grape growing almost doubling over that 10-year period—from 729 employees to 1,443. That is a positive result for our Hunter Region, which relies very heavily on the tourist dollar.
Today it was interesting to see the Tourism and Transport Forum release figures on a per electorate basis on how much employment is generated by tourism. The forum says that in my electorate of Paterson tourism makes up 7.1 per cent of the employment and that Paterson is ranked 19th highest in Australia for tourism as the source of employment. The electorate of Hunter, where the vast majority of the wineries are, has an employment rate in tourism of 5.9 per cent, and is ranked 41st out of all the electorates in Australia. 
The support of our wine industry through this wine producer rebate is basically a direct investment in regional Australia. This bill will benefit around 90 per cent of our wine producers, who will be able to fully offset their wine tax liability. What impresses me about this amendment is that around 85 per cent of the benefits will be received by small wine producers in regional and rural areas. I think that is an impressive part of this bill. This bill will enable our small wineries to make larger investments in their local operations. It will stimulate further growth in employment opportunities.
Whilst many colleagues in this House would disagree—but it is good to see how parochial they are in regard to their own areas—there is no doubt that the Hunter does produce the best wines in Australia. Unfortunately, I only have six wineries in the whole of my electorate; most of the wineries are in the electorate of Hunter. The wineries in my electorate include, starting in the north, the Great Lakes winery at Wootton, which has changed hands recently and is producing some very interesting wines and ports. I was there a couple of weeks ago at a function to raise money for the local community. In Gresford we have three very good wineries. Tonight I was speaking to Geoff Broadfield, who is one of the winemakers for Camyr Allyn Wines, which is owned by John and Judy Evers. He works predominantly at the Glenbrook winery at Gresford, which is owned by Tom and Terese. Of course, we have the Allyn River winery, which is owned by David and Dianne Hilliard. Towards Nelson Bay at Bobs Farm is the Divers Luck winery, which is a new winery. The people there have the technology developed so well that they are growing the grapes in sandy soils and producing excellent wines. The people who pioneered that at Bobs Farm are from the Port Stephens Winery, which is headed up by Tony Griffiths. Tony Griffiths is one of those people who understands not only the importance and quality of wine but also the importance of packaging that with tourism. Tony was one of the senior members of the Port Stephens tourism group and he significantly drove the direction in which it went. Part of the benefits from that are that people are coming to the cellar door to buy wines.
When I spoke to those people, it was clear that the issues relating to the wine equalisation tax were making it very hard for our small wineries. If you consider, say, a $15 bottle of wine, about a quarter of the price, $3.65, goes to the government in taxes and the winery only receives around 44c. This government recognises the need for change, particularly to support the small wineries. Besides those people in the wineries whom I have mentioned, I would like to recognise the support and information on this issue that I have received from Peter Drayton of Drayton Wines and Richard Owens from Oakvale.
A new winery has opened up at Stroud. Ms Blackmore came to see me about the WET only days before the budget, and we sat down and went through the whole issue. This group from Stroud want to grow their winery and grow the opportunities in an area where wine has not been produced before. They brought a couple of bottles and, I have to say, I tried the wine out the other night and it is a very respectable drop. It is one that I would highly recommend, as I do all the wines from my area.
There are some key issues for the wine industry in my area. Today I received a letter from the New South Wales Wine Industry Association. The New South Wales Wine Industry Association was formed back in 1994 as a coalition of the New South Wales regional wine associations. There are some 17 regional members of the association, covering 99 per cent of the state. They are unique in that they allow not only companies but also individual grape growers to belong. They represent the grape growers and the winemakers, and they are also represented on the executive council of the Winemakers Federation of Australia. The simple fact is that New South Wales crushes 34 per cent of the grapes used to produce Australian wine; therefore, New South Wales contributes 34 per cent of the wine levy. That is the issue at the heart of the concerns of the New South Wales wine industry. 
The wine levy is proposed to be increased from $3 to $5 a tonne. The New South Wales Wine Industry Association are not opposed to that as much, but they are opposed to the fact that very little, around 10 per cent, of the collection is actually spent back in New South Wales. They contribute 33 per cent of the wine levy and 28 per cent of the grape levy, but around 10 per cent comes back to the growers and producers in New South Wales. I see that as an issue that needs to be addressed. The president of the New South Wales Wine Industry Association, Christopher Barnes, whom I have known for quite a while, has written to Judith Troeth pointing out all these things. I ask her to consider this very important issue. The wine industry is not opposed to the increase, but it is opposed to the way it is distributed. For the New South Wales wine growers to support this levy increase, they need to see that there is a fair and equitable distribution of the funds back into their industry.
As I have said throughout this speech, the wine equalisation tax is perhaps a little long in coming but will provide great benefit from 1 October to wineries in my electorate. Some of those wineries are concerned about the fact that it is a rebate. Some of them would appreciate an exemption to $290,000, but this is better than the position they were in prior to the budget. I know that, once we get over the hurdle of it, it is going to provide great benefit to them.
There is a long way to go with the development of wineries, particularly in regional and rural areas, as technology expands and people are able to grow grapes in areas where they have never been able to grow them before. When I drive down to Canberra now I see some of the diversity that is occurring in the wine industry in the hills around Lake George. People are growing vines in areas where they never would have considered growing quality grapes before. But species and varieties change, technology changes and the ability to work land is always on the increase. I quite like to see the investment in my electorate by people who have put a couple of acres under grape to produce a local product and to provide employment in a very vibrant and opportunity based industry that supports not only the wineries but the tourism industry as well. I commend this legislation to the House.",REPS,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (WINE PRODUCER REBATE AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Evans, Martyn, MP",ALP,2004-08-03,"—As a member representing South Australia it is a great pleasure to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Wine Producer Rebate and Other Measures) Bill 2004 this evening. That is especially so for someone who represents—and seeks to represent even more so—an area which is a great part of South Australia's winegrowing industry. The electorate of Bonython, which I currently represent, and the electorate of Wakefield—which I know the current member, the Speaker, will not mind if I take a proprietary interest in, because he knows of my great interest in a substantial part of his electorate—represent one of the premium winegrowing areas of South Australia.
The electorate that I now have, Bonython, contains Angle Vale, which is one of the closest winegrowing areas to the metropolitan area. That grape-growing area is particularly important to South Australia, as it is right in the metropolitan area and represents an opportunity for people to see viticulture on their very doorstep, in the suburban area. As we head out up the Main North Road, up the so-called riesling trail towards Clare, within the electorate of Wakefield—both new and old—we come to some of South Australia's premier winegrowing districts. The riesling trail through the cities of Auburn and Clare passes many famous wineries, both small and large. These are some of Australia's best winegrowing areas and produce a substantial part of South Australia's wine output. 
South Australia is famous for its wine and its wine tourism. We really come to understand the importance of measures like the one before the House tonight for economies like South Australia's and for regional economies like that of the Clare Valley. This measure, I think, very much underpins part of the regional growth strategy of South Australia and the subregional strategy of areas like Clare. That applies throughout Australia in the districts which my colleagues on both sides of the parliament have spoken about this evening.
Before we address that in detail, I think it is important to go back a bit and look at the way the industry has grown in Australia over the years. It is important to note that in 1966, just four decades ago, Australian domestic wine consumption amounted to little more than two bottles per head of population per annum—a very small quantity indeed. Yet when we look at the intervening period we can see that wine production has jumped enormously. It is now some 572 million litres a year, with Australians consuming some 24 bottles of wine per head of population per annum. That is a significant jump indeed, and one which we can attribute to more than just the changing lifestyles which Australians have enjoyed over that period of time. It shows the way in which our culture has benefited from immigration and the way in which we have come to appreciate the different lifestyles of people around the world because of immigration.
It also shows the way in which innovation in viticulture and wine-processing technology has allowed us to enjoy wine at a much cheaper price. It has allowed the mass production of wine to bring it to our tables in a way that more and more people can now afford. It has allowed the mass marketing of wine, but also it has allowed a great diversity of wine. I think that is something which is quite critical to this measure. It has allowed a large number of boutique wineries to flourish and a great diversity of wine production, so it has allowed a cultural shift in wine production. From 1966 to 2004—almost a 40-year period—wine consumption has gone from two bottles a year per head of population to 24 or 25 bottles a year per head of population. I suppose some of us are doing more for Australia than others in that regard and are holding up those who are unable to discharge their duty to the country in quite the way that others are. We are ensuring that the wine industry, therefore, is able to build a firm domestic base from which to then contribute to Australia's export industry. I will cover some of the other important statistics in a moment.
South Australia is a very important part of the national wine industry. Our industry employs some 12,000 people, including 500 cellar door staff. That is very significant for a regional economy like South Australia's. Wine tourism, which is a vital part of that total industry, is also a very big employer. Wine tourism in the six main wine regions in South Australia contributes around $500 million annually to South Australia's economy. We have nearly one million visitors a year to South Australia. They purchase nearly four million bottles of wine, which is worth around $65 million to South Australia's economy. They buy those at cellar doors. 
That is a very significant outcome for South Australia's wine industry and for the economy as a whole. That goes very much for my electorate, because the riesling trail from Adelaide to Clare is one of the very important wine tourism regions. By enhancing that, we enhance the whole of South Australia's tourism potential. New jobs have in fact grown quite significantly over the last four or five years. Between 1996 and 2001, there was an increase of nearly 90 per cent in new jobs because of grape growing and wine production. Indeed, South Australia probably has half those jobs.
The very viability of that industry has contributed enormously to the viability of South Australia's economy. While we still have very substantial contributions from motor vehicle industries and defence industries, that wine industry is a value-added agricultural industry, contributing, as it does, along with our horticultural industries, wheat and traditional agricultural industries. Wine can be produced very much more quickly than many of those other products and therefore adds value in a way that they cannot. It is able to grow in value more substantially than those industries because of the significant additional value which it brings through intangible means. The wine industry has an intangible value for people which many of those other commodity based industries simply do not have.
What about the structure of that industry? Why is that so critical? We find that the overwhelming majority of the industry is based in some quite small premises. I think you will find that probably 90 per cent of the industry is based on some quite small properties producing relatively small amounts of wine. That is why the structure of this rebate is quite critical to the industry. I think the government could have designed this differently, as my colleague the member for Kingston has outlined. But the reality is that this is the measure that we have before us, so I think it is important to deal with that as well, although I commend the member for Kingston on the work that he has put in over many years in trying to coax the government towards the point we are at now.
However, the reality is that, at the moment, the industry faces a financial situation which is less than desirable. While it has seen massive growth, with exports surpassing $2 billion annually—which is over 1½ million bottles or `ambassadors', as I think one of the industry's leading lights, Peter Barnes, described them in a speech at a recent conference, `ambassadors' which go proudly forth on behalf of the industry to three million consumers every day—and while those exports have recently overtaken domestic sales and the US market has now overtaken the UK market as the leading export market for Australian wine, the small producers are the basis for the wine tourist market. They are the principal attraction for people who come through in their vehicles and want to go on tours and look around wineries and so on. They do not necessarily want to go to the very large producers, who are perhaps more efficient and who are perhaps the basis for that large export industry. Those large producers are certainly not the basis of the tourist market. The basis is the small boutique wineries, which the tourists are probably much more attracted to seeing. They find it much more interesting to see the diversity of wine and the diversity of cultural output, and they find that a much more attractive proposition as a wine tourist undertaking. These wineries will be the beneficiaries of this kind of rebate, even though it has probably come a little late in the day from budget day to help them in the way which it could have. That would be a desirable outcome in this context. 
Australia's wine industry has succeeded where others have not because of the efficiency of its output, because of the science which has gone into the industry and because of the very successful marketing strategies which the industry has employed. I think the government could do more to assist that industry by ensuring the infrastructure is there. The infrastructure in the Clare Valley needs to be improved to ensure that tourists can reach the area. The road infrastructure needs to be there. Main North Road to Clare certainly needs to be improved to ensure that tourists can travel on a relatively safe and secure road. The infrastructure should be properly upgraded and improved. We need to ensure that the telecommunications infrastructure is in place so that people can receive GSM signals on telephones throughout the area, not just CDMA. That is not yet properly in place. We need proper TAFE college courses for hospitality in the local region to ensure that the full tourism and hospitality industry service courses are in place. All those things are important.
Of course, the science of viticulture can always be upgraded and improved through further R&D efforts. The industry has made great strides in irrigation technology, reducing its call on water resources, which is very important to ensure that salinity does not become a problem. Recent work by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Science and Innovation is to be commended in that regard. But I think the government needs to be vigilant in ensuring that we work with the industry and that proper science based work is undertaken to ensure that salinity is not an issue here and that the industry gets the full resources of our science base. This would ensure that the best possible technology is brought to bear in irrigation to ensure that our vineyards receive the best possible water resource technology to drive their future growth.
So there is a whole range of assistance which government can properly provide for the industry to encourage its future growth and to ensure that our small boutique wineries are encouraged, despite the current financial difficulties which they are under. This will certainly assist them in that regard. I commend the second reading to the House, but I certainly hope that we will be able to use the FTA to ensure that our wine labelling issues are resolved as a matter of urgency—if indeed that measure comes into law, as I hope it ultimately will if commonsense can prevail in getting it through now. That will be of assistance to the industry as well. With those remarks, I commend that to the House.",REPS,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (WINE PRODUCER REBATE AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Smith, Anthony, MP",LP,2004-08-03,"—I want to speak briefly on this important bill and associate myself with the remarks of all those on this side of the House who are supporting it. This is an important tax reform for the wine industry. It provides a $290,000 rebate on the first $1 million of sales for every wine producer every year. Whilst this important tax reduction applies right across the board, it is particularly beneficial to our small wine producers. For some of the very smallest wine producers in my electorate of Casey and across the rest of Australia—those who have annual sales of less than $1 million—it will mean that, effectively, from 1 October they will be paying no wine equalisation tax at all. For those small wineries with annual sales exceeding $1 million each year it means a tax reduction of at least $290,000 every single year.
Effectively this reform will operate like a tax-free threshold—the new threshold being $1 million, below which no wine producer pays any wine equalisation tax at all. The rate will be 29 per cent from 1 October, just under two months away. As previous speakers have outlined, the tax reduction itself will be effected by way of a rebate so that any wine equalisation tax paid by a wine producer on the first $1 million of sales will be fully rebated and fully returned. As I have indicated, it is the small wineries particularly who will, in a proportional sense and a day-to-day cash flow sense, benefit the most from this change. In fact it is estimated in budget papers that 90 per cent of all wine producers in Australia will be fully rebated and effectively 100 per cent exempt from the wine equalisation tax. That means that from 1 October, 90 per cent of wine producers in Australia will move from a taxable position with regard to the wine equalisation tax to a zero net tax position where, for all practical purposes, they will pay no wine equalisation tax at all. That is a great outcome for small wineries in my electorate of Casey and the other electorates where there are significant numbers of wineries right across rural and regional Australia. Whilst it is not acknowledged or, often, comprehended by those opposite, this reform is the result of very sensible, quite longstanding dialogue and consultation between members on this side of the House from rural Australia and the outer suburbs and regional areas like the one I represent. It is the culmination of quite a long dialogue that has brought about a good outcome and a practical result. 
I would like to briefly make mention of some of the small wine producers with whom I have had contact in my electorate who have worked long and hard in arguing the case for action on this front. They have been quite productive in putting forward policy proposals. In particular, I would like to mention Kevin Ryan and his wife Margaret, Steve and Ros Atkinson from Yering and Peter Fergusson from Yarra Glen—all of these are from the Yarra Valley—who have been in contact with me on this issue for a couple of years now. These people and many more over many months in the last couple of years have put the case quite firmly, sensibly and productively to members like me, to my colleagues and to government ministers to bring about this change as part of the budget.
I would also like to pay tribute to and make mention of the member for McEwen—my friend and colleague Fran Bailey. By virtue of the fact that she is a minister, she is unable to speak in this debate but I think it would be fair to say, and my colleagues would agree, that no-one has worked longer and harder on this issue than she has to bring about this change. She has worked very hard on this over a number of years, particularly in the Yarra Valley—where her electorate of McEwen adjoins my electorate of Casey—and also right up into the Macedon Ranges. I know that if she were able to speak in this debate she would be here right now doing so. She would also like to thank Peter Fergusson from Yarra Glen, with whom she has had a long association in her electorate of McEwen, and John Ellis and Gordon Cope-Williams in the Macedon Ranges, who have also been working very hard with her to bring this about.
It is important that we all acknowledge that the ability to bring these reforms about and get this sort of result is a direct consequence of the government's strong financial and budget management. I think that is an important point that needs to be made here in the House, and it is something I know that the small wine producers certainly comprehend. It is the critical factor in the difference between mere policy proposals and promises and concrete policy implementation and outcomes of the type that we are seeing with the Tax Laws Amendment (Wine Producer Rebate and Other Measures) Bill 2004. Any member of parliament, any political party, any group can say they will do something but the ability to actually bring it about only comes through strong and sensible budget management that provides the funds to do these sorts of things and provide the sort of assistance that we are providing to the wineries right across Australia. 
As previous speakers have pointed out, small wineries play a vital role in regional Australia and on the outskirts of all our towns and cities. I agree with the previous speaker, who said that they provide very important competition and diversity and, above all, they produce a quality product. It is that above all else that people visiting our tourist regions want to see. They like to visit and experience the product first-hand. As the previous speaker also said, wine producers are increasingly becoming very export focused. I think that is a great success story for Australia and one we should all be proud of.
When you think of the wine industry and how it has evolved—not just in recent years but over a long period of time—I know my colleague from The Nationals will agree with me when I say that, at the end of the day, the people in the industry are farmers but they are not seen that way. The fact that the industry has become one of Australia's most successful industries, which is world renowned, including in Europe and the United States, with very little government assistance is a real tribute to them. I think the member for McEwen would agree with me that the quality that has driven that has really come from the small wineries in the Yarra Valley, the Macedon Ranges and those areas. They are the great success stories you hear. The big wine producers play a major role as well, but the innovation, diversity, interest and excitement has really come from those small wine producers, who themselves have often sacrificed a great deal.
The common story that the member for McEwen and I heard as we worked with these people was that they had given up a job, often a secure career, 10 or 20 years ago to establish a winery in the full knowledge that it would produce nothing in the way of profits or livelihood for a long period, but they are very passionate and very hardworking. They have a seven-day-a-week job, and this measure in the bill will very much help them. It will help not only them but, importantly, the local community.
I mention that because it is something that is critical to electorates like Casey and McEwen moving forward. We are seeing a tourism industry and a hospitality industry develop; we are seeing a whole experience that is providing jobs, opportunities and new careers for young people living in the region and the surrounding suburbs. The small wineries are a vital cog and a vital ingredient to that. As the agribusiness, hospitality and tourism industries start to interlink and provide those sorts of opportunities, I think new careers and options will increasingly become available, particularly for young people training in those areas. That is bringing a lot of interest and excitement to our high schools in Casey and McEwen and to the local Swinburne University, which is starting to specialise in those areas.
As I wrap up, I want to pay tribute again to the small wineries in the Yarra Valley. The member for McEwen and I would agree with absolutely everything that has been said on this side of the House, with one exception—because we know that the wineries in the Yarra Valley and the Macedon Ranges are the best wineries in Australia. There is no doubt about that. They are the best wineries in Australia, and they have done a very good job over a long period of time. I would like to commend them for the way they have interacted and brought about this policy reform in a very sensible and mature way.",REPS,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (WINE PRODUCER REBATE AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Katter, Bob, MP",IND,2004-08-03,"—In rising to address the Tax Laws Amendment (Wine Producer Rebate and Other Measures) Bill 2004, I would like to say that I, like a large number of people in the House, have seen a great increase in the number of wineries and the wine production in North Queensland. It has probably not been as much as we would like, but some people have invested a huge amount of money. Charlie Nastasi, one of the big mango kings of Australia, is now producing wine in addition to his mango production, and that has been a success story for him. Some other wineries in the region include Mt Uncle winery, Murdering Point Winery, Paradise Estate Wines and Wine Works Downunder at Herberton, under Pat O'Brien. 
We praise the government for what they are doing in this bill with the $290,000 rebate, which is quite substantial, but we do not want to lose sight of the fact that the introduction of the GST meant that everything was going to be taxed at 10 per cent. This most certainly does not equate to 10 per cent. We cannot help but reflect upon the fact that the current government—and they are very embarrassed to admit it—have doubled taxation in their short period in office. The reason the other side of the House do not bring attention to this is that they trebled taxation in their period in office. One wonders whether the country can continue to increase taxation by 500 per cent every 16 or 17 years.
As previous speakers have remarked, this industry has been created by the people of Australia without any real input one way or the other from the governments of Australia. I see industries in my state of Queensland that invariably have been created by government action. The Queensland government has invested money in a dam, a coal loader, a railway line for coal—that particular example leaps to my mind—hard rock mining from Mount Isa and the sugar mills. The infrastructure for all of those things was built by the government in Queensland. Also, the abattoirs were, in the main, outside of Lord Vesty, built by the government in Queensland. So we come from a state where the government built all of these things and then the farmers paid the government back and purchased all those assets over a period of time.
But here we have an industry that has been grown by the people themselves. Each of these wineries in the electorate that I represent has been built by people who have had no assistance from anyone—no breaks anywhere. Out of the dearth of alternatives they could go into, they have come up with a very aggressive and of course a very magnificent adjunct to the giant tourism industry of North Queensland, whose main attractions have been the rainforest—and it is one of the few rainforests in the world one can walk safely through—and the Great Barrier Reef. But regions need other things as well, and the wineries have made a very great contribution to increasing the qualitative as well as the quantitative basket of value that we have to offer to Australian and overseas tourists.
There is one other aspect of this legislation which is of more than passing interest, and that is retail processing. If the big retailers in this country, Woolworths and Coles, buy in bulk, they pay tax only on the bulk purchase. They do not pay tax on all the processing costs, which of course in the case of wine—the labelling, the bottling and the corking—are very large indeed. So, because Treasury knows it cannot win in a fight against Woolworths and Coles in this place, whoever is in government—and of course what would happen here would be a magnificent side-stepping of not only the legislation but also the spirit and the reality of the legislation—it very cleverly moved before Woolworths and Coles could move. So we pay Treasury a great tribute here for showing that very fast leg work. But it is a sad reflection on the government of Australia that we have to run in fear of these giant corporations. 
I do not think anyone here has really viewed with any degree of pleasure the rise of Southcorp. Australians created and worked in this great owner-operator industry. They were people on the land with dirt under their fingernails. As the years have passed, they have been replaced by the corporates—the people sitting in the boardrooms. Of course, in the case of Southcorp, you can see how abysmally the corporates have run agriculture in this country compared with the success story when these operations were owner operated. There are some wonderful stories, books, magazines and articles about Southcorp. It is a very depressing story indeed.
Would to heaven that government could use the power that it has to be able to influence the marketplace to the point where the owner-operators stay running the country of Australia—not the big corporations where people are so divorced from the growing of grapes or the production of wine they would not have any idea how these operations take place. In my own industries, we have seen that in Stanbroke and a number of other giant corporations. When tough times come in the cattle industry, it is the corporations that go down first. And it does not give me any joy to watch the elevation of the current head of Telstra. I was there one morning, as were a number of other members of parliament, when he said that agriculture in Australia is struggling but, as it becomes more corporatised, it will become more efficient. You need look no further than this industry to see whether it is the owner-operators or the corporations who are efficient.
I want to praise the government insofar as there are some restraints built into this legislation. The benefits for putting in new grapevines—the accelerated depreciation—have been taken away from new people coming into the industry. I most certainly would like a lot more wineries in the Kennedy electorate and in North Queensland. This is one of maybe two agricultural industries that are making a quid in this country and have the possibility of competing in the longer term. One often wonders whether this is actually a secondary industry rather than a primary industry, but I think we can safely say that if there were no primary industry there most certainly would be no secondary part to the industry. In this case, if there is massive overproduction, there will be a collapse. We can say, `Supply and demand has worked the thing out in the long term' but, for those of us who are close to the people we represent and have to witness the hardship and heartbreak of that process working itself out, I do not think it works itself out in a very humane fashion.
A government member interjecting—
—I take the interjection from the honourable member. He probably fits into the category of this person who has been elevated to the head of Telstra. And we have the wonderful performance at the Reserve Bank, where our interest rates are 500 per cent higher than one trading partner and infinitely higher than the other, holding up the dollar—and the NFF, his own organisation, says it is costing rural Australians $12,000 million a year. That is how successful that mentality has been—and I walk forward with a very great degree of temerity when I am walking in this particular minefield.
There needs to be some sort of dampening down of a massive increase in production. There was a magnificently successful scheme introduced in the wool industry. It increased the price of wool by 300 per cent. That great man Doug Anthony introduced it and that terrible man Mr Keating undermined it and then overturned it. I speak with great authority because the acting head at the time was a personal friend of mine and a man of outstanding talents and abilities. I also discussed it with a number of previous ministers in the conservative government in this place, and they verified what John Barr had told me about the undermining of the scheme and the withdrawal of the government scheme altogether. Of course the price then collapsed 300 per cent. 
A lot of intelligent people said that the one mistake that was made with that wonderful scheme was that they had no production controls. Whilst sometimes we hesitate to go into that degree of regulation, I do praise the government for some sort of dampening down of a massive explosion of production in this industry—which would see it go the way of so many other industries when massive overproduction has taken place.
The wine industry is a great success story created by the little, ordinary hardworking owner-operating class of Australians, not by big corporations. The big corporations played no part in this success story. If they had come down at the grouter, one could judge their performance. Here is a clear-cut case where two horses were put in the race—one the corporates and one the owner-operators. My last reading was that they were getting the owner-operators back to get the corporates out of trouble. That was the universal message being carried in the national financial media. I thought it was a wonderful advertisement for the sort of point of view that is championed by a little group of people in this part of the parliament and is being opposed by the major political parties in this arena.",REPS,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (WINE PRODUCER REBATE AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Cobb, John, MP",NATS,2004-08-03,"—The Tax Laws Amendment (Wine Producer Rebate and Other Measures) Bill 2004 is probably one of the best examples of a government looking at what is happening in an industry and recognising what it needs, where it has been and where it is going. A wine producer rebate measure was announced by this government in the 2004-05 budget to provide a wine equalisation tax, WET, rebate of up to $290,000 to every wine producer per annum. This effectively exempts from WET a million dollars wholesale value of each producer's domestic wine sales per financial year.
I was rather staggered—`amazed' would be a better word—to hear the previous speaker, the member for Kennedy, attack corporate agriculture. I would be the first person to say that the most efficient producers of agriculture in Australia are large family farms, but why that merits an attack on corporate agriculture I do not know. They are the people who have the money to conduct experiments that the family farmers then put to very efficient end use. It was quite extraordinary, really, when you consider that the people who are going to benefit from this amendment to the tax law are the family farmers, the entrepreneurs and the specialist winegrowers. If anything, the corporates probably lose; they certainly do not gain in any measure in the way that the small producer does. To suggest that corporate winegrowers have not contributed to the Australian wine industry shows nothing short of a lunatic lack of knowledge of the whole industry. It has been a combined effort by family growers, conglomerates of investors and corporate agriculture—and it has been a highly successful one.
The wine producer rebate measure replaces the current Australian government cellar door rebate scheme and the accelerated depreciation provision for grapevine plantings. It takes effect on 1 October this year. That is the result of a lot of consultation with wine producers. Those of us who are or have been involved in agriculture would realise that the wine industry of Australia has seen that it is time for that accelerated depreciation to finish. The wine industry is very appreciative of the fact that the two things have happened simultaneously. Under the new arrangement contained in this bill, a maximum rebate of $290,000 with no decrease in payment for wholesale values of sales exceeding the $1 million threshold is available to each wine producer within the new regime. Also, that rebate is not exclusively linked to cellar door sales. 
The rebate applies to sales of up to $1 million where the wine is sold direct to a retailer, via a distributor, through cellar door sales or through mail order. It pretty much covers everything in retail sales. For the smaller wineries in my own electorate it represents a very significant boost to their operations and their ongoing development. Like many small wineries, these businesses sell and market their excellent wines directly to markets that they have quite often developed themselves—niche markets or markets they have gone out and found and developed. As a result, many of these boutique and small wineries have been unable to pass on or claim back their WET under the existing arrangements.
The wine industry is a sector which is growing enormously in regional Australia. There are over 1,600 wineries operating in Australia, and that is a doubling of the total amount over the last 10 years. It has certainly been a success story in Australian agriculture. Of those over 1,600 wineries, about 1,580 crush less than 1,000 tonnes of grapes each year. In my own electorate, the small and boutique wineries in the area include such wineries as: Tanmor Wines, the Red Earth Estate Vineyard, the Lazy River Estate, Boards Estate Wines, and the Indigenous owned and operated Murrin Bridge winery in the Central West, between Lake Cargelligo and Euabalong—that is an area I know well; I played football there as a youngster.
The Murrin Bridge winery is run by an Indigenous group who had the desire and the go-ahead to do it. They got help from TAFE and various other people to teach them how to grow wine. They saw the opportunity. They had the land and the water was there. It is one of the success stories of Indigenous people using their own initiative, seeking help where it exists and doing it in a sensible way. This measure will be an enormous boost to them. I was there only a month or two ago, and what they have developed there is nothing short of remarkable. It has an enormous future. This measure of the government's will undoubtedly put a small established orchard like that, producing their own wine with help, on the road to a sustainable, long-term footing.
Wine producers will all receive tax relief with the passage of this bill, and around 90 per cent of wine producers will be able to fully offset their WET liability by accessing the new rebate. In particular, small wine producers in rural and regional Australia will benefit significantly, receiving around 85 per cent of the total rebate benefits. Why that would produce the type of attack on corporations from the member for Kennedy that it did only he would know. But, then again, only he would know why he says most of the things that he does.
Returning more money to the wine industry equates to more jobs for regional Australia and greater wealth for all of us. In a full financial year, around $90 million will be injected back into the industry—on average, an injection of approximately $57,000 for each and every small winery in Australia. Knowing agriculture as I do, that is no insignificant amount of money and no insignificant step that has been taken by the federal government. I urge all members of this place to support this bill. It will certainly result in greater support for our rural and regional industries and for rural and regional Australia, a lot of which has not pulled out of the worst drought in living memory. 
A further aspect of the wine industry is its important relationship with tourism. You cannot separate tourism from the wine industry. Wineries and cellar door tastings and sales are attractions that encourage tourism. They even encourage people within a local area, region or state to get out and have a look at what they actually have. Wineries are a tourist attraction in the Barossa Valley and the Clare Valley in South Australia, in the Margaret River region in Western Australia, in the Hunter and the Riverina in New South Wales, and even in my own electorate in Forbes, Parkes and down at the Lachlan. It is a fact of life, and very few people can stop themselves from taking in the attraction—from ducking into a winery when they pass one.
These wine-growing regions are well known not just nationally and at the state level but internationally. Australia is at the forefront as a wine producer. This is the country that came up with controlled temperature, stainless steel curing of wine. It probably leads the way in modern wine viticulture. This tourism potential is an incredible fact that must be considered when government initiatives and programs are developed. It will multiply, as we are also assisting the tourism industry and the wider agribusiness sector.
Agricultural based industry still remains one of the biggest export industries in Australia. Well over 20 per cent—around 23 per cent—of our exports are still agriculturally based. We still export almost 70 per cent of our agricultural product. Any measure like this is going to have an enormous effect upon agriculture in general in country Australia. There are threats to the wine industry, just as there are threats to all regional agribusinesses. One of the biggest threats to the wine industry is probably the members opposite and certainly anyone who talks the rubbish that we have just heard the member for Kennedy talking. That kind of thing can only do harm to an industry, no matter where it is said.
Our people in country Australia are totally justified in being fearful of just where the Labor Party would lead them if they were ever to get back into government. The US-Australia free trade agreement is a great example of the city-centric views held by many of those opposite. It always was, and always would be, good for the future of our regional agricultural industries, for Australia in general and certainly for country Australia. Yet the influence Labor come under and the loyalties they subscribe to make you wonder if they are talking about the same agreement that we are talking about. Even today we heard in this chamber that they really do not know exactly where they are on it. It is obviously not with those working hard in these very industries, who not only feed and clothe the nation but also generate billions of dollars. Viticulture, in particular, over the next 10 years is going to benefit substantially from the free trade agreement with the United States of America. It is obviously very much to its advantage for this free trade deal to go through.
Another area of concern for regional Australia is the position of Labor on mining and forestry. If they take the attitude that they take with wineries on that, it is a problem. You would hope that they do not let it sneak through to the way they may vote on this bill. Are they standing up for workers in those industries? I can assure you that they are not—not judging by their attitude. If you look at their latest star recruit, Peter Garrett, with his undoubted green credentials, you see that he is pretty much against any increase in production that you can think of. His erstwhile companions the Greens—one wonders where he is with them now—would have us abandon all new mines and shut down existing mines. They do not want us to increase agricultural production. They think a free trade deal means unsustainable production. Australia, especially in agriculture, has only scratched the surface of its ability to sustainably produce. If the Greens, Peter Garrett and his newfound friends got away from their textbooks and computers and learnt a little about agriculture and what Australia does and how it does it, they might actually learn about it. 
Peter Garrett is a Labor candidate who has actively protested against, and supported the protesters against, all new mining ventures and land development operations. As for the forestry industry, under what Peter Garrett has always proposed, they might as well as walk away from their jobs right now. It would mean no jobs, no security and absolutely no opportunity for the children of all those people and many around them. It is not empty rhetoric that I am talking about but rather the grim future that industries like the Australian mining industry, the agricultural industry and the forestry industry would have under a Labor government, with Peter Garrett and the Greens leading the away.
The bill that we are debating here today supports the expansion of the wine industry. It injects much-needed capital or income into it. The dreams and aspirations of those growing wine producers could also be dashed, as they require land to develop and that would not be available under a Peter Garrett Labor Party. Labor are going to have to bow down to the Greens, because obviously that is who they are going to depend upon for all their support in the Senate, one would assume, if we ever had a Labor government. If we ever have the Greens in control of the Senate and Labor in control of this House, I fear for agriculture in a way I have never feared for it before.
We must remember that these are the realities that those opposite and certainly the Greens in the other place do not understand and do not consider. As I said before, they actually need to learn about agriculture and sustainability. Without doubt, they need to realise the absolute truth about agriculture. Those of us who have the most to lose out of hurting our land are presumed to want to hurt it. Something that those whom I call the fundamentalist environmentalists, the Greens and Labor have to learn to come to grips with is that we do not want to hurt it. We have the most to lose if we abuse that land. Let us get on with looking after it.
This government understands and can implement policies and programs that encourage sustainable development and sustainable growth. I think that the bill that we are debating here today is probably the best example you are likely to see of a government that has listened to an industry, supported an industry, helped it to get onto its feet and helped it to get into the incredible development phase that it has had over the past decade. Then, when it got going, it has listened to it once again and seen its needs. It recommended the measures that helped it to expand as it did—and this will surprise the member for Kennedy—along with the help of a lot of corporate and business investment into the wine industry. At the same time, it is taking away a tax that at this point in time could hold it back. It is going to inject incredible opportunities for the wine industry, especially for the smaller producers. I would hope that everybody in this House and in the Senate could support a bill that is built on commonsense and is best for developing Australia, especially country Australia.",REPS,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (WINE PRODUCER REBATE AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Prosser, Geoff, MP",LP,2004-08-03,"—I rise to support the Tax Laws Amendment (Wine Producer Rebate and Other Measures) Bill 2004, which proposes to amend the A New Tax System (Wine Equalisation Tax) Act 1999, or the WET act, by implementing a new wine producer rebate to improve certain compliance and administrative issues arising from the legislation. The amendments will: enable wine producers to claim a wine producer rebate offsetting wine tax liability under a threshold wholesale value for domestic wine sales; repeal provisions that provide for producer rebate of certain retail sales and applications for own use; include the value-added costs involved in bottling and packaging bulk wine for purposes of retail sale in the tax base for assessment of wine tax liability; and include the receipt of certain wine tax credits after export of wine as a ground for the preselection of wine tax exemption upon re-entry of wine that has not been altered or undergone a change of ownership. 
The main thrust of the amendments is to reduce the tax burden for small and medium sized businesses and decrease the overall paperwork for wine producers. In addition, the amendments are designed to reduce incidences of tax minimisation and align depreciation rules for grapevines with those applicable to horticultural plants. The amendments set out the grounds upon which producers will be eligible for rebates, define those producers eligible for a rebate, provide transitional provisions for commencement of the rebate on and from 1 October 2004 and replace the current Australian government cellar door rebate system.
Members would be aware that currently wineries get a partial tax offset from cellar door sales. However, this benefits only those wineries on the tourist circuit, where, as a result of their location, cellar door sales are naturally high. However, the new and emerging wineries such as those within my electorate in the South-West of Western Australia find it very difficult to achieve cellar door sales of any note to be eligible for the tax offset. This proposal will provide a level playing field to the advantage of small producers. I was happy to be involved in the discussions and initiatives for the introduction of this new WET arrangement. I know that wineries, particularly the smaller boutique wineries, will benefit from this new measure, which will reduce their paperwork quite considerably.
The provision of a wine producer rebate measure was announced by the Australian government in the 2004-05 budget. It will provide a maximum wine equalisation tax rebate of $290,000 per annum to eligible wine producers. The WET exemption will apply to wholesale sales of $1 million of each producer's domestic wine sales per financial year. Under the new arrangements, the new producer rebate is not exclusively linked to cellar door sales as it will apply to all domestic sales. Around 90 per cent of wine producers will be able to fully offset their WET liability by accessing this new rebate. In particular, those small producers in regional Australia will benefit significantly, receiving around 85 per cent of the rebate benefits. It is estimated that this measure will provide additional assistance of around $338 million to wine producers over the next four years.
The winery sector has made a significant contribution to regional Australia, quadrupling employment opportunities over the past decade. There are now approximately 57,000 people employed either directly or indirectly as a result of the growth in this industry. Consistent with current producer rebate arrangements, the new wine producer rebate is payable to producers of grape wine, grape wine products, fruit or vegetable wine and mead. However, in this regard, I am pleased this will also include, under a subsequent government amendment, cider producers that have been drawn into the WET arrangements but which are currently excluded from the proposed new WET rebate legislation. 
This particularly affects cider producers in my electorate who are compelled to comply with the existing WET arrangements and were excluded from these provisions in the original draft of this legislation. To add insult to injury, the cider producers were also excluded from the cellar door sales rebate scheme. The WET rebate will continue to be claimed through the business activity statement and, to reflect the implementation of these new arrangements, transitional provisions in this bill will govern the payment of rebates under the existing arrangements for wine sales between 1 July 2004 and 30 September 2004 in the 2004-05 financial year. WET on wine sales effected after the commencement of the new rebate scheme on 1 October 2004 will be rebated under the new scheme. For wine dealings from 1 October 2004, the maximum rebate available is on a pro rata basis and will be 75 per cent for the nine-month period to 30 June 2005 and will exclude the period of the 2004-05 financial year accounted for under the existing arrangement—that is, from 1 July 2004 to 30 September 2004.
Under this proposed bill the amount of producer rebate is calculated as 29 per cent of the wholesale value of wine sold or applied to own use. New provisions allow for rebates to be paid to wine producers, whether licensed under state legislation or not, and producers and groups of producers may claim the rebate. These will replace the current legislation whereby rebates are paid to wine producers that are licensed under state legislation, and each licensee may claim a rebate for qualifying sales. Amounts claimed by wine producers under the new producer rebate scheme are to be treated, as for rebates under the current scheme, as ordinary income.
The two compliance measures contained in this bill relate to ensuring wine packaging is included in the tax base and deal with the export and re-entry of wine. As WET applies at the rate of 29 per cent of the final wholesale sale of wine, or nominal value, in the absence of an exemption, schedule 2 of this bill makes amendments to the WET act to ensure costs of wine packaging that are integral to the preparation of wine for retail sale, such as placing wine in containers and labelling and sealing those containers, are included in the calculation of the taxable value of wine.
Historically, wine has been sold by the wine producer after it has been packaged for retail sale and WET has included a component drawn from wine packaging in containers such as bottles and casks. However, some retailers who are able to buy wine in bulk volumes may do so and then package the wine for retail sale themselves. In doing so, the wine tax is not applied to the packaging component of the wine product. The intention of this measure is to address the nature of costs incurred in the necessary processes to prepare the wine to reach the point of retail sale.
Moreover, the amendments reflect that the measure does not intend to impose a WET liability for the wine packaging component on organisations that undertake bottling, labelling and packaging activities for non-commercial purposes, such as for fundraising for charity. The retail sale of wine that was packaged after the final wholesale sale will have WET calculated on the basis of its notional wholesale sale value, which is calculated according to existing procedures detailed in the WET act. Existing credit rules apply when determining the final WET payable to prevent WET applying more than once to the same goods, with the effect that WET already borne on the wine component of the retail product will be deductible from the final calculation of WET payable. Schedule 2 of this bill also makes amendments to the WET act that will ensure wine exported from Australia for which a wine tax credit has been claimed and then imported into Australia by the same person for further dealings will attract a wine tax liability, notwithstanding the earlier attribution of a wine tax credit. 
The amendments remove the potential for export and import arrangements to be manipulated to avoid payment of wine tax. Generally speaking, wine exports are exempt from WET, while imports of wine are subject to wine tax. Where WET has been borne by an exporter, they may claim a wine tax credit, which ensures that the export is exempt from WET. If that exporter then returns the wine to Australia as an importer, WET is not applied provided that: the wine is unaltered from when it was exported; there has been no change in ownership; the original acquisition of the wine, if the importer did not manufacture the wine, was by a dealing that was subject to wine tax; and a payment had not been claimed under the tourist refund scheme. Under these arrangements it is possible for a person to first acquire wine in a way that is subject to a taxable dealing and then export the wine and claim a wine tax credit before returning the wine to Australia, with no requirement to pay wine tax. The result would be that a person has avoided wine tax for wine intended for sale in Australia.
Other amendments under this bill propose changes to capital allowances for grapevines by the removal of accelerated depreciation for grapevines. Schedule 3 of this bill makes amendments to remove provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, which provides special rules for determining the decline in value of grapevines. As part of a package of changes to the taxation treatment of the wine industry, the government has decided, effective from 1 October 2004, to align the treatment of grapevines with the general treatment provided for other horticultural plants. Therefore, from October 2004, taxpayers can either calculate their own estimate of the effective life of the grapevine or rely on the safe harbour determination by the Commissioner of Taxation. Currently, a grapevine starts to decline in value in the year in which the taxpayer first uses it as a primary production business for the purpose of producing assessable income. Grapevines are written off over a period of four years at a rate of 25 per cent per annum.
Schedule 3 of this bill deletes the reference to grapevines as a separate category of depreciable asset, with effect from 1 October 2004. Grapevines which were established prior to 1 October 2004 will continue to be deductable under the old rules, subject to meeting all of the requirements under those rules before 1 October 2004. However, following these amendments, the deduction for grapevines which started to decline in value from 1 October 2004 can still transfer from one taxpayer to another. Where a taxpayer acquires a grapevine from another entity and the other entity used the repealed grapevine provisions to deduct the decline in value of the grapevine, the subsequent owner will, subject to satisfying the relevant conditions, be entitled to the remaining write-off. The subsequent owner will be able to calculate the decline in value under the former provisions using details obtained from the previous owners under section 40-575.
As my colleague the member for Parkes just mentioned, the changes will be a significant benefit to many small wine producers, particularly in the South-West of Western Australia. As I mentioned in my speech, I am pleased that the Treasurer has agreed to include the WET rebate for cider producers. I have a small number in my electorate. They were unintentionally left out of this bill, while, as I mentioned, they were unintentionally—I believe—caught up in the wine rebate initially. Of course they are not wine producers, but they copped the 29 per cent rebate. 
My colleague the member for Parkes also mentioned the enormous boost that the success of Australian wine exports and wine tourism has given Australia. It has been no more evident than in the South-West. Sure, the Margaret River area is a famous area in Western Australia, but so too are the emergent areas of Harvey, the Ferguson Valley, Pemberton and a whole range of other areas. They are interlinked with the tourism industry. As I mentioned, the problem with the old system was that, if a wine producer wanted to make cellar door sales and get reasonable sales, they had to be on the tourist circuit, and that meant being established around the Margaret River area. This system is fairer. This system will give everyone the same benefit and will reduce the paperwork for compliance. I am delighted that I am a member of the government that sought to give this sort of break to small wine producers particularly, and I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (WINE PRODUCER REBATE AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Hunt, Gregory, MP",LP,2004-08-03,"—I am delighted to be able to rise in support of the Tax Laws Amendment (Wine Producer Rebate and Other Measures) Bill 2004. I am delighted for a very simple reason: this bill brings relief, it brings increased business prospects, and it helps lay out the future for over 50 wine producers in my region. It helps the more than 150 grape growers within the electorate of Flinders, in areas such as Red Hill, Main Ridge, The Gurdies, Bass, and many other towns, including Merricks, Dromana, Moorooduc and Tuerong. All of these towns have small businesses which rely on the growing of grapes, the crushing of those grapes and the creation of wine to help create produce for the Mornington Peninsula and tourism for the Mornington Peninsula, Westernport and the area of the Bass Coast. This is a tremendous step forward for each of those small businesses.
It is also a tribute to the Mornington Peninsula Vignerons Association, which, as much as any small winemakers group in Australia, was responsible for this outcome. There were many people involved in helping to have the changes brought to the WET. We were told from the outset that it would not be possible, and yet, through a series of creative policy suggestions and through a concerted effort of working with local producers and with other MPs, we were able to bring about a change. So there are a series of people who deserve to be thanked: in particular, Mark Rodman, the head of the Mornington Peninsula Vignerons Association, and others who have worked with him—Brian Stonier, Nat White, Sir Peter Derham, Andrew McCutcheon and many others from the Mornington Peninsula, Westernport and Bass Coast regions. All of them helped to create the strength to push forward the case and to provide the intellectual drive to show that there was a real case in sound economics for lifting the threshold for the wine equalisation tax.
The essential change is simple. It is to lift the threshold for the rebate to $1 million, from a base of $300,000 tapering out to $580,000 for no rebate, and it applies to all—and I repeat all—winemakers in Australia. So, whether the business is small, medium or large, the first $1 million of wholesale sales value will be exempt from wine equalisation tax and it will be possible to claim a full rebate. That is a value of up to $290,000 in returns for small and medium businesses within the electorate of Flinders. So for producers in, as I say, Main Ridge, Red Hill, Merricks, Moorooduc, Bass, The Gurdies, Loch, St Heliers and many other towns there is a real and distinct change—$290,000 makes a significant difference for businesses. 
How does this work? The Commonwealth has agreed to lift the wine equalisation tax threshold from a base of $300,000 tapering out to zero at $580,000—a maximum rebate which would have been 42 per cent—up to a threshold now of $1 million and $290,000 in rebate. So that is an increase from $42,000 to $290,000: a net change of $248,000. That is a massive impact on small businesses which are able to take advantage of this change if they fall within the right sector of the market.
I am very pleased that we have been able to do this. It is an interesting example of an industry group representing small and medium sized businesses—not the big end of town—involved in agricultural production, manufacturing and wine tourism, working with MPs from throughout the country; in particular with members such as the member for Pearce, who helped coordinate the program, and the member for McEwen who is in this chamber at the moment. I would also like to thank the Treasurer, who was very flexible in allowing this change. It was not an easy change. It was one which we had to work for. It would not have occurred without the flexibility of the Treasurer and his willingness to look at the case, to listen and to adapt to a strong economic case.
Very simply, the Tax Laws Amendment (Wine Producer Rebate and Other Measures) Bill 2004 lifts the burden of the wine equalisation tax completely from all small wine producers who produce up to $1 million in wholesale sales. For those who produce over $1 million in wholesale sales, it reduces the burden of their tax payments by up to $290,000. That is a tremendous step forward for all the vignerons on the Mornington Peninsula, along the Bass Coast and around Westernport Bay. It is a great step forward. I thank the government. I thank the Treasurer. I commend the bill to the House. This is a great step forward for people who are concerned about wine tourism and small business and jobs on the Mornington Peninsula, around Westernport and along the Bass Coast.",REPS,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (WINE PRODUCER REBATE AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Brough, Mal, MP",LP,2004-08-03,"—I want to thank all of those from both sides of the House who contributed to this debate from this evening. The Tax Laws Amendment (Wine Producer Rebate and Other Measures) Bill 2004 contains amendments to the A New Tax System (Wine Equalisation Tax) Act 1999 to introduce new wine producer rebate arrangements and two compliance and revenue protection measures.
In the 2004-05 budget the Australian government announced that around $338 million of financial assistance would be provided to wine producers over the next four years in the form of a producer rebate that will replace the existing Australian government cellar door rebate scheme and the accelerated depreciation of grapevines on and from 1 October 2004.
The new wine producer rebate arrangements will give wine producers or groups of associated producers access to a maximum rebate of $290,000 each financial year. That will effectively exempt the first $1 million of wholesale value of domestic sales of wine each year. Key features of the new rebate are that the eligibility of the rebate is not tapered or ceased beyond the $1 million wholesale value threshold of the wine and that the rebate claimable is not affected by sales exceeding the threshold.
Under this measure, around 90 per cent of wine producers will receive a rebate that totally offsets any WET liability, with around 85 per cent of the benefits being received by small wine producers, mainly in rural and regional Australia. The removal of accelerated depreciation of grapevines will result in the alignment of treatment of new grapevine plantings with the general treatment of horticultural plants. The amendments will apply to grapevines which first begin to decline in value after 1 October 2004. 
The amendments ensure that costs of wine packaging necessary in preparation for retail sales, including bottling and labelling of wine, are included in the taxable value of the wine. This is done by creating a taxing point at the point of retail sale to capture all value adding costs incurred in the process of putting the wine onto the retail market. This addresses the practice of some large retailers of purchasing prepackaged bulk wine, which triggers WET assessment and payment, and then subsequently taking steps to bottle and package the wine with the effect of artificially minimising the cost to be attributed to the wine tax base.
The amendments also provide for a clawback of wine tax credits claimed after wine has been exported from Australia and then imported unaltered into Australia by the same person for further dealings domestically. This removes the potential for export and import arrangements to be used as mechanisms for avoiding payment of the wine tax.
I would just like to draw two issues out from the contribution of the member for Kingston, the shadow spokesman who addressed this issue earlier this evening. There were two substantive issues raised by the member for Kingston. The first issue was his second reading amendment supporting the introduction of a volumetric exemption. The second was the matter of the costing of the government's policy.
The government acknowledges that the wine production rebate differs from the pre-budget proposal of the Winemakers Federation of Australia that the first 600,000 litres of each winemaker's production should be exempt from WET. However, a volumetric exemption would be inconsistent with the value based nature of the WET and would require more complex calculations and increased administrative cost, particularly for small winemakers.
Also, an exemption rather than a rebate would lead to having the same wine in the market on both a taxed and an untaxed basis as that threshold was reached. In other words, wine that exceeded that threshold could be sitting on the shelf next to wine from before that date and, for all intents and purposes, be the same product with different taxation at the point of sale. By contrast, the government's effective exemption delivered through a rebate can continue to be accessed through the business activity statement. Clearly, that is less paperwork and less red tape for these small business persons.
The member for Kingston also queried details of the cost of this measure. First, as set out in the supplementary explanatory memorandum that I am about to table, the inclusion of cider, perry and sake producers will cost a further $1 million each financial year. Second, I can confirm the figures set out for the measure `Wine industry assistance: providing a wine equalisation tax producer rebate' in the budget measures 2004-05 are net figures that take into account the cessation of the existing Australian government cellar door rebate as included in this bill. Details of the expected cost of the cellar door rebate are included in the 2003 tax expenditure statements published by the Treasury.
I trust this information satisfies the member's concerns and avoids any attempt by the opposition to delay the passage of this bill and the important benefits it delivers to the wine industry. I table from the 2002-03 tax expenditure statements published by the Treasury in 2004 and also from Budget Paper No. 2, Budget Measures 2004-05, for the benefit of the member for Kingston. 
Finally, this government pay a great deal of respect to this industry, which is not only doing enormous things, as many of the members on both sides of the House have indicated tonight, for tourism and hospitality but also in export. Anything that the government can do by using practical measures to help facilitate the growth of this significant industry, particularly in regional and rural Australia, we will do—as we have done here. In doing so, we recognise that this industry is a major driver of employment and innovation in this country and an industry that has a very bright future under a coalition government. I commend the bill to the House.
 (Hon. L.R.S. Price)—The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Kingston has moved as an amendment that all words after `That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question.

"Cox, David, MP",ALP,2004-08-03,"—The Indirect Tax Legislation Amendment (Small Business Measures) Bill 2004 is a final admission by the government that the GST is proving an intolerable burden for small businesses in terms of administration. My first question in this place was to the Prime Minister. It was in early 1999 and it was this: `In the light of the foreshadowed changes to the business activity statement, does the Prime Minister now agree that he was right when he told the House on 12 March 1981 when as Treasurer, and in respect of his first failed great tax adventure:
A multi-stage VAT was rejected fairly quickly because it would have imposed an enormous paperwork burden on both taxpayers and collecting authorities.
Will he now admit that no matter how he attempts to simplify the business activity statement Australian taxpayers will not be able to avoid the enormous paperwork burden required to support GST compliance? Does the Prime Minister recall that that administrative burden was calculated in the government's own GST regulatory impact statement at $1.9 billion in an ordinary year? What small portion of that burden does he hope to relieve by his proposed measure?'
The Prime Minister's answer was, `Well, that was then and this is now.' He said that he had made his statement that the Fraser government had pretty quickly rejected a multistage VAT because he was the Treasurer and was part of that government, but he did not actually agree with it. He thought that the positives and the negatives of GST administration in 1999 were such that he was quite relaxed about the administrative burden that he was placing on Australian taxpayers, particularly small businesses—something of a backflip. Now we have the Prime Minister presiding over a government and another budget measure which is another backflip which will reverse that, admittedly only for very small taxpayers. This budget measure will allow small businesses with an annual turnover of less than $50,000 and non-profit bodies with an annual turnover of less than $100,000 the option of reporting and paying their GST on an annual basis. This is a fairly lacklustre attempt to reduce the heavy compliance burden placed on small business. It represents a cynical attempt by a tired government to shore up what it sees as a core constituency—small business—after ignoring the interests of that constituency for the last eight years. This is a pretty poor patch-up job.
Compare this to Labor's simpler BAS policy. Labor's simpler BAS policy applies to small businesses with a turnover of up to $2 million. It gives them the option of using a simple ratio method to calculate their GST on a quarterly basis. There is no need for an annual reconciliation, and it will provide a safe harbour against a tax audit. The premise of this policy is that people have now been paying GST for a number of years; they know a fair bit about their GST requirements and the tax office knows a fair bit about their GST requirements. The tax office should be perfectly well able to give them a ratio which is that proportion of their turnover that they need to pay in GST. Every quarter, instead of going through every invoice and doing a total reconciliation, they will simply have to add up their turnover, multiply it by their ratio and pay that amount of GST. That will be a significant saving in compliance for a very large number of small businesses. It is a concept that was first conceived by the opposition before the last election. The government has failed to come up with any substantial criticism of it. It has stood the test of time and it has certainly stood the test of acceptability of small businesses in this country. 
The government's small business measure to allow very small businesses to do the paperwork only once a year poses some significant risks for those small businesses, because if they do not set aside the amount of GST that they will ultimately have to pay then they will find themselves with severe cash flow problems. They will not be able to avoid doing all the paperwork, actually reconciling all of those tax invoices; it is simply the case that they will have to do it all in one lump at the end of the financial year rather than doing it in four smaller lumps, in instalments.
From the conversations that I have had with a number of peak accounting bodies, those accounting bodies are not impressed by it as a concept. To the extent that they look after small businesses—and most of them do—they can see that there will be pitfalls in this for many small businesses, and the peak accounting bodies are not enthusiastic about it. I think that, with the shortage of accountants in Australia today, their lack of enthusiasm is not related to the fact that they might be losing any business by the government implementing this measure. I think their concerns are more that a lot of small businesses will get themselves into a substantial amount of trouble and it will be more complex and more costly for accountants to help people sort their way through those problems.
Schedule 1 of this bill provides this option for microbusinesses that presently do not have to register for the GST. As I said, they are businesses with a $50,000 turnover and nonprofit bodies with turnovers of less than $100,000. I think it is interesting that the Labor Party has a somewhat different concept of what a small business is and puts that figure at $2 million of turnover. The government, however, in schedule 2 adopts the Labor Party's definition of what a small business is. Currently, businesses have to determine each quarter the amount of input tax credits related to purchases for personal, not business, use, thus reducing the amount of input tax credits that they can use to offset their GST payable.
This is similar to the annual requirement for businesses to determine the amount of business expense related to personal use which cannot therefore be used to reduce business tax liabilities. These amendments require only small businesses with an annual turnover of $2 million or less to determine the amount of input tax credits related personal use on an annual basis. So, unlike the first measure in this bill, this measure will apply to small businesses with a turnover of up to $2 million year. The government seems to be confused about what a small business actually is. Labor welcomes the government's adoption in this schedule of the Labor Party's definition of what a small business is and notes that that is completely consistent with Labor's simple BAS policy.
Schedule 3 of the bill also defines a small business as an entity with a turnover of $2 million or less. So we have two to one in this bill for the $2 million turnover definition. Currently, businesses with an annual turnover of $2 million or less can elect to pay their GST through quarterly instalments with an annual reconciliation. However, these businesses are required to make a new election each financial year for this option. In order to reduce compliance costs, a business that wishes to continue to pay GST by instalments will no longer be required to make a new election every year. The entity's initial election will continue to apply while ever the entity continues to satisfy the eligibility requirements. 
While any relief for the high compliance costs faced by small businesses due to the bungled implementation of the new tax system is welcome, this bill represents poor policy design and some obvious changes that should have been part of the system from day one. The Howard government will be remembered as the Liberal government that completely failed what is meant to be its core constituency: small business. Only a Latham Labor government will provide real and tangible relief to small businesses, significantly cutting GST red tape, providing greater protection under the Trade Practices Act and ensuring that small businesses have access to a healthy and educated work force. These are the important issues for small business, and these are the issues that the Howard government cannot and will not deal with—due to their lack of interest in the real needs of small business and their complete lack of policy.
The Labor Party will not oppose this measure. It will pass and will take effect from this year. But, when we are returned to government, we will replace it with our simpler BAS model. I think most small businesses will applaud that, and a great many more small businesses will benefit from that than will benefit from this inadequate measure.",REPS,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SMALL BUSINESS MEASURES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Washer, Dr Mal, MP",LP,2004-08-03,"—I thank the member for Kingston for his bipartisan support on the Indirect Tax Legislation Amendment (Small Business Measures) Bill 2004. The small business sector plays a vital role in the economic fortunes of Australia. Small businesses employ well over three million people, accounting for almost half of private sector non-agricultural employment. About 30 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product is estimated to be generated by the small business sector. Without a doubt, small business is a major contributing factor to Australia's resilient economy. Small business is one of the keys to the success of the Australian economy over the last few years—and this is quite remarkable when we consider the Asian meltdown and the difficulties being experienced by other economies. The strength and adaptability of small business, with ordinary men and women putting in a lot of hard work to build their businesses and provide a good standard of living for themselves and their families, and importantly provide employment for other Australians, are magnificent.
The coalition government is committed to cutting red tape for small business operators so that these hardworking individuals can spend more time doing what they do best and less time doing paperwork. The Indirect Tax Legislation Amendment (Small Business Measures) Bill 2004 contains three measures aimed at significantly reducing GST compliance costs for small businesses and providing greater flexibility to taxpayers in managing their affairs. The first of the initiatives provides small businesses and non-profit bodies that are voluntarily registered for the GST the option to report and pay GST on an annual basis rather than reporting on a quarterly or monthly basis, as is the case at the moment. Businesses that take up this option will be able to prepare and lodge an annual GST return at the same time as they prepare their annual income tax return. Businesses will make a single payment of any GST at the time they lodge their returns with the Commissioner of Taxation. Of course, small businesses with an annual turnover of less than $50,000 and non-profit organisations with a turnover of less than $100,000 do not have to register for GST. But, for various reasons, many of them choose to do so.
Typically, a small business with an annual turnover of less than $50,000 is a one-man band—or, quite probably, a one-woman band, as many of these businesses are launched by women who are keen to work in an environment that they can control and adapt to meet the needs of their families. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, about 800,000 small businesses are operated from home, including bed and breakfasts, house and lawn management services and pet care services. So it makes a lot of sense for these one-person entities and home based operations to be able to lodge their GST returns annually. And, of course, it also lifts the red-tape burden for about 30,000 non-profit organisations that currently have to lodge a business activity statement either monthly or quarterly. 
The second measure contained in this bill provides businesses that have an annual turnover of $2 million or less with the option to undertake annual apportionment of input tax credits for acquisitions used partly for non-business purposes. Those businesses will disregard for most acquisitions and importations their non-business use in determining the amount of input tax credit they can claim in their monthly or quarterly GST return. Businesses will make a single end-of-year adjustment to take account of the non-business use of the acquisitions or importation at the time of completing their income tax returns. This will allow further cost savings by allowing their GST and income tax information to be determined simultaneously.
The third measure further reduces compliance costs for small business by simplifying the election rules relating to the option to pay GST by instalments and to lodge an annual GST return. An eligible business will no longer be required to make and lodge an annual election with the Commissioner of Taxation. Once a valid election has been made, it will remain in force until the business operator chooses to leave the instalment system or it is no longer eligible to apply the option.
My family are small business owners so I know at first hand how red tape can be vexatious to the spirit. Of course we know that GST compliance and keeping good books are a necessity when you are a small business operator, but the less red tape there is, the better. When you are running a small, streamlined operation you need to concentrate on your business rather than on spending time on unnecessary paperwork. All three of the measures contained in this bill are designed to do just that: to cut the red tape and compliance costs for small business operators so that one of their most valuable assets, their time, is not taken up with unnecessary paperwork but is used for the benefit of their businesses. I commend this bill to the House.",REPS,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SMALL BUSINESS MEASURES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"McMullan, Bob, MP",ALP,2004-08-03,"—The Indirect Tax Legislation Amendment (Small Business Measures) Bill 2004 is another example that shows the Howard government has run out of ideas for solving the nation's problems. It is also another example that shows that for eight years the Howard government has said, `We're the friend of small business,' but, when the crunch comes, it does not do the big things that are important for small business. It is more stark in another matter that is going to come before the House soon where, when the government has to choose between helping small business and helping big business, it goes down the path of helping big business every time. On this occasion the government knows that there is a much more substantial proposition than this available but it will not accept it for one reason: the Labor Party put it forward first. So it has had to duck, dive and weave and try to find an alternative to solving this red-tape crisis it has created with the business activity statement.
This is an inadequate, minimalist proposition that will not go to the core of the problem or help enough people, and it actually has significant risks within it. It is an example of a tired and lazy government that, after more than eight years, has adopted a minimalist approach to assist one of its claimed core supporter groups. Who now remembers the 1996 promise to cut red tape in half? You can get a laugh at any small business meeting in Australia by asking, `Has your red-tape burden been halved since 1996?' If you actually tried to assert that it were so, you would probably be stoned—or perhaps you would have to be stoned to say it. But it was certainly a very inappropriate promise. It was obviously a non-core promise. The minister for small business was right to say in the Financial Review the other day that the failure to keep that unrealistic promise has damaged the government's credibility in the small business sector. 
We here in the opposition share the small business community's disappointment. Firstly, they have made long, well-researched representations for reform to help them in the area of the Trade Practices Act, and the government will do only the bare minimum. And then they have a reasonable expectation that the government will take up a proposition that will cut the red-tape burden of dealing with the business activity statement for many of them and that, in the process, will not have the potential adverse financial and management cash-flow problems that this ill-considered proposition can engender.
The primary proposition in the bill is to allow businesses and non-profit organisations that voluntarily register for the GST the option to report and pay their GST on an annual basis. The benefit is the cost to the budget, which in the first year is quite substantial, by the deferral of the tax collection. Then there is an ongoing significant but smaller cost to the revenue. It only applies to small businesses with a turnover of $50,000 year—not that they are not people who need assistance. It covers the very smallest businesses who should be assisted, and I will outline later a more substantial measure that will assist not just them but others. But these, for the most part, are not the businesses where the managers spend hours each month completing BAS forms. At this micro end, they do need assistance—it is not an unreasonable proposition that they should be assisted—it is just that this is the wrong way to do it. A lot of people get left out and it carries real dangers for small business in this approach. There is a greater relative impact on cash flow from having to find an annual amount to pay, because that is the implication of this measure. People with a turnover of less than $50,000 and very small quarterly payments will have to find a one-off annual payment.
We did not agree with the GST, and we still wish it had not been introduced, but it is here and it operates. One of the upsides of it is that it has led to financial and management discipline from having to meet the quarterly BAS payments—the cash-flow benefit of paying quarterly and the discipline in the management and financial systems to meet the requirements of the legislation. So we find that businesses are likely to be subject to meeting larger lump sums for their annual BAS payment instead of smaller quarterly amounts, with a cash-flow implication. I understand that the best run businesses will be putting the money aside regularly so that, annually, they will have four times as much set aside as those who have to meet quarterly payments. So, when you take away the discipline and rigour of the quarterly payments and create the cash-flow problem of having to meet the payment annually, this measure is not only inadequate in its positive sense, it has serious risks in the negative.
It is amazing when you compare the government's pathetic little offering, this minor easing of the compliance burden, to the major show in town—that is, the opposition's alternative simplified business activity statement option. Our option will allow businesses with a turnover of up to $2 million per year—which is double the number of businesses that would benefit under the government's measure—the option of using a simple ratio method to calculate their GST on a quarterly basis. Every business with a turnover of up to $2 million per year which chooses this option—and if they do not wish to change, they do not have to do anything—can have their regular BAS payment procedure radically simplified, saving hours of small business time, cutting through acres of red tape and yet, in the same process, not experiencing the dangers that are inherent in this proposal. 
Our option allows more than twice as many businesses to be covered. They have the option to complete just two boxes on their BAS each quarter and avoid the potential risks and pressures on their cash flow of an annual payment regime. Under the simplified BAS option that the Labor Party has put forward, there will be no requirement for an annual reconciliation. This will be a real and effective reduction in the compliance load on the tight management resources of small businesses.
Labor will not be opposing the amendments in this bill. My colleague the member for Kingston outlined the case for that quite well. This is a small benefit, and we think we can get in and fix it after the next election before the risks become too obvious. But I recommit the Labor opposition—and an incoming Labor government—to make the more effective changes that we need after the election. We have taken serious note of the concerns of small businesses, and we will act to reduce their compliance load through this measure—as we will act substantially to give them fair competition rules by amending the Trade Practices Act in a manner which the government will not do.
It is really hard to understand why the government have been so slow to come up with this measure. Haven't they been listening to the cries of small business? If they did not want to accept our proposition because they do not want to acknowledge its validity—and small business will have to wait for a change of government to see that measure come in—why did they take so long to come up with this small measure? It is largely unremarkable, except for the fact it has been released on the eve of the election to give the government a fig leaf to cover their embarrassment. I have to say on this occasion that it is a very small fig leaf for a rather large embarrassment and it probably will not do the trick.
The government have cobbled together this minor measure in an attempt to rescue themselves from the embarrassment of Labor being the only party to have a proposition to reduce the red tape compliance burden on small business caused by the BAS. Surveys continue to show that the business activity statement is the major red tape compliance burden on small business. Small businesses know who imposed it on them and they know how shonky the government's promises are following the promise the government made in 1996 of a 50 per cent reduction in red tape.
An incoming Latham Labor government has got a program in place ready to act to support small business. We will reduce red tape and compliance costs—and we will have more to say about that—we will make the changes to the Trade Practices Act needed to protect small businesses from unfair competition, we will create a small business advocate to give a real voice in government for small businesses, we will introduce a late payments bill to give them some leverage over their slow paying debtors, and we will meet their demands for a skilled work force from our `earn or learn' program, our funding of TAFE and other measures to do with mature age employment. 
For the incoming Latham Labor government, these commitments are simply the beginning. We are determined to implement the next round of reforms to build a fairer and improved competitive environment for small business. In the interim, we will allow these small and inadequate measures to pass because they are small benefits for those businesses which are affected. It is a great pity that we cannot get more substantial and more effective reform. It is another case of too little too late. It is also a case of better than nothing so we will allow them to pass. Small business will have to wait for a change of government after the election to see real reform.",REPS,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SMALL BUSINESS MEASURES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2004-08-03,"—The Indirect Tax Legislation Amendment (Small Business Measures) Bill 2004 allows businesses and non-profit bodies that voluntarily register for the GST the option to report and pay their GST on an annual basis rather than a quarterly basis. It also allows for annual apportionment of creditable purpose for input tax credits, and it does not require businesses to make annual elections to pay their GST in quarterly instalments. So in respect of input tax credits, it means that the apportionment exercise can take place once a year, rather than once a quarter, and once a small business elects to pay GST instalments on a quarterly basis it does not need to keep doing it. This is a small, positive step for small business in terms of the compliance nightmare of the GST.
Members would recall that, at the time of the introduction of the GST in 2000, the Treasurer boasted that the GST and other tax changes would be in effect a `streamlined new tax system for a new century'. He said that compliance would be much easier and that the burden of red tape would be greatly eased on small business. The sad reality is that nothing could be further from the truth. We know that these matters are of serious concern to small businesses because they tell us directly, but they also conduct surveys and those surveys are very revealing.
When the Minister for Small Business and Tourism comes into the parliament, he wants to talk about industrial relations. I well recall that he produced a report of Australian Business Ltd just before parliament rose in the last session and said, `Here it is. It shows that small business is concerned with industrial relations matters.' He was being very economical with the truth. I had also received and read a copy of the same survey that morning, and what the Minister for Small Business and Tourism neglected to mention was that the top priorities, the major concerns, for business in Australia—certainly the constituent members of Australian Business—were taxation and regulation, Nos 1 and 2. In fact, industrial relations ranked behind those.
But the government takes very little notice of the pleas from the small business community to reduce the compliance burden. The government indicated even before it was elected in 1996 that it would be very methodical and committed to reducing the red tape burden on small business. The then Leader of the Opposition, now Prime Minister, said on 31 January 1996:
... I will be establishing a small business deregulation taskforce. That taskforce will have a specific brief from me as Prime Minister, to report within six months of the new Government taking office. Its main responsibility will be to advise on ways in which the regulatory and paper burden on small business can be reduced by up to 50%.
That was from the Prime Minister before the 1996 election. About a year later, on 24 March 1997, the Prime Minister, in a ministerial statement in the parliament, conceded: 
The volume of tax legislation has become a tidal wave which threatens to overwhelm small business.
On the same day, in the same statement, he said:
During the election campaign we committed ourselves to the goal of reducing the burden of paperwork and red tape on small business by 50 per cent in our first term. I am confident that our response to the Bell report, along with other initiatives that we have already taken, will make a substantial contribution to that objective by the end of our first term.
We were then confronted with another statement by the Prime Minister very much towards the end of that first term. He was asked by Alan Jones on 14 August 1998:
Will the number of pages in the Tax Act be reduced by the introduction of a GST?
The Prime Minister responded:
Yes it will because some of the anti avoidance measures which take up a lot of pages are going to disappear. I don't know by how many pages but it will be some reduction I understand.
If we fast forward to 22 September 1999, we have the Treasurer on the same radio program. Of the tax act, Alan Jones said to the Treasurer:
It's unreadable and unintelligible, there's a massive GST program that's going to overtake us ...
And the Treasurer said:
Well I think that's right. And that's why we've got to get the number of pages of the Tax Act down. That's what we're working on right at this moment.
So on 22 September 1999—five years ago—the Treasurer said that they were working hard on reducing the number of pages in the tax act, as part of an overall plan to reduce the tax compliance burden on small business. Let us hear from Gary Banks, the Chairman of the Productivity Commission. On 22 December last year, he said:
The Income Tax Assessment Act—often taken as a regulatory `barometer'—has grown particularly rapidly since its inception. At nearly 7,000 pages, the ITAA—
the tax act—
is now nearly 60 times longer than the paltry 120 pages that did the job when it was first introduced in 1936.
That is the fact of the matter. I will now refer to an interview of 15 January 2004 on the ABC radio program Life Matters. Julie McCrossin had appearing on that program Michael Inglis, a Sydney based tax barrister. They started talking about the size of the income tax act—the act that the Prime Minister said would reduce in size as a result of the GST. Mr Inglis said:
But I can't resist. When I spoke to you last time, April of last year, Income Tax Act, 8,500 pages. Do you know what it is currently?
Julie McCrossin said:
I want you to tell me—
Of course she did. Mr Inglis said:
We did a great service last year—
I think this is a bit tongue in cheek—
we really improved things.
I think it is very tongue in cheek. He went on to say:
Currently, in fact it's a few months old, 10,500 pages for your income tax legislation. Add in GST, FBT, super, 13,500 pages, 9.5 million words.
That is the streamlined new tax system for a new century. That is the reduced income tax act and the reduced compliance burden that the Prime Minister promised.
When the Prime Minister came to office, the income tax act was 3,000 pages, and now we have a barrister reporting—he must not have much else to do with his time—that it has grown to 10,500 pages. And then we need to add the GST, which was supposed to streamline the tax system, FBT and super—and you get 13,500 pages, or 9.5 million words. That does not include the private binding rulings that have had to be issued to clarify this so-called streamlined new tax system for a new century. If it is so simple, why was it necessary in the first year of operation of the GST for 80,000-plus private binding rulings to be issued? 
In a question on notice, Labor asked the Treasurer how many private bindings have been issued since then, and the Treasurer has been strangely silent. We do not have an answer. The reason we do not have an answer is that the answer would be acutely embarrassing. This so-called streamlined new tax system for a new century has resulted in a proliferation of compliance burden and a massively complicated tax. The legislation before us today is but a small step in the direction that the government said in 2000 that it was headed—that is, to simplify the tax.
With the GST, approximately $6 needs to be collected in order for $1 to flow into consolidated revenue. The remaining $5 is then refunded through the value-adding chain as input tax credits. The government says this is an efficient, streamlined new tax system for a new century, where the Taxation Office has to collect $6 gross to get $1 net! Is it any wonder that Australian Business Ltd and other business organisations identify the regulatory burden, the red tape burden, the tax compliance burden as one of the major issues retarding small business growth in Australia today?
Labor has had a superior measure before this parliament for several years now. It is called the ratio method. The ratio method is elegant in its simplicity. It is based on the historical performance of a small business. It is effectively a ratio between the GST and input tax credits claimed based on the actual history of that small business. Any eligible small business seeking to avail itself of the ratio method can ask the tax office to be issued with a ratio. For the purposes of illustration, let us assume that the ratio is 5.5 per cent, because ordinarily it will be somewhere between zero and 10 per cent once you net away the input tax credits that that business has typically claimed. Once the tax office issues that ratio, the small business need only multiply GST sales by that ratio—in this case, 5.5 per cent; a simple calculation—and remit that amount to the tax office. You could not get a simpler method of assessment, and no reconciliation is required. This is a measure that is superior to the one that is being debated here in the parliament, and yet the government has refused to contemplate it. It has criticised it and at the same time the small business community has welcomed it as a very substantial breakthrough in the battle to reduce the GST compliance burden on the small business sector.
Some of the advantages over the proposed legislation before us are that the number of businesses eligible for Labor's simplified GST payment system would be much larger, because eligible businesses would be those with a turnover of up to $2 million, whereas the measure before us in the parliament today will only benefit businesses with a turnover of up to $50,000 and non-profit businesses with a turnover of up to $100,000. Labor's plan covers a much larger number of businesses and, moreover, there is no need for businesses to complete a full BAS form at the end of the year. It is elegant in its simplicity, and Labor remains mystified, as does the small business community, as to why the government will not pick up this measure, which has been detailed in a private member's bill and introduced into this parliament.
Perhaps one of the reasons the government has not done this is that the Minister for Small Business and Tourism is beside himself with indifference. He pretty well admitted that in an interview with the Australian Financial Review on 22 June this year. The newspaper said that he admits he is unsure whether small business would welcome his return to the portfolio after the election. He is quoted as saying, `You would need to ask them.' The article goes on to say that many small businesses: 
... are frustrated by what they see as Hockey's failure to address theirperennial concerns about red tape,training and ballooning compliancecosts, despite hiscreation of theSmall Business Council last year.
The reason is that the minister is bored with his portfolio. He is not interested in small business. He hails from the big end of town, a point that the small business community has made to me. He even went on to insult them by saying:
Small business hasn't got the same corporate governance as larger businesses. Therefore poor corporate governance practices in small businesses are one of the biggest hurdles to transferability.
The article continued:
Warming to the theme, he declares that if he were not a politician, he would be a property developer. “I've got real estate in the blood.”
Perhaps that is what he should do—retire from parliament at this election and go and be a property developer.
I think that answers the question that I asked as to why the government has not been interested in reducing the compliance burden on small business. It has not responded to the very priorities that small business has identified. Those priorities are: the GST compliance burden, the broader tax compliance burden, the overall regulatory burden and, increasingly, a more and more acute skills shortage in Australia. The government has not responded to the skills shortage. In its $52 billion pre-election budget spending splurge it was not able to find one extra dollar for vocational education and training in Australia—what a disgrace.
Such is the commitment of this government to taking vulnerable working Australians down the low road to low skills and low wages that it is consigning vulnerable working Australians to a race to the bottom, competing on wage costs against the countries of East Asia—China, most particularly. This is a race we should never have entered. It is a race we should never want to win. In the face of small business and larger businesses in this country screaming out for a strategy to ease the skills shortage crisis, the government found not one extra dollar for skills development in the budget. Indeed, it has legislation in this parliament that would remove from awards any obligation whatsoever on the part of employers to train their work force, so indifferent is this government to the real needs of the small business community in this country.
If this legislation is a minor step in the right direction in terms of ever so moderately easing the compliance burden on small business, another decision that it has taken is a large step in the opposite direction—and I refer to the superannuation choice legislation that the government managed to get past the Senate in the last sitting. When the small business community becomes aware of the massive compliance burden associated with it having to advise all its staff that they have a choice in superannuation and that it needs to keep records of the different superannuation contributions to different funds, small business will be horrified and will wonder how on earth this government could ever sustain the phoney claim that it is the party of small business.
This government takes small business for granted. It favours larger businesses at the expense of small business. It has a small business minister who hails from the big end of town and wants to mix with the big end of town and who insults the small business community in this country—so much for the government's streamlined new tax system for a new century. The small business community needs a Latham Labor government because it is only a Latham Labor government that is genuinely committed to reducing the compliance burden on small business through the ratio method and a range of other methods and measures that we have already articulated in support of the small business community in our country.

"King, Peter, MP",LP,2004-08-03,"—I rise tonight to speak to the Indirect Tax Legislation Amendment (Small Business Measures) Bill 2004. It was a small business man, a man who could speak well in politics and understood the challenges facing a large business, who gave perhaps one of the best speeches in parliamentary history on a topic which is not unrelated to the one we are debating today. Let me quote from Edmund Burke's eulogy of what Charles James Fox had to say in his attack upon the tyranny of the East India Company back in 1783. It is relevant even today. He said:
He well knows what snares are spread about his path, from personal animosity and possibly from popular delusion. But he has put to hazard his ease, his security, his interest, his power, even his popularity. He is traduced and abused for his supposed motives. He will remember that obloquy is a necessary ingredient in the composition of all true glory; he will remember that calumny and abuse are essential parts of triumph. He may live long; he may do much. But here is the summit. He can never exceed what he has done this day.
It is a fitting tribute to the task facing small business men and women in this country today that, through the ages, it has been understood by politicians of all hues that courage, hard work and initiative are the product of simply spending a lot of time at the workplace and that ideas and self belief are the product of an outstanding small business or, as we sometimes also say today, medium sized business in this country and anywhere else in a productive, competitive economy.
Before I come to the details of the bill before the House, I want to say something briefly about some initiatives that I have taken in my own electorate to promote the issues of small business, which are often ignored, because small business, to be frank, is not well organised as a lobby group. There are a number of different associations and groups, and it is hard for small business men and women to give up the time necessary to expound and understand the issues at stake in the legislation and the policies that are before the state and federal parliaments that affect their businesses and, indeed, their way of life. I put together, on my election in 2001, a small business forum called the Wentworth Small Business Forum. I gave a commitment to that in the election campaign, and I went about setting it up shortly after I was elected.
We have held several meetings, and the issues that have arisen from that small business forum have been taken up by governments at local, state and federal levels. The issues have included matters concerning superannuation and tourism, including the problems that small businesses face with employing backpackers and itinerants. Also, the issues have included especially the problem of red tape; of course, industrial relations; and, finally, and more recently, the free trade agreement. That issue was discussed at the most recent forum I held, when Mark Vaile, the Minister for Trade, was our special guest. Many small business men and women from across the eastern suburbs of Sydney attended to hear the interesting address by Mark Vaile. On a previous occasion we had the good fortune to have Mr Hockey, the Minister for Small Business and Tourism, attend and say a few words about the issue of superannuation and red tape. Whether or not that forum and the comments made by small business men and women on that day had any impact on the minister, I do not know. But I can say this: the legislation before the House does take up some of the concerns of the small business men and women in my electorate. 
The bill before the House does address in particular one of the problems facing small business today—that is, the compliance burden. The Treasurer said in the budget statement that he was announcing measures that would allow small businesses which are below the registration threshold and voluntarily registered for GST to report and pay GST annually instead of quarterly.
He also said that these measures would benefit some 740,000 small businesses and 30,000 non-profit organisations. It did require the approval of the states and that, indeed, has taken some time. I am pleased to say that that has been obtained. In addition, small businesses with an annual turnover of some $2 million or less were to be allowed to apportion their private and business use of assets such a motor vehicles on an annual basis rather than on a quarterly or monthly basis. Finally, the Treasurer announced that businesses that elected to pay their GST through quarterly instalments would not be required to re-elect in the following years. It might be said that this is small beer in the overall scheme of things, but the truth is that a start has to be made. An attempt has to be made to get rid of the red tape that is burdening our men and women in small business across the country. I am pleased to say that the minister has heard the plea of small business right across the land, including in my Wentworth small business advisory forum, as I have just mentioned.
These concerns are not isolated. For some years now there have been concerns expressed and indeed articulated in a more comprehensive and understandable fashion in a number of detailed reports. I will mention a couple of them that would seem to me to be of some importance and that highlight the significance of the issue before the House. The 2001 report named Businesses' views on red tape: administrative and regulatory burdens on small and medium sized enterprises, a joint report by the OECD and the ACCI, estimated that tax, employment and environmental regulations imposed more than $17 billion in compliance costs on small and medium sized businesses in Australia in 1998. That was six years ago. Just imagine exponentially the cost today. Of these costs, employment and tax regulations accounted for 76 per cent of the total. In all at that date, there was a $33,000 per annum cost of compliance.
It is easy to speak in round figures like a bean counter, but it is more difficult to imagine the actual time and effort put in by small business men and women that represent those figures. The Small Business Deregulation Task Force also reported a couple of years before that that, on average, small business spent some 16 hours per week on administration and compliance activities. Of these, government paperwork and compliance was around four hours per week. The other major problem in that regard, also requiring a similar enterprise, was the processing of approvals function as well as duplication, lost opportunity and the paperwork burden.
It was not just the OECD and the ACCI which identified this problem, nor the small business task force that I have mentioned. In a later report in 2003 entitled From red tape to smart tape: administrative simplification, it was noted that the position had not improved. The matter had been clearly stated and yet it had not been dealt with by government. I suppose that the government was more concerned with ensuring that the taxation laws, the employment laws and the environmental laws and so on were so clearly stipulated and so fulsomely expressed that no-one could escape and no-one would be able to complain that they could not understand their obligations. This is the great problem of all law-makers. The more that one specifies the problem, in a sense, the greater one makes the burden for those upon whom the legislation rests and who will be required to comply with its terms. Yet that is the very issue being faced by this legislation today. The states and the Commonwealth wanted to ensure that the GST regime, a taxation regime which is revolutionary in a sense, would be properly, fully, duly, fairly and comprehensively administered. But that problem itself gave rise to the very problem which the House is addressing tonight. 
The ACCI, in a document known as the Charter of Mutual Regulatory Responsibility—it is a bit of a mouthful and I am having some difficulty coming to terms with it—set out their statement of a new regulatory system in Australia that would relieve the burden on small business. It proposed the appointment of a small business advocate to act on behalf of small business within government so as to bring about a change in the burden on small business. But I want to finish this consideration of the relevant reports by going to the Council of Small Business Organisations in Australia. Really, in a sense, their report says it all. It estimated that the compliance burden on small business has been at least 35 per cent greater in more recent years than on larger businesses over the last four to five years. This is what they had to say about this point. This is a July 2004 report, so we are almost up to date. They said:
Opening a bank account, moving a telephone number, registering a business name, applying for innumerable licences, all of these take time and cost money and divert business owners from developing their businesses and serving their customers ... Red tape impacts disproportionately on small businesses because they do not have the money or staff to devote solely to compliance tasks. There is a physical limit to how much compliance a small business can do and stay afloat.
Isn't that the problem we face! We have supine bureaucrats, people who think that the only way to solve a problem is to make another law, impose another regulation and have another rule that will cover the problem instead of administering the matter fairly and properly in accordance with a sensible administrative approach. That seems to be the way that modern bureaucracy tends to solve the problems of government. But what bureaucrats forget and what law-makers overlook is that this imposes a burden on small businesses which has become completely and utterly unacceptable.
This legislation before the House is a start. It is a small start. There are some improvements to the regulatory framework which, with respect, I wholeheartedly endorse and approve. Let us hope that it is the start of something bigger. Let us show that we trust small business men and women to go about their businesses and hope that the hard work, initiative and courage which are required to become a successful small business man or woman are encouraged by this parliament and promoted by the law-makers in every way possible. I support the legislation.",REPS,<title>INDIRECT TAX LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SMALL BUSINESS MEASURES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Brough, Mal, MP",LP,2004-08-03,"—I thank the participants in tonight's debate on the Indirect Tax Legislation Amendment (Small Business Measures) Bill 2004. As the member for Wentworth said, small business personnel and people who enter into such ventures or enterprises do require courage and initiative. Without those two qualities, those enterprises would not exist. Quite frankly, without personnel with a little courage or initiative, this country would be a far weaker place. 
This bill gives effect to three measures that will assist the small business community which were announced in the 2004-05 budget and is part of a package of measures aimed at reducing small business compliance costs as outlined in the Prime Minister's Committed to Small Business package, which was announced on 6 July 2004. The first measure in the bill provides voluntary GST registered entities the option of reporting and paying their GST on an annual basis. The second measure enables eligible small businesses to undertake annual apportionment of input tax credits for acquisitions that are used partly for non-business purposes rather than do that each time they prepare their business activity statement. This will go a long way towards addressing some of the concerns that small business people have raised from time to time with people such as the Minister for Small Business and Tourism and the member for Wentworth amongst others.
The third measure simplifies the current GST instalment election rules. These measures reflect the government's commitment to reduce GST compliance costs for small business and not-for-profit organisations by providing them with greater flexibility in discharging their GST payment and reporting obligations. The member for Rankin made play of the opposition's record and what they propose to do, in their words, to `assist' the small businesses of this country. I remind the member for Rankin that, if he really wanted to assist small business in any way, shape or form, he as part of the Labor Party could: firstly, pass the unfair dismissal laws, which have now been through 40 times and been knocked back; secondly, remove their support of secondary boycott legislation; thirdly, remove the threat of a payroll tax at a federal level, which in my knowledge would be the first time that one has ever applied and which is a dampener on employment; fourthly, remove their proposition to abolish junior wage rates, which will also be a great disincentive for employers to put on young people; and, fifthly, cease their opposition to AWAs, which allow workers to have more freedom to negotiate with employers in the work force to the betterment of the individual, the business and the wider economy. Tonight, the member for Rankin once again opposed choice in superannuation for employees, which I find to be an extraordinary comment for him to be making. It is so out of touch with the needs of average Australians.
I will quickly contrast what we are offering to small business here—that is, certainty, a reduction in red tape and also an appreciation that, when they use goods that could be used for both business and private use, this could be proportioned annually—with Labor's proposals, which are open to abuse and revenue leakage. That has big ramifications further down the track when the ATO attempts to regain what is rightfully part of the tax take. Under Labor, there would be no reconciliation of estimates and GST liabilities, thus the option would be open to abuse by businesses that know they will pay less tax under this option that the ALP is promoting.
Nothing upsets the genuine Australian taxpayer more than knowing that the business or individual down the road is doing the wrong thing. The Labor Party's proposal would do more to undermine the confidence that the small business community have in the fact that they are competing on an equal basis with their neighbour. Under the ALP's proposal, businesses would only have to keep records to justify their turnover. If audited, they would not have to justify their input tax credit claims or details of their sales. This again would increase the possibility of abuse, which is not something that this side of the House accepts as being good policy. Businesses previously in a refund situation would be allowed to apply previous ratios even though they may no longer be in a refund situation. This is ludicrous, and I am sure it is something that, in government, the opposition would have to overturn—and to what ramifications for small business? Businesses may also nominate an industry that is known to have a more favourable ratio. 
All of these things undermine people's trust and faith in a just taxation system. What the government has proposed here and what I am sure will pass both in here and in the Senate are measures which will simplify the taxation system and will ensure that small business people have more time to spend on their businesses, generating profits and jobs, which is good for Australia. The Howard government and Minister Hockey in particular, who represents small business very ably, very professionally and with great dedication, will ensure that the interests of small business are always uppermost in the minds of the coalition government. I commend the bill to the House.
Question agreed to.

"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2004-08-03,"—I seek leave to move the second reading amendment being circulated in my name. The government has delayed the introduction of the Schools Assistance (Learning Together-Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Bill 2004 into this parliament, unfortunately leaving schools in a very uncertain funding position. Leaving debate on this bill until August, just four months before the end of the school year, means that schools, principals, students, teachers and parents are all in an uncertain and precarious position. Of course, we on this side of the House do know how schools work. We know that this is about the time when schools are making their decisions for 2005—students are choosing their subjects; principals are making decisions about staff—and they have to know what their funding will be for next year in order to make those decisions. Clearly the government really does not care about the havoc that funding uncertainty can cause for schools. It is blatantly irresponsible of the government to introduce this bill so late in the year. The delay is yet another case of this government playing politics with children's education. 
By contrast, Labor have outlined the principles on which schools should be funded, and these are in stark contrast to the government's unfair funding system. Labor stand by our commitment to needs based funding for all schools. We will increase funding to government schools and redistribute funding away from high-fee non-government schools to more needy Catholic and lower fee independent schools. The non-government sector as a whole will not lose any funding. We will fight the government's unfair funding system at the coming election. For me, this will be a very important fight—a critical fight—to get fairness back into schools funding. It is a fight that we certainly will not resile from. But Labor's determination to change the government's divisive funding system will not put at risk funding certainty for our schools now.
As I said, the government should be condemned for holding back on this bill until so late in the year. As you may know, Mr Deputy Speaker, the funding contained in this bill was actually announced back in March. It has taken months for the parliament to see the bill and even longer for it to come on for debate. Labor will allow this bill to pass for one reason only—that is, to give schools and parents the certainty that they need for next year. Unlike the government, we will not play politics with children's education. But, on winning the election, Labor will introduce fairer, needs based funding legislation that will begin in 2006, and our first budget will contain additional funding for government schools.
Labor's education policy will have many elements, and will include establishing a national schools resource standard to make sure that all schools in Australia, whether they are government, Catholic or independent, have the resources to deliver a high standard of education. We want to fund all schools on the basis of need. We have negotiated a national schools agreement with state and territory governments and we will negotiate agreements with other non-government school authorities to deliver needs based funding. For Labor, at both a national and a state and territory level, significantly increasing the funding for government schools will be one of the priorities that this nation can be proud of. Ensuring a basic level of funding for all non-government schools and guaranteeing the overall funding level for the non-government sector—these are commitments that Labor have made. But we do intend to redistribute funding away from high-fee, wealthy schools to lower fee, needy Catholic and independent schools.
We want to provide incentives to make sure that the best teachers, the most experienced teachers, and school leaders are available to assist schools with concentrations of students with special needs. We have announced that we intend to pay the TAFE fees for secondary school students. We will employ 1,080 training mentors to make sure that young people are helped to stay on at school or to move into full-time jobs or further training. We will provide extra resources to improve school discipline. We will have a national action plan to get more male teachers into schools, and we will recruit more fathers and other men—whether they are grandads, uncles or other leaders in our community—to serve as role models in our schools. We have announced a Bright Futures program to support secondary school students from disadvantaged backgrounds to progress to university or TAFE.
The bill that we are debating here tonight will operate for only one year, 2005, if Labor win the upcoming election. We are supporting funding for 2005 as a transition year prior to the adoption of Labor's fairer, needs based funding policy. Labor do not support the government's unfair and divisive schools funding system, which has seen the largest funding increases go to the wealthiest schools in this country. Take the King's School in Parramatta in Sydney, for example. They received a 165 per cent increase in funding between 2001 and 2004 from this Howard government. By contrast, a couple of schools just around the corner from the King's School in Parramatta, Fairvale High School and Trinity Catholic College, have had to make do with a 20 per cent and a 25 per cent adjustment respectively—barely enough to cover annual increases. Trinity Catholic College does not have anything like the facilities of King's. It is Trinity Catholic College and Fairvale High—which certainly does not have the facilities of King's—that are in desperate need of more resources. Labor believe—so differently from the Howard government—that every Australian child is entitled to a great standard of education. That means for us that every child at every school will get a basic level of funding for their education. But we believe that priority in funding above that basic level must be given to schools on the basis of educational and financial need. 
I do not know how many people recognise that this is what has happened under the Howard government but I hope that every member of this parliament will stop for a moment and think about the figures that I am about to put on the parliamentary record. Under this bill, the Commonwealth government is providing more recurrent funding to the 12 per cent of students in non-systemic independent schools—$7.6 billion—than to the 2.25 million students, or 69 per cent of students, who are in government schools: $7.6 billion will go to the 12 per cent of students in non-systemic independent schools; $7.2 billion will go to 2.25 million students in government schools. This is the first time that this has ever happened in Australia's history. This is despite the fact that many independent schools operate at resource standards that are much higher than those on average in government schools.
The vast bulk of the funding contained in this bill is only that which is required of the Commonwealth government to meet the existing costs of education. That is in fact just indexation for all schools. The bill provides $31.3 billion in funding for government and non-government schools. That represents an increase of $8 billion over the current four-year period. But of this increase—get this—only $405 million is new money. The bulk of the increase results from indexation and supplementation.
Of the $405 million, government schools will receive only $4 million for students with disabilities in government schools. Government schools will get five per cent of the new money, or 0.1 per cent of the $31.3 billion. That is how much extra on top of indexation is going to our government schools. In return for this, our government schools are now going to be required to meet new funding and accountability conditions for starting ages, curriculum testing, reporting to parents, staffing, and of course flagpoles. The Howard's government's policies are nothing short of outrageously unfair. They must be reformed so that every Australian child—every single Australian child—gets a great education.
The government like to claim that all non-government schools are now in their SES funding scheme. Let us have a look at the facts. The minister's own department has testified that only half of non-government schools are actually being funded according to the government's own SES funding policies. Let us look at the details. Fifty per cent of non-government schools are funded on the basis of their SES score, nine per cent are funding maintained at year 2000 levels, 37 per cent are funding maintained at year 2004 levels and four per cent are funding guaranteed. 
The government has established a funding system in which four schools with the same SES score receive four different levels of funding. It is also the case that the majority of Catholic schools—60 per cent, in fact—do not have funding certainty after 2009 because they are funding maintained. For the future of all Australian children, a more sustainable and coherent funding system is needed: a fair system that actually delivers increased funding to government and needy non-government schools.
The minister for education has been heard to say—just last week, in fact—that school resources do not matter. He said on the ABC's AM program that it is ability not resources that determines a student's academic achievement. He has also said that high-fee schools perform well because they attract students with high ability. Why on earth is he therefore giving these high-fee schools the biggest funding increases in the country—as much as 300 per cent? According to the minister's logic, these schools do not need additional resources because resources do not matter. I wonder what world this minister is living in?
Maybe it is like that up there on the North Shore in Sydney, but last week I visited three Aboriginal community schools in the Northern Territory. The things that struck me, first of all, were how extraordinarily poor the resources in the classrooms were and how hard it was for the teacher and the teacher's assistant to teach these children, because of language differences. It is an absolute tragedy to see the level of education that these children are receiving.
We cannot deny that the school in Oenpelli at Gunbalanya needs proper classrooms. It does not have proper classrooms. Yet this minister says that resources do not matter. Anywhere else in Australia it would not be acceptable to have children in these sorts of classrooms. They are tiny little classrooms—they are almost sitting on the ground—and they are made of some sort of tin. It is totally unacceptable. This place is just one of the places in the Northern Territory that needs a new school. Yet this minister has the hide to say that resources do not matter while at the same time he gives millions upon millions of dollars to schools like the King's School, Trinity Grammar and Geelong Grammar while we have schools in the Northern Territory, for example, crying out for increased funding just to cover the basics; just so they can have a decent classroom to teach in.
Let us get real. The massive funding increases that have gone to the highest fee schools in Australia would be far better spent on helping poorer-performing children at needy schools. Some of them are like the ones I saw last week in the Northern Territory. Others are Catholic parish schools in many of our country towns. These are the policies that Labor will implement. We will make sure that children in these schools get the resources that they need so that they too get a great education.
The government wants to distract people away from these fundamental resource inequalities between schools, because not only does this bill do nothing to address them; it is going to make them worse. That is why we have seen this minister put an enormous effort into trying to muddy the waters by introducing a range of different issues that do not go to the central question of how much money is available to make sure that children in our schools are properly educated.

"Sciacca, Con, MP",ALP,2004-08-03,"—Tonight I draw the attention of members to the urgent need for the government and the community to support the one in 2,500 Australian boys who suffer from Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Just two weeks ago, I met with Anne Holland from Upper Mount Gravatt, who spoke with me about her 11-year-old son, Matthew, who was diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy in July last year.
Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an X-linked chromosome disorder which only affects boys. There is no known cure. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by abnormalities of the dystrophin gene that produces a protein needed to maintain healthy muscles. As affected boys grow, their muscles become weaker, they lose the ability to walk and many boys will also experience problems with their joints, spine, heart and lungs. In addition to these physical challenges, a diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy causes ongoing psychological challenges for sufferers and their families as they deal with the deterioration of their mobility and muscle strength and the resulting decline in their quality of life. They have to reconcile themselves to the fact that boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy are generally not expected to live beyond their late teens or early 20s.
Understandably, the Holland family want to make sure that they have done everything they can to see that we in the federal parliament do everything in our power to help boys like Matthew enjoy a longer and more comfortable life and that researchers receive the support they need to improve treatments and to find a cure for this fatal genetic condition.
While Matthew has not completely lost his ability to walk, he does rely on a motorised scooter to get around at school or when family or social outings require a lot of walking. In an effort to slow the progression of the disease, Matthew has physical therapy and hydrotherapy to avoid the tightening of the muscles. When not using his scooter, he wears ankle-foot orthoses to assist with walking and takes a five millilitre dose of prednisolone, a cortico steroid. This medication has been found to successfully preserve heart and lung function and mobility.
Unfortunately, there is only one cortico steroid treatment available to young Australians with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The alternative medication, deflazacort, is not available in this country. The Holland family and many in their position would welcome the introduction of this effective medication onto the Australian market. It would give them a choice of treatments, especially as deflazacort causes less weight gain in some patients, an important factor when trying to preserve their son's mobility for as long as possible.
We are fortunate that there is some excellent research into Duchenne muscular dystrophy being conducted in Australia. Dr Andrew Hoey leads a team of researchers at the University of Southern Queensland who are focusing on developing and testing new therapies for cardiac and skeletal muscle in Duchenne muscular dystrophy affected boys. Dr Robert Kaspa and Dr Andrew Kornberg from the University of Melbourne are developing a novel technique to treat genetic neuromuscular disease, with a focus on using it to improve the quality of life and the lifespan of boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Western Australian muscular dystrophy researcher, Dr Steve Wilton, has developed gene therapy which will effectively turn Duchenne into a much milder form of the disease, namely Becker muscular dystrophy. 
In an interview with the ABC, researchers said, `With Becker's muscular dystrophy the severity ranges markedly. For example, there was one person who was not diagnosed till their mid-60s and was playing competitive sport till their early 60s. If we can convert Duchenne muscular dystrophy, where boys would normally die in their teens, into the much milder form, it has a considerable potential to improve the quality of life for both the boys and their families.' Human trials of this therapy are due to commence late this year or in early 2005.
We have impeccable intellectual resources in Australia, and they need our financial support if they are to advance their research and develop effective therapies and eventually a cure for this debilitating disease. By building the profile of Duchenne muscular dystrophy in Australia through forums such as this and creating greater awareness amongst our law-makers, our medical professionals and the general public, the Holland family and other families around the country who are living with this disease hope to gain wider support for their calls for increased investment in research and improved access to medicines and medical equipment such as suitable wheelchairs and respiratory equipment.
I am pleased to have had this opportunity tonight to advance their cause. It is estimated that the federal government spends approximately $3 million on each child with Duchenne muscular dystrophy throughout his short life. I support the Holland family, therapists and researchers and add my voice to their calls for more appropriately targeted government support to help them cope with and combat Duchenne muscular dystrophy.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy</title>,Adjournment,20,1,speech

"Costello, Peter, MP",LP,2004-08-03,"—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
The Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer represents the Australian Government on the Ministerial Meeting on Insurance Issues. At its meeting in Perth on 4 April 2003, Ministers agreed that further work should be undertaken with insurers to identify opportunities for further harmonisation of tort law reform. Officials representing the Australian Government, States and Territories are continuing to work together to progress harmonisation of reforms.
The Review of the Law of Negligence, chaired by Justice Ipp, was released on 2 October 2002. This review was jointly established with the States and Territories and reported on a range of issues including:
	professional negligence;
	reform of the TPA;
	limitation periods and reforms to assist not-for-profit organisations;
	limiting the liability of public authorities;
	self assumption of risk to override common law principles;
	proposals to restrict the circumstances in which a person must guard against the negligence of others; and
	the replacement of joint and several liability with proportionate liability.
The recommendations of the Ipp Report provide all jurisdictions with a model for consistent reform. The Australian Government has introduced the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injury and Death) Bill 2003 and the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injury and Death) Bill (No. 2) 2004 into the Parliament to support state and territory reforms in a manner consistent with Ipp wherever possible. It is disappointing that the Opposition refused to support either of these bills in their original form and has not accepted the Ipp model. The Australian Government encourages the Opposition to pass the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injury and Death) Bill 2003 as soon as possible to help improve the cost and availability of public liability insurance.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Tort Law Reform</title>,Answers to Questions in Writing,22,1,answer
