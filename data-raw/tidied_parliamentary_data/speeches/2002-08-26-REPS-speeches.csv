"Neville, Paul, MP",NP,2002-08-26,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories, I present the committee's report entitled Norfolk Island electoral matters.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—In 1999 the government sought to amend the Norfolk Island Act 1979 to ensure that only Australians could vote in or stand for election in the Norfolk Island Assembly elections. The Senate rejected the bill and sought greater consultation with the people of Norfolk Island on the matter. It was referred to the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories in March 2000.
Current electoral arrangements on Norfolk Island raise serious concerns. The franchise for the assembly election is based on residence on Norfolk Island rather than Australian citizenship. There are also requirements for eligibility to vote that are 30 times the period that applies to other parts of Australia. There is a requirement for a residential period of 990 days or 2½ years residence in the previous four years whereas the usual period in Australian states and territories is one month or six months in Tasmania. The result is that some Australian citizens are prevented from voting in Norfolk Island elections and non-Australian citizens are entitled to vote and stand for election. The committee concluded that this was unacceptable.
Under the proposed provisions in the rejected 1999 bill, only Australian citizens would have been eligible to enrol and stand for election to the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly. Six months was proposed as the qualifying period for enrolment for an ordinary resident and the enrolment rights of those currently on the electoral roll would have been preserved. Since Australian law does not require a person to renounce any other citizenship, dual citizenship combined with the grandfather clause would have provided security of voting rights and existing citizenship for all those currently entitled to vote.
The Norfolk Island Assembly, which gave evidence to the committee, argued the special nature of Norfolk Island's traditions and culture, as well as the concerns felt by islanders that these may be threatened by allowing relative newcomers a voice in island affairs. The committee was not persuaded that there was either a proven risk or a need for special protection, particularly when such protection entrenched in electoral law served to deny a basic human right to a group of citizens. Moreover, the committee argued that because the role of the Norfolk Island Assembly extended well beyond simple local issues, it was vital to Australia's national interest that ministers and other Legislative Assembly members were Australian citizens. The committee also noted that Australian citizenship is now a requirement or is being considered as a requirement for enrolment and election at local government level on the mainland.
The Norfolk Island government also objected to what it saw as the Commonwealth legislating on matters which were the province of the Norfolk Island Assembly. The committee recognised the right of the Norfolk Island Assembly to legislate in this area and it believed that it was preferable that it do so. However, the committee was aware that a succession of Norfolk Island governments have rejected electoral changes proposed by the Commonwealth. Consequently, it was clear that the likelihood that a Norfolk Island government would act unilaterally to implement these changes, which the committee considered to be fundamental to a strong democracy, was remote.
The Commonwealth made it clear during the inquiry that self-government for Norfolk Island continued to be desirable; however, it did not believe, and the committee concurred, that the changes to the act affecting the electoral system in any way diminished the island's self-government. The committee also believed that the Commonwealth had a responsibility to ensure that the Norfolk Island government met its existing fiscal and social obligations to the community. Moreover, the committee recognised that the Commonwealth has, and will continue to have, the legitimate right to intervene if it believes that an issue of national or international importance is at stake. The committee hoped that there would be increased cooperation between the Commonwealth and Norfolk Island governments and would be disappointed if Norfolk Islanders should ever be required or feel obliged to choose between increased independence and the benefits of citizenship. 
The committee concluded that a requirement to have Australian citizenship in order to vote or stand for elections of the Legislative Assembly was appropriate. It was satisfied that adequate safeguards could be provided for non-citizens who were already enrolled and noted both the relative ease with which New Zealand citizens might acquire Australian citizenship and the opportunity that exists for both nations to hold dual citizenship. Two referenda were held on these matters on Norfolk Island and both strongly supported the Norfolk Island government's position of no change. However, the committee was not satisfied that the conduct of the referenda was accompanied by clear, comprehensive information. There was also concern about perceived levels of intimidation of people on the island who disagreed with the majority view.

"Ellis, Annette, MP",ALP,2002-08-26,"—It is a pleasure to stand up today and address the tabling the report of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories entitled Norfolk Island electoral matters. There have been a number of reviews of electoral matters on Norfolk Island, leading to some changes to the Norfolk Island Act made in 1985. This inquiry is the latest of those reviews. Islands in the sun, tabled in 1991, recommended that:
 ... the residency provision be coupled with a citizenship requirement so that only Australian citizens are eligible to stand or vote in legislative assembly elections. 
This was not acted upon at the time. The issue was further raised by Minister Somlyay in 1998 and again by Minister Macdonald in 1999, when he introduced proposed legislative changes to the Norfolk Island Act.
The Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee conducted an inquiry into those proposed changes, although unfortunately that committee of inquiry was not able to visit the island. Opposition senators at the time rejected the findings of the committee, and the legislation was rejected. However, those same senators included in their addition to the report that:
 ... the matters of electoral reform contained in this Bill require wider consultation and much more consideration than the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee was able to give.
The non-government senators recommended the matter be referred to the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories for further inquiry. Minister Macdonald referred the matter to our committee in November 2000.
It was felt that residents on the island should be given every opportunity to put their views to our committee, and this was done by submission, by public hearing, and also by including a number of in camera contributions. The committee members noted with interest the wishes of a number of residents of Norfolk Island; they felt more comfortable taking advantage of the in camera means of addressing the inquiry than of the more public one available.
The findings of this inquiry are very much in the same vein as those earlier recommendations I referred to. This report contains two recommendations. They are as follows: 
Recommendation 1
The Committee recommends that Australian citizenship be reinstated as a requirement for eligibility to vote for and be elected to the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly, with appropriate safeguards for the right to vote of all those currently on the electoral roll.
The Committee further recommends that these changes be incorporated into the Commonwealth Norfolk Island Act 1979.
Recommendation 2
The Committee recommends that the Government amend all appropriate legislation, including the Norfolk Island Act 1979 and the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, to ensure that all elections and referenda on Norfolk Island come under the supervision of the Australian Electoral Commission.
I want to place on record my thanks and those of my colleagues to the Norfolk Island government and the people from the island who presented submissions and gave evidence, whether publicly or, as I said before, privately, in camera. I also want to thank my colleagues on the committee—both those from this parliament and those from the previous parliament, given that this inquiry spanned an election period. I would like to acknowledge on record the assistance and work of the committee secretariat of the 39th Parliament and the secretariat currently with the committee, who assisted with the production of this report.
It is fair to say that this issue has been inquired into and inquired into. However, now that the matter has been thoroughly examined by a joint standing committee of this place, which has looked very carefully not only at the evidence given to it during this inquiry but also at the work and the evidence in those previous inquiries, I and my colleagues on the committee are very much of the view that these recommendations stand strongly on their own behalf. I know that I am probably not alone when I say that I am very much looking forward to seeing the responses that may come to the inquiry recommendations and I know that we are also going to welcome any proposed legislative amendments that may lead from the inquiry.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>National Capital and External Territories Committee</title>,Committees,0,1,speech

	That the House take note of the report.
In summary, it was the view of the committee that popular referenda were not appropriate mechanisms for determining such questions. The right to vote is a fundamental right, not a matter of popular opinion. This is particularly important where those without a vote are excluded from a referendum to give them the right to vote. Popular opinion often opposes the rights of minorities, the very groups which human rights seek to protect.
The committee made three recommendations to the government. First, that the Norfolk Island Act be amended to make, with appropriate safeguards for those already on the electoral roll, Australian citizenship a prerequisite for both suffrage and the right to stand for election; second, that referenda and elections on Norfolk Island come under the supervision of the Australian Electoral Commission; and third, that the eligibility period for voting be reduced to six months. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
Leave granted.

"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2002-08-26,"—Today I present the Workplace Relations Amendment (Unfair Dismissal—Lower Costs, Simpler Procedures) Bill 2002—a better solution to the unfair dismissal system and Labor's solution, in contrast to the government's bill, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002, an approach which has been rejected five times already by this House. My private member's bill provides a solution driven by the problem, not by the politics. For six years, the government has had an obsession and an assertion in relation to unfair dismissals but it has never had a practical solution. 
Unfair dismissal laws protect workers from being sacked without good reason. This does not mean a worker cannot be sacked; it simply means they cannot be sacked unfairly. The government wants to take that protection away from employees in small businesses. This not only exposes the workers in those businesses to the fact that they can be sacked unfairly but also exposes small businesses to expensive common law action. It is no solution at all. Just have a look at the government's explanatory memorandum to its so-called `fair dismissals' bill, which seeks to:
... prevent small business employees (other than apprentices and trainees) from applying under the WR Act for a remedy in respect of harsh, unjust or unreasonable termination of employment.
Just think about that. If the government's Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 is passed, it will mean that there will be no remedy if you are sacked unjustly. That is not fair, not for one moment. It takes fairness away. Rather than being a fair dismissals bill, it takes the fairness out of the procedure. 
The government claims that passage of this bill will increase employment. How can anyone claim that you can create jobs by making it easier to sack people? It does not stand to reason. It is for those reasons that Labor continue to oppose the government's legislation. We will not support legislation that makes it easier to sack workers unfairly, but we will support changes to the current system—changes to ease the pressure on small businesses in relation to unfair dismissal. Just as we have put forward constructive proposals to lift red tape from small businesses struggling with the GST, so this private member's bill also addresses the concerns of small businesses. Small businesses have told me that they are concerned about delays and legal costs. This bill addresses those issues. It is about lowering costs, simplifying procedures and reducing uncertainty and confusion. 
The bill I am proposing contains a number of key elements. It seeks to reduce the cost of defending unfair dismissal claims by limiting the role of lawyers. Labor's bill targets the ambulance chasers through better regulation of the paid agents. The bill enables the minister to establish an indicative time frame for unfair dismissal cases to be heard and this will encourage the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to deal with the claims more quickly. The bill also requires sacked workers to seek, as one of the remedies, reinstatement so that the commission cannot consider an application unless reinstatement is part of the remedy. This is designed to combat the pay-off mentality. The bill requires the minister to develop an information package in consultation with the states. The bill will reduce uncertainty for small business operators. It will speed up the process through eliminating unnecessary complexity where several employees are sacked at the same time for related reasons. This deals with a range of cases in the coal mining industry—one still unresolved at Blair Athol.  
Today we put forward a positive solution. We will oppose the government's attempts to make it easier to sack workers but we are in favour of simplifying the processes, taking the anomalies out and speeding up the processes. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Unfair Dismissal—Lower Costs, Simpler Procedures) Bill 2002 is a bill for a positive solution. It is one I commend to the House.

"Barresi, Phillip, MP",LP,2002-08-26,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	expresses its gratitude to the “Heroes of Kokoda” as we reflect upon the 60th anniversary of the Battles to Save Australia, and accordingly give due honour and respect to the memory of these heroes by:
	(a)	supporting the development of the Kokoda Track as a National Memorial Park, which will ensure it remains a historical, cultural and commemorative experience for all Australians; and 
	(b)	establishing a joint Australian and Papua New Guinean Master Plan under the guidance of Australian Government and local PNG Provincial government personnel;
(2)	expresses support of the Government's commitment of $1.5 million for the establishment of 3 memorials in Papua New Guinea, one of which will be constructed at Isurava to commemorate the Battle at Kokoda; and
(3)	calls on all Australians in this the 60th anniversary month to commemorate the sacrifice of all servicemen who participated in the battles along the Kokoda Track by:
	(a)	inaugurating a National Day of Remembrance celebrated both in Australia and at Owers Corner, PNG;
	(b)	congratulating the Australian Football League, the members, supporters and administrators of the Sydney Swans and Richmond Tigers for their annual commemorative game at Stadium Australia, honouring the Spirit of Kokoda; and
	(c)	supporting the establishment of a Fuzzy Wuzzy Angel Scholarship Foundation to educate the sons and daughters of the Kokoda Trail Villagers as a sign of our nation's gratitude for the selfless sacrifice of the local people during the campaign.
It gives me great honour to introduce this private member's motion honouring the 60th anniversary of the sacrifice by the heroes of Kokoda. Introducing this motion has added significance, as I had the tortuous pleasure of walking from Kokoda to Owers Corner in April this year, emerging from the track in time to attend the very solemn Anzac Day service at Bomana Cemetery.
Five hundred young Victorian men left the Australian shores in 1942 for Papua New Guinea believing that they would be stationed in Port Moresby, only to be told on their arrival that they were heading out to Kokoda. They were told that they were the only defence between the invincible Japanese Imperial Army and Port Moresby, and of course Australia itself. They were ordered to defend at all costs, not to retreat, and to buy time while diggers from the 2nd/14th and 2nd/16th returning from the Middle East could be diverted to the track. The 500 young Victorians combined to form the 39th Battalion, a group of relatively untrained and militarily unskilled militia upon whose shoulders, unknowingly, the independence and sovereignty of our nation would depend. These men did not know their fate nor did they know of the sheer number of Japanese they would soon confront. They embarked on a journey that quickly turned into a battle—the battle to save Australia. Their heroism and deeds are the stuff of legends. Sadly, we have not had as proud a record in honouring our past heroes as other nations, but perhaps in the last few years we are seeing a change.
In April this year I met up with a group of 18 other Australians to pay our own tribute to the heroes of Kokoda. I was the only federal MP on a nine-day walk across the Kokoda Track, led by New South Wales upper house MP Charlie Lynn—a Vietnam veteran who has made the Kokoda Track and the need to develop a national memorial master plan a cause worth fighting for in all political jurisdictions, here and overseas. We were accompanied for part of the journey by author and director Patrick Lindsay, who has just published the latest book on Kokoda, as well as Army personnel involved in recovering and identifying the remains of an Aussie digger at the original Isurava battlefield site. I vividly recall that the only way I managed to complete the trek was with the incredible assistance of my guide, Naki, as well as an attitude of one foot in front of the next—no time to savour the scenery on a track often not even as wide as one foot; a track often doubling up as a watercourse on the acute, steep slopes.
Many of the guides and porters are descendants of the brave native heroes, the fuzzy wuzzy angels, who gave their lives to rescue the Aussie diggers. The most emotional part of the nine days was when we paid homage to one of the original `angels' in the village of Naduli. On this note, I extend sincere congratulations to Kelvin Templeton, the CEO of the Sydney Swans, for organising the first of five Kokoda tribute matches this Saturday at Stadium Australia and for establishing the Fuzzy Wuzzy Scholarship Fund for children of the villages along the track. Well done to the Sydney Swans. 
The only similarity between our group and the 39th Battalion was our location. The physically and emotionally gruelling nature of the trek pales into insignificance when you think of what the Australian soldiers contended with. We were not being shot at, nor did we have to fight off an overwhelming enemy force, and we had ample food, shelter and support. When the Australians and Japanese met along the track, it was the scene of some of the bloodiest battles fought in Papua New Guinea. The resulting tensions between the diggers and Generals Blainey and MacArthur have been well documented. The bloodiest of all battles took place at Isurava, Templeton's Crossing, Mission Ridge and Brigade Hill. All should be treated as sacred sites by all proud Australians. Some months after the initial arrival, only 32 of the 500 Australians from the 39th Battalion were alive. If it were not for the timely arrival of the 2nd/14th and 2nd/16th, the battles would have been lost.
It was a fitting gesture this year to honour the contribution of those Australians who fought along the Kokoda Track. Congratulations to the government for opening the memorial at Isurava, not far from the site where Private Bruce Kingsbury won the first Victoria Cross in the PNG campaign. I also take this opportunity to congratulate the government on the recent environment and heritage legislation introduced in the House. It will soon be possible to list overseas sites that have a national significance. I have already foreshadowed that, in the absence of a federal government application to list the Kokoda Track, I, along with my friend Charlie Lynn, will attempt to do so.
As I remarked to James Buchanan, an 82-year-old Deakin constituent who was in the 39th Battalion, `The freedom, sovereignty and independence of our great nation will forever be in debt to the heroes of Kokoda.' May their contribution forever be remembered as Australia's fight for independence. (Time expired)

"Edwards, Graham, MP",ALP,2002-08-26,"—I am happy to take part in this debate about the Kokoda Track and, in doing so, I want to read a speech that was made by former Prime Minister Paul Keating in 1992 for the 50th anniversary of the battle. He made this speech on the track, and I quote:
This is the place where the rock of friendship and the foundation stone of relations between our two countries rests and while we've had a long history together in places like Port Moresby and Lae and other places it is really here that the soul of the relationship sits, here in Kokoda. Because it was here that Australians decided to defend your liberty as well as their own and you decided to defend yourselves and help us defend ourselves. It was here young Australian men fought for the first time against the prospect of the invasion of their country, of Australia.
Never before, even though we fought in many conflicts, mostly imperial conflicts, in conflicts where we felt pangs of loyalty to what was then known as the “Mother Country” to Britain and to the empire to fight in Gallipoli with heroism and in Belgium in Flanders and in France and in other places, this was the first and only time that we've fought against an enemy to prevent the invasion of Australia, to secure the way of life we had built for ourselves. And those young Australian men fought here, 2,000 of them died, 600 Americans died later and we should never forget their sacrifice, that the families who live so distantly in the United States lost 600 sons here should never be forgotten and they cost the lives of 13,000 Japanese who fought for their country and what they believed were their country's strategic interests which were, of course, interests which we could not accept and could only abhor.
The lesson of this place is that these young men believed in Australia and we need to give Australians, all Australians, particularly young Australians, an Australia to believe in. We can't deny young Australians their birthright to a past with meaning for them and a future with meaning. It has to be a future with meaning and everything we see here—there can be no deeper spiritual basis to the meaning of the Australian nation than the blood that was spilled on this very knoll, this very plateau, in defence of the liberty of Australia.
So, Prime Minister, can I thank you on behalf of your countrymen, some who I've met here today who actually fought in that campaign, for those who died in that campaign, to the relatives here today of loved ones who were lost in that campaign but who gave their lives selflessly in the defence of Papua New Guinea and the defence of Australia and the broader defence of liberty in the Pacific.
This was the place where I believe the depth and soul of the Australian nation was confirmed. If it was founded in Gallipoli it was certainly confirmed in the defence of our homeland here.
That is an important link. That was 10 years ago; we are now talking about the 60th anniversary. It is tremendous to see that the Prime Minister at that time went and that the current Prime Minister has also gone. So there is a very strong bipartisan approach to this issue. I also want to again read into the Hansard the poem written by Sapper Beros, who was in the 7th Division and served on the track. His mother had the poem published in the Courier Mail. It reads:
The Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels
Many a mother in Australia,
When the busy day is done,
Sends a prayer to the Almighty
For the keeping of her son.
Asking that an Angel guide him
And bring him safely back
Now we see those prayers are answered
On the Owen Stanley Track,
For they haven't any halos,
Only holes slashed in their ears,
And with faces worked by tattoos,
With scratch pins in their hair,
Bringing back the wounded,
Just as steady as a hearse,
Using leaves to keep the rain off
And gentle as a nurse.
Slow and careful in bad places,
On the awful mountain track,
And the look upon their faces
Makes us think that Christ was black.
Not a move to hurt the carried,
As they treat him like a Saint,
It's a picture worth recording,
That an Artist's yet to paint.
Many a lad will see his Mother,
And the Husbands, Weans and Wives,
Just because the Fuzzy Wuzzy
Carried them to save their lives.
From mortar or machine gun fire,
Or a chance surprise attack,
To safety and the care of Doctors,
At the bottom of the track.
May the Mothers in Australia,
When they offer up a prayer,
Mention those impromptu Angels,
With the Fuzzy Wuzzy hair.

"Billson, Bruce, MP",LP,2002-08-26,"—I rise to not only reinforce the spirit of my friend and colleague's motion but also reinforce the fact that I seconded the motion. The motion before the House today is an expression of gratitude and symbolises this parliament's commitment to recognising the work and great achievements of Australian men and women and—as so eloquently outlined by the member for Deakin—those who aided them, as the 60th anniversary of the Kokoda battles draws near. Many will be reminded of it because of the Aussie rules match next weekend—where the mighty Richmond Tigers should give the Sydney Swans a whopping—which will be cause to prick the national conscience about this defining moment in our nation's history.
The New Guinea campaign is seen as a defining moment in our history, as the invincibility of the Japanese forces was first broken down during those times. In May 1942, the Japanese attempted to take Port Moresby by sea but were thwarted during the naval battles of the Coral Sea and also by the effects of the Midway battle. The Japanese decided to take Port Moresby in two approaches. First, they landed at Milne Bay on the south-east tip of Papua and were repulsed by the Australians with the aid of air support. The second avenue was over the Owen Stanleys; that caught the Australians by surprise, but we were ready to take it on. The 39th Battalion was ordered to cross the Owen Stanleys to secure an air base at Buna, 200 kilometres away.
Our troops were heavily outnumbered, poorly prepared and lightly equipped, so they withdrew to Ioribaiwa and Imita Ridge, where they faced difficult conditions, an extraordinarily difficult climate and unforgiving terrain. The Australian 39th Battalion was joined eventually by the 53rd Battalion and by the seasoned AIF infantry battalions of the 21st Brigade. Savage battles ensued, but the Australians started to gain the upper hand and the Japanese were unable to advance beyond Ioribaiwa. The Australians were reinforced by the AIF 3rd Battalion, the 25th Brigade, the Second First Pioneer Battalion and the 66th Independent Company. The suffering was huge: sleep deprivation, inadequate shelter, difficult climate, limited food and very restricted medical supplies. Troops carried 30 kilograms of equipment; they fought through constant wetness, tortuous terrain, and tropical diseases and fevers—malaria, hookworm, dysentery and the like. In that initial phase 600 Australians died and more than 1,000 were wounded.
Kokoda marked the turning point in the war of the south-west Pacific. The Japanese would no longer pose a direct threat to Australia. The member for Deakin has outlined the gallantry, and the great suffering that was endured in order to protect our nation. I believe his motion to properly recognise the heroes of Kokoda as we approach the 60th anniversary is entirely appropriate. The idea of a national memorial park is certainly something that needs to be worked through with the Papua New Guinean government, but I wholeheartedly endorse the member for Deakin's push to have some formal recognition of that part of Papua New Guinea as part of our national history and—as was mentioned by the previous speaker, the member for Cowan—part of our national sacred space.
There is master planning going on as a joint Australian-Papua New Guinean endeavour. Funds are being provided through the Australian government, and the support of the provincial government, through its personnel and infrastructures, is seeing that improvements and proper memorials are created. As the member for Deakin mentioned, funds are being made available for three particular memorials, and there was also recognition—through the visit led by our Prime Minister—of what a remarkable contribution Australians have made. The member for Deakin has also outlined the Fuzzy Wuzzy Angel Scholarship Foundation and the contribution of Kelvin Templeton and the Sydney Swans in making sure that this date is not forgotten.
The member for Deakin also mentioned the heritage laws that are available now, where our nation can protect and recognise heritage that is actually in countries outside our jurisdiction. I believe it is important that this site, and also some of the areas that were traversed by the 58/59th Battalion, gain recognition. It could be embraced as a comprehensive package of heritage sites properly supported by interpretive signage and markers so that our heritage that was fought for, the blood that was lost and the national character that was created in areas of Papua New Guinea, highlighted by the Kokoda campaign, can be recognised and shared by all Australians. While the names of the AIF battalions are pretty much household words, few civilians have heard of the 58/59th Battalion. I mention that as my grandfather served in that unit. It was one of the few battalions in the Australian Army to win all of the battles in which it was engaged during the war, and it should also be recognised as part of an integrated proposal.

"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2002-08-26,"—One of the greatest battles in Australian history occurred in 1942, when Australian soldiers and AIF forces battled against the Japanese invasion force. The campaign centred around the one-metre wide, 160-kilometre long Kokoda Track through the Owen Stanley mountain range, crossing gorges and streams and going over ridges of up to 2,500 metres high from Buna to Port Moresby. It was known as the worst battlefield of World War II. Australians were outnumbered five to one; they were fighting against superior armed and experienced jungle troops, but the Australians finally sapped the Japanese of strength, bringing their advance to a halt before finally driving them out of New Guinea.
This month is the 60th anniversary to commemorate and honour the sacrifice of our armed forces, in particular the 39th Battalion, the 2/14, the 2/16 and the 21st Brigade and all other servicemen who contributed towards the campaign along the Kokoda Track. We cannot be grateful enough to these gallant servicemen and women for their bravery that saved Australia from invasion and subsequent loss of freedom. At this point, I would like to pay tribute to our friends in Papua New Guinea. The loss of 600 lives during the campaign was quite significant. This would have been far greater had it not been for the help of the native Papua New Guineans affectionately known as the fuzzy wuzzy angels. No known live casualty was ever abandoned by those Kokoda Track villagers. One digger wrote:
They carried stretchers over seemingly impassable barriers, with the patient reasonably comfortable. The care they give to the patient is magnificent. If night finds the stretcher still on the track, they will find a level spot and build a shelter over the patient. They will make him as comfortable as possible, fetch him water and feed him if food is available, regardless of their own needs. They sleep four each side of the stretcher and if the patient moves or requires any attention during the night, this is given instantly. These were the deeds of the “Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels”—for us! 
For our men and our women.
The Kokoda Track today is increasingly becoming a destination for international tourists and for those of us who make the pilgrimage to pay our respects to Australian servicemen and women who served during World War II in this rugged and inhospitable environment. The motion before the House seeks to pay tribute to the heroes of Kokoda and to honour and respect their sacrifice. The development of the Kokoda Track as a national memorial park, within the context of an Australian-PNG master plan, is important and will ensure that this historical piece of heritage is retained for future generations. The allocation of $1.5 million by the federal government for the three new war memorials on the Kokoda Track, Milne Bay and Popondetta to mark the 60th anniversary of the Papua New Guinea campaigns during World War II is supported fully by the Australian community.
The monument subsequently unveiled at the northern end of the Kokoda Track is a first and positive step towards establishing a commemorative platform of activities in recognition of those who served in Australia's PNG campaign. This monument features granite plinths engraved with the words `courage, endurance, mateship and sacrifice', which epitomises the very sentiments of the Australian community who salute those who have fought to defend our freedom and our democracy. The commemoration of the sacrifice of the 39th Battalion, the 2/14, the 2/16 and 21st Brigade, and all of the other servicemen and women who have participated in the battles along the Kokoda Track, by commemorative activities such as the establishment of a day of remembrance are essential symbols of our nation's gratitude. At the same time, it is imperative to demonstrate our appreciation to organisations such as the Australian Rugby League and the Sydney Swans, as well as the Richmond Tigers, for their annual commemorative game honouring the spirit of Kokoda. Educating the sons and daughters of the Kokoda Track villagers as a sign of the nation's gratitude is a laudable and patriotic undertaking and bears great potential to assist in establishing closer links between our two great nations. 
I support this motion and I appreciate that this motion was put forward by the member for Deakin. I think it is a great honour and a great privilege for us in this House to be able to mark the 60th anniversary and to pause for a moment and remember the sacrifice made by our gallant troops who fought with distinction in very difficult circumstances. By all accounts they prevented the Japanese forces from marching through to Port Moresby and heading to Australia, at which point we really do not know what would have happened, and we are glad we do not know. I commemorate those servicemen and women. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Kokoda Track</title>,Private Members' Business,2,1,speech
"Scott, Bruce, MP",NP,2002-08-26,"—I rise in the House today to join others in support of the motion put forward by the member for Deakin, with others on both sides of this parliament speaking to it. We express our gratitude to the heroes of Kokoda and applaud the establishment of a national memorial park along the Kokoda Track. This is the 60th anniversary of the battle on the Kokoda Track, and it reminds us all that this part of Australia, as it was at the time, was the last line of defence that had to be defended should the Japanese gain a foothold in New Guinea. As others said previously, Australia would have been a much different place had they been successful. Our sovereignty certainly was at risk, and that is why we are today saluting those men of the Australian Defence Force. I think we should also include those of the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force, because all three services played a part in support or in transport or in the operations of those from the ground on the Kokoda Track.
The battle for New Guinea began with the Japanese invasion. The forces landed at Gona, on the north-east coast of Papua. We all know now, and history tells us, that their plan was to cross the Owen Stanley range and to attack and occupy Port Moresby, the main Australian base in New Guinea, which would have given them a strategic point from which to launch off into Australia.
Australia's official historian, Dudley McCarthy, describes the Owen Stanley range as the most rugged on earth. I have never had the opportunity to visit the Owen Stanley range, but I have certainly flown over it. I have read much of the history of the Kokoda campaign. Men of the Australian Defence Forces fought under horrific conditions: the terrain was rugged, they were not well equipped and they had to endure a tropical climate. The young soldiers had to contend with not just the steepness of the track but with rainforests dripping with moss and infested with leeches and mosquito-infested swamps. We all know that a large number of our men contracted malaria, a disease that would afflict them for many years after their service in New Guinea.  
Despite being in the tropics, they were continually wet and cold in the incessant rain and high altitudes, which had an effect on their physical wellbeing. I salute our Australian soldiers for their determination—they were determined to take Kokoda and to push the Japanese back off the Owen Stanley range, something that we should all admire and salute.
The withdrawal ended on 17 September at Imita Ridge, north-east of Port Moresby, with the Australians benefiting from reinforcements. Japanese forces were at the end of a long supply line. At that stage, the Japanese commander ordered the Japanese to retreat and the Australians followed up the Kokoda Track, retaking Kokoda on 2 November.
Many have likened Kokoda to being like Gallipoli on our territory. Others have said that we need to encourage young Australians to visit Kokoda and the Kokoda Track—young Australians are visiting Gallipoli in large numbers today—as it is close to home and gives young Australians the opportunity to see first-hand and understand better the conditions under which Australians served.
I would also like to acknowledge the fact that the Victoria Cross was posthumously awarded to Bruce Kingsbury for his efforts on the Kokoda campaign on 29 August and to Corporal French from Crows Nest for his efforts at Milne Bay on 4 September. I commend the motion to the House. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Kokoda Track</title>,Private Members' Business,2,1,speech
"Gibbons, Steve, MP",ALP,2002-08-26,"—I am pleased to support this private member's motion honouring those who fought on the Kokoda Track. Had it not been for the brave deeds of the ANZACs during the Gallipoli campaign, it may well have been the story of Australian experiences on the Kokoda Track that assumed the role of defining us as a nation. Despite the passage of time and the recent death of our last ANZAC, Gallipoli holds a significant place in our national consciousness. Yet it was at Kokoda that Australians displayed similar bravery and defended Australia when it directly faced the threat of invasion by the Japanese. Australian soldiers were killed in battle, paying for their bravery with their very lives. In fact, more Australians died in the seven months of this campaign than in any other of World War II. Many were captured, suffering as prisoners of war. Kokoda was a theatre of war where Australian soldiers experienced unspeakable acts of brutality. Our Japanese enemy was brutal in the treatment it dispensed to the Aussie diggers. It is understandable that the psychological effects would remain long after the physical scars have healed. 
While I have no hesitation in supporting this motion and measures to acknowledge the actions of Australians on Kokoda, I am mindful of the necessity to do so with dignity and respect. For the veterans who survived Kokoda, the memories of their experiences are understandably not always pleasant ones. I am sure that many actually choose to forget what they experienced on the Kokoda Track. Let us ensure that we express our gratitude for their service but do not force commemoration upon those who have every right to keep their memories their own.
The suggestions by the member for Deakin in this motion to recognise the deeds of Australian soldiers at Kokoda are an appropriate way of giving our thanks to those who fought to save Australia. Kokoda deserves the status of a national memorial park so that it remains a historical, cultural and commemorative experience for future generations of Australians who owe their freedoms to the sacrifices of Australian soldiers on Kokoda. 
I am particularly pleased to see there is provision for Australia to work with the government of Papua New Guinea in the development of various memorials to Kokoda. I am also pleased that there should be recognition for the pivotal role of the fuzzy wuzzy angels. Many Australian survivors owe their lives to the bravery of the Kokoda Track villagers, many of whom lost their lives in the struggle to stop the invasion of Australia by the Japanese. They displayed enormous bravery in the process. Even the Japanese survivors have acknowledged the ferocity with which Australian soldiers fought in the various battles of Kokoda.
It is appropriate that the Commonwealth parliament should support this motion and do so in the absence of partisan political divisions. The memorials at Kokoda will also provide tangible reminders to the deeds of Australian heroes. I am sure the many younger Australians who make the pilgrimage to Gallipoli will also visit Kokoda in greater numbers. We should encourage them to do so.
The observations of my colleague the member for Cowan about his regular visits to Vietnam are probably familiar to many members of this House. He is a great champion for all our veterans from all wars. Visiting places such as Vietnam, Gallipoli and Kokoda is the best way to experience and understand these struggles first-hand and to pay tribute to those who participated. I would encourage all members of this parliament to do so. In commending this motion to the House, I express my gratitude to the heroes of Kokoda. It is their bravery and sacrifice that allow us to meet here today in this House 60 years later.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Kokoda Track</title>,Private Members' Business,2,1,speech
"Bishop, Bronwyn, MP",LP,2002-08-26,"—Four years ago, in August 1998, I went to Isurava—the battlefield of which had only just been rediscovered—and took back the veterans from the 39th Battalion and the 2/14th. It was called `the last parade'. I went there in my capacity as Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel. In that clearing, where the descendants of fuzzy wuzzy angels met the veterans, there was a small pulpit-like structure erected from saplings that had been cut from the jungle. I spoke from there, as did others. I apologised to the men of the 39th Battalion and told them that they were heroes, not the cowards that they had been falsely labelled by General Blamey after they had fought together with the 2/14th at that Battle of Isurava—in so many ways the most significant battle for Australia, because this was the first time that Australians fought alone on an Australian territory to repel an invader that was coming to our shores. 
The men of the 39th were militia. They had had six weeks training, if that. They were under the command of Colonel Honner. They were meant to be relieved by the 2/14th, who had been returned from the Middle East. The age of the men from the 39th was 18. The age of those returning was 23—they were seasoned. It was the first time the militia and members of the AIF fought together on Australian territory. They fought side by side, as the men of the 39th decided they could not be relieved; they had to remain and fight. It was from there on a policy of strategic withdrawal, holding the Japanese at bay, stretching their supply lines, demoralising them. It was a ferocious battle.
The week before last, I went back to the Kokoda Track. This time I did not fly by helicopter, as I had previously, but walked in to Isurava with Charlie Lynn, from Efogy 1. I thought very often of those men as I looked beside the track at holes where Australian troops had dug in. There had been the most ferocious of fighting and they had fought outnumbered—something like six to one, sometimes 10 to one—all knowing that they were fighting for Australia. These men did not have long trousers, as we had, or hiking boots. They had Army issue of the time, which was shorts. The temperature gets down below zero at night. They did not have anything warm to wrap up in, as we did; they had capes. I walked along one part of the track where one of those who fought there for us, to give me and the rest of us in this chamber the freedom we enjoy, had crawled with crudely made pads on his knees and his hands, knowing that if he stopped it would mean death, knowing that the ferociousness of their enemy was something they could not give in to.
In the place of that small pulpit-like structure there is now a magnificent memorial commemorating that battle. I promised the men when I was there in 1998 that I would do all I could to ensure that the name of Isurava became as well known as the name Gallipoli. I felt that my trekking for four days through the jungle and just beginning to understand what they went through was part of that promise.
My dad fought in New Guinea. I thought of him a lot. He never talked to me about it; he talked to my brother, because he did not think girls ought to know too much about the war. But I have heard the story since and I thought about him a lot on the track. I went with Charlie Lynn, a former major in the Australian Army, now a member of the legislative council of NSW, who has done it 29 times and cares passionately, as I have come to do, about letting people know about the courage of our men at Isurava. There are many memorials that are being planned. I think the one to be launched, as outlined in the motion, is one to be commended, as indeed is the rest of the motion. It was a very moving experience for me, but not a fraction of what it was for those men.

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2002-08-26,"—I am pleased to be able to rise today and support the member for Deakin's motion of gratitude to the heroes of Kokoda. Although I will not comment on the three paragraphs and subparagraphs of the motion, I note that they are worthy of our strong support. I am very pleased to be able to participate in this debate, particularly as we approach the 60th anniversary of the battles to save Australia with a shared understanding of their importance. 
This, as others have observed, has not always been the case. For decades, both historians and Australian governments rejected the significance of the Kokoda Track to our political and cultural history. This has been particularly unjust to the servicemen involved, not only because of the enormity of their heroism and their suffering but also because they had already been neglected by the military hierarchy at the time of their ordeal. Shamefully, no Australian Prime Minister had visited Kokoda after the event prior to the visit of Paul Keating in April 1992. I note that Christopher Bantick, in his article in the Canberra Times of 9 September 2000, says:
When former Prime Minister Paul Keating kissed the ground at Kokoda on which the Diggers died, he recognised the sacredness of the place where much Australian blood was shed and, in a single, stunning, natural act, he perhaps also baptised Kokoda as a new Gallipoli in national memory.
I think that is truly the case and, in that context, I want to congratulate the current Prime Minister, following his commemorative visit earlier this month, for his efforts to ensure that the track is being honoured in the rightful way. It is the least we must do.
In the early hours of tomorrow morning it will be 60 years since a force of several thousand experienced Japanese soldiers launched their attack on the Australian 39th Battalion at Isurava. The 39th comprised, as I have said, an inexperienced bunch of boys—literally—with an average age of 18½ years, new to the war and new to the jungle. I am not going to detail the events of the following months; they have become legend and others here have spoken about them. The fortitude and sacrifice of the 39th, their Papuan allies and the battalions that came later to their aid deserve reverent acknowledgment. Their determined resistance and eventual victories, including the unlikely success at Milne Bay, stunned and invigorated the Allies. As Field Marshal William Slim, the commander of the Allied forces in India and Burma, later noted:
We were greatly cheered by the news of the Australian victory at Milne Bay. This was the first-ever defeat of the Japanese on land. If the Australians had done it, so could we.
The peoples of Australia and Papua had shown their resourcefulness and their courage to the world. 
I just want to refer again to the article by Christopher Bantick. He in turn quotes from a book by Peter Brune entitled We Band of Brothers. He quotes Brune referring to the struggles and travails of the 39th Battalion and the mammoth effort at Kokoda:
In simple terms, the saga of the 39th Australian Infantry Battalion's campaigning is a classic illustration of what egalitarian Australia has always rejoiced in—the seemingly impossible triumph of the underdog against all conceivable odds.
And he says also:
The 39th Battalion represented Australia at that time. Australia was almost a naive country. Isurava was a turning point in the country's maturity. We didn't have anybody else but ourselves.
That is an accurate depiction. Others have talked about this event as our coming of age. But it was an important tragic and heroic moment and part of the Australian story, and part of the Australian story that we Australians need to constantly remind ourselves of, especially as those veterans of those great campaigns—including Kokoda—are coming near to the end of their lives. We must ensure that the effort, their sacrifices and the sacrifices of the fuzzy wuzzy angels—the help that they gave these heroic individuals and the courage they showed—are not forgotten and that future generations recall and understand that moment in our history.

"Secker, Patrick, MP",LP,2002-08-26,"—I rise today to speak on the motion moved by the member for Deakin, which, amongst other things, states:
That this House:
(1)	expresses its gratitude to the “Heroes of Kokoda” ...
The motion put forward by the honourable member for Deakin deals with a subject which is very dear to my heart. I last spoke in the House on Kokoda just over a year ago, when I had the pleasure of moving a motion in relation to obtaining support for the development of the Kokoda Track as a national memorial park on behalf of the Hon. Charlie Lynn MLC of the New South Wales parliament.
The motion to which I speak today reiterates this call and asks that this House support the government's commitment of $1½ million for the establishment of three memorials in Papua New Guinea and calls on all Australians in this 60th anniversary month to commemorate the sacrifice of all servicemen who participated in the battles along the Kokoda trail, and to do this by inaugurating a national day of remembrance and supporting the Fuzzy Wuzzy Angel Scholarship Foundation to educate the sons and daughters of the Kokoda trail villagers as a sign of our nation's gratitude for the selfless sacrifice of the local people during this campaign.
I personally would like to add my full support to this motion because, as I have said before, our diggers' efforts at Kokoda are the Second World War equivalent of Gallipoli, or even better. The odds faced by our diggers at Kokoda were just amazing. They were outnumbered and outgunned, yet they still managed to contest every inch of the Kokoda Track as they forced the Japanese troops to retreat. The conflict cost 607 lives and left more than 1,000 seriously injured, yet despite the amazing odds the Australians reoccupied the village of Kokoda on 2 November 1942. This was an amazing feat. I do not believe that many of the Australian public realise just what an amazing feat this was. Unless you have trekked the rugged and unforgiving terrain of the track, I do not think that anyone can even remotely imagine just what our young diggers were actually faced with.
The many documentaries of the Kokoda Track and of celebrity trekkings of the Kokoda Track have helped to raise the profile of those young diggers who sacrificed themselves for the nation. I am pleased that these documentaries have helped our younger generations to understand just exactly why they can live in our country as they do today. However, not many Australians—young or old—recognise that of all the Allies it was these diggers on the Kokoda Track who first broke the spell of the invincibility of the Japanese army. They were the ones who first made the progress, who won the battle and who succeeded in forcing the Japanese troops to retreat. So it is for these reasons that I believe that it is very important to commemorate their efforts by developing the Kokoda Track as a national memorial park and that we should be trying to establish a joint Australian and Papua New Guinea master plan.
Following my last speech in the House on the Kokoda Track, I was contacted by two people who are very supportive of the motion I put forward. Dr Alan Bentley, a fellow South Australian, contacted me to offer his support to the development of the Kokoda Track as a national memorial park. Dr Bentley served in the 6th Australian Field Ambulance, 21st Brigade, which provided the 31 medical members for the Maroubra force. The other person was Mr Ross Bastiaan OAM RFD of Victoria, who wrote to me voicing his support. I was amazed when reading Mr Bastiaan's letter to realise the level of support some people are prepared to provide to preserve this important and emotional part of our history. Mr Bastiaan's dedication cannot go unnoticed and it is for people such as Mr Bastiaan and Dr Bentley and my good friend the Hon. Charlie Lynn that this House must see this project through to fruition. I fully support all aspects of this motion and urge all my colleagues to do the same.

" McFarlane, Jann, MP",ALP,2002-08-26,"—My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services. Do you recall last year in your defence of your family payment system saying in parliament:
Of course, what we have done, which we are the first government to do, is, if people underestimate their income, we give them a 10 per cent top up.
Minister, why did you not mention the fact that, while family payment debts last forever, your top up is only good for 12 months—the only tax-linked benefit to have such a time limit? Minister, what is your advice to the Canberra family whose tax return reached the tax office two days late and who missed out on a $1,900 top up?",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Taxation: Family Payments</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,question
"Anthony, Larry, MP",NP,2002-08-26,"—I would like to thank the honourable member for her question. It gives me an opportunity to reiterate the government's family tax benefit program. I will state again that this is all about giving extra payments to Australian families. Two million Australian families received at least $2 billion extra through the family tax benefit and, of course, that gave assistance to the children of those families.
We did make some modifications. For the first time, those parents—particularly if they overestimated their income and, therefore, were entitled to more family tax benefit—could receive that at the end of the year when a reconciliation was done. That was called a top-up payment. Certainly, in the first financial year when the new taxation system came into place, I have been informed that up to about 400,000 families received that. 
The question the honourable member asks is, `Why isn't that period perhaps longer, compared to other social security legislation or law?' I might add that the arrangements that we have in place for family tax benefit, particularly the top up, which allows 12 months, allow significantly longer than just about any other form of social security payment.
—Why is it the only one?
—Perhaps the member for Lilley might learn something about this, because the legislation that was put through on this over two years ago was supported by this parliament and, indeed, a lot of this notification is in the Tax Pack. But I want to reiterate again that there is a 12-month period for that top up and that is very generous compared to other forms of social security payments.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Taxation: Family Payments</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,answer

Minister, with the next school holidays starting in September, can you inform the House why you believe that your child-care system is working when the government's restrictions have led to children with special needs not being able to get extra hours care in the holidays because of your decision to freeze special needs funding, and outside school hours care vacation programs and family day care schemes with double the number of children needing places than have been allocated by the government? Minister, given that you know that these problems will arise again in each state and territory when the next block of school holidays occur, what are you going to do to help these working families cope? ",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Family and Community Services: Child Care</title>,Questions Without Notice,8,1,question
"Anthony, Larry, MP",NP,2002-08-26,"—I am really delighted that the Labor Party is showing such interest in the policies around child care. The honourable member asks a number of serious questions, which I am very happy to answer. The first is the issue of outside school hours care. Since the Liberal-National Party have come into government, there has been a 221 per cent increase in the number of children using outside school hours care. There has been a huge increase happening under the policies of this government. As it stands now in outside school hours care—as is the case in family day care for this year—places are going to be reallocated amongst those services that may not have been using them, and we are doing that. When it comes to outside school hours care, part of the issue is funding but the other part is ensuring that there are adequate regulations and licensing at state and territory level. The responsibility, particularly for regulation, does rest with the states. I believe that this is a real issue because of the quality standard. They recognise that—that is why we have deferred the accreditation process for outside school hours care until next year.

—If you want to listen, another interesting fact is that it has increased substantially: $10 million in 1997 to over $22 million in the past financial year. There has been a cap placed on that, as we look at that particular system to see how we can best assist those 4,400 children currently funded who have disabilities. I will be looking at a whole range of issues within child care to best try and respond to the changing demands that we have in assisting families meet work and family responsibilities, particularly with the issue of outside school hours care.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Family and Community Services: Child Care</title>,Questions Without Notice,8,1,answer
"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2002-08-26,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	recognises the physical, emotional and psychological damage caused by child sexual abuse;
(2)	recognises that in every state in Australia adults who have sexual relations with teenagers under the age of 16 are committing a criminal offence, and there are no excuses for this behaviour;
(3)	commits itself to providing a safe environment for every child in Australia;
(4)	commits itself to playing a role in ending sexual abuse of children overseas; and
(5)	commits itself to acknowledging and seeking to mend the harm done to victims of child sexual abuse.
When I first sought to have this issue debated in private members' business, we were in the midst of a crisis of confidence in our Governor-General. He had clearly shown signs that he had no understanding of the nature of child sexual abuse in the comments he made about a priest's relationship with an under-age girl. The Prime Minister's support of the Governor-General brought into question his own understanding of child sexual abuse. The support for the Governor-General was, of course, in contrast to the quick condemnation of a High Court judge against whom Senator Heffernan made allegations which were later found to be false. It seemed at the time that the Prime Minister had fallen into the trap that many Australians also fall into, where they think it is more likely that child sexual abuse is being committed by homosexual men and creepy-looking strangers—the truth, of course, is much more frightening.
In November 1995, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority inquired into organised criminal paedophile activity. The committee stated:
There has been a widespread reluctance in Australia to accept the reality that most child abuse is committed by a close relative or person well known to the victim. The tendency has been either to deny that much abuse occurs or to blame strangers and attach disproportionate importance and credence to claims, often sensationalised by the media, about shadowy paedophile organisations and networks.
Now we have another serious accusation. The accused is a prominent person, who is, of course, entitled to a presumption of innocence, but the Prime Minister's rush to defend Archbishop Pell has been inappropriate in the extreme. A proper investigation, preferably conducted by the police, but, if not, by a trusted person independent from the church hierarchy, is necessary and will occur. To say that there is no merit in the case because of the delay in reporting, fundamentally misunderstands the nature of child sexual abuse and may discourage victims from coming forward in the future. The message is that, if a perpetrator is a respected member of the community, you will never be believed.
Most victims never report abuse. J.M. Fleming reported, in the Medical Journal of Australia in 1997, that only 10 per cent of victims reported the abuse to the police, a doctor or other agency such as a sexual assault service. The fact that there are usually no witnesses is one big reason for not reporting; victims feel they will not be believed. Of course, this is typical of the nature of this crime: it is most likely to occur in secret, usually in the home of the offender. Long delays before reporting are also symptomatic of child sexual assault. Children do not feel confident that what happened to them was wrong and not their fault until they reach adulthood. Abusers often threaten or bribe children to prevent disclosure. 
The bias in our legal system has always been towards protecting the accused, and quite properly so, but this can be done without assuming the evidence of victims is fabricated. Victims may also feel that, even if they took legal action, the result would likely not be a conviction. Research by Cossins from 1991 to 1996 shows that conviction rates for cases involving child sexual assault are much lower than conviction rates for all other crimes combined—and that included crimes that are difficult to prove, such as allegations of assault by police.
Before the age of consent was raised from 12 to 16 years in Australia in the early 19th century, it was normal sexual practice for some Australian men to have sex with child prostitutes as young as eight or nine. Children who were abused were often accused of fabricating stories or of just being child prostitutes who were not paid for their services. This culture of assuming that children lie easily in these cases still has credence with many people. The truth is that children are more likely to cover up abuse than to invent it. Often this is because perpetrators, if not family members, spend a lot of time building a relationship with a child and his or her family before abuse occurs. Children are groomed for abuse. Perpetrators are usually known to the victim; in fact, they are usually family members. In 93 per cent of cases in New South Wales, family members, friends or neighbours were perpetrators. What is really shocking is that, in 57 per cent of cases, the perpetrator is a natural parent of the child. Three times as many girls as boys are abused. These figures come from Child Protection Australia 1999-2000, which was produced by the Australian Institute for Health and Welfare.
We need to ensure that every Australian child is safe in his or her home. We need to teach protective behaviours to children as part of a whole program of self-esteem and confidence building that makes children aware that behaviour that makes them feel uncomfortable need not be tolerated. `Stranger danger' warnings are just part of teaching children how to protect themselves. We need to strengthen families before abuse starts—not cut, as this government has, $16½ million from the stronger families program. We need to make court procedures bearable for children. I recognise and applaud recent measures to allow children to give evidence on closed-circuit TV, but we also need to change judicial practice so that warnings against convicting on the basis of uncorroborated evidence do not prejudice juries against convictions. These warnings are no longer mandatory but they are common practice in courts, and, where they are given, juries are less likely to convict.
We need to ensure that mandatory reporting is followed up properly and that government agencies are resourced to do their jobs and to do them effectively. We need to continue community education campaigns that describe how wrong child sexual abuse is and what to do if you are a victim or if you suspect a child of being a victim. These campaigns must be culturally appropriate. We need to jail perpetrators, and we need to jail them for a long time—not as a punishment and not as a warning, but to keep them away from other children. We know that the rates of recidivism for sexual offenders, particularly child sex offenders, are high. The statistics vary about how high they might be, but the offenders need to be kept away from other potential victims. We can have a look at perpetrator programs and whether they are effective, but certainly not at the expense of counselling and other support offered to victims of child sexual abuse. Any programs need to be premised on the fact that child sexual abuse is a crime. 
While child sexual abuse happens in all communities and in all socioeconomic groups, we also need to be honest and acknowledge that some communities face worse problems than others and that those communities need extra help to find their own solutions for the long term but, meanwhile, their children must be protected from abuse that might occur today or tomorrow. 
The recent Gordon inquiry in Western Australia—triggered by the coronial inquest into the death of 15-year-old Susan Taylor—which was followed by allegations of endemic abuse of children in one particular Aboriginal community in Perth, went to some of the issues involved. Susan Taylor, at 15 years of age, took her own life in 1999, just weeks after disclosing to her former case manager that she had endured a life of sexual abuse. The Gordon inquiry found significant failures of government departments to coordinate, plan and deliver services. It found terrible stories of sexual abuse and heavy solvent use amongst Aboriginal teenagers, that Aboriginal children are seven times more likely than non-Aboriginal children to be abused, and that 80 per cent of Aboriginal girls in the juvenile justice system reported having been sexually abused. The inquiry made 197 recommendations—which, obviously, I cannot cover today—including a massive overhaul of health and welfare services that deal with child sexual abuse, mandatory reporting of children under the age of 13 with sexually transmitted diseases, and, in specific reference to the community in question, that there be formal negotiations between the community leaders to ensure welfare workers have access to these children.
In response to the Fitzgerald report on communities in Cape York, which found that Indigenous children were up to four times as likely to suffer from abuse than non-Aboriginal children, Boni Robertson, who had completed an early, very important work on extensive violence and abuse in Aboriginal communities, said:
We've been researched and inquiried out. We need to get beyond the inquiry stage now and do something about it.
She was further quoted last week after the rape of a two-year-old girl in Northern Queensland. Ms Robertson said:
Our people need to be a lot more honest about the prevalence of sexual abuse. Until we're honest about this and expose offenders, our children will always be vulnerable to sexual abuse. 
We need, as a community, to implement some of the recommendations that have come out of these reports and not talk. We need to resource Aboriginal women to stop the abuse in their communities, but we also have to accept that jail must be an end result for people who are involved in the sexual abuse of children. I did want to make some comments about Australia's role in protecting children overseas from child sexual abuse, but I notice I have run out of time. I hope I will have an opportunity to do that at another stage.

"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,2002-08-26,"—I am happy to speak in support of the motion by the member for Sydney on child sexual abuse and welcome her initiative in bringing this matter to the House. I believe it is one of the most significant issues that confronts today's society. It has been a long-running issue and, in the current environment where more and more examples of this come to light, it is appropriate that we consider ways in which we can address the problem. There is increasing public focus on this issue and a lot of media interest in it. Most importantly, we should address some of the causation behind it and some of the ways in which we can minimise the damage. The existence of sexual abuse of children is a serious indictment of our society. It is also one of the most appalling crimes that any of us can imagine. We need serious measures to address this issue.
There is no doubt about the long-term damage caused by sexual abuse—innocence is lost, trust is compromised and families are destroyed. The victims of child sexual abuse usually deal with emotional upheaval for the majority of their lives. Many suffer emotional breakdown to the point where they become depressed, suffer low self-esteem, have an inability to sustain a loving relationship with family members and others. Some turn to alcohol or drug abuse, some turn to prostitution. There is a statistic that shows that 80 per cent of prostitutes have suffered some sort of sexual abuse as a child.
There are a number of significant measures needed to address this issue. Mandatory reporting has been in existence for a number of years and has done much to assist the situation and needs to be upheld. Currently, those who work in this area comment on the limited resources available from various departments of community services around Australia. We need to ensure that we have appropriate resources in order to attack the problem, to follow up leads and to investigate where complaints have been made. I noticed last night on the evening news that the Victorian minister for social welfare was saying that he would like to see introduced a national register of paedophiles. That is something which we should seriously look at, not so much as to invade people's privacy but, because of the recidivism rate of these people, it is important that we know where they are to prevent further occurrences of child abuse occurring.
I was involved in a Kairos program a couple of months ago in Long Bay jail, which lasted 3½ days. A significant number of people were there because of paedophilia. Working in this environment was a challenge but one of the most disturbing things, in listening to their stories, was the incidence of people who had themselves been abused as children—almost universal. Because of that, it is important to break the pattern. There is a number of programs that exist for treatment of those who have this serious addiction. The prison has instituted one which goes on for 12 months with psychologists. The experience of Kairos programs in US prisons shows that the recidivism rate drops dramatically after having been through these programs. They are not a panacea but they do seem to work because people can find a recurring sense of self-esteem and understanding of the importance of working through it. I commend this program.
Kairos has been instituted in the New South Wales prison system and also in Victoria but is yet to go nationwide. I understand one is about to commence in South Australia. Kairos programs have a wide application. At the program I was involved in, a significant number of the people had been convicted of paedophile offences. It was interesting to see the extent to which their lives had been shattered. For those who had been married, their marriages had collapsed, they had no contact with their children, no contact with their parents, they had lost their businesses, their jobs and their self-esteem. For most of them, it all began when they were six, seven, eight or nine, when as children they were abused. Breaking that pattern is a real challenge for us all.
There is also the question the member for Sydney was planning to speak about—protecting children outside Australia. It is a fact that all Australians should be deeply disturbed by the fact that there are literally hundreds of Australians travelling around South-East Asia on so-called `child sex tours'. The extent to which this practice is supported by desperately poor families looking to make money in countries like Cambodia and Thailand was graphically illustrated by an article in a recent weekend edition of the Sydney Morning Herald. Despite this scourge, Australia has led international efforts to combat child sex tourism, including by the enactment in 1994 of child sex tourism provisions in the Commonwealth Crimes Act 1914. Ten Australians have been successfully prosecuted under this act.
The government has taken action in this area by making it a criminal offence under Australian law to have sex with children, whether the act occurs in Australia or overseas. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is working with the Attorney-General's Department and the Australian Federal Police to identify how we can use the DFAT network better to help combat child sex tourism. Australia funds programs to strengthen institutional and legal capacity in the region to fight child sex, including funding support of $350,000 for Child Wise ECPAT—a leading international non-government organisation combating child sex tourism—for its regional child abuse prevention program. 
This is a particularly challenging issue. It is an issue that affects, as the member for Sydney has said, all levels of the community and it reaches into all strata. We are confronted by this issue amongst not only some Catholic priests—as I discovered in Long Bay—but also people you know. I was actually confronted by somebody I went to school with. It is not something that is unique—that these are different people; that you have never met them. It is something that permeates right through our community. Unless we address the issue of child sexual abuse and take the significant steps that have been outlined by the member for Sydney and by officials and experts in this area, we will see this continuing pattern recurring in the future of young lives being ruined, their whole self-confidence being shattered, their trust in adults being totally torn apart, their belief in relationships and what they can mean being shattered, and their ability to maintain long-term relationships being put to straining point. Of course, we see this pattern in people who take the ultimate action—that is, suicide. 
Child sexual abuse leads to a whole permeation of aberrant behaviour. Some people are affected by drug abuse, others turn to prostitution and some to crime. My wife has been involved in the Mulawa program in Sydney. At the closing service for Mulawa, people shared stories from their own backgrounds. These people were not paedophiles; they were young women who had entered a life of crime. They told of how they were abused—again, at young ages. The effect on our society is dramatic and significant and it tears people apart. We certainly need to do something about it. I support the motion moved by the member for Sydney today.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Child Sexual Abuse</title>,Private Members' Business,10,1,speech
"King, Catherine, MP",ALP,2002-08-26,"—I rise to give my strongest possible support to the motion on child sexual abuse before us today. The damage done to individuals, families and communities through the perpetration of child sexual abuse is irreparable. Child sexual abuse has been brought to the front of our thinking of late with high profile cases, but child sexual abuse has been occurring in our community for a long time. My first job after graduating as a social worker was heading up a unit that worked with young people who were at risk and coming into contact with the juvenile justice system. They were kids on probation and parole from youth training centres. I am not exaggerating when I say that at least 95 per cent of the cases that I worked with over a period of five years involved sexual abuse. Their abusers came from all walks of life, from all socioeconomic groups. In the main, they were family members, friends of the family, neighbours and people placed in positions of care over them. Much of the abuse had occurred over a long period of time.
When you talk to adult survivors of child abuse, they tell you of the fear, shame and sense of powerlessness that the abuse has caused. They tell you that their lives have never been the same. They tell you of the sense of loss and grief they feel for what their lives would have been if the abuse had not occurred. These adults are not just anonymous statistics; they are everywhere in our community. They often tried to report the abuse before, but were not believed. Many of them work with us, are members of our families, play sport with us or live next door. Some of them could even be members of this House. Many of them are still silent. What message do you think the Prime Minister's statement regarding the allegations against Dr Pell sent to those who might want to come forward and report child sexual abuse? It sent a message that if you speak out you will not be believed.
It seems to me that, given the daily revelations of child sexual abuse and the damage that it has caused countless lives, we have to have a national response to the issue. The establishment of a national child and youth commissioner is long overdue. Children and young people must have an advocate at the highest level. Labor has outlined the roles a national youth commissioner should play, and these include developing mechanisms to assist the coordination of best practice service models for children and youth programs, including protocols for dealing with child abuse complaints. 
The report on child protection 2000-01 clearly shows that we are failing our children in the prevention of child abuse and neglect. The government's focus on standardising mandatory reporting is not enough—it is after the event and is not going to stop child abuse. We have an obligation to focus on preventing child abuse and neglect happening in the first place. We need to understand and address the complex causal factors and scrutinise the adequacy of current family support programs, not cut them. We need to have in place a system that insists on stringent checks of people who have contact with children and are placed in positions of authority over them. We need better education, training and support for people who are at the point of receiving an allegation. We need to stop seeing family support programs, such as the provision of child care, income support and family relationship counselling, as somehow not the main game for the federal government. We also need to do more to stop the sexual abuse of children overseas, particularly when the perpetrators are our own citizens. We desperately need a national commissioner for children and youth to put the issue of the protection of children into the national spotlight.
I had the opportunity to talk to Moira Rayner, Victoria's previous sex discrimination commissioner, before she took up the post of children's commissioner in the United Kingdom. I asked her why she decided to take the job, and she said something along the lines of, `I knew the government was serious about their commitment to children when I turned up for my interview and there was not an adult in sight. The kids ran the interview process, and they made the decision. How could I refuse the job when children had selected me?' I think that governments that put that much power in the hands of children make a pretty powerful statement. If we were to send such a statement, and if the government were to endorse Labor's initiative to have a national children's commissioner, it would go a long way towards preventing child sexual abuse and giving children a voice in this parliament and in the community.

"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2002-08-26,"—It is good to be associated with the remarks and the general spirit that flow in this House towards the victims of child sexual abuse. I congratulate the member for Sydney on her initiative in bringing together this motion on child sexual abuse and for putting on the record this chamber's position. Robert Browning, the English poet, wrote in one of his poems:
... go practise if you please with men and women: leave a child alone for Christ's particular love's sake!
I thought that was quite apt for our discussion here today. Child sexual abuse is an absolute blight not only on Australian society but on civilised societies worldwide. Throughout the world, we are experiencing so many rapid advances in medicine, education and technology, yet we allow so many of the vulnerable to be violated. So many of our children, who wear the warm shroud of innocence on their shoulders, have that torn away from them, more often than not by someone whom they are close to, in whom they have established a trust and upon whom they would have thought they could rely.
I have always considered child sexual abuse to be an abhorrent crime, and the lead-up to this debate—which is not a debate in the true sense of the word—encouraged me to research some of the statistics on child sexual abuse so I was better informed and more able to make comment in this chamber. I was most certainly shocked by the ugly scar that the statistics represent for Australian society and for the world. What is child sexual abuse? What is child abuse? These are important questions. I put them on the record so that we know some of the benchmarks when we assess the statistics as well as what constitutes abuse. In most instances, across various jurisdictions, abuse is described as any action or a lack thereof that has a detrimental effect of a significant nature on a child's physical, psychological or emotional health and development. Child sexual abuse is an extension of this definition and incorporates abuse of a sexual nature, such as fondling, exhibitionism, intercourse, incest and child pornography.
The statistics in the report into organised criminal paedophile activity of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority were of great concern to me. The report said:
Of the 2,873 substantiated cases of child sexual abuse reported—
in the year prior to this committee's report—
the parent (natural, adoptive, step, de facto or foster) was believed responsible in 34.6 per cent of the cases and a guardian in two cases. A sibling or other relative was believed responsible in a further 22.8 per cent of the cases, and a friend or neighbour in 27.6 per cent of cases. 
It was only in 14.9 per cent of cases that the person was neither a relative, guardian, friend or neighbour. Although I am not one to quote Hillary Clinton often, she said, `There is no such thing as other people's children.' Members of society have a responsibility to nurture and protect the young. We no longer can shy away from our responsibilities. We should report those whom we believe may be abusing children and indeed those whom we believe may be sexually abusing children. According to the reports, in virtually all instances it is someone who is known to the child who is most likely to violate that child's innocence. 
I am pleased to report that the government, over the past six years, has substantially increased expenditure in tackling this problem. In 1996 we expended approximately $5.5 billion on the justice program, which incorporates measures to stop this type of activity. This has increased now under the federal government by 8.4 per cent to the most recent year. None of these efforts will be fruitful, however, if there is not goodwill in the community to prevent this abhorrent abuse. I urge all members to come together in the spirit of this motion and to make sure that we are vigilant always.

"Jackson, Sharryn, MP",ALP,2002-08-26,"—I wish to raise an important matter today that ultimately threatens the viability of the Swan and Canning rivers and their environs in the Perth metropolitan area. I have previously told the House about the magnificent work being done by community land care and natural resource management groups in the Swan region. The Swan region includes my electorate of Hasluck, as well as the electorates of Canning, Tangney and Pearce in the Perth metropolitan and peri-urban areas. There are 17 catchment groups and over 200 other environmental groups operating in the region. They represent many thousands of community volunteers. I am amazed at and thankful for the ability of these groups and their coordinators to attract volunteers from the community to become involved in land care activities in the region. I am not aware of any other program or project that has captured the energy or the hearts and minds of so many volunteers, and I have been particularly privileged to visit many of the projects that have been undertaken by these groups in my electorate. The reason I rise to speak today is the fear that those groups and I share that the funding they receive for the continued coordination of their projects within the electorate of Hasluck is at risk.
I would like to take some time to cover the information that I have received. Firstly, in answer to a dorothy dix question last week, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry acknowledged the work of these very same volunteers and commented about community Landcare projects. Of course, it was National Landcare Week, and perhaps that is why he chose not to reveal what appears to be the truth about the current uncertainty of NHT extension funding to urban community Landcare and natural resource management groups. These groups receive funding for their projects from a variety of sources: the private sector, federal, state and local governments, as well as the community itself. However, their major source of funding, particularly that which resources the employment of the 11 community Landcare coordinators currently employed in the Swan region, comes from the Natural Heritage Trust. Their funding ceases in September—just next week.
The Natural Heritage Trust was heralded by this government as a billion-dollar investment over five years—approximately $200 million per annum. In recent budget papers the figure of $250 million was put forward, allegedly for NHT funding. That is not the only reference we have had to this funding. Indeed, on 14 May 2002 a joint press release was made by the two ministers who have some responsibility for NHT funding—the Minister for the Environment and Heritage and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. In that press release, Dr Kemp tells us:
At least $350 million of the new Trust funding will be spent directly on measures to improve water quality. For example, Rivercare projects will support improved land and water practices that affect the health of our rivers. Coastcare and Rivercare funding will also target coastal and urban water quality hot spots such as the Parramatta River, Moreton Bay, Port Adelaide, the Derwent Estuary, Port Phillip Bay, the Cooks and Georges Rivers and—
importantly, I might add—
the Swan/Canning Rivers.
That is the very area that I am talking about today.
As I said earlier, the minister referred to the funding for NHT in answer to a question he gave last week. He claimed that this government had made a $2.5 billion commitment to the Natural Heritage Trust. With these figures of $250 million, $2.5 billion and $350 million being thrown around, you can imagine my surprise when I heard the figures that community Landcare groups in my electorate have been advised of by senior bureaucrats responsible for NHT funding. They have been told by those bureaucrats that much less money will be made available than has been publicly indicated by the government. Current estimates from these friendly visiting bureaucrats indicate that in truth the government is considering making only between $50 million and $100 million available in this interim year. Remember that the government has promised at least between $200 million and $250 million, depending on which press release you read or which minister you are talking to—substantially less than what has been promised.
Compounding this problem are the current guidelines for the coordination and facilitation stream for the transitional year of the NHT, which I might say is the source of the funding for the 11 community coordinator positions in the Swan region. The guidelines state that priority will be for positions that provide support for rural community groups engaged in Landcare and sustainable agricultural activities. I do not denigrate the need for funding to be directed to rural communities for Landcare projects—quite the contrary. However, as Pat Hart, who is the chairperson of the Canning Catchment Co-ordinating Group in my electorate, said to me in her letter: 
We also have grave concerns at the proposed reduction in funding ... for urban Landcare groups. We acknowledge the major issue with salinity in our rural areas and recognise the urgency. We also recognise the huge environmental problems facing the Swan/Canning catchments where we have 1.3 million people located on a relatively small area. A very fragile, ancient landscape that has major environmental problems. In the Canning Catchment we have seen major blue/green algae outbreaks, wetland destruction on a major scale and severe dieback impact on bushland. The Canning River identified as the worst weed affected river in the State with severe loss of aquatic species. The Canning/Wungong/Southern Rivers suffering severe silting and loss of natural flow. There are grave concerns also by catchment coordinators with their future positions ... The incredible impact of the educational and awareness programs implemented by these groups should not be underestimated. The continuation of these programs is critical to ensure real positive environmental changes. To take away these programs will set the catchment back years and will mean a real financial loss through the work already put into their management. Outstanding achievements are, and have occurred through Urban Catchment Groups.
That is why I rise today, and those are the issues that I particularly want to put on the record about this Natural Heritage Trust funding. It is time, I think—and I call on the government—to be honest about the situation for NHT funding for urban Landcare groups.
What are the arrangements for these programs in capital cities and large regional centres in other parts of Australia? Is Western Australia being treated in a less equitable manner than other states? And what has the government got to say about the so-called partnership between government and the community in natural resource management? What value is a partnership when the federal government feel that they can walk away with no regard for or commitment to projects well under way? Are they expecting that the costs for these projects will be picked up either by state governments or by local governments and the community itself? How ironic that we have this government holding an inquiry into state government allegedly cost shifting to local government when here is a classic example of the federal government doing the same thing. How dare they make public calls for priority projects under new arrangements and let the bureaucrats go out there and tell people that there will not be enough money to fund them. How credible can a government be that calls publicly for projects and yet does not or will not make the commitment to fund them? And, if there are funds made available through the Envirofund stream, what community groups are going to be left to implement them?
The work of the community—who have contributed, as I have said, many thousands of voluntary hours over seven years, having been supported by government projects—is likely to be wasted if their funding is not continued. It also runs contrary to the kinds of commitments that have been made to these groups by various ministers, most recently in correspondence in late May, where, in a letter to the Chairperson of the Swan Catchment Council, Mr Michael Grasby, Minister David Kemp said:
Mr Truss and I understand your views on the importance of urban Landcare projects and wish to emphasise that the government is committed to ensuring that these projects continue to be supported under the extension of the trust.
If that is the case, where is the funding? I would say that the overall administration of the transition from NHT to the Natural Heritage Trust extension has been lacking in leadership and direction and, frankly, at a policy level, is downright inept. I urge the government to support the Swan Canning catchment region and their urban Landcare coordinators.",REPS,<title>GRIEVANCE DEBATE</title>,<title>Hasluck Electorate: Natural Heritage Trust Funding</title>,Grievance Debate,11,1,speech
"Hull, Kay, MP",NP,2002-08-26,"—I rise to speak in support of the Criminal Code Amendment (Espionage and Related Offences) Bill 2002 because of the great importance of national security and defence for Australia. In this changing world, Australia needs to be alert to the fact that our security and defence can be compromised and, unless we take steps to prevent this occurring, this will be an ongoing position. This bill will ensure there are processes in place to deter people from passing on classified information belonging to Australia. Due to advances in modern technology that allow us to communicate with people around the globe, thereby making the accessing and passing on of highly classified information more difficult to trace, we are now living in a smaller world than our parents and grandparents did. One of our roles as a government is to keep abreast of these changes, ensuring that they are reflected in legislation and that we remain one step ahead of those people who would choose to threaten our security.
Australia has a long and proud history of strong defence and security. This bill enables Australia to continue that history by ensuring that our legislation keeps pace with the rest of the world and with the criminals who seek to threaten the security and defence of our country. The main effect of the bill is to establish new offences dealing with the protection of security and defence under the Criminal Code Act 1995, strengthening Australia's espionage laws in a number of ways. This legislation is aimed at protecting Australian national security. The amendments contained in the bill make it clear that the espionage offences are designed to capture actions that genuinely prejudice or threaten the security and defence of Australia or any country we share sensitive information with.
The coalition government undertook a review of Australian espionage laws after the 1999 arrest in the United States of a former Defence Intelligence Organisation officer and Australian citizen for attempted espionage. He was arrested and charged with a number of offences, including the unauthorised disclosure of United States intelligence material. This incident affirmed the government's commitment to tightening Australia's security, and a review of security procedures was commissioned. This legislation has evolved as a result of the review which was carried out by Bill Blick in 2000.
The incident in the United States and the review by Mr Blick highlighted the need for Australia to strengthen its espionage laws and impose tougher penalties on those who break such laws. The changes to the legislation, which will increase the maximum imprisonment penalty, will send a clear message that Australia will not tolerate any compromise of our national security. Australia's national security is of the utmost importance, and this government will not tolerate Australian interests being compromised, either here or abroad. As a government, we need to ensure that there are systems and laws in place to protect information used by Australian personnel serving overseas, whether as part of the defence forces or as embassy staff. We need to establish an effective legal framework that both deters people who intend to betray Australia's security interests and punishes them if they carry out that intention.
By referring to conduct that may prejudice Australia's security and defence, rather than its safety and defence, Australia's espionage laws will be strengthened in a number of ways. The change to the terminology reflects the modern intelligence environment. The term `security' is intended to catch information about the operations, capabilities and technologies, methods and sources of Australian intelligence and security agencies; the term `safety' is unlikely to include such information. Identifying a person committing an act of espionage is often an impossible task, without good resources and the latest technology. By amending the current legislation, we can ensure staff within our security agencies can keep ahead of criminals and be properly equipped to identify and target those choosing to commit espionage and threaten Australia's domestic security.
The government is committed to protecting national security and to stopping those who threaten Australia's interests. In the government's 2002-03 budget, announced in May, we outlined measures to upgrade our domestic security, secure our borders and strengthen our defence forces. This government announced the largest and most comprehensive upgrade of our defence capabilities made by any Australian government in more than 25 years. Under the plan set out in the white paper, an additional $1 billion was included in the 2002-03 Defence budget. We also added to that program to fund the deployment of Australian troops in the war against terrorism. The events of September 11 made us realise that our domestic security can be threatened. Our responsibility as a government is to defend our citizens and our national security interests. The 2002-03 budget allocated an additional $1.3 billion over five years to upgrade security within Australia. The budget provided an extra $539 million to the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Protective Service and Australian intelligence agencies, to assist them in identifying potential security threats. There will be enhanced cooperation with overseas law enforcement agencies and improvements in screening arriving and departing international passengers. The government will also be improving the secure communication system of the Department of Defence and taking measures to protect our critical information infrastructure from attack.
The main effect of the bill is to establish new offences dealing with the protection of security and defence. The legislation states that a person's action must result in, or be likely to result in, the information being disclosed to another country or to a foreign organisation or to a person acting on behalf of such a country or organisation. The type of activity that may constitute espionage has been expanded to move into line with espionage activity. This means a person may be guilty of an espionage offence if they disclose information concerning Australia's security or defence, intending to prejudice the Commonwealth's security or defence. An individual could also be guilty of an offence if they disclose information concerning the Commonwealth's security or defence, without authorisation, to advantage the security or defence of another country. Amendments included in the legislation will also protect foreign sourced information belonging to Australia. This means information held at Australian embassies throughout the world is protected by this legislation, ensuring Australian interests are protected outside our borders.
The legislation sets out four espionage offences. The maximum penalty for each type of espionage offence is 25 years imprisonment. All four offences relate to the unlawful use or disclosure of information concerning the Commonwealth's security or defence, or information concerning the security of another country that has been or is in the possession or control of Australia. These provisions provide protection to information generated by Australia as well as information generated by other countries that is in Australia's possession or control. The offence applies whether or not the conduct constituting the alleged offence occurs in Australia and whether or not a result of the conduct constituting the alleged offence occurs here. This means the espionage offences provisions in this bill will potentially apply to all possible circumstances within and outside Australia where espionage might threaten Australian interests. 
The bill also outlines and covers initiation of prosecutions, holding hearings in camera and forfeiture of articles. Safeguards will apply in the legislation to ensure that legitimate transfers of information can continue, including information passed on to journalists in the interests of the public. Concerns were raised in the media that this legislation would seek to prevent public discussion. This is not true. This government welcomes public discussion, and this legislation has been introduced to protect Australian security interests, domestically and internationally. The legislation is not aimed at hampering or stopping public discussion, and communications to journalists are not considered an offence, unless they themselves are spies.
One of the issues addressed by the amendments is that of penalties for espionage offences. The penalties currently in place are inadequate when dealing with national security crimes. Compared to penalties for other serious crimes like people-smuggling and drug trafficking, those for espionage crimes, which threaten each citizen of Australia, are grossly inadequate. This is what the legislation aims to address. An act of espionage has the potential to place the lives of individuals and the security of the nation in jeopardy. A threat to or breach of domestic security strikes fear into the heart of every Australian. Through this legislation we aim to protect the citizens of Australia and ensure those given the responsibility of protecting our national security interests are fully equipped to do so, with adequate laws in place.
This bill amends the Criminal Code Act 1995 to increase the maximum penalty for the most serious cases of espionage from seven years to 25 years imprisonment. This government considers seven years imprisonment to be a grossly inadequate punishment for the more serious acts of espionage during peace. The proposed offences are consistent with equivalent provisions in the United States, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Canada. The bill also provides that bail decisions for those charged with espionage offences should only be made by Supreme Court judges. In moving into line with other developed countries and their penalties for these offences, Australia is working towards creating a unified stand, informing criminals that we will not tolerate threats to domestic and international security.
In preparing this bill the government have considered technological advances in information management and communications, as well as international standards, ensuring the legislation reflects the advances in technology and acknowledging the role it plays in the crime of espionage. By enacting this legislation Australia can offer greater assurances to our information exchange partners that, when they provide information to us in confidence, we will protect that information in the same way that we protect our own sensitive information. Penalties in comparable countries for equivalent offences range from the death penalty in the United States to 14 years imprisonment in the UK, Canada and New Zealand. The espionage offences included under the act are not intended to capture situations where information is communicated as part of an authorised information exchange arrangement between Australia and our allies.
The bill will also further support the process of bringing cases of espionage to trial. In the interests of national security, the presiding judge in a case involving an individual charged with espionage offences retains the discretion to decide whether court proceedings remain open or are closed in the interests of Australia's security or defence. This is aimed at protecting Australian security interests at all times.
After events such as September 11, which forced Australia and many nations around the world to look closer at domestic security and defence, we as a nation need to be alert at all times to the potential risks that exist should security information be sold and fall into the wrong hands. This government cannot afford to be complacent, and we certainly are not doing so. We can no longer believe that, simply because we are located away from the world's hotspots and have not yet been a target, we can escape the very real threats of espionage. This legislation recognises the need for Australia to remain abreast of changes in world security and the threats which exist for all countries.
Debate often rages about so many important issues in our society—health, education, trade, international relations—but what of security and defence? I happen to believe that security and defence are among the most important issues for all Australians. Since September 11, security and defence have become important issues, not only for the United States but for Australia, for this government and for the rest of the developed world. Australia has not been physically threatened since World War II; as a government and a nation, we need to ensure this good record continues. Highly sensitive government information falling into the wrong hands is a frightening thought, but it is something we must all think about and something we must endeavour to protect against. I commend the minister for this bill and I commend the bill to the House, in the interests of Australia's future.",REPS,<title>CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT (ESPIONAGE AND RELATED OFFENCES) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Williams, Daryl, MP",LP,2002-08-26,"—in reply—I would like to thank those members who have participated in the debate on the Criminal Code Amendment (Espionage and Related Offences) Bill 2002. There are a number—the members for Banks, Cook, Watson, Moncrieff, Sydney, Curtin, New England, Corangamite and Lingiari, and ultimately I particularly thank the member for Riverina for her considered contribution. Members of the opposition raised a number of issues in this debate that had nothing to do with the bill before the House. Of course that has never been done before! I can only assume that these issues were raised in the absence of any objection to the bill itself. Indeed, I am pleased that all members of the opposition who spoke on the bill expressed their endorsement of it, but I do wish to respond to a number of the points raised. 
The members for Banks, Watson and Lingiari expressed concerns about the agreement between Australia and the United States of America concerning security measures for the reciprocal protection of classified information. This is an agreement signed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Ambassador Schieffer on 25 June this year. The members opposite claimed that the implication of the agreement was that it would hinder the access of elected representatives to classified information or that elected representatives would need to be subjected to a personal security clearance. This is simply not the case. The agreement will not in any way prejudice the existing procedures for access to classified information by parliamentary representatives. The issue was specifically considered at the time of the signing of the agreement. The continuation of the current practice in relation to parliamentary representatives was expressly confirmed in an exchange of letters signed by both parties at the same time as the treaty. The letter relevantly stated:
In respect of the requirement for security clearances in the agreement, the parties acknowledge the special status of elected representatives at the federal level and confirm their intention to continue to apply their current practices to them.
Information as to this exchange of letters was readily obtainable from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I would invite the members opposite to do their homework before wasting time on spurious issues that have nothing to do with the bill. The new agreement merely updates, simplifies and strengthens a framework for the bilateral exchange of classified information which has been in place and has worked well since 1962. It does not change domestic law or policy.
I also note that this particular agreement is scheduled to be tabled in parliament on 27 August—tomorrow—and will be reviewed by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties before any action is taken to bring it into force. A national interest analysis summarising the agreement will be circulated when the agreement is tabled. I might remind the member for Banks that it was the Howard government that introduced the JSCOT, the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, as part of the Howard government's landmark reforms of Australia's treaty making processes in May 1996. The result of those reforms is a more transparent process which gives Australians unparalleled input and an opportunity to understand the work of governments in making new international laws.
The Criminal Code Amendment (Espionage and Related Offences) Bill 2002 establishes an effective legal framework to both deter and punish people who intend to betray Australia's security interests. As a result of this bill, we will have one of the tightest, strongest pieces of legislation to protect sensitive information among our information exchange partners. The end of the Cold War did not herald the end of espionage. In fact, the rapid development in technology and the increased connection between nations mean that information warfare is a boom industry. There remain an extraordinary number of people and organisations who seek to trade in information, particularly sensitive security and defence information, and unfortunately there are weak people who are prepared to betray Australia's interests and compromise Australia's security by selling sensitive information with which they have been entrusted.
This bill will strengthen Australia's espionage laws in a number of ways. The type of activity that may constitute espionage has been expanded. A person may be guilty of an espionage offence if he or she discloses information concerning the Commonwealth's security or defence, intending to prejudice the Commonwealth's security or defence. A person may also be guilty of an offence if he or she discloses information concerning the Commonwealth's security or defence without authorisation, to advantage the security or defence of another country. Security or defence is defined in the bill so as to afford protection to a range of material that may not be protected under current laws. In particular, the term will include the operations, capabilities and technologies of and methods and sources used by our intelligence and security agencies.
Importantly, the new offences will also protect foreign sourced information belonging to Australia. As a result, we can offer greater assurances to our information exchange partners that, when they provide information to us in confidence, we will protect that information in the same way that we protect our own sensitive information. A person who compromises foreign information in our possession will face the same penalty as a person who compromises Australian generated information. That penalty will reflect the seriousness of the offence. As a result of this bill, the maximum penalty for a person convicted of espionage will be 25 years imprisonment.
In addition to strengthening the offence provisions, the bill includes provisions that further support the process of bringing cases of espionage to trial. The most important measure in this regard is to guarantee that only a judge of a state or territory supreme court will decide the question of bail. In addition, I am advised that the Australian Federal Police Commissioner intends to issue an order to all members of the AFP that, as a general policy, bail should be opposed in espionage cases. This will ensure that, wherever possible, those alleged to have committed espionage will not be able to escape the law.
The government amendments to the bill respond to recommendations made by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. On introduction, the government referred the bill to the committee for inquiry and report before progressing to the Senate. The committee made five recommendations, including that the bill progress, subject to the other four recommendations. The government has accepted and given effect to the Senate committee's recommendations in the amendments. 
I would like to take the opportunity to set the record straight on another issue that has been raised during public and parliamentary scrutiny of the bill. When I originally introduced the bill into the House on 27 September 2001, the bill contained provisions dealing with official secrets. It was not debated and lapsed when the parliament dissolved for the November 2001 federal election. When I introduced the bill into the House again on 13 March 2002, the official secrets provisions were not included in the bill. The official secrets provisions were designed to replicate existing provisions in the Crimes Act in more modern language, consistent with the Criminal Code. Those provisions were the focus of considerable media attention and were the subject of a considered misinformation campaign. The media suggested that the provisions were designed to limit the freedom of the press and would have prevented the reporting of government activities. The media scare campaign suggested that the government was conspiring to plug leaks. This campaign was alluded to by the member for Banks and these misguided claims were repeated by the member for Watson during debate.
I want to put the government's position on the record. The government's view, which is backed up by our legal advice, is that there is, in substance, no difference between the existing provisions in the Crimes Act and those that were intended to replace them in the Criminal Code. Despite this, to avoid delay in achieving the primary purpose of the bill—to strengthen Australia's espionage laws—the government decided to excise these provisions from the bill. The government did so not out of any concession that there was any substance to the misinformed claims. On the contrary, the government did so because the government did not want to hold up passage of this important legislation. We decided that, for the time being, the existing Crimes Act provisions will stand in their current form.
The government is committed to protecting Australia's national security and punishing those who threaten Australia's interests. That is the purpose of the bill. It is not aimed at hampering or preventing public discussion. This is important legislation which will assist in providing a safe framework for the exchange of sensitive information and will ensure that we have strong laws to punish those who seek to betray Australia's interests. The government is committed to protecting Australia's national security and punishing those who threaten Australia's interests. The bill delivers on that commitment. I commend the bill to the House.

"Edwards, Graham, MP",ALP,2002-08-26,"—In dealing with the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2002 Budget Measures) Bill 2002 and the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 tonight, we recognise that both bills contain measures of a drafting nature, rectifying oversights in drafting from previous legislation, including some discrepancies which have arisen through imperfect interaction with the Social Security Act. Most of these drafting changes, while necessary, are not controversial. For that reason, we have no problem in dealing with these on a cognate basis. 
One such clean-up of note within the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 removes an accidental anomaly concerning different offsetting arrangements between two parts of the Veterans' Entitlements Act where widows are affected. This was unintended and the correction is therefore beneficial. Within the same bill is a provision which relates to a mechanism to be inserted into the Veterans' Entitlements Act allowing for easier incorporation of non-legislative documents or other statutory instruments into statutory instruments governing the operation of some benefit schemes. While a concern with this issue will be articulated by the shadow minister in another place in due course, I simply note that this concern does need to be put on the record, though it is not sufficient at this stage to cause us to withdraw our support for the bill.
With respect to the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2002 Budget Measures) Bill 2002, there is only one key issue of note, and that is the amendment which provides for the indexation of the income supplement of war widows. We support that move without hesitation, though I put on the record our strong objection to the snide, cheap remark of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs that the freezing of war widows' social security benefits in 1986 was a Labor Party act of meanness. It was nothing of the kind, as the minister well knows. It was no more than an adjustment which should have been realised many years before when it became clear that, inevitably, war widows would become eligible for a range of other benefits which was never intended and that there was a degree of doubling up in the payment of pensions, which should have been foreseen but was not. I will not dwell on this now except to say that we firmly believe that support given to war widows, when compared with the age pension counterpart, is now appropriate.
In addition to the war widows pension being indexed by MTAWE—male total average weekly earnings—and non-means tested, we believe that the income support supplement, ISS, at $125 per fortnight, indexed by MTAWE is also reasonable. As we all admitted, it could be more generous but at this stage, when most of the widows are of retirement age, it is reasonable. We therefore support this provision. It is inevitable and no doubt will be welcomed by widows, as it prevents any further erosion of their combined benefit. That does not mean, however, that we are content with all the details surrounding support for widows, because there are some areas of neglect which will be dealt with in some detail in the debate in the other place. There are of course other issues which I raised in the House as recently as last Monday, and I can assure the House that we will continue to raise these issues until they are addressed.
I want to compliment Senator Mark Bishop, the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, for his work on exposing the government's attitude to holders of the gold card. As we know, the gold card entitles holders to health care to cover all conditions. This includes treatment as a private patient in a public or private hospital. The government, however, has failed to remunerate at a reasonable rate doctors treating gold card holders. The result is that the gold card is no longer the guarantee to the level of health cover or care that it used to be and to which these veterans and, for instance, war widows are justly entitled. Senator Mark Bishop has rightly highlighted these concerns. It was very interesting to see the minister's office, as late as a week ago, denying them; yet I see the issue was pretty well aired on the ABC this morning. The government has been big on trumpeting the extension of the gold card to the veteran community. Its challenge now is to ensure that the extension of the gold card is not negated by the government allowing it to be devalued as a means of ensuring the quality health and related care for our veteran community.
Another area of concern for me relates to veterans' access to Hollywood hospital, in Western Australia. Hollywood hospital is a private hospital run by the Ramsay group. I say at the outset that I have a high level of regard for the quality of health care at Hollywood generally. I am, however, concerned at the number of veterans who are being turned away from Hollywood and pushed off into other areas of the public health system. I am aware of several occasions when this has recently occurred, and it has impacted on both city and country veterans seeking treatment in Perth.
My office had a call a couple of weeks ago from some constituents who were very concerned about their mother. Those concerns were taken up by my office and were fixed. Having just returned from a parliamentary trip to visit our troops in Afghanistan, I was pleased to receive a note from the family. It said:
Dear Mr Edwards
Just a note to say thank you to the staff in your office for the work they did in securing a bed for our mother ... who is a gold card recipient in Hollywood Private Hospital. She was admitted to Royal Perth last Thursday at 4.30 through the emergency department after being told no beds were available at Hollywood. At 1.30 the next day she was still sitting in a chair in the “transit lounge”. After a phone call to your office and speaking to Rick Giblett, a bed was found at Hollywood.
That is one example. I am aware of lots of others, including one from a fellow in Exmouth, north of Perth, who contacted me because he was quite offended at the lack of treatment that he received. It is less than two years ago that I raised in this House the issue of a young Vietnam veteran who had some problems in getting into Hollywood hospital. He was sent off to another hospital in an inappropriate way. The next day, he was admitted to Hollywood but discharged himself and, very sadly, took his own life. Those people who were looking after him had a view that the treatment that he got impacted to some degree on his decision to take his own life. 
I know there are a number of people in Perth who are concerned about this issue. One of them is Blue Ryan, the National President of the T&PI Association. Blue Ryan is absolutely—150 per cent—dedicated to the members of that association. He has raised some concerns. Unfortunately, instead of addressing some of those concerns, there are some people who have taken to denigrating Blue around the place. It is not the way to deal with the issue. There are some problems there and they should be addressed. As a result of the letter and the approaches that have been made to my office, I will be asking the minister's office for a briefing so that I know exactly what has happened in relation to the particular constituent issue that I raised. Generally I have a very high regard for the level of treatment within Hollywood. The problem is this: if you cannot get in there, how can you access it? Our veterans are entitled to that good level of health care, and they should not be shunted around, for whatever reason that is occurring.
The other issue that I want to turn to once again is this issue of the rewrite of the Military Compensation Scheme. I have a press release here, dated 11 June 1997. It quotes then Minister Bishop:
Mrs Bishop announced that work will proceed on developing the single, self-contained military compensation scheme for peacetime service which covers only military personnel. This will be considered by Cabinet by the 30th of June next year.
That was 1997, and we are still waiting. When I was given responsibility by the ALP side for the rewrite of this Military Compensation Scheme, I wrote to the minister involved and reiterated a commitment that was given by the Labor Party some years ago—that we would adopt a bipartisan approach to this rewrite because an immense amount of work has had to go into it. But I did say that ultimately the bipartisan support will be dependent upon the detail of that new piece of legislation, and it will be dependent upon the support of the ex-service organisations that are being consulted as a part of that rewrite. Those ex-service organisations, including the RSL, the Vietnam Veterans Association, the Vietnam Veterans Federation and others, have a very important role to play because it is their responsibility, based on their experiences as ex-servicemen and women, to ensure that the new Military Compensation Scheme will look after current soldiers—those serving today—and those who will come in the future.
I must say that I am very pleased at the way that the ex-service community have really knuckled down to the task. If the government thought that the ex-service organisations were going to be some sort of a pushover, they were very wrong, because the people who are serving as part of that consultative group are very conscientious indeed. I recently had a letter from the Vietnam Veterans Federation relating to the new Military Compensation Scheme. I will quote from their letter, which is headed `The new military compensation scheme':
More is required of members of the Armed Forces than any other public service. Soldiers, sailors and aviators give up a great deal of liberty for the needs of a service which is ready to face Australia's enemies. A new Military Compensation scheme is needed to cover its unique demands and its dangers. 
To their credit, the government has taken on the task of developing such a Military Compensation scheme. The government's idea is to base the new scheme on the `workers compensation' model. In fact, the Department of Defence was well down the track of developing the new scheme when it became clear that its `lean, mean' workers compensation model ran foul of the principles of the long established and tested Repatriation compensation system covering Australia's war veterans.
I am reliably informed that the Department of Defence resisted having to incorporate these long established principles into its scheme and has been made to reconsider its position only by some strong and persistent objections from a thankfully vigilant war veteran community. I understand that there may still be some resistance in the corridors of Defence. 
As far as I am concerned, this resistance to incorporating the best of the way we have looked after war veterans in the past into the new Military Compensation scheme must cease. Amongst those matters of importance which have been resisted by Defence are:
Establishment of separate streams involving different nomenclature and additional benefits for those with war service. 
The establishment of a category of totally and permanently incapacitated (TPI) for those rendered unemployable by war service.
Recognition of and compensation for lost careers.
Acceptance that a soldier, sailor or aviator injured in battle to the point of unemployability should not be humiliated by an inability to provide decently for his family. It is unacceptable that his children should be deprived because their father was disabled whilst fighting Australia's enemies. Acceptance that soldiers, sailors and aviators, whose ability to earn a living has been destroyed whilst fighting Australia's wars, deserves a standard of living at least that of the average Australian family.
They go on to say:
Rights enjoyed by war veterans in the compensation appeals system are also under threat from a reluctant Defence Department. The right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal with legal representation provided by Legal Aid is much valued and much appreciated by war veterans. This enthusiasm is not shared, it appears, by some of those tasked with developing the new Military Compensation Scheme. 
As far as I am concerned, this valued right enjoyed by war veterans must not be abolished.
And in developing the new Military Compensation system, the Department of Defence should look again at the appeals system for servicemen and women with only peace-time service. 
Just as the armed forces demands more from its members, so it has more responsibility for those members' welfare. The quid pro quo for obedience up is responsibility down. 
It is distressing, therefore, to see young, inexperienced, impecunious soldiers, sailors and aviators, thrown, unassisted into the legal maze of the Military Compensation appeals system. 
The armed forces should, at least, assist members to prepare their cases. 
That is signed by Tim McCoombe and Graham Walker, two very well-known advocates for veterans in Australia. I value their opinion and I hope that the government consultative group that is looking at this new MCRS will value their opinion as well.
I now turn to the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia and some of the things they have said in relation to this rewrite of the Military Compensation Scheme. I raised last Monday, during the grievance debate, the fact that the younger veterans group has been excluded from this consultative process. I asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs whether she would look at putting the Gulf War Veterans Association, peacekeepers and peacemakers on to this consultative committee, because at some stage they will have a right and will want to have a say. I would have thought that it would have been better to pull them into the consultative group now and give them the opportunity to have their say and be a part of any new rewrite. But that has not happened yet.
In one of their many contributions, the Vietnam Veterans Association have said:
Employment within the Australian Defence Force (ADF) requires that the individual undertake training for war, peacemaking and peacekeeping. The inherent dangers of such training set the members of the ADF apart from all civilian occupations.
That seems to be something that the Defence department does not really accept at this stage, but I know that many within the Department of Veterans' Affairs do. I hope that the Veterans' Affairs hierarchy is trying to argue with Defence over the current impasse to ensure that some of the benefits that these ex-service organisations are talking about are written into the new Military Compensation Scheme. The Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia argue:
The VVAA notes with some concern that there is a mind-set within Defence that:
this is workers' compensation legislation based on the premise that the burden of proof is on the claimant;
all are treated the same under the Act; and
only those who see active service against an enemy will have a lower standard of proof.
The Defence argument is that the number of truly totally impaired personnel in the future is likely to be small. It gives no credence to the fact that a predictable proportion of soldiers returning from war are physically and mentally incapacitated to the extent that they could never hold down a job. There is considerable evidence that the proportion of soldiers suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, for example, is exactly the same for peacekeeping as it is for fighting a war.
Defence concludes that the classification of Totally and Permanently Incapacitated (TPI) will not exist in the new scheme where arrangements are designed to support each individual on the basis of their level of impairment and their needs.
The document is fairly detailed and well researched. I congratulate Barry Billings and others who have worked on that for their contribution. In their submission, under the heading `Conclusion', they state:
It is mooted in some quarters that the veteran's entitlement and compensation scheme should be brought into the 21st century.
Modernisation may well be applicable to service today in the Navy, Army or Air Force, but to discard the benefits so generously given by the people of Australia to those who have seen active service against the enemy is to deny the historical and beneficial care given to those whose lives have been changed forever.
A modern compensation system based on Defence service alone, denies the sacrifice and deprivations encountered by those on warlike service.
The VVAA will continue to work towards reaching a conclusion which is mutually acceptable, and which will protect the interests of future veterans and Defence personnel without eroding hard-won benefits.
It has been said many times that; `Australia has the Best Repatriation System' in the world that caters for the care and needs of the Veteran community. This is due to the `much amended' Veterans Entitlement Act and the will of the Australian people. We suggest that its replacement has to be `Better than Best'.
That is the end of the quotes from that submission from the VVAA. I implore the minister, the government, the Department of Defence and the Department of Veterans' Affairs to listen to these ex-service organisations and to respond to the things that they are saying. If they do not, the years of work that have gone into this rewrite will be jeopardised, because there is no way that the veteran community are going to roll over and allow the benefits that they have fought for and accumulated over many decades to be wiped off under a rewrite of a military compensation scheme which will, as I said, put currently serving veterans on a lesser level of support than those people who are already entitled under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. We are talking about those soldiers who currently are serving in places like the Gulf, Kuwait and Afghanistan. I think the very clear and strong message from the veteran community is that those soldiers, sailors and aviators are as entitled to a good compensation scheme as are any veterans who have gone before them. That is a position that I would strongly agree with.
I have covered the areas that I wanted to cover. As I said, the opposition supports these bills, although there will be some further arguments in another place—when they get to the Senate. I am sure that some of the issues which I briefly touched on at the start of my speech will be teased out and dealt with in more detail by the shadow minister in that place. In conclusion, I reiterate the fact that we on this side of the House are prepared to have a bipartisan approach to this rewrite of the Military Compensation Scheme. It is a big rewrite; a lot of work has gone into it.

—How is that? I am speaking!

Motion (by Mr Swan) proposed:
That the member be not further heard.
—The member for Curtin has the call; we have just voted that the member for Curtin be given the call. It is quite unreasonable to interrupt the member for Curtin at this stage. It is early in her speech. The standing orders indicate that, a member having been given the call, they are entitled to be heard.
—Thank you, Mr Speaker.
—Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Mr Speaker, under what standing order do you so rule?
—I am happy to acquaint the member for Lilley with the standing orders. I am also comfortable with the fact that, the member having been given the call and having had less than three minutes in which to participate in the debate, it is reasonable for her to deliver her speech. The member for Curtin has the call.
—Thank you, Mr Speaker. As I was saying, the changes contained in these bills before the House this evening highlight the Howard government's commitment to improving, refining and expanding the system— 
—Mr Speaker, further to the point of order raised by the member for Lilley, am I to understand that you are now creating a precedent—which I might welcome; I am not necessarily disputing it, but I am just trying to clarify it—that you will not allow members who have been given the call to be interrupted by anybody, minister or member, moving that they be no longer heard?
Government members interjecting—
—Order! I am happy to clarify the matter for the member for Fraser. Of course, I am creating no such precedent. I must admit that I am having difficulty in this short time in finding the appropriate House of Representatives Practice reference, but I am confident that it is customary for a motion, having been agreed to by the House, not to be put again within a reasonable frame of time. I am about to seek advice on what a reasonable frame of time is, but it was painfully obvious that the member for Curtin had said nothing that warranted her being sat down. In fact, I am confident that there are incidents in House of Representatives Practice where, a motion having been put, it is not entertained by the House within a particular period of time.
—Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Could I refer you then to page 327 of House of Representatives Practice. If you have in fact ruled that the member for Curtin had not spoken, page 327 refers to a break in business and, therefore, it was quite appropriate for me to attempt to move my motion.
—I will refer the member for Fraser and the member for Lilley to standing order 169 without reference to House of Representatives Practice, which would take me a little longer. It was on recollection of standing order 169 that I acted. Standing order 169 says:
Subject to the provisions of standing order 233, the Speaker or the Chair may, in his or her discretion, disallow any motion or amendment which is the same in substance as any question, which, during the same session, has been resolved in the affirmative or negative.
It is not unreasonable for the member for Curtin to be heard, and I intend that she should be heard unless she says something that is outrageous.
—On the basis that I say nothing outrageous, I seek to continue that the changes contained in these bills—
—I am attempting to accommodate the member for Curtin, as she must be well aware. The member for Curtin will resume her seat.
—Mr Speaker, on a point of order, standing order 169 refers to matters during the same session. It clearly does not have the specificity which standing order 94, `Closure of member', does. It says:
94	A motion may be made that a Member who is speaking, except a Member giving a notice of motion or formally moving the terms of a motion allowed under the standing orders, “be not further heard”, and such question shall be put forthwith and decided without amendment or debate. 
The standing order that you have referred to is in general terms; it does not relate to that. The specifics of standing order 169—
—I have dealt with this matter under standing order 94. The House has resolved under standing order 94 that the member for Curtin has the right to be heard.
—The changes contained in the bills before the House this evening, the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2002 Budget Measures) Bill 2002 and the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, highlight the Howard government's commitment to improving, refining and expanding the system of federal government support for Australia's defence forces. I am delighted to see so many members of the opposition in the House this evening to support the federal government's support for Australia's defence forces and veterans and their families. It is timely that these measures be introduced to the House whilst Australian men and women are on active service in Afghanistan, the Gulf, East Timor and elsewhere, for it focuses our attention, quite rightly, on our defence forces and, indeed, on veterans.
Australia's defence force personnel risk life and limb regularly to advance Australia's national interest. The Australian defence forces have a further role of aiding and shielding Australian citizens. This task involves assistance to the public during times of natural or man-made disasters and civil unrest, and service in emergency situations, such as the rescue of sailors during the Sydney to Hobart yacht race several years ago. The specialist skills and training required, as well as the dangers facing defence personnel, make the armed forces unique in Australian society. The coalition government has acknowledged consistently that it is in Australia's national interest to develop technologically superior and highly trained armed forces personnel. However, in order to make certain the high standard of Australia's defence forces, it is necessary that appropriate services are provided to defence force personnel and their families during their periods of service and beyond.
When our defence personnel are serving away from home, they must be sure that there will be someone or something to assist their families. The nature of military service is such that the federal government has a responsibility to provide support and care services to defence personnel and their families once they return from active service. Hence, part of that responsibility is to ensure that the families of veterans are well looked after in the event of one of our military dying or being disabled. In my electorate this is an issue of considerable interest, for not only is the Hollywood Private Hospital—to which the member for Cowan referred in his speech—located within Curtin, there are living in my electorate thousands of beneficiaries of veterans affairs pensions or payments, including disability pensioners, service pensioners and gold card holders. In fact, the net total of beneficiaries is over 4,000 and the average age of those beneficiaries is about 77 years. 
The federal government has over the last 5½ years recognised the contribution that these men and women make to the defence of our country, and the risks that they take. Let us not understate it: we are talking here of the defence of democracy, property and person and the cause of freedom in this country. The federal government recognises this in a variety of ways, through a comprehensive program of increases to entitlements, recognition generally and memorials. The two bills before the House involve some fairly minor legislative changes, described as housekeeping amendments. Nonetheless, the fact that these changes are being made at all demonstrates the high priority that the Howard government places on veterans' matters.
The second bill, the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2002 Budget Measures) Bill 2002, is legislation designed to implement the Howard government's commitment in the 2001 federal election to remove the unfair freeze on the ceiling rate of income support supplement and service pension payable to Australian war widows and war widowers. This freeze was the result of a particularly shabby decision by the Hawke Labor government in 1986. The Hawke Labor government sought to penalise the widows and widowers of Australian servicemen and women by freezing the income support payment in 1986. The consequence of this decision was that the value of the payment would decrease over time. The Howard government has sought to partly discharge its obligations to the families of defence personnel by linking the payment to the cost of living and wages index. As such, the payment will provide more satisfactory support to Australia's war widows and end what has been a longstanding anomaly.
The War Widows Guild of Australia has quite rightly campaigned to have the income support payment linked to the cost of living and wages index, and I commend the guild for its staunch advocacy of this reform and the commitment with which it has campaigned. According to Department of Veterans' Affairs statistics, there are 934 pensioners who are war widows in my electorate of Curtin, and I know that, if passed, this legislation will go quite some way to assisting these women. Also located within the electorate of Curtin is the Campbell Barracks in Swanbourne, the home of the Special Air Service Regiment. I raise with the House the fact that I met with a group of SAS spouses and partners who were seeking information on specific Commonwealth government services available to them. I was delighted to be able to inform them of a range of services and initiatives that the federal government has indeed put in place to assist the spouses and partners of SAS personnel serving overseas.

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2002-08-26,"—Thank you, Mr Speaker. It really heartens me to hear how pleased members on the other side of the House are to see me rise to speak on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2002 Budget Measures) Bill 2002. I know they will be spending their entire time listening to my words and hanging off everything I have to say, because they know that we on this side of the House really care for veterans and have their interests at heart.
This is important legislation that we on this side of the House support. This bill will enable the twice-yearly indexation of the ceiling rate of income support supplements and service pensions, and it really reflects the cost of living and the rises in wages that have taken place. The indexation of the war widows income supplement was frozen in 1986, and this change will allow the unfreezing of this allowance. In 1995, the income support supplement was created in the Veterans' Entitlements Act. At the same time, the frozen rate of $120.10 for war widows on an age pension came into being and many of those pensioners transferred from Centrelink to DVA.
I believe that members in this House will join in support of this bill. It really looks at budget measures. There is only one key issue, and that is the amendment that provides for the indexation of the income supplement for war widows which we are supporting without hesitation. Every member of this House appreciates the contributions that veterans have made to our country. I think it is only fitting that we should remember that when debating this legislation. In doing so, we have to pay tribute to war widows and the support that they have given to their veteran partners and spouses over the years. It has been a long time coming, but it is good that this allowance is now going to be unfrozen. The war widows pension, as we all know, is a lifetime tax-free benefit, and when these changes come into place it will operate in a way that benefits the war widows.
Whilst discussing this legislation, I would like to bring to the attention of the House a ceremony that I attended last Sunday at Swansea, which is within the electorate of Shortland. It was the rededication of the Swansea community war memorial, and it had enormous support from the community. This rededication of the memorial was necessary because the community had joined with the Swansea RSL subbranch and the Swansea RSL and built a wonderful new memorial as a tribute to the veterans of our community.
The thing that is so special about this memorial is the inclusion of water in the monument. It is a beautiful marble monument with a water theme. When we look at the service that our veterans have performed over the years, and the connection of this particular area with the water, it makes for a spectacular monument to our veterans. I need to bring to the House's attention the enormous support of the community and the many people who contributed to the cost of the reconstruction and rededication of this community war memorial. We had Brian Arkell, who is a local solicitor, Barry's Quality Pies, Blacksmiths Home Hardware, Cardiff RSL Subbranch and Catherine Hill Bay RSL Subbranch. Catherine Hill Bay is a very tiny place with only about 200 people in the community, but that RSL subbranch contributed towards this wonderful memorial. We have S.P. Chapman optometrists, the City of Newcastle RSL Subbranch, Bruce Clancy, C.D. and S.Y. Colhoun, B. Cunningham, Dorothy's Skin Clinic, Jim Durie, D. and J. Evans, Civic Videos and the Hadfield family. Carrol Hall, who is a real estate agent and no relation to me, contributed as well. I made a contribution, as did Islington RSL Subbranch and Kim Mangos, the local physiotherapist. The maritime services union made a contribution, along with the Newcastle RSL District Council, Newcastle Permanent Building Society, our state member Milton Orkopoulos, Parsons Funerals, N.R. Peattie, Pelican Flats RSL Club, which is the adjoining subbranch, Ken Rutledge Roofing, Shortland RSL Subbranch, Ann and Alan Smith and R.A.J. Stamm. Swansea RSL Club made a substantial donation, as did Swansea Workers' Club. The Department of Veterans' Affairs supported the new memorial. They could see that it was really needed in the area. Also, Newcastle Vietnam Veterans' Association, Wallsend RSL Subbranch and Arthur Woods contributed. I read all those names out to show you the support in the community for this memorial and for veterans. Any legislation that is introduced into this House that helps veterans and war widows is welcomed by the community as a whole.
One of the things that has been of great concern to me and to the veterans in the community I represent is the gold card. There have been a number of issues around the gold card within my electorate recently. Doctors have started lobbying for increased fees for the treatment of veterans under the Repatriation Private Patients Scheme. I am sure that I am not the only member in this House who has been contacted by veterans in our electorates. With the gold card, as we all know, veterans are able to access free treatment from their doctors. Recently, veterans have been finding, when they go to the doctor, that the doctor refuses to accept their gold card in payment of services. It has happened with general practitioners and with specialists.
—Name one!
—Many doctors are refusing to look after our veterans who went to war, who supported our country and have been prepared to give their lives for our country. The issue of spiralling medical indemnity insurance premiums has added significantly to health costs and has also led to an increase in the price that veterans have to pay for their visits to the doctor, as is the case with all people in the community. 
While I am not prepared to name a doctor who is not bulk-billing veterans, what I will share with the House is a survey that I performed in the electorate. I rang 25 doctors, randomly chosen, and asked them whether or not they were bulk-billing pensioners and whether they were accepting the gold card from veterans. I found a very sad state of affairs. Over 20 per cent of the doctors I contacted said that they were no longer bulk-billing veterans. Twenty per cent of the doctors said that the men who went overseas and fought for our country were no longer going to have their gold card—which was given to them when they came back at the end of the war—honoured. They were no longer going to receive the free medical treatment that they had been promised. The doctors have been lobbying the government and the government has done nothing to resolve this matter.
With the issue of medical indemnity insurance and the government's failure to resolve that problem, we find that there is an enormous increase in consultation fees being charged by doctors. One practice within my electorate has recently, since this problem with the medical indemnity insurance arose, increased its fees from $38 to $43 to $47. When a veteran believes that their gold card is going to be accepted to pay for their medical treatment and they are denied that, they are faced with having to pay a bill of $47. That is not good enough, and that is not what we promised our veterans. Similarly, another surgery has increased its fees from $37 to $40, and so it goes on. 
I believe that our veterans deserve better than they are getting from this government. They expect more and, to be quite honest, I expect more. Those doctors I surveyed were in the Lake Macquarie part of the Shortland electorate. We are also receiving phone calls from the Central Coast. I have had two phone calls and an email today in relation to the fact that doctors are not accepting the gold card. The AMA have written to all members of this parliament about this matter and how they need the government to act immediately. If they do not act immediately, we are going to have the same situation that we have with bulk-billing generally and those veterans who have looked to the government for security, those veterans who have fought for our country, will be let down and will be forced to pay for a service that they have always believed was their right to receive.
Another budget measure that was introduced this year that had the potential to cause enormous hardship to veterans was the increase in pharmaceuticals. I am pleased to see that has been stalled in the Senate, but I feel sure that this government will bring it back and try to bring about that increase. There is no group of people in the community who are more reliant on medication than our veterans. I have recently been approached by quite a few veterans who are upset about some of the medication that is no longer covered by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. They are also very worried about what the effect will be of this increase in cost that the government is still trying to push through. One veteran I was talking to told me that he takes 18 tablets a day. He is terrified about the proposed increase in the cost of medicines, as is another veteran who takes 14 tablets a day. Another veteran that has been coming along to talk to me recently is also quite upset about the cost that he incurs in having his medication packed in a Webster pack. What the government has done with that particular budget measure is try to introduce a quick-fix approach rather than looking at all the issues that surround the cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.
For the remainder of my speech I would like to refer to a submission that the Partners of Veterans Association of Australia Inc. have submitted to the Committee for Review of Veterans' Entitlements. This is a particularly strong group of women. Their patron is Mrs Lynne Cosgrove. Their president is Narelle Bromhead, who lives within the Shortland electorate. The women who are involved in this group are very dedicated. They are dedicated to improving conditions for veterans and their partners. In their submission they start off by reaffirming their unreserved commitment to the veterans of the Australian armed forces with qualifying service and then go on to talk about a number of issues. They talk about the war widows compensation pension. This pension was introduced under the War Pensions Act 1914 as compensation, paid to veterans' widows, for the death, from war related injuries, of their husbands. The submission refers to a speech that was made in 1917 by the then defence minister, Senator Pearce. The speech reads:
One of the saddest spectacles of the past has been to see men who have been willing to risk their lives in the defence of their country left destitute and the dependants of men who have laid down their lives for their country having to live on charity.
That is a situation that these women worry about. They feel that, currently, they are not adequately covered and that there are quite a few problems in this act, particularly in relation to younger war widows. They make the point:
The Australian government must consider as a first priority, veterans of the Australian forces with `qualifying service' and their dependent families.
They say that they welcome the changes in this legislation but they believe that it does not go far enough.
They refer to the war widows compensation payment, the domestic allowance that is paid to war widows, and the income support supplement and the need to revisit that. In particular, they refer to the issue of age. The income support supplement is payable to women over 58, and they refer to the impact that has on younger women. This group of women are particularly concerned about the fact that younger widows are expected to try to re-enter the work force but they are not given adequate training to do that. They do not believe that the government is really serious about supporting war widows and helping them re-enter the work force or to develop new skills. They see that a lot of war widows have been under extreme pressure for a considerable time and they view it as a cost-cutting exercise rather than an exercise designed to help them. I call on the government to really get serious about veterans and to support our veterans and our war widows. (Time expired)
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—Before I call the member for Hasluck, I remind the member for Shortland that contributions to a debate should be relevant to the bill before the House.

"Jackson, Sharryn, MP",ALP,2002-08-26,"—I rise to speak on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2002 Budget Measures) Bill 2002 and the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002. I am always pleased to have the opportunity to speak on legislation that affects veterans. This is especially so because it gives me the opportunity to pay tribute to them and to acknowledge their service to the country. I was privileged, as an official of the Miscellaneous Workers Union, to meet many veterans employed as national park rangers, security officers and in other industries covered by the union. Often these men—and I think it is a reflection of their character and who they are—also volunteered to take on roles such as delegates in their workplace, taking on the responsibility of representing their fellow workers and taking up issues on their behalf with the employer. Such workplace representatives make an extraordinary contribution to their colleagues. In particular, I am talking about people such as Cedric Turner—or `Shorty', as we know him—Colin Evans and Ron Donnelly, who were all rangers at Kings Park; Bob Woods, who continues to play an extremely active role in the TPI Association; Roy Harris, the national park ranger; Brian Neal—or `Bulk', as we know him; Warren South; Phil Kaye, a long-serving representative at CSBP; and of course Phil Clover, who is vice president of the union's Western Australian branch. Given earlier discussion in the House today concerning the Kokoda Track, the House may be pleased to know that Phil has made a significant contribution to following the track and finding the various battlegrounds that have recently been commemorated by the Prime Minister on his trip to Papua New Guinea. 
As I said, these men continued to serve the community in many capacities after returning from active duty, and their selfless concern for their fellows is heartwarming. That is why it is with great sadness that I have seen some of these men suffer the health consequences of their service to the country. Despite the good services of the Western Australian office of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, it has often been a difficult time for them and their families. I continue to wish them all well and offer what support I can as they deal with those issues.
I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister for Veterans' Affairs for the issuance of the new certificates of appreciation under the Saluting their Service program. It is particularly pleasing to me that these certificates will also recognise what I call the newer veterans—that is, those people returning from service or who served in the Gulf War and in various peacekeeping operations. I am glad they will have their contributions recognised early, unlike the struggle that existed for those Vietnam veterans who were shamefully ignored for many years. However, I do not share the minister's concern in her press release that one of the reasons that we need to do this is that, because of the ageing of our veterans, somehow in the future there will be less attention or recognition paid to Anzac Day. I am pleased to say that I attended many Anzac services in my community and was astounded by the number of young people in particular who proudly wore medals and the like from uncles and grandfathers. Also, nearly all the schools in my electorate had some service to commemorate Anzac Day.
I will now go to the specifics of the legislation. The first of these two bills seeks to make three amendments to address inequities and anomalies with regard to the war widows income support supplement, the third being a drafting correction. Amendments in the second bill serve mainly as minor legislative housekeeping items. The first bill aims to remove the frozen ceiling rate of the income support supplement, which is paid to recipients of the war widows and widowers pension, and to twice yearly index the rate proportionally both to CPI and average male weekly earnings in line with other main income support pensions. The amendments also propose concurrent backdating for three months prior to the date of the claim for income support supplement, in line with the present war widows and widowers pension. This will alleviate the financial disadvantage that arises when social security payments cease on granting of the war widows and widowers pension. As it currently stands, the payment of the income support supplement can be provided only from the date of the claim.
Although it is encouraging to see some of the anomalies and inequities in the legislation being addressed—for which I offer my support—there still exists a situation under the proposed amendments whereby a war widow or widower under the age of 57, and who is without children, cannot get income support supplement, nor can they get the disability support pension.
The government has failed to support the war widows and widowers, who may find themselves in this situation, essentially leaving them with  no more than the war widowers pension should their partners die. There could very well be situations where a widow or widower may have spent much of their time as a carer for their veteran partner, often dealing with all of the health care problems of their spouse and the stress that that causes their family. It seems to me that they may find that this has kept them from being able to actively participate in the work force for many years and, of course, they will find it very difficult to find immediately new employment. As the legislation currently stands, widows and widowers in this position seem to me to be almost forgotten and simply left to deal with the system irrespective of the service and the contribution that their spouse has made. I think this shows that there are still a number of issues confronting veterans and their families that the government needs to address. These are some of the areas I want to touch on tonight.
The first of them is that the government is still failing to live up to its promise to remove the disability pension from the means test at Centrelink. Currently, veterans with disabilities caused by their service have up to $157 per fortnight deducted from their disability support pension, due to the inclusion of their veteran disability pension in the DSP means test. This situation could be further worsened by any move by the government to force veterans who are currently on the disability support pension to the Newstart allowance. Not only is the Newstart allowance $52 per fortnight less than the DSP but the means test for the Newstart allowance is also much tougher, with the income fee reduced from $112 to $62. For veterans in this position, the exclusion of their non-taxable, non-means tested DVA disability pension from the Centrelink means test would result in immediate and substantial financial relief. This policy suggests that payments of compensation which are made for pain and suffering, albeit unfairly, count as income only for ex-service people and not for the rest of the community—that exclusion is good enough for the wider community but not good enough for veterans. The discriminatory legislation needs to be amended, and with a far greater sense of urgency than this government appears to be prepared to commit. The time has come for the government to stop ignoring the obvious inequities in the legislation and to stop placing the burden for its mismanagement on those men and women who have served this country. 
The member for Shortland addressed what appears to be recent evidence from members in this House which exposes a trend of gold cards being rejected by some doctors when veterans present for medical treatment. This is also a slap in the face for veterans. We are told that many doctors claim that the schedule fees—that is, the Commonwealth medical benefits scheme rates—are now below the actual cost of providing some services. The government is fully aware of the problem and seems to me to be refusing to address the issue. Instead, veterans are likely to be made to seek medical treatment as general patients and to pay the gap between the Medicare rebate and the fee being charged by doctors. If we are not careful, the gold card is at serious risk of becoming redundant as once again this government ignores the needs of veterans and their families. Veterans deserve to have free access to health care, especially in their older years or if they are suffering from service related injuries. They are entitled to the free treatment that they have been promised. That is part of the deal we do with them when they make their commitment to serve the country.
This government has stalled other reforms with respect to veterans' issues. The Clarke review of veterans' entitlements—with, I suggest, its misguided terms of reference—is a classic example of how the government is successfully delaying or putting on ice areas in the Veterans' Entitlements Act that need urgent attention, such as those that fail to adequately recognise the level of service carried out by the SAS. It is also an admission of a failed government policy for veterans. The SAS is not just an elite Defence Force unit; it is a unit whose members are highly trained and skilled at working in the most arduous and stressful conditions. The risk of injury or illness from such service is without question very high, as those serving and their families well know. In order to attain such an elite level, SAS personnel must undergo hazardous training and be exposed to situations of extremely high risk. Exposure to this level of training must be more adequately recognised, and an inquiry should be considered to determine the long-term effects of such service.
I know a little about this area, as another veteran I admire—a man named Rick Giblett—has been campaigning for many years to gain proper recognition for service personnel involved in counter-terrorist training. The three things that he has vigorously pursued include, firstly, that counter-terrorist training be declared as hazardous service, to ensure that SAS personnel are able to get access to entitlements under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. Secondly, there is the question of access to and the level of TPI entitlements and other compensation, as well as the issue of how Centrelink treats these payments. I am aware that these two issues are now part of the current review. I join with veterans and veterans' supporters in my electorate of Hasluck in hoping for a speedy resolution and a successful outcome which clearly recognises that counter-terrorist training is hazardous service and that those personnel involved should be properly treated.
The third thing which Rick Giblett and his organisation have been campaigning for—and which I wish to speak about—is a health study. This would be an opportunity to put in place a proper and considered study which collects the facts concerning the health of these particular veterans or personnel. This would acknowledge what those of us who deal with veterans know for a fact—that is, the health issues and problems that these people are dealing with now. Hopefully, the study will make proper recommendations for the future.
It was my intention when I first drafted this speech to have quite a go at the Minister for Veterans' Affairs for her failure to take up this question. It seemed to me to be absolutely outrageous that you would have to campaign to get someone to look into whether or not a problem existed amongst this dedicated force. I have been advised very recently by some of the people who are in discussions with the Department of Veterans' Affairs—and I might say that the negotiations with the department seem to be much more successful than those that have been held with the minister and her representatives—that at least those senior people appear now to recognise the great need for an inquiry to be undertaken. I hope that that is the case. I commend them if that is the case. If it is not, I will be back on my feet in this place to make quite a song and dance about it. I have had the opportunity to meet not only with Rick but also with others and to hear first-hand the story of many of the people who have been involved with the SAS and with counter-terrorist training. How anyone could suggest that they do not have a legitimate claim is absolutely beyond me.
Perhaps I can put the minister on notice in that respect: she will have my congratulations if the health study is announced and she will hear from me again—and, I am sure, from many others—if it is not. In relation to that, I particularly commend those veterans and representatives of veterans' organisations who have been involved with that active campaign and have been lobbying for what must be at least five years to see this finally come to fruition. I convey my regret that this parliament and this government did not choose to act earlier on this particular issue.
Earlier I commented on the Clarke review and voiced my concern about some of the terms of reference for the review. I did that because I think the review has failed to address a number of the issues that confront the totally and permanently incapacitated, TPI, group of veterans. This group has been lobbying the government without success for the last few years to address the shortfall in the value of the special rate they receive as formulated all those years ago. Frankly, that rate has been considerably eroded since. It should also be noted that many TPI veterans—that is, veterans who are considered incapable of working more than eight hours a week because of injuries incurred in the service of this country—also fall into the group that are affected by the inclusion of their disability pensioners income in the Centrelink means test, further eroding what might be considered a reasonable standard of living. 
In relation to that, I take this opportunity to acknowledge the tireless work and efforts of the many veterans and veterans' organisations I have had the privilege to be involved with since becoming a member of parliament. Tireless campaigners for veterans' rights such as Brian Reeks, a veteran from Thornlie in my own electorate, keep me well informed—on a daily basis, on some occasions—of the many issues confronting veterans, and in particular those issues facing TPI veterans. Brian, along with the Australian Federation of Totally and Permanently Incapacitated Ex-Servicemen and Women, WA Branch, has lobbied and continues to lobby government on behalf of this group of veterans. They should be commended for their efforts. In that regard, I earlier referred to Bob Woods, another good friend and a solid campaigner in the Active TPI Association. The association have been very active in my home state of Western Australia, attempting to bring their issues to the attention of the community. I have to say that the community of Western Australia supports them wholeheartedly. It is, I think, time that this government addressed the situation of these people in a considered way.
Whilst I am paying tribute to those organisations which lobby on behalf of veterans, I absolutely cannot forget the returned servicemen's leagues in my electorate of Hasluck which also do a great job in serving both the returned veterans and the wider community. In particular, I refer to the Bellevue RSL, the Darling Range RSL and the Gosnells RSL, which are all active groups. Along with their respective sub-branch women's auxiliaries groups, they work tirelessly for their respective local veterans' communities and their families. I feel it is vitally important to recognise their efforts. In an age where volunteer organisations are struggling to maintain an operable level of membership, the RSLs in Hasluck stand out as shining examples of how this can be achieved. I offer them my best wishes—and long may they rule! In fact, a couple of those RSL associations are some of the many groups that ensure that there are well-attended services each year, particularly on Anzac Day but also on other important days of recognition, such as Sunday, 18 August for the Vietnam veterans community. I am sure that these services and the work these organisations do in the community will ensure not only that the issues of veterans are brought to the fore but also that we continue to respect and honour the service that has been given to the country by those veterans and their organisations.
One particularly heart-warming ceremony I attended on Anzac Day was held at the Railway Workshops, Midland. They have what is known as a peace memorial rather than a war memorial. Funds were raised by the workers in the workshops back in 1923 to build the memorial. They raised 1,000, which in those days was a considerable amount of money. The names not only of those workers who lost their lives in World War I but also of those who lost their lives in World War II are duly recorded on the peace memorial. It is a magnificent memorial: it is a woman standing with her left foot on a sword and with her right arm extended, simply asking for war to cease. It was delightful to see the memorial and to see the relatives, including the grandchildren, of those workshop personnel there. I commend the bills to the House.

"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,2002-08-26,"—I rise tonight to inform the House of a growing problem in the electorate of Greenway. This is a problem that I believe could easily be rectified by this government, but they choose not to do anything. The problem was highlighted in a couple of questions from the opposition at question time today. The problem I am talking about is the severe lack of child-care places available to the mums and dads in my electorate.
Greenway is located in one of the fastest growing areas of New South Wales. New housing developments and the attractive lifestyle of living in a great part of Sydney are bringing many young families to the area. Between 1996 and 2001 the population of Blacktown grew by over 26,250 people, which was the second largest increase in New South Wales. A huge increase in population like that naturally places a large burden on the local child-care centres, where the waiting lists are growing and families are getting frustrated. The child-care centres themselves are being frustrated, because they wish to expand and accommodate new families. They know how tough it is and they want to do something to help, but they are unable to because of a regime that does not allow the flexibility that is needed in an area like mine.
In a question without notice by the member for Gellibrand today, it was shown that, since the government came to power in 1996, spending on child care has fallen by over $800 per child-care place, placing a huge strain on providers, who are forced to cut costs wherever they can. There is a particular problem in my electorate with OOSH services, out of school hours services, because the regime that governs the number of places is particularly rigid. Areas like Glenwood, Quakers Hill, Marayong and Schofields are in desperate need of more places, but these places are unavailable. These services have to wait until a committee of bureaucrats politely ask each OOSH in other areas if they will give up some of the places that they are not currently using. Not too many services have spare places to give up, and those that do are naturally unwilling to do so in case of future demand. This leaves the growing areas out in the cold.
One case in point is the South Marayong out of school hours care service at Marayong South Public School. SMOOSH, as it is called, began its service in January 2001 with 30 places both before and after school. In the last 12 months they have seen their attendance grow from 2,788 hours of care in term 2 2001 to 6,306 hours of care in term 2 2002. That is a 150 per cent increase in just 12 months. They have a growing waiting list for next year. Honourable members can see by this growth that they are desperately in need of more places, but there are simply none to be had. 
I have also received a letter from the operators of Schofields OOSH. They are also struggling with numbers and facing huge residential developments over the next few years. Glenwood and Stanhope Gardens are, similarly, crying out for more places. Even if parents were willing to pay full costs, without government subsidies, these OOSH services would be unable to help given the restrictions of the legislation, which does not allow subsidised and non-subsidised places at the same centre.
It is fine for universities to have full fee paying students sit next to HECS place students in the same class as a way of expanding opportunities in that sector, but it is not okay for the same arrangement to take place at an outside school hours care centre. This is a piece of logic that escapes me. I have been contacted by many constituents who have been to a number of child-care centres in the area, none of which can take their children because they are full to the brim already. Greenway is a growing area and the growth shows no signs of slowing down, with new housing developments planned for many parts of the electorate and a move in the older areas to medium density housing. With house prices the way they are, young families often need a second income that requires both parents to be working. 
Children need to be looked after and our child-care system needs to be flexible enough to meet the needs of a rapidly growing community. Unfortunately, what I see is a rigid and inflexible system that struggles to keep up with the changing needs of a growing community. This is precisely why the government must step in and act. Only the government can provide the legislative and financial framework for the overall system. All the framework needs is re-examination and adjustment from time to time, and the time has come for the child-care system.

"Smith, Stephen, MP",ALP,2002-08-26,"—In that case, Mr Deputy Speaker, I move: 
That the Main Committee has no confidence in the Chair.
Question unresolved.
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—It is an unresolved question. I will refer it to the House. 
—Mr Deputy Speaker, it has to be referred now.
—I said it is an unresolved question. 
—The ayes have it.
—I heard the ayes and I heard the noes and I ruled that the noes have it.
—My point of order is this: there is an unresolved question in respect of the confidence that the Main Committee has in the chair. 
—Do you want to move another motion?
—I have moved a motion.
—I have said that the motion is unresolved. I have referred it to the House.
Mr STEPHEN SMITH (Perth) (8.08 p.m.)—I move:
That that matter be referred to the House forthwith.
Question unresolved.
—It is an unresolved question. I will refer it to the House.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: there are three unresolved questions. 
—I have referred them to the House to be dealt with.
—Firstly, there is the dissent motion. Secondly, there is the motion for want of confidence in you. Thirdly, there is the motion that that want of confidence be referred to the House forthwith. On what basis do you say that cannot be referred to the House? It has to be referred to the House forthwith.
—On the basis of the motion that was moved earlier in the House and carried by the House.
—The House's resolution does not say anything about want of confidence in the chair. 
—It says if there are any unresolved questions they will be referred to the House—
—In respect of the bill. Whether the committee has confidence in you or not has nothing to do with the bill. The House's resolution does not cover it!
—The member for Perth will resume his seat! 
Mrs GASH (Gilmore) (8.10 p.m.)—I move:
That the member be not further heard.
Question unresolved.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. There are four unresolved questions now.
—They will all be resolved by the House.
—None of them are covered by the motion passed by the House, which referred to the bill. There is an unresolved question in respect of dissent from your ruling. There is an unresolved question in respect of want of confidence in the chair. There is an unresolved question in respect of that want of confidence being referred to the House immediately. There is an unresolved question in respect of whether the member for Perth be not further heard. All those issues need to be referred to the House now, because the motion that was passed before dinner in the House referred to debate on the bill.
—Do you have another point of order?
—You must act now. You have no choice; you must act now.
—You have no point of order. I have ruled on all of those.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: this is quite an outrageous performance by the opposition. The motion that was carried in the House is very clear. It says:
... the Main Committee continuing debate on the Bill regardless of any unresolved questions. 
What we are trying to do as a government is to facilitate government members continuing debate on this issue.
—I have heard the point of order. The member for Robertson will resume his seat. I have ruled on that point of order.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. My point of order is very precise. The motion provided by the House says:
... following arrangements applying in relation to the Research Involving Embryos and Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002 ... 
It is nothing to do with the substantial procedural issues that the member for Perth has been raising and disagreeing with you on. His point is valid: this should be returned to the House forthwith.
—I remind the member for Lilley of point (4), and I will take him to the third last word, which says `any' unresolved questions will be referred to the House.
—It is clearly subsidiary to the lead paragraph in the motion passed by the House. The lead paragraph relates only to the Research Involving Embryos and Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002. If the parliament had wished this to extend to procedural matters of the Main Committee, that would have been included in the motion passed by the House. 
—There is no point of order. You are debating the issue. 
—Mr Deputy Speaker, how can you rule, as you have, that dissent from the chair on procedural matters—where a clear majority of people in the Main Committee dissent from your ruling—is considered under point (4) of the resolution that you are quoting as to not refer this back to the House? This is a clear abuse of the democratic process. 
—That is exactly what you are doing and you should be ashamed.
—I am not ashamed about this, because the majority of the members in the chamber should be able to decide what the procedure of this chamber is. 
—The member for Melbourne Ports will resume his seat. I have heard his point of order. The standing orders say that, if the Main Committee cannot resolve a question, it is referred to the House. I have referred the unresolved questions to the House. 
—Mr Deputy Speaker, they clearly do not resolve—
—Do you have a point of order?
—I certainly do. The motion passed by the House of Representatives earlier this evening clearly does not go to the procedural matters that are currently being contested on the floor. As I said to you before, (1), (2) and (3)—the subsets of the overall motion passed—relate only to the bill. They do not relate to procedural matters, otherwise those standing orders—
—There is no point of order. The member for Lilley is debating—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, will you let me finish?
—No. The member for Lilley is debating the issue. I said that there is no point of order.
—You have not heard me out yet.
—There is no point of order; you will resume your seat.
—On that, I will take a point of order. The point of order is very simple: there are specific standing orders which relate to procedures which are not mentioned in the motion that has been passed by the House of Representatives earlier this evening. They are not mentioned at all and therefore they are clearly outside the ambit of your ruling. Had the parliament wished to suspend procedural matters before the Main Committee, all of those existing procedures in the standing orders would have been mentioned in the motion that was passed by the House of Representatives only a couple of hours ago.
—I will say again that the principle issue involved here is that this chamber cannot resolve an issue. Even though the motions might be moved and ruled upon, this chamber cannot resolve them; they have to be referred to the House. 
—Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: you have already resolved those matters and this should be referred to the House.
—No, I have not resolved them. The issues have been referred to the House for resolution.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I too raise a point of order. I very clearly heard the honourable member for Perth move a motion of dissent from your ruling. That is why I came into this chamber. I would like to know on what ruling you can say that the motion we voted on in the House, dealing with (1), (2), (3) and (4), has anything whatsoever to do with dissent from the chair's ruling? I would like to know what advice you have taken from the clerk on how you can possibly say to the honourable member for Perth that his dissent from your ruling is now going to be covered at a further time in another chamber when, in this chamber at the moment, if dissent is taken against the chair's ruling then that has to be acted on now. Could you please explain?
—For the benefit of the honourable member for Prospect, the fourth point of the motion that was passed in the House says:
... the Main Committee continuing debate on the Bill regardless of any unresolved questions.
We have four. They have been referred to the House. 
—Further to that, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like it clearly explained to us on both sides of this chamber how condition (4) very clearly spells out anything pertaining to dissent from the chair's ruling. We debated that in the House. We took a vote on that in the chamber and that was applicable to the bill before the House being sent to the Main Committee. In the course of this bill coming to this Main Committee, a dissent from your ruling was clearly taken. I would like to be advised how this chamber can keep operating when a motion has not been resolved in which dissent has been taken from the floor against the chairman's ruling.
—The honourable member for Prospect would realise the motion was put, was unresolved and was referred to the House. That is under the standing orders of this committee. I call the honourable member for Wentworth.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. If that is the case, we should adjourn to the House immediately.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I do not wish to take the honourable member for Wentworth's time. I am sure he is only too willing to get to the debate as long as both sides of the House are. I would like it explained, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am sorry, but you have not explained it by referring me or any other member in the Main Committee to clause (4) of the motion put by the Leader of the House. Point (4) clearly refers to the bill that was referred from the chamber to the Main Committee. There was a clear motion put dissenting from your ruling. If that motion has been put and it cannot be carried in this place, then all debate must adjourn and it must be resolved in the main chamber. It is an unresolved question for the bill.
—If the member for Prospect read the standing orders of the Main Committee, they clearly say that an unresolved question cannot be decided in this committee but must be referred to the House. There are four questions that have been put to this committee and are unresolved. I have referred them to the House. 
—You have now wasted 20 minutes.
—With an unresolved want of confidence motion in the chair.
—I have untold patience.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: as a matter of logic, you cannot have an unresolved motion.
—What is the point of order?
—The point of order is very simple. You cannot have an unresolved motion of dissent from the chair's ruling. It is just not possible.
—Do I have to read the standing orders to the honourable member for Lilley?
—It is an oxymoron.
—The standing orders are very explicit about this committee. An unresolved question is referred to the House. I call the honourable member for Wentworth. ",REPS,<title>DEPUTY SPEAKER</title>,<title>Want of Confidence Motion</title>,Miscellaneous,25,1,speech
"King, Peter, MP",LP,2002-08-26,"—The issues before the House arising—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. Dissent from the chair in any public meeting has to be dealt with before any other matter can be dealt with. You cannot resume discussions of other matters that are substantive matters that were before the House. The House clearly decided that, if there were any disagreement, it would focus on matters substantive to the stem cell legislation. The House did not intend that you would overrule 700 years of procedural debate in any democratic assembly—
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—The member for Melbourne Ports is now debating the issue. The member for Melbourne Ports will resume his seat; he is debating the issue. I remind the member for Melbourne Ports that this is not a public meeting; it is the Main Committee. We are bound by the standing orders—
—The member for Melbourne Ports will resume his seat until I am finished. We are abiding by the standing orders of the Main Committee. I have spelt out the standing orders of the Main Committee. They are what we are abiding by: the standing orders of the Main Committee.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. This bill, which we are hoping to debate, is a very important bill—
—The member for Robertson is debating. What is the point of order?
—The point of order is that the opposition are clearly restricting debate. We have passed a motion in the House—
—That is not a point of order. The member for Robertson will resume his seat.
—The point of order is the fact that we have passed a motion in the House which clearly states that the Main Committee continue debate on the bill regardless of any unresolved question. 
—I have ruled that way.
—And I support that ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I do not want to have to keep raising the question, but the fact of the matter is that the worst unresolved question here tonight is that of dissent from the chair. How can you possibly conduct this meeting when a motion of dissent has been moved?
—The member for Prospect is now debating—
—I am just asking for a clear direction.
—I have ruled—
—But you have not ruled. You have only referred me to item (4) on the agenda.
—You can resolve this issue in the House, because that is where it will be resolved. If you want to debate the issue in the House, you can debate the issue in the House. I have ruled that these are unresolved questions and will be resolved in the House.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. Under what standing order of the Main Committee do you say that a matter of dissent from the chair cannot be dealt with by this democratic assembly of people? You said that this is not a public meeting, but the same democratic procedure is inherent in the standing orders of the Main Committee that is inherent in any democratic public meeting. You simply cannot say that you will not deal with the dissent thing and that you will refer it to the parliament.
—The member for Melbourne Ports is now debating the issue.
—What is the standing order?
—My reply to that is that the House of Representatives has passed a motion and referred it to the committee. This motion says very clearly in clause (4):
... the Main Committee continuing debate on the Bill regardless of any unresolved questions.
I rely on that. I also rely on the standing orders of this committee, which say that an unresolved question must be referred to the House.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. In terms of these sorts of things the matter must be resolved immediately rather than waiting for some time for the debate to continue. There has been a dissent motion; it should be addressed. It has to go back to the House immediately; we should not continue the debate. That is my understanding of the standing orders.
—That is debating the question, too. You were not here when I said earlier that point (4) of the motion passed by the House of Representatives—the Parliament of Australia—says that no questions unresolved in this House can obstruct the debate in this committee. They will be referred to the House for resolution.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. What we are clearly seeing here is a delaying tactic—
—That is not a point of order.
—The point of order is that they are continuing to discount your ruling. You have read out the standing order—
—That is not a point of order. I call the honourable member for Wentworth.
—The issues before this House are complex and of long-term significance—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order.
—Stop interrupting his speech!
—I am after clarification here. The member for Perth dissented from your ruling. You stated that you were going to refer that matter to the House. That is unresolved; that is showing no confidence in your decision. Yet you are still in the chair. I cannot understand why the matter has not been sent to the House of Representatives.
—The member for Fowler is now debating the issue. I have ruled on that issue.
—Order! I have ruled on that issue. I call the honourable member for Wentworth.
—On the one hand—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I appreciate that you have accepted a lot of points of order that may have been on the same point. Whilst I agree with you that the motion passed by the House is quite unambiguous, my understanding with a dissent is that, firstly, we have to follow the correct form and it thus needs to be handed in in writing and, secondly, it is not a question unresolved about the bill; it is a procedural issue. If I may say, Mr Deputy Speaker, with great respect, I am not sure that I have heard a dissent motion moved in this— 
—This is debating the issue. What is the point of order?
—I am not sure that a dissent motion has previously been moved in the main chamber and I guess from that point of view I cannot point to precedent about how it might be handled.
—That is debating the issue. What is the point of order?
—Personally, given that we have never had it before, I believe—
Honourable members interjecting—
—Order! What is the point of order?
—I believe it is a procedural issue; it is not an unresolved question associated with the bill.
—There are two clear issues that I have already ruled on, and I have said it over and over again, although it does not seem to be entering any heads at the present time. First of all, the standing orders of this committee are very clear that a motion cannot be resolved in this committee. It must be referred to the House. The second issue is that the motion moved and carried by the House, the Australian Parliament, clearly says at (4):
... the Main Committee continuing debate on the Bill regardless of any unresolved questions.
That is very clear.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Could you inform me who authorised the clock to stop at 19.54? I do not wish to deprive the honourable member of his time but the normal procedure is that once the clock is started no-one interferes with that clock, and it is still on 19.54.
—I cannot answer the question. It is probably in disgust.
—I should say at the outset—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, my point of order is this: one of the unresolved questions is an unresolved question of the want of confidence that the Main Committee has in you. The House cannot allow—
—You are making a statement, not a point of order.
—I am not making a statement; I am making a point of order. There are two aspects to the point of order. The first is that the House cannot allow such a resolution to continue ad infinitum—
—The House can under the standing orders.
—It must deal with the question of want of confidence in the chair immediately. That is the first point. The second point is that in any event—
—Can the member for Perth show me the standing order that says that?
—Any time a want of confidence motion is moved in the chair it is considered by the House immediately. You cannot allow a question of want of confidence to be unresolved for a period of time. That must be dealt with immediately. The second point is that, in any event, that most serious of any serious procedural motion—just like the other procedural motions which have been the subject of unresolved questions tonight—is not caught by the motion of the House, which is expressly limited to questions regarding the bill. The most serious of the procedural motions goes to a want of confidence in you, and you are saying to the Main Committee that you are happy—
—This is not a point of order; you are now debating the issue.
—You are happy to have that indefinitely as an unresolved question. You cannot allow the House—
—You are now debating the issue. The member for Perth will resume his seat. I have heard the point of order.
—I have not reached my point of order.
—You are debating it. You are not continuing. I have heard the point of order, which is dissent from my ruling.
—The point of order is on the way and manner in which the House needs to deal with an unresolved question about want of confidence in your chairing of this Main Committee. My first point is—
—The member for Perth is debating the issue.
—No, I am not.
—You are not raising a point of order; you are debating.
—The first aspect of the point of order is that you cannot allow the House not to deal with that immediately. The second aspect is that, in any event, the unresolved question is not covered by the resolution passed by the House earlier this evening. That resolution is expressly— 
—The member for Perth will resume his seat. You are debating the issue. You are not raising a point of order. You will resume your seat. 
—I am making a point of order.
—I will rule on the point of order.
—What is your ruling?
—When you sit down, I will rule. I refer you to standing order 276:
Every question in the Committee shall be decided on the voices and if any Member dissents from the result announced by the Chair, the question shall be recorded in the minutes as unresolved. Any unresolved question shall be reported to the House and included in a schedule attached to the report of the Committee to the House on the bill or order of the day. 
Provided that, if the question—That the Committee do now adjourn—is unresolved, it shall be deemed to have been resolved in the affirmative. 
I have ruled that these questions that have been put to the committee are unresolved. I have referred them to the House.
—I have a point of order under standing order 280, which says:
Except as provided by these standing orders, the same rules relating to the proceedings on bills and for regulating the conduct of business shall be observed in the Main Committee as in the House itself ...
If a motion of want of confidence was moved against the Speaker or a Deputy Speaker in the House, it is incredulous to argue that that would not be considered by the House immediately. There is an unresolved question as to the want of confidence that the Main Committee has in you. That must be resolved immediately.
—I have ruled, and it will be referred to the House. You can debate the issue in the House. I call the honourable member for Wentworth.
—The issues before this House are complex and of long-term significance, and they do not admit of the option to do nothing. On the one hand, if the bill succeeds—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I clearly appreciate and understand standing order 276, which you have read out. I again would appeal to the people here in the Main Committee that standing order 280 is very specific. If a dissent in the chair has been moved, it must be acted on. The chair has provided, through that dissent ruling, no confidence to any speech being given in the House tonight. You have no confidence then, because the dissent has not been qualified. A vote has not been taken on it. The ruling is there, pending. It has nothing to do with the motion we voted on—I repeat it, Mr Deputy Speaker. Again, standing order 276 is specific. Standing order 280 says this committee must run in the same way as the parliament. You must refer the dissent motion against you to the parliament to be acted on now.
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—I have on several occasions explained to members opposite what the rulings are. I believe that they are probably looking to suspend the committee and are disruptive. I warn members that I will name the lot of them.
—The issues before this House are complex and of long-term significance but do not admit of the option to do nothing. If the bill succeeds, it will clearly establish unequivocally that, in Australia, cloning of human cells for the purposes of reproductive or therapeutic purposes will be absolutely prohibited, upon pain of criminal punishment.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order. The honourable member is on his feet. Could you please explain to me and the Main Committee—I alone have been up here 22 minutes—how he still has 13 minutes remaining on the clock for his speech on this debate. You had called him before I came into the Main Committee and, as I said, I have been here 22 minutes.
—That was a problem that was resolved as soon as it was pointed out to the committee that the clock was not continuing. It is a bit difficult to say how much time was spent in disruption. I call the honourable member for Wentworth.
Opposition members interjecting—
—I am going to be a little bit harsh here in a minute.
Debate interrupted; adjournment proposed and negatived.
—As the question is unresolved, I will refer it to the House.
—On the other hand, if the bill fails, then the position in existence before the COAG agreement in April of this year will prevail; that is, that there will be no legislation on a national basis banning cloning in the states of New South Wales, Queensland and Tasmania and varying regimes in the other states and territories. It is generally accepted by both the supporters and opponents of the bill before the House that that position is undesirable. Thus, it is accepted by all sides of the debate that some form of legislation is necessary. Hence, to do nothing is no option at all. 
In my contribution, I wish to address several issues: the first is the consultation that I have had with my constituents in the federal seat of Wentworth; the second is the issues raised by the difficult question of cloning and its scientific nature; the third is embryo stem cell research itself and the benefits that may arise from it; the fourth is adult stem cell research; and finally, the fifth is the difficult theological and philosophical question which is at the heart of the debate—namely, when does human life begin? I will then discuss the protections in the bill and will finally draw some conclusions which I hope will advance the debate.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It is quite obvious that the member opposite is completely out of time. He rose at 8.20 p.m..
—I have ruled on that issue. I said that the clock was a problem to start with. We cannot resolve it at this particular time. I think we need to apologise for that, but I have called the member for Wentworth.
—The first thing that I did in relation to my constituency was hold a public forum at the Woollahra Seniors Centre in Woollahra in my electorate. I invited Professor Jansen of the Sydney IVF institute, who is one of the leading scientists in this area, to put the yes case and I invited Ms Mary Byrne from the John Plunkett Centre for Ethics—
—The member for Wentworth will resume his seat.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I only arrived here a few minutes ago and I need to ask you about the reference to naming all of us—I presume you mean all of us on this side of the committee—in terms of the points of order that have been called here in the Main Committee tonight.
—I advise the member for Lowe to read the standing orders.
—I have just arrived and I am wondering why I would be subjected to that, because I have not participated in the debate.
—I have the point of order—
—I am seeking clarification why all of us could potentially be named if we interject or call a further point of order. I want clarification from the chair, because I have taken it as a threat that I cannot say anything for fear of being named. I would just like clarification.
—I understand your point of order. The standing orders of the Main Committee clearly state that, if there is a disruption, a member can be referred to the House. I have had disruption. There is no debate on that.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I have a further point of order. I only arrived in this chamber a few minutes ago and I am not sure what took place before I arrived.
—You are now on your feet on a point of order disrupting the chamber. The member for Wentworth has the call.
—I letterbox dropped the suburbs immediately in the area of the Woollahra Seniors Centre and I ensured that there were two advertisements in the principal newspapers that circulate in my electorate. The public meeting which I called was well attended, and the debate was very thorough and effective. The points of view that were put—
—The member for Wentworth will resume his seat.
—I am trying to resolve these difficult questions. I move:
That the committee advise the House of the unresolved question that is before the chair, that the Main Committee adjourn immediately and that, when the House resolves the matters, the Main Committee return.
Question unresolved.
—As the question is unresolved, I will refer it to the House.
—The points of view that were put at that meeting were very instructive to me as the local member. This might be asked: on a question of conscience, why are the views of the constituency relevant in the formation of the opinion of the member as and when he or she votes in the House of Representatives? There are two answers to that, in my respectful opinion. The first is that I take the view that, strictly speaking, I am not a delegate of the electorate but rather a representative and that at the same time, in adopting the representative role, it is important to take into account the views of the constituency. Therefore, I did consider it important to hold a public meeting so that the issues could be aired and so that I would have the capacity and opportunity to draw upon the views of people in my electorate—views, of course, which I respect greatly. Second, at that meeting there were several speeches both for and against, and many questions were put to the experts who presented the case on both sides. The purpose of it was not to obtain a resolution but rather to inform and assist the public debate, which has been a very important one and is going on even to this day in this chamber before you, Mr Deputy Speaker.
There were two speeches, however, which were instructive and had a great effect on those who were present. One was by a lady named Skye Banning, who in fact works in my office. She has diabetes and went blind some five years ago from that terrible disease; it is said to be incurable. She spoke very warmly of the importance of the hope that the stem cell research held out for someone like her. The other one was by a man named Adam Johnson, who did not live in my electorate but did drive a long way to be there because he had heard of this public debate. He has motor neurone disease. He was a delegate to the republic convention in Old Parliament House a couple of years ago. He is a very articulate person, and he too spoke very warmly of the hope that was open to him as a result of the possibilities of stem cell research. 
But it was not my purpose to achieve at that public meeting any resolution or indeed any definition in my own mind of my own views. As a Christian, I earnestly sought the views of local church leaders including rabbis, some of whom live in my area. They include Rabbi Alman, who sits on the World Rabbinical Council. I also visited Archbishop Jensen, who is a constituent who has strong views against embryo stem cell research which are well known. In this way I was able to consult not only the views of the community but also the views of leading churchmen and others who had a contribution to make on the issue.
Finally, on the process of consultation in my electorate, I doorknocked in two suburbs, Randwick and Waverley, and I think it is important to put on the record the impression that I had as a result of that doorknocking. Most women, particularly younger women, were in favour of embryo stem cell research but with strict limitations to ensure that there was no commerciality—no sale or transfer in an open market—of embryos, and I believe that it is a very important qualification that they made. The male constituents were not so clear in their views one way or the other on this legislation. Nonetheless, in my assessment there was a firm majority in favour. Then I had the great instructive benefit of reading the report that was prepared by the Andrews committee of this House last year. That was the process that I undertook in consultation with my constituency and the broader electorate in seeking to form my views on the important issue of conscience which is before this parliament.
Let me now speak about the second matter I mentioned—namely, the issue of cloning. I know there are some in the scientific community who believe, particularly in relation to the issue of therapeutic cloning, that this is an important scientific advance which should be sustained. However, I do not accept that view, because I take the view that therapeutic cloning is so close to reproductive cloning as to be dangerous and does not admit any true distinction that would permit a proper program of research of the type that is proposed in this bill. Therefore, somatic cell nuclear transfer, which is in effect what is meant by cloning in this context, is properly banned by this legislation, and I strongly support it for that reason.
The next issue I mentioned was embryo stem cell research itself. The formation of the embryo for the purposes outlined in the bill does not involve any system of therapeutic cloning by somatic cell nuclear transfer or by any other means other than the process, in the IVF laboratory, of the fertilisation of the female egg by the spermatozoa. The embryo is formed from the two gametes: the spermatozoa and the oocytes. The question, therefore, is whether or not this form of research gives rise to any benefit or any limitation which ought to be objected to. The principal benefit is the evolution, via the extraction through pipettes, of the stem cell itself. Not a lot has been said about stem cells as such. Stem cells were first discovered in rodents as far back as 1970, and since then stem cell research has developed quite extensively. It was not until recent years that the extraordinary ability of stem cells to take on the physical form of cells surrounding a host body, called pluropotentiality, was appreciated. Whether it is a liver or whether it is brain cells—even blood and bone marrow—stem cells grow to ensure the purification, in a sense, of that particular organ or human part.
It is quite clear that the extraction of stem cells from embryos by that form of research and the potentiality that this holds out for the broader community, as well as the scientific community, is extraordinary. It has been described by some as the most important development in medical science since the development in the 1920s of penicillin that marked significant advances in medical science. The real question is: are there any alternatives to the extraction of stem cells from embryos? One proposal which has had a lot of publicity recently is adult stem cell research. I do not wish to go through the details set out in the Andrews report of the scientific aspects of the extraction of adult stem cells by the process of cell compatibility. In summary, there are two perceived advantages in the scientific community of embryo stem cells, which do not adhere in adult stem cells. The first is that, generally speaking, the adult stem cell has a shorter shelf life than the embryo stem cell. That can be significant in some scientific research, which is referred to in the Andrews report and in other articles. The second is that the adult stem cell is less flexible.
 (Mr Mossfield)—Order! The honourable member's time has expired.
Mrs GASH (Gilmore) (8.48 p.m.)—I move:
That the member's time be extended.
—Order! I am advised that that is not possible. 
—On a point of order, Mr Speaker: the resolution from the House does say, in point (2), `each member speaking for a period not exceeding 20 minutes'. I sat through the member for Wentworth's speech. He would have spoken, I am sure, for less than 10 minutes, so in view of that I support the motion for the extension of time because I believe he should have the opportunity to speak for a period of 20 minutes, as was outlined in the resolution by the House.

"Quick, Harry, MP",ALP,2002-08-26,"—What a remarkable evening. I rise to speak on the Research Involving Embryos and Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002. Society as I know it has changed remarkably over my 61 years.
—Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The clock does not seem to be working. It seems to be favouring one side of politics more than the other.
 (Mr Mossfield)—Order! The clock is now working. Thank you for that.
—Start again, Harry. You have some good things to say.
—Thank you. I will start again, if I may. Society as I know it has changed remarkably over my 61 years—family structures, the concept of community, medical innovation, telecommunication advances, travel options and educational opportunities. Growing up as a child in Ballarat, Port Augusta and Rainbow, I experienced the impact of various diseases on the community—whooping cough and measles, to name a couple. They impacted not only on me but also on my schoolmates. I well remember as a youngster the polio epidemic and the way in which medical professionals fought to curb the disease and its cruel impact on families. I remember as a youngster in the early 1950s visiting my father in the Ballarat Base Hospital as he fought for his life while suffering from pneumonia—a disease in those days that caused many deaths.
Medical research in these times was pretty basic, initiated by some amazing Australian scientists and little understood and little heard of by ordinary citizens unless the diseases hit their families and impacted on them. As an overseas traveller in the mid-1960s, I remember being vaccinated against smallpox and being violently ill from my shot. Due to wonderful medical research and international governmental cooperation, the world is now free of this disease. Like many in this House, I well remember the time when the IVF debate occurred and the accusations, claims and counterclaims that flew from those who supported and those who opposed this medical advance for infertile couples wanting children. A close family friend's son was one of the earliest recipients of a bone marrow transplant to combat his leukaemia. Just over three years ago my life was saved by medical research when part of my heart failed in its operation.
I have been listening with great interest to the many speakers in this debate—speakers on both sides of the political fence and on both sides of the ethical issue. A conscience vote in the House is a wonderful thing. We finally get to hear views of people as they speak from the heart—or at least one would hope so. Too often in this place many members trot out in their speeches what is acceptable to their supporters and their party and not really what they themselves feel is right and proper for Australia and its people. Having the freedom to wander across the field, explore every nook and cranny and then finally decide on where you want to build is something to be treasured and encouraged. It is a pity that it does not happen more often in this House.
It is also a pity that some people in this place just cannot help themselves, even when it comes to a debate like this one on a bill that has been a source of great controversy. I would like to have seen each and every one of us participating in this debate, and it saddens me that not everybody is participating. I would like to have seen a cessation of stereotyping, name-calling, personal abuse and character assassination because of the views a person holds. Why not just put forward your own point of view and leave it at that?
As a member of this place for 10 years, it has been fascinating to see the reaction of supporters of the opposing views on embryonic stem cell research. We have all been bombarded by emails, faxes, letters, form letters and mailed booklets from both sides of the argument. This is somewhat disappointing, to my mind, as the people who have contacted me have never spoken to me before and have never contacted me on any other issue. This worries me, as I am very sceptical of people with a single issue in mind, whether it is in favour or against the issue.
Like others in this place, I have been bombarded with letters. I would like to read a couple, not just from one side but from both sides. I received this one here the other day—I think it was Monday—from a lady in Kingston Beach:
Dear Mr Quick
I just wanted to let you know I am opposed to using embryos for stem cell research, even those embryos that will be discarded after IVF.
Not enough has been said of the research using adult stem cells because they are a viable alternative.
It seems to me that any legislation that allows the use of embryos—produced for whatever initial purpose—is opening the door to things we cannot and have not contemplated.
Yours sincerely
Jean Richardson
Looking at her wonderful writing, I would assume that she is a little bit older than I am. Here is another letter, from the other side of the fence:
Dear Harry 
I don't know how you intend to vote on the bill concerning stem cell research but I thought it might be an opportune moment to mention my daughter Amanda who has suffered from juvenile rheumatoid arthritis since the age of 16 months. The following is overlong and if you use it in your speech I leave it entirely to you as to which pieces of information that you use.
I am going to read the lot. It continues:
She has never known what it is to run and play in the manner of ordinary children and now at the age of 28, there is a real worry for me that I might outlive her. She can barely walk properly and the likelihood is that a wheelchair will become mandatory in the near future. She has a walking frame and an electric scooter, but the latter cannot be carried around in her car. It goes without saying that I have made many health contributions for drugs, specialists and the type of equipment needed by the severely handicapped.
From an early age, she endured drug and chemical treatments that would sorely test most adults. By the age of four, she was taking a prescribed dose of eight Disprin tablets a day. This lasted until the medication caused a stomach ulcer. The appropriate drugs for that condition were duly prescribed and she took them in combination with most of the anti-arthritis drugs of the day.
In many respects, she has been a guinea pig or a test subject for the medical profession and was an early candidate for the use of methotrexate, an anti-cancer drug of considerable toxicity, which had been found useful in the treatment of arthritis. She endured traction in bed, which closely resembled a medieval rack and behind it all, constant and severe pain.
At the age of 16 Amanda had a hip replacement which nearly cost her her life, as the surgeon inadvertently nicked a major blood vessel. Further operations followed in the sequence of a replacement knee, the other hip, the other knee and more recently, a shoulder joint. Arthritis also affects the eyes in the form of iritis. My daughter has already had the lens of one eye replaced and has had follow up laser surgery. I think you will agree that sight is one sense that most people would least like to lose.
Needless to say she is not very mobile, and the first prothesis caused problems which required invasive surgery and rebuilding of part of her pelvis which had crumbled. Her surgeon was concerned about yet another general anaesthetic, as his usual anaesthetist noted collapsing blood vessels during the last operation. Mercifully, she survived the operation but required six weeks bed rest and is now undergoing rehabilitation.
A division having been called in the House of Representatives—
Sitting suspended from 8.58 p.m. to 9.17 p.m.
—Before the suspension, I was quoting from a letter. It continues:
Throughout her trials and tribulations, my daughter has shown great courage. In taxing circumstances, she obtained a degree at Monash University ... She remains on a cocktail of drugs, including morphine, for arthritis and chronic pain. The unpleasant fact remains that this disease has twisted her body, stunted her growth, produced swelling through the use of steroids and reduced her life expectancy—a situation of which she is only too aware. She has osteoporosis at the age of 28 and is probably menopausal. That means she will be denied children, a matter of sadness for us all. Of late she has commented that death could be a more desirable state, a remark which produced a severe reaction in me. I am not saying she is suicidal—far from it, for she battles on indomitably. It is unlikely that she will ever get married and increasingly probable that she will have to live with her mother and stepfather in an unhappy setting. 
It goes on finally to say:
Her rheumatologist has told her that stem cell research offers her the best chance of repairing some of the damage done to her bones and joints but it will not cure twisted fingers and deformed feet. Nevertheless, it is widely regarded as a cure for the disease ... On her behalf, I urge you to vote in favour of the bill. 
Best wishes

Anthea Patterson, a lovely lady who owns the Hartzview Vineyard, faxed me a letter which reads: 
Dear Harry
As our representative in Canberra I felt it important to communicate to you how passionately we feel about this issue—
that is, Anthea and her husband, Bob. She continues:
I was deeply concerned this morning hearing Bob Carr talk about embryos as only the size of a pin prick as if therefore they weren't real life. Also justifying killing these precious lives to help those who are sick or suffering from some disease. 
The bible makes it abundantly clear in Psalm 139:16, 17 when David is speaking to God he says:
“Your eyes saw my substance being yet unformed. And in Your book they all were written, The days fashioned for me, when as yet there were none of them.” 
Clearly God has given us life and it is precious to Him, we have no right to take a life no matter how young. 
Kind regards 
Anthea Patterson
As I said, we have heard from people on both ends of the spectrum. There are many of us here who, for the first time for a long time, are actually talking to each other across party lines, wondering whether we are going to split this bill. There are people talking of abstaining from a vote. There is a band of seven of us on our side, the Labor side, who are contemplating voting no.  
There are people on the other side, some very dear friends of mine, who are in turmoil. This is not an easy issue. Some of my close friends are scientists; I admire many of them. We have scientists on our banknotes; they are remarkable Australians. But I think that, when you get six of them in a room, you probably get seven different opinions. On something as contentious as this, it really worries me that we have such a divergence of opinion. We have those who say that embryonic stem cells are the way to go; others say it is adult stem cells. When you read the newspaper or scan the Internet, you get 27 versions of the same story.
I am a person with a deeply religious belief in life. My late father was a very humble, Christian man who gave up butchering to become a lay preacher and then, at the ripe old age of 68, took a divinity degree. He has been the model for my life since I was a young child. When we had the euthanasia debate I was torn, because Dad was dying from pancreatic cancer. As I have said before, I stand here today because my life was saved by some very fine medical research. Every morning I wake up and thank God that I am still alive. My mother has one of those hyphenated diseases. We celebrated her 85th birthday the other week. I said to her: `Mum, wouldn't it be nice to keep you a little bit longer? But I think your body is wearing out and the good Lord has decided your days are numbered.' And she is happy about that. She is in a nursing home.
I guess having a conscience vote means that I make up my mind. I weigh up all the pros and cons. I think of my 26-year-old daughter living in London and my 22-year-old daughter living in Melbourne, and I wonder how I would feel if they caught some dreaded disease. Thank God—touch wood!—they are free from disease. But I do wonder, if either of them got breast cancer or some other horrible disease that affects women, how I would feel. Would I change my mind? But I have faith that many of these things are being resolved.
I noticed in the paper today that some people were saying that we are spending tens of millions of dollars on this when, across the oceans, in places far away, young people are dying from lack of food and lack of medical resources. We in the Western world—wealthy, self-content—are able to direct almost unbelievable sums of money into research to keep ourselves happy and alive longer. I look at some of the doctors who are out working in Aboriginal communities and I pay tribute to them; yet I see another branch of the medical profession obscenely refiguring people so that they look younger and better and healthier. And I wonder what medical research—all this science—is about.
There is a wonderful piece of Scripture that I want to include. I know there are people on my side who declare themselves humanists and probably pooh-pooh some of the things I have said. But this is Harry Quick's version of life. There is a wonderful verse, Hebrews 11:1, that sustained my father through many trials and tribulations, and it has sustained me as well. It says:
Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.
I have faith that, somewhere along the line, many of these diseases will be cured. That will not be in my lifetime. I like to think that the good Lord will give me another 20-odd years and that I will survive as long as my father, who passed away at 87, did. But I am against cloning. I would like to see the bill split up; then I think we would get a 100 per cent vote against cloning. But when it comes to embryonic stem cell research I honestly believe that it is not the way to go. I think there are options other than putting all your eggs in one basket. I know we have spent millions of dollars setting up this wonderful research centre. But I have talked to people in the cancer network; the member for the Riverina and I are cosponsors. We had Daffodil Day the other day.
We have heard of some remarkable advances in the management and treatment of cancer in all forms and it has not involved embryonic stem cell research. I do not think it is the way to go. I know that I am not going to be in the majority on this. I will be pooh-poohed by people on my side and by people on the other side. That does not worry me; as I said at the outset, this is a conscience vote. I am saying what I believe. I have faith in humanity that many of the dreadful things that afflict us—AIDS, youth suicide, poverty, family disfunctionality—will be cured.
A division having been called in the House of Representatives—
Sitting suspended from 9.26 p.m. to 9.50 p.m.
—In the last few minutes of my speech, I would like to sum up my argument. This is a very controversial issue. I would like to think that there are 150 of us who have thought long and hard about the Research Involving Embryos and Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002. I will hold no grudges against my colleagues and those from the other side as to how they vote. I will be interested to see exactly who does speak and who does not, and I would like to question as to why and why not. I would like to think that there will be 150 speeches from the heart, as mine is tonight.
In the euthanasia debate my two daughters did not agree with my point of view, but I said, `Sarah and Hannah, this is my conscience, my decision. I am not going to be swayed.' I can honestly say that I have never been swayed by anybody; I am not that malleable and pliable that I do as I am told. I do as I think and as I feel, and as I know the people in my electorate expect me to do. I would like to think that they will admire me for taking a stand; whether they agree with it or not is another matter. I would urge all members of this place to split the bill so that we can have 100 per cent against cloning, and then let us have a vote on the actual issue of embryonic stem cells. To the scientists who work tirelessly in this field, I say congratulations; I do hope you will make breakthroughs. For the people who are suffering, may God look after you. Some of you will be cured. I guess the younger ones have more hope, more possibility, than people my age who are encumbered with disease. 
I look forward to hearing other speakers in this debate. I hope and pray that they will speak from their hearts. When it comes to the vote in the main chamber of this House, this wonderful place that we are all privileged to serve in, I would urge all members to cast their vote not with an eye on those who shout loudest and longest but from their hearts, praying and hoping that the decisions they take will have an impact on not only the people in their electorate but all Australians. I thank those who do speak to this bill. With those words, I thank the members of the House for their patience; it has been a rather tumultuous evening. Lots of things have been said, and I look forward to hearing other members speak in this place on this very controversial but essential bill.",REPS,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS AND PROHIBITION OF HUMAN CLONING BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Miscellaneous,26,1,speech
"Baldwin, Robert, MP",LP,2002-08-26,"—I rise tonight to speak to the Research Involving Embryos and Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002. I think that it is important right from the start that we understand what this bill is about. This bill is an act to regulate certain activities involving the use of human embryos, to prohibit human cloning and other unacceptable practices associated with reproductive technology and for related purposes. This bill is an exercise of the mind and it is a torment for many people who are debating this bill. Some will stand here debating this bill on religious grounds, ethical grounds and other considerations important to them, for this bill has been put to us as a conscience vote—to vote as we see fit in line with our conscience.
The one thing I would urge all of my colleagues to consider is that we allow the splitting of this bill so that we can determine the vote—and from everyone I have spoken to, there is unanimous support for voting it down—on human cloning of any sort. Then the main issue in this bill, the use of embryonic stem cells, can be debated and a vote taken on its merits. I say from the outset that I respect every individual's opinion here, no matter what it may be, but I do have objections to those who claim that people with moral fibre seek to inflict moral standards upon others.
We need to go to the very beginning to understand where life actually begins. Life begins when a living sperm fertilises a living ovum—they are not dead sperm; they are not dead ova. To believe there is a point in time some five days later when life begins is quite wrong. And that is the textbook version: all of the embryology textbooks confirm that, in fact, all human life begins at fertilisation. The formation of that individual human being is when the DNA is typecast, and at that point in time it is a real human life. Destruction of that human life for whatever reason should never, ever be considered. At that point, as I said, the DNA is formed, and with DNA we have a distinct human structure with a set gene pattern—herein, a life. To purposely try to destroy that life is really to conduct tests on human beings. There is no other way of applying our conscience to it.
What I have tried to do in this whole debate is to keep an open mind and look for answers. I have listened to the experts. I am not a scientist, and neither are most of my colleagues, but I know that we have all gone in search of answers. We have had briefings from people like Professor Michael Good, the Director of the Queensland Institute of Medical Research, head of the Co-operative Research Centre for Vaccine Technology and head of the Comprehensive Cancer Research Centre. We have heard from Dr Peter Silburn, a neurologist, who is also Adjunct Professor of Human Movement Studies and Molecular Neurobiology at Griffith University and the Faculty of Health at Queensland University of Technology, a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Medicine at the University of Queensland, President of the Parkinson's Society in Queensland and Vice President of the Movement Disorder Society of Australia. We have heard from Professor Alan Trounson, the chief executive officer of the new national stem cell centre, who is the former Deputy Director of the Monash Institute of Reproduction and Development and professor of obstetrics and gynaecology/paediatrics at Monash University. We have also had lectures from Professor Bob Williamson, the Director of the Murdoch Children's Research Institute in Melbourne and President of the Association of Australian Medical Research Institutes. When I hear the discussion and debate from these people, all eminently qualified, and when we have conflicting views from the country's greatest scientists on whether embryonic stem cell research is actually required, it leaves a poor bunny like me in a very dangerous state. Do I believe one set of scientists or do I believe another set of scientists? After listening to all these scientists, I am convinced of one thing, and that is that all of these gentlemen deserve our respect as they all have a passion to cure the sick. 
When we are confused by scientists taking a stance on each side, the next thing we need to consider is medical ethics. If we look at the basic principles of medical research, we think about the Hippocratic oath. Parts of that oath have been put down in UNESCO's Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights in 1997 and the World Medical Association's Declaration of Helsinki in 2000. A couple of their key points are that medical research on human beings:
(a)		must respect the dignity and integrity of the human research subject;
(b)	must not result in death or disabling injury;
(c)		must put the wellbeing of the human subject before the interests of science and society; and 
(d)	must be preceded by careful and rigorous assessment of the risks and burdens in comparison with foreseeable benefits to subjects or others.
In other words, to carry out destructive embryo research goes against the medical ethics laid down in those conventions.
I need only to look at the report into human cloning by the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs of 2001. As I have said, I have been to a briefing with Professor Trounson. The minority report states:
Professor Trounson asserted there is no need to use any more embryos to create embryonic stem cells. This was supported by Mr Robert Klupacs, the General Manager and CEO of ES Cell International Pty Ltd:
We have now grown six cell lines within our research laboratories. The commercial reality is that it is very unlikely we will ever have to go back to another embryo source again to grow a new line ... Our position is that we do not think we will ever have to go back to derive another embryonic stem cell line.
This report was done in 2001, not much over 12 months ago, and here it is 12 months down the track and we are wanting to go down a different path. You can see why I am confused.
We also need to look at—and it has been overridden in a lot of this—some of the expert research on adults stem cells. I read in the Australian on 21 June this year an article by John Kerin and Deborah Hope about Catherine Verfaillie of the University of Minnesota, who has led a team which has isolated rat and human adult bone marrow stem cells which can differentiate into a wide range of cells and tissue types. An article published in Nature raised the prospect that adult cells have significant advantage over embryonic stem cells, with less cancer potential. In supporting that, a letter by Dr David A. Prentice of Indiana State University—where he is a professor of life sciences—has clearly pointed out the differences between the relative performance of stem cells derived from human embryos and those derived from the adult body or umbilical cord blood. He has clearly stated—and I am not a scientist, so I need to refer to these people:
Embryonic stem cells have not yet produced a single clinical treatment; there are few and limited successes in animal models; and problems of immune rejection, tumour formation and genomic instability continue to be unresolved.
That is a quote from a letter of 20 August from Dr David Prentice. Further, he says, by contrast—and this is the most important thing—that adults stem cells have proven successful in laboratory culture and animal models. They are already being used in a wide range of clinical treatments. I am not against research. I am not against saving people's lives or curing diseases. I am against the destruction of human life.
The other thing that has happened in this whole argument is that there has been great tugging at the emotions of the people involved in the debate. We have seen Christopher Reeve, who played the role of Superman, wheeled out in a wheelchair, saying, `Unless you support this, I will never walk again.' That is part of the problem. There has also been a video showing a rat cured by using embryonic stem cells. Dr David Prentice says that, whilst that video was shown, it has actually not been published yet and the stem cells used for that treatment were not embryonic stem cells but germ cells delivered from a nine-week-old fetus.
Today we are going down the track of stem cell research. When do we ask for the next movement of the line in the sand to allow people to use embryos of not just up to five days but up to 14 days and then up to 21 days? At what point in life do we stop pushing the barrow wanting to take life? My good friend Alan Cadman, the member for Mitchell, is in here and, like me, he has said quite clearly in many of the discussions that life begins at conception. I looked at all the evidence provided. I went through some of the other stuff from Professor Bob Williamson. I quoted his credentials earlier on. He said:
Embryo stem cells have two great advantages—they grow rapidly and easily in the test tube, and they can form ... into any tissue in the body.
However, in his documentation he says:
They have one great disadvantage; they may provoke immune rejection because they are foreign to the recipient ...
He also says that, importantly, the growth at times at this stage cannot be controlled. So, potentially, by developing these stem cells, we may be creating further problems. He also says, to his credit:
Adult stem cells can be obtained from many tissues ... They have three disadvantages at present—they prefer to give cells for the tissue from which they are obtained, they are hard to grow, and you have to take them from a patient ... 
That is very true but what needs to be understood in this is that, as I said quite clearly, for embryonic stem cells you have to destroy a life. As we go further and start to discuss the advantages and disadvantages and try to take the emotion out of it—and that is what I have tried to do in this debate—we see that there are many unsubstantiated claims as to the success of embryonic stem cell research. As I said, no current clinical treatments have been proven successful. There have been very few and limited successes in animal models. It is difficult to obtain pure cultures in the dish. It is difficult to establish and maintain the cells. There are the problems of immune rejection, the potential for tumour formation and the genomic instability. However, when we look at adult stem cells—and they are proven, with a long way to go—it is proven that they have the ability to generate virtually all adult tissues. They can multiply almost indefinitely, providing numbers that are sufficient for clinical treatments. They have proven successful in laboratory culture. They have proven successful in animal models of disease. They have proven successful in current clinical treatment. They have the ability to home in on damage. They avoid problems with tumour formation. They avoid problems with transplant rejection and, most importantly, they avoid the ethical quandary. 
As we go down this road, we need to make a clear-cut decision, and that decision has to be based on the fact that, when we take cells from a child, from a blood cord or from an adult, we do it with permission. If we take the cells from an embryonic stem cell, we are taking life away without permission. Sure, some other person may give permission, but the person or the individual or the human—whatever your interpretation is—whose life it is does not give permission.
The other thing that I have to question is whether the development of embryonic stem cell research can or may lead to the genetic modification of the human being. What I find surprising in this whole debate is its context: over the years we have had a lot of debate and a lot of disappointment about genetically modified foods. When we seek to introduce foreign DNA, foreign genetic structure, into a human being to grow, in essence we are starting down the track of changing the genetic structure of that human being, no matter how small. What will be the ramifications of that long term down the track? We do not know. As I said, there are many qualified scientists, but they cannot guarantee us that there will be no problems down the track. 
The other thing that concerns me is that this whole debate seems to be driven by big business. I do not have a problem with people making money but I do have problems with them making it out of an emotional roller-coaster, where they try to deliver hope and quite often fail yet go for the massive dollars. I find disturbing the threat I heard from some of my colleagues that, if we do not allow it here, this research, this money and this intellectual property will go offshore. But I say this to you: our clear conscience will stay here. We have to make a decision that our values are not for sale at any price. I know people who have children delivered by the GIFT program. How do you say to children that you allowed their potential brother or sister—because that cell is a potential brother or sister—to be experimented on? I also know that it is not easy to say to those who are sick and who need treatment and hope that we would discount that.
In light of all these arguments both for and against, I make my decision on this bill based on my ethical beliefs driven by a strong commitment to my God. I refer you to Psalm 139:13-16, which, in summary, says that the unborn are known and loved by God. I ask this parliament to consider splitting the bill so I can personally vote on the banning of human cloning and then use my conscience to vote against the use of embryonic stem cells. I urge all members to allow this so each and everyone one of us can have a true conscience vote.",REPS,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS AND PROHIBITION OF HUMAN CLONING BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Miscellaneous,26,1,speech
"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2002-08-26,"—I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the Research Involving Embryos and Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002 because it provides us with an opportunity for both an important and unique debate. While I am very glad that both major parties have allowed a conscience vote on this bill, I would hope that every member of this House uses his conscience in identifying with a political group and consciously expresses this knowing full well what this means each time they vote and not just on this occasion.
The bill that is before us deals with important ethical issues and is the result of a great deal of debate in many forums. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs considered the issue of human embryo research and human cloning for two years before it handed down its report in August last year. The issue has been debated at COAG, party forums and extensively in the media. The NHMRC has taken draft legislation to public forums, so every Australian has had the opportunity to have their say on the issue.
Much of the debate in this House so far has been concerned with what this legislation allows. However, it is important to note what this legislation prohibits. The prohibitions that this bill levies absolutely refute arguments that this bill is the thin end of the wedge or that it would set us upon a slippery slope to moral blindness. The prohibitions in the legislation show that this House, as representative of the people of Australia, is capable of making complex moral decisions. The legislation prohibits the creation, importation and exportation of human embryo clones. It prohibits cloning human embryos by embryo splitting or by somatic cell transfer and it provides large penalties for those acts.
The bill establishes an NHMRC embryo licensing committee, whose function it will be to license and assess research activity involving the use of excess embryos from assisted reproductive technologies. The prohibitions in this bill, particularly the prohibitions on human cloning, make some fairly substantial moral decisions and show that this House—indeed, the parliament—is capable of making difficult ethical decisions. The controversial elements of the bill pertain to the use of surplus embryos created as a result of assisted reproductive technologies. This bill allows excess embryos from these technologies created before 5 April 2002 to be used in scientific research, but it prohibits research on embryos created after that date. The bill also establishes a scheme to license, assess and enforce standards on research activities involving the use of excess embryos created by assisted reproductive technologies.
Mr Deputy Speaker, as you will have observed during the debate, this is an issue that ignites great passion both here in this chamber and in the community. We would be foolish not to accept that the issue of whether to use excess embryos for research is extremely difficult and one of ethics and moral belief. The greatest ethical challenges present themselves, it seems, at the beginning and at the end of life. However, I believe that the parliament is capable of making the right decision. 
The debate has again made clear to me the very complex nature of biomedical ethics, and that is why I strongly support the Leader of the Opposition's proposal for an Australian bioethics commission. This commission would exist not to defer the responsibility of making ethical decisions from this House to a statutory body but to advise the government on these issues. An Australian bioethics commission would provide a forum in which this nation could discuss detailed ethical and scientific questions rigorously. It would enrich the debate on these issues, which I suspect are only to become more difficult and more scientifically complex into the future. We should not defer the responsibility to another forum, but we do need another forum to inform the debate so that the whole nation can participate in it. Ethics and the underlying values that support them are not something that we as a nation should shy away from. We are only in danger of losing our values if we do not have a clear idea of what they are.
It took me a long while to make up my own mind about what I would do in this legislation, but I have taken the decision that I will support the bill. I have not taken that decision lightly. It was only after a great deal of thought and quite careful deliberation of the arguments both for and against and after listening to the debate in the parliament thus far that I came to my decision. I am concerned, though, that this debate is in the Main Committee and not in the House of Representatives. I think the public has a right to listen to this debate, because it is probably the most contentious issue that will be debated during this current parliament. I suspect it will be the only issue on which there is a conscience vote. I am disturbed that we have a situation where the government, using its numbers in the House of Representatives, has moved this matter to this chamber to be debated in this place effectively behind closed doors. Whilst it is true that the debate will be reported in the Hansard, if it had been in the House the debate would have been monitored by the media and it would have been broadcast.
I believe that all Australian citizens who have an interest in this debate have a right to understand and know what is going on in the parliament. It seems to me that, by moving the debate into the Main Committee, the government, through the leader of government business, has fatally sold short the interests of the Australian community in relation to this issue. We can talk amongst ourselves as we do in this chamber, arguing one side of the argument or the other, knowing that people on both sides of the chamber are going to share a common view, whether it is for or against. But in the wider community no-one will know. No-one will know unless someone takes the effort, the time and the trouble to make sure that the debates in this particular chamber, the Main Committee, are being monitored and the community is being informed about them. I suspect this will not be the case.
This evening we saw the farce of it all when a non-contentious piece of legislation to deal with veterans' entitlements was sought to be referred to the Main Committee in an effort to allow us to debate this subject—this very important ethical subject—in the main House. Unfortunately and sadly, the government refused to allow that referral and as a matter of fact we are now going to debate this legislation in this chamber. Ultimately, we will have a vote in the other place. The record there will record who voted for what but, apart from the vote, the content of the deliberations will, I fear, go unheard.
I want to make it very clear that I have consciously considered both sides of this debate and many of the issues. I am not an expert. I am not an expert in ethics or theology or medicine or science, but I do have the ability to make judgments soundly based on my own moral principles and my own ethical standards. But I base my decision on the principle of the value of every human life. I think the answers to the questions that this bill puts must be informed by the value that we place on human life—life that is and, dare I say, life that will be.
What we do with the excess embryos that are created through assisted reproductive technologies is a large but not altogether different question. This bill asks us to weigh up the value of banning research on embryos that would otherwise be destroyed against the value of the treatments and therapies that this research may yield, alleviating pain and suffering from some of the most debilitating diseases. The scientific and technical arguments have already been discussed in the course of this debate and I will not go over them here. Suffice to say that stem cell research offers hope for the development of a range of treatments ranging from those commonly referred to in the context of this discussion, from treatments of neurodegenerative diseases—including MS, motor neurone disease and Parkinson's disease—to congenital and other diseases. Specifically, embryonic stem cells have the capacity to differentiate into any other type of cell in the body. Adult stem cells, in contrast, have only a limited potential for differentiation, although recent research shows that some adult stem cells may have the ability to revert or to be passaged to levels of lesser differentiation. While the potential of embryonic stem cell research is immediately greater than that of adult stem cell research, I am sceptical that stem cell research in general will be the panacea that some have made it out to be. I wonder whether all the treatments and cures for diseases that have been touted about this place in the last week will be developed in the future as a direct result of embryonic stem cell research.
However, this in itself is no reason to stop embryonic stem cell research. I am also unconvinced that gene therapy and therapies developed through stem cell research will not have unforeseen or adverse effects sometime in the future. There are numerous examples of scientists who have not fully understood the ramifications of their work, resulting in disastrous consequences, and I am sure that they are understood by many in the chamber—well, the few that are here. One example is the outbreak of CJD in Europe, which has been attributed to the use of animal cadavers as a source of protein in feedlots. This may have been done with the best of intentions by scientists who thought that they knew what they were doing, but the consequences for many lives were disastrous. There is also a very simple analogy: scientists introduced the cane toad in an effort to eliminate insects from the cane fields of North Queensland. Of course these are not analogous, but what they demonstrate is that science wanted to produce one outcome and got an unintended consequence. As a result, cane toads have had disastrous impacts upon ecosystems right throughout Northern Australia. It would therefore be churlish to think that in this new area of stem cell research, where the potential benefits are so great, there may not be, down the line, some unforeseen consequences. 
Many people in the House—as opposed to this particular chamber—including the members for Gwydir and Warringah, have argued that this bill should be rejected because all life is sacred. The member for Warringah argued that it is imperative to protect the embryo because it cannot protect itself, but I fear that they see only the ethical debate and may just have forgotten the ethics. I will not labour the point, but there are many people in Australia and around the world who suffer needlessly and die from preventable diseases. I believe that the views of many people who oppose this bill are in themselves inherently contradictory. The member for Sturt, for example, had some very interesting views on this matter. In his speech to the parliament on the bill, he said:
To me, and scientifically, a one-cell embryo has every aspect that is required to form a human being that I have or that you have ...
However, he had no difficulty with the fact that the excess embryos created through assisted reproductive technology will ultimately die. He claims:
There is a profound moral difference between killing and letting die.
He went on to say:
There is a vast difference between treating those embryos with that respect and using them for scientific purposes to create human embryonic stem cell lines that destroy and kill the embryo in the process.
A question has been raised—indeed, the previous speaker raised it—about when an embryo becomes a person. If we accept that embryos are in every way human, as the previous speaker said, surely and logically it is morally repugnant to create embryos that will ultimately die. If we were to adopt that position we would have to ban all forms of assisted reproductive technology currently being used. To accept the position that an embryo is human and that embryos will be destroyed in the process of this reproductive technology at the same time as supporting that technology is, in my view, to tacitly condone euthanasia. It is to say that embryos destroyed in the process of assisted reproductive technology are human beings and are expendable. It is to say that the death of many human beings is justifiable by the creation of a very few. This argument, to me, is untenable, and I would have thought it puts the proponents of it in a moral dilemma. 
I have not heard anyone in this House argue that we should ban assisted reproductive technologies and deny some couples the ultimate joy of parenthood. But this is a moral and, to some, a religious debate; it is not a debate that is resolved by religion but one that exists within the religious traditions. The member for Flinders succinctly outlined the debate that continues within the Catholic traditions. I am not going to repeat it here because time will not permit, but I think he gave a very good analysis of the Catholic tradition changing as a result of a decision made by Pope Leo XIII in 1887, which effectively changed Catholic doctrine.
My judgment in this matter comes down to the real question that this bill is asking us. The member for Aston crystallised the question when he said:
We are not being asked to determine the fate of these embryos. Whatever we decide, their fate is to be destroyed. We are only asked to determine how they should be destroyed: as part of a research program to benefit future generations or simply as discarded waste product.
It seems to me that those who would oppose this legislation on the basis that we should not use these excess embryos for research and who use the theological and ethical arguments they have been wont to use are contradicting themselves. It seems to me that you cannot have it both ways: either you sustain all embryos or you do not. If you are going to allow them to die, as has been said by others, then it seems to me that the moral dilemma is not so great. Do you tacitly euthanase by exposing these cells so that they just wither or do you intervene? My view is that humankind demands that we intervene and that we maximise the opportunities that would result from this research and from the exploitation of a very few, a very small number of excess embryos, of the tens of thousands of excess embryos that exist and the tens of thousands of excess embryos that will ultimately wither.
I was going to illustrate in some detail the contradiction between the views of those who oppose this legislation and where they stand in support of other human life. And I was going to detail how, on the one hand, the moral strength of their argument is pinned on this issue of the value of human life yet, on the other hand, we cannot bring ourselves, as a nation, to deal with the human lives being lost every day to poor health in Indigenous communities in Australia. I would have thought there was some logic in the view that, if you accept the propositions some opponents of this legislation put, we should be doing a lot more about that suffering here in Australia and about the people who are suffering in other parts of the world. 
To those who would argue for passion and emotion to be taken out of this debate, I would quote the member for Fremantle, who said of this debate:
It is about our common human feelings and there have to be emotions in these debates; otherwise we are simply ciphers and we should hand the debate over to a computer.
After much thought, I have decided to support this legislation fundamentally because it is my view that, if these embryos are to be destroyed in any event, we have an obligation to use them to benefit the living. This is not the thin end of the wedge; the parliament has shown this time after time. I believe that we will demonstrate again through this debate that we are capable of making the tough moral decisions, and I believe this parliament will continue to make the tough moral decisions and reflect the wider community's view. However, I still say that this debate should be conducted in the main chamber.

"Costello, Peter, MP",LP,2002-08-26,"—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(1)	The General Insurance Code of Practice (the Code) is an industry-based, self-regulatory code for general insurers that is administered by the Insurance Council of Australia.
Members of the Insurance Council of Australia must adhere to the General Insurance Code of Practice, which sets out requirements such as proper training of staff, plain language wording and internal dispute handling procedures. 
The Code was approved by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) on 3 August 2000 pursuant to subsection 12FA(1) of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 1989 and section 113 of the Insurance Act 1973.
(2)	and (3) The Code covers contracts of insurance which are prescribed contracts under section 34 of the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 and include travel insurance.
Travel insurance is defined as contracts that provide insurance cover in respect of a sickness or disease contracted or an injury sustained by the insured person while on the specified journey.
(4)	The General Insurance Code of Practice is the only industry-based code of practice approved by ASIC under s113 of the Insurance Act 1973 for general insurers.
(5)	The activities of general insurers are governed by a range of laws, including the Insurance Act 1973, the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 and the Corporations Act 2002 (including those amendments introduced by the Financial Services Reform Act 2001).
These Acts include a range of sanctions which apply where breaches occur.
In addition to the sanctions available under this legislation, consumers with complaints about general insurers have access to the General Insurance Enquiries and Complaints Scheme.  The GIEC is a national Scheme for consumers aimed at resolving disputes between insureds and their insurance companies.
(6)	Refer answer to question 5.
(7)	There is no need for an inquiry into the ambit of the code. The new Financial Services Reform Act 2001 (FSRA) regime provides a comprehensive product disclosure regime aimed at ensuring retail consumers have sufficient relevant, accurate and timely information to make informed decisions about financial products, including information about the significant benefits and risks associated with the product.  FSRA also provides a licensing, conduct (including training) and disclosure regime for financial service providers.  In order to obtain a licence to provide financial services to retail clients, a financial service provider must have in place adequate internal and external dispute resolution procedures.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Insurance Council of Australia: Code of Practice</title>,Answers to Questions in Writing,27,1,answer
