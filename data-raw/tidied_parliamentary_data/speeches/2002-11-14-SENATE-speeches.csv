"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2002-11-14,"—I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:
That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (7) of standing order 111 not apply to the following bills, allowing them to be considered during this period of sittings:
Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002,
Australian Heritage Council Bill 2002, and
Australian Heritage Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2002.
I also table a statement of reasons justifying the need for these bills to be considered during these sittings and seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
Purpose of the Bills
These Bills will: 
·	establish a Commonwealth heritage regime that will focus on matters of national significance and Commonwealth responsibility;
·	list, protect and manage places of national heritage significance in a National Heritage List using a process of community consultation, expert advice and ministerial responsibility;
·	list, protect and manage heritage places in Commonwealth areas in a Commonwealth Heritage List using a process of community consultation, expert advice and ministerial responsibility;
·	advise Commonwealth agencies on actions in relation to places in the Commonwealth Heritage List; 
·	establish the Australian Heritage Council, prescribing the composition, meeting requirements and functions of the Council in relation to the protection and conservation of heritage; and
·	repeal the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975, provide for transitional arrangements and amend other Commonwealth legislation as required.
Reasons for Urgency
This legislative package is the final plank in the Commonwealth's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act), the Commonwealth's most fundamental reform of Commonwealth environment laws. National heritage places remain the only matter of national environmental significance that has yet to be included in the EPBC Act. This represents a major anomaly that needs to be addressed in order for the legislation to be fully effective and comprehensive. The inclusion of a heritage trigger in the EPBC Act will provide stronger protection for Australian's nationally significant heritage places, Commonwealth heritage places and provide more streamlined and efficient heritage assessment and approvals processes. These Bills will implement the 1997 COAG Heads of Agreement on Commonwealth/State Roles and Responsibilities for the Environment and the Government's 2001 election commitments in relation to heritage.
Furthermore, there is currently duplication in the requirement on Commonwealth agencies to refer proposals for advice as a consequence of the concurrent operation of the EPBC Act and the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975 (AHC Act). This has lead to confusion among stakeholders, an increased burden on agencies and a considerable impact on administrative resources. The expeditious passage of the new heritage legislation will lead to the repeal of the AHC Act and thus the early removal of this onerous requirement on Commonwealth agencies.
The Bills were originally introduced into Parliament in December 2000 and referred to the Senate's Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee which handed down its report in May 2001. Since that time, a number of amendments have been made to the Bills to accommodate a number of the Committee's recommendations such as retention of the Register of the National Estate and the incorporation of best practice heritage management by Commonwealth agencies. 
The Bills are the result of six years of consultation with government, non-government, industry, Indigenous and community bodies. After so many years of public debate, there is a high level of community interest in the legislation and a widespread expectation that it will be passed in the current session of Parliament.
State and Territory jurisdictions have commenced work on an integrated heritage strategy which is contingent on the establishment of the new heritage regime. If passage of the legislation is delayed any further, it will lead to consequential delays in the ability of other jurisdictions to implement their reforms.

The statements read as follows—
AUSTRALIAN CRIME COMMISSION ESTABLISHMENT Bill 2002
Purpose of the Bill
The Bill will create the Australian Crime Commission to replace the National Crime Authority.
Reasons for Urgency
The Commonwealth and States and Territories made an agreement on terrorism and multi-jurisdictional crime at the COAG meeting of 5 April 2002. In relation to organised crime, it was agreed to replace the National Crime Authority (NCA) with an Australian Crime Commission (ACC) `that builds on the important features of the NCA for effective national law enforcement operation in partnerships with State and Territory police forces whilst removing the current barriers to its effectiveness.'
The Commonwealth and States and Territories also agreed that the ACC would come into operation by 31 December 2002. The ACC will be a Commonwealth body but, because of the cross-jurisdictional nature of the ACC's operations, complementary State and Territory legislation will also require amendment. Commonwealth legislation will need to be amended before 31 December in order for it to be interoperable with legislation in each State and Territory so that the ACC can commence operations by the end of the year.

NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (CONSOLIDATION AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL (No. 1) 2002
NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (FRANKING DEFICIT TAX) AMENDMENT BILL 2002
Purpose of the Bills
The consolidation regime allows groups to operate as a single entity for income tax purposes and thereby lodge a single tax return. The Bills are the next in a series of Bills that include provisions to establish the consolidation regime in the tax law. The Bills contain legislation for parts of the regime not dealt with in the previous two Bills.
The Bills also make certain consequential amendments following the introduction of the new simplified imputation system.
Reasons for Urgency
The consolidation regime and the simplified imputation system commenced on 
1 July 2002 and it is therefore important that the measures in this Bill are enacted as soon as possible to enable taxpayers and their advisers to put arrangements in place for the 2002-2003 income year.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-11-14,"—While there are discussions taking place between ministers, I remind honourable senators that the importance of the amendment is to prohibit the importation and exportation of products or components derived from a human embryo clone. We are talking about placing a ban on all forms of human cloning in Australia. On the one hand we are doing that but, unless my amendment is adopted, on the other hand we are leaving open the importation of stem cells from human embryo clones. This could be done from a number of places, including Singapore and at this time the UK. This would completely undermine the ban on cloning that is proposed in this legislation. We have to fix it up somehow or another.
I remind honourable senators and people listening that this is not a theoretical question at all. I quote from the Australian of 1 April a report about Dr Peter Mountford, Chief Executive of Stem Cell Sciences. He spoke out strongly in favour of so-called therapeutic cloning. The report says:
Dr Mountford has never produced a human embryo, but holds a patent on technology he believes will achieve this result by the end of 2002.
That result is the cloning of a human embryo. The report goes on:
He plans to commercialise the process within two years by supplying disease-carrying embryonic stem cells to pharmaceutical companies for drug screening.  
Under this legislation, there would be nothing to stop the product derived therefrom being imported into Australia. There would be nothing to stop Dr Mountford—if what he says is achieved, if that is the word—from exporting the stem cells derived from those human embryo clones to Australia: from the UK, for example. There would be nothing to stop certain scientists that I know of, who have connections in Singapore, importing such human embryo clones—that is, of course, if they ever get away with it technically. It is a serious matter and it is a practical problem because what is the use of banning cloning in Australia when you leave the gate open to receive them from overseas? I know this is exercising the minds of honourable senators, but if we are all at one in attempting to impose this ban then we should do it. We just cannot do that and wash our hands of what happens with regard to imports from overseas. We have not washed our hands of that completely because—I remind the Senate—we do in this legislation ban the imports and exports of human embryo clones. So we do that much, but we will not go to the next obvious step to protect the system by banning the importation of stem cells derived from those clones.
I have just a couple of words more. I did get a bit concerned when I heard what the minister had said on `advice'. Now that I have read it in Hansard, I am even more concerned. The minister stated—and they were her words: 
My advice is—
and presumably that was obtained from NHMRC, and this is worrying—
that COAG decided that the legislation does not extend to stem cells and that the regulation of imported and locally made stem cells should be regulated according to NHMRC guidelines. 
Of course, the importation has got nothing to do with NHMRC guidelines, and they are inadequate anyhow. So that did concern me and it would be a rather brave Premier, I would have thought, particularly one who might be going for an election at the moment, who would say, `No, we don't mind the importation of stem cells derived from cloned embryos,' notwithstanding the fact that it undermines the whole purpose of this legislation. So, in short, we are faced with a real problem unless we do something, in some way, to fix this problem.
 (Senator Brandis)—Is it the wish of the committee to return to the consideration of amendments (3) and (4) standing in the name of Senator Harradine and postponed on 12 November? I take it that it is. The question then is that the amendments be agreed to.

I request the time to defer and then I might, perhaps, respond.",SENATE,<title>PROHIBITION OF HUMAN CLONING BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-11-14,"—I am not sure if it was last night or yesterday, but when this clause came up and we deferred it I said I understood the motive behind the amendment and that we would not be supporting it, and I did admit yesterday that I had a concern about that. I had spoken in my speech on the second reading about consistency and that that posed some difficulty for some people who are supporting the bill. In order to address that in some way, I had a meeting with the Prime Minister yesterday morning and my staff met again with the Prime Minister's staff yesterday afternoon. I appreciate very much that the Prime Minister took the time to see me and to give me the opportunity to say what had happened in the chamber. I think that speaks highly of the fact that this is the sort of debate it is a shame we cannot have more often and that he listened to the concerns of some of the people making a contribution.
Despite not supporting Senator Harradine's amendments, I would now like to announce that it is the government's intention to amend the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations to implement a ban on the import of viable materials derived from human embryo clones. This would include stem cells derived from human embryo clones and would be reviewed in 12 months. This gives us time to think about the issues that have been raised and to discuss in more detail this issue. This is in addition to the changes foreshadowed last night—or the night before—to the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations to implement a 12-month prohibition on the export of human embryos. 
On both these changes to customs regulations, I would also like to advise that government members will be exercising a conscience vote. I remind senators that it is already an offence to export or import human embryo clones under the Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill. It is not necessary to explicitly prohibit the export of stem cells derived from human embryo clones, since under the Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill it is an offence within Australia to create, develop or import a human embryo clone. Therefore, it should not be possible to derive and subsequently export stem cells from human embryo clones.",SENATE,<title>PROHIBITION OF HUMAN CLONING BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-11-14,"—The other night an important issue arose in this debate concerning the import and export of cloned human embryos. I can see why Senator Harradine sees the need to move his amendment, and I think that the minister's adjournment of the matter was wise, because of the importance of this issue. I note what the minister has said. Although it is frustrating to adjourn matters to discuss things, this is so important that I think it was worth while, and the discussions that the minister had were indeed worth while. After discussions with government I, as the Minister for Justice and Customs, can say that the government will be amending the Customs (Prohibited Import) Regulations to implement a ban on the import of viable materials derived from human embryo clones. This would include stem cells derived from human embryo clones and would be reviewed in 12 months.
That means that this regulation will stand in place until otherwise revoked. There will be a regulation in place that will ban the import of viable materials derived from human embryo clones as well as stem cells derived from human embryo clones. This works in tandem with clause 11 of the Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill, which prohibits the import of cloned human embryos. As far as importation goes, we will now cover the field from the importation of human embryo clones at the one end to the components or the stem cells or the viable material which has come from human embryo clones at the other. To that extent, I would commend that approach to the Senate. As well as that, the Prime Minister has announced that, in the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations, the government will implement a 12-month prohibition on the export of human embryos. That is across the board. There will be a review to look at that in the meanwhile. Of course, there is nothing to stop the Senate from reviewing it as well under its own processes, in a Senate committee approach. There is nothing to stop the Senate from reviewing any of this as it sees fit.
As the minister has said on the changes to the customs regulations, members of the government will be allowed to exercise a conscience vote. One question that has been raised is in relation to the export provisions. Under clause 11 of the Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill, the export of a cloned human embryo is banned. What of other components? As the minister has said, it is not necessary to explicitly prohibit the export of stem cells derived from those human embryo clones, because under this very bill it is an offence to create, develop or import a human embryo clone, and therefore it would not be possible to legally derive and subsequently export stem cells from a human embryo clone. We have a situation which accommodates the concerns of those who want to see the field covered in relation to the import and export of human embryo clones and material derived from them. I can see why Senator Harradine moved his amendment. I think there is merit in such an amendment, but I believe that with these regulations we can cover the field. On that basis, I will not seek to pursue my amendment which has been circulated in the chamber.",SENATE,<title>PROHIBITION OF HUMAN CLONING BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2002-11-14,"—I thank both ministers for their contributions. I have a question for Senator Ellison in relation to the amendments he has proposed to the Customs Act, I believe. My question relates to the definition of viable materials. My understanding is that the minister in his explanation specified that this would include stem cells. I do not want to misrepresent the minister's contribution. That is why I seek clarification. Minister, the amendment, as you outlined it to the chamber, involves `viable materials'. What does that mean? How could that be defined? I am presuming that stem cells are only one part of what you would define as viable materials. Am I on the wrong track? I just want to get clarification of the wording and what it actually means. I had sympathy similar to the minister's with the intent of Senator Harradine's amendments, for the same reasons. I was concerned not only about consistency but about the fact that in this chamber we have deplored the notion of human reproductive cloning, and thus the legislation— 
—That was what I was meaning by consistency.
—I am agreeing with you. 
—But you said there wasn't consistency—
—No, I said I was concerned not only because of consistency but for a whole range of ethical and other reasons. My concern with the original amendments put forward by Senator Harradine—which I understand was also the government's concern—was the broad-ranging nature of the amendment. By that I mean the terminology in relation to products and whether or not that took into account everything from intellectual property through to stem cells et cetera.
I guess one of the things that we were discussing both in the chamber and behind the scenes with all senators involved in this debate was whether we could achieve the intent of those amendments but perhaps with a tightening of the definitions. I wonder if that has been achieved by the amendments that Senator Ellison is proposing or whether we still have some issues that we have to confront when we use terminology such as `viable materials'.",SENATE,<title>PROHIBITION OF HUMAN CLONING BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-11-14,"—I do not think you can get into much more detail other than the description of viable materials. I think it is a matter which speaks for itself: it is any material derived from a human embryo clone which is viable. What would one attribute to the word `viable'—something which can be used, something which is capable of being used, certainly not something which is decayed, moribund or dead? You are talking about something which can be used and the limits of science, I guess. It would certainly include stem cells—we have mentioned that in particular, though. It would include any living product from any part of the embryo—I think Senator Harradine has used the word `components'—and any culture from a cloned embryo. There is a definite description; the term speaks for itself.
—I was wondering whether you had anything in particular in mind to do with stem cells.
—`Stem cells' and `part of the embryo' are examples of pieces of viable material from a cloned embryo.",SENATE,<title>PROHIBITION OF HUMAN CLONING BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2002-11-14,"—I made an earlier contribution on this issue, and I have a concern in relation to consistency—although I would probably use the stronger word of `hypocrisy'—if we were to go down the path of having this position of being prepared to have a general and, as we have been told by the political debate and by COAG, strong ban and then allow, or perhaps encourage, similar behaviour internationally by preparedness to accept the products of that behaviour into the country. I would firstly like to commend the Minister for Health and Ageing. I know that the advice she received through our normal processes was contrary to the position that is now being developed, and she should be commended for being prepared to take on that issue and take it to the Prime Minister. I hope that that will be characteristic of what will happen with some of the other issues that we are likely to have to work through in the next bill as well.
I indicate firstly, though, that I am generally happy with the proposal that the government has put to resolve this issue. However, if Senator Harradine is persisting with his amendments I will maintain support of those, for one main reason, which relates to my comments on this issue the other day. We had the situation in Victoria where we had a strong ban on research on embryos and Professor Trounson was able to utilise a loophole to import embryonic stem cells from Singapore into Australia. His ability to do that has been used by some as a reason—not necessarily the complete reason—for no longer maintaining that ban in Victoria. I have already made the point that it was perhaps difficult within the Victorian jurisdiction to deal with the importation issue, particularly in a national environment which was void of regulation or legislation in other states. But I prefer to see a clear message on this issue within this legislation, if that is at all achievable. 
I understand what the government have done, and I commend them for finding a solution to this issue but, because of the history of what occurred in Victoria, I prefer the instrument that is dealing with a ban on cloning to indicate in its full strength, clarity and consistency our position on banning and to highlight the fact that there is no hypocrisy, that there is a ban on cloning and to not involve an acceptance of that practice, whether it be in Australia or overseas.",SENATE,<title>PROHIBITION OF HUMAN CLONING BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-11-14,"—First of all, I am getting a bit concerned about the use by Senator Stott Despoja of the term `reproductive cloning'. This bill bans all forms of cloning. Is she saying that there are some forms of cloning—
—No, I am not, Senator Harradine.
—Senator Stott Despoja, you always deliberately say `reproductive cloning', leaving the gate open for so-called therapeutic cloning, the type of cloning that has been mentioned by Dr Peter Mountford, the chief executive officer of Stem Cell Sciences. He wants to do so-called therapeutic cloning—that means production of human embryo clones so he can commercialise the process within two years by supplying disease-carrying embryonic stem cells from those clones to pharmaceutical companies for drug screening. The process is exactly the same whether you call it reproductive cloning or so-called therapeutic cloning, a term that is completely deceptive so far as its effect on human embryos is concerned—it is hardly therapeutic for the embryo that is cloned or developed for that purpose.
We really have to be quite open as to what we are saying in this debate. Is it a fact, as I suspect it is, that this legislation will pave the way for such cloning by the use of the review system, which will be a private review undertaken by ministerially appointed members? Let us be open as to what we mean.
I want to formally acknowledge—and I hope she is listening—the fact that Senator Patterson is doing a difficult job and she was obviously thinking very deeply about the matter. I understand the situation, and I think she acted in the entirely proper manner and the entirely parliamentary manner to take the opportunity to postpone the clauses so that she could express her views to various people, including the Prime Minister.
We are all after the same approach when it comes to this question of import and export. The clarification made by Senator Ellison, the Minister for Justice and Customs, has also been very much appreciated. Whilst I would like to see this in the legislation, I will nevertheless be looking forward to what comes forward in the amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations and the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations. I would like the minister to explain again what is meant by that 12 months. When is it likely that these regulations will come into effect?",SENATE,<title>PROHIBITION OF HUMAN CLONING BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-11-14,"—The Prime Minister has said that the regulation in relation to the export of embryos would be extant for 12 months. So it would be a finite term, and there would be a review in the meanwhile. The regulation in relation to the import of viable materials derived from human embryo clones and stem cells derived from human embryo clones would stand until revoked. That is different from the statement in relation to the export of embryos. And, of course, there will be the review as well. 
In relation to the question of this going into regulation I, as the minister, would seek to have it put into regulation as soon as possible. Regulations can be implemented expeditiously, but I would want to make sure that the wording was appropriate and in accordance with the statements that have been made. I would seek to have that done as soon as possible. I cannot give the Senate any more definite a time than that, but I would be very keen to see these regulations in place.",SENATE,<title>PROHIBITION OF HUMAN CLONING BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2002-11-14,"—I know that Senator Harradine's intention was to provoke me to respond and, yes, I am provoked. I will put this on record very simply, because Senator Harradine, I hope, is aware of the comments that I have made not only in my contribution to the committee report on this bill but also in my speech in the second reading debate on both pieces of legislation. As Senator Harradine is more than aware, I and many others have recognised that the distinctions between the terminologies of reproductive and therapeutic cloning are not always helpful. I possibly used the terminology `human reproductive cloning' more out of habit than anything else. Throughout my Senate career— particularly since 1997 and, of course, since the advent of Dolly the sheep—I have been an interested spectator in this debate and have been interested in prohibiting what at one stage was known as human reproductive cloning. Rather than take issue with Senator Harradine's specific points now—although I do find it extraordinary that it took Senator Harradine a couple of minutes into my speech in the second reading debate to claim that I was in some way impugning him when I was making a general comment on Senate committee processes—I will say that he has no qualms about misrepresenting me in this debate.
I think Senator Harradine has made very good points during the committee process and more generally, as did others in their presentations to the committee, that `therapeutic cloning' is a misleading term. As I noted in the committee report and said in my speech the other day, the term `therapeutic cloning' collapses both therapeutic and non-therapeutic research on embryos and also the distinction between destructive and non-destructive research on embryos. So I think there is good reason to call for—and I acknowledge Senator Harradine has done this, as have I—more specific and clarified terminology in this debate. I think you know, Senator Harradine, that I am conscious of the distinctions and I am not intending to mislead the parliament when I use the terminology `human reproductive cloning'. I think that was a mischievous point and I would like us to get back to the issue at hand, which was the specific amendments the government has put forward which the Australian Democrats will be supporting.",SENATE,<title>PROHIBITION OF HUMAN CLONING BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2002-11-14,"—I just want to indicate on behalf of the Australian Labor Party that we will not be supporting Senator Harradine's amendments. We were aware of the concerns being raised during the debate in relation to the export and import of human embryo clones and products derived from them. We supported the deferment to allow some progress that was being made around the chamber on those issues. We understood that those concerns were legitimate and genuinely held and that there was a need to work through some of those issues.
As we now know today, the response of the government has been to announce that there will be two amendments to the customs regulations: firstly, to ban the export of human embryos for 12 months subject to further review and, secondly, and more particularly, to ban the import of viable material derived from human embryos and clones, subject to a more comprehensive review in 12 months. I think Senator Ellison just gave some more detail on that. I think that is a reasonable response from the government. It seeks to address the concerns that have been raised, but it does not substantially depart from the national approach which was agreed by COAG and which these bills seek to implement. For those reasons the Australian Labor Party's formal position will be to support the approach that the government has indicated it will take and to oppose Senator Harradine's amendments, but, as I have indicated on all other issues in this debate, Labor senators will obviously be able to have a conscience vote on those matters. The formal Labor Party view will be to oppose Senator Harradine's amendments and to welcome the response given by the government in relation to the customs regulations to be formulated.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-11-14,"—I did not want to provoke Senator Stott Despoja; I simply wanted her to place on record what her views are. She deliberately used the words `reproductive cloning'. She knows as well as I do that there has been an attempt to make a distinction between so-called therapeutic cloning and reproductive cloning. I am aware that she understands the difference. I am not trying to misrepresent her. I am simply saying that she only used the words `reproductive cloning'. If you like, all cloning is reproductive cloning, because you are reproducing a clone of a particular individual. Different things can happen with that clone—either it can be transferred and placed into the body of a woman or it can be harvested for stem cells and destroyed. What I would be interested in—and I still have not heard this—is whether that type of so-called reproductive cloning that is stressed by Dr Mountford is the type that she may support.
What worries me about this review is that, at the end of the day, there will be certain scientists who go along and say, `We find that we cannot use this stem cell research on patients because the stem cells are histo-incompatible with the patient.' Those cells will create an immune response in that patient, so they will be looking for so-called histo-compatible stem cells. The obvious stem cells to use there are adult stem cells. But there is this push to develop cloned human embryos using the somatic cell nuclear transfer process—using a somatic cell from a particular patient so that a little clone of the patient is created, or this is the theory. As a result, they will attempt—and I underline that word—certain therapies. This is a very major question. I did not want to misrepresent Senator Stott Despoja, but I just wanted to see precisely why she used the words `reproductive cloning'. I thought we were against all forms of cloning if we were fair dinkum about this bill, because this bill bans all forms of cloning.

— That is for you to decide, Senator Harradine.
—Thank you; it is not relevant here.
Bill, as amended, agreed to.
Bill reported with amendments; report adopted.",SENATE,<title>PROHIBITION OF HUMAN CLONING BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2002-11-14,"—I commence this discussion in committee of the Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002 with some general comments on how I hope we will be able to proceed with amendments and, indeed, on the character of at least some of those amendments, particularly the set of amendments that I will be moving. There are certainly some aspects of Senator Bishop's amendments, which we will be commencing with in a moment, that I have worked on with Senator Bishop and facilitated through the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry on this bill, but I hope it will facilitate senators' responses in considering the many matters that will be raised during this committee stage debate to contemplate the general approach that has been taken to amendments with this bill. 
Whilst it was clear in the second reading debate that some senators opposed this bill outright, there is in a sense—at least from my perspective and that of some of my colleagues—a view that, if it is the wish of the Senate to allow research on human embryos, it is the Senate's task to ensure that the COAG intention that we have a strict regulatory regime put in place is fulfilled. This bill has been through an interesting process, and I think many senators will be reflecting in the course of this debate on different aspects of that process. But the desire at this stage and in this debate is quite clearly to ensure that we will have a strict regulatory regime in relation to this conduct. That is certainly my intention.
I have a particular perspective on that issue because I come from a state where, to date, there has been an outright ban. At the same time I reflect that, during the deliberations of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, there were several concerns—and COAG itself reflects this—about how the current guidelines do not strictly regulate this practice in those states that do allow research on human embryos. We discovered during the committee hearings that these current guidelines will in fact underpin several key criteria in this bill. In Victoria, for instance, if the bill is passed as it is currently framed and until some aspects of the bill are put in place—such as the guidelines that are, at this point in time, nowhere near detailed presentation—we will be going from an outright ban to the more liberal or laissez-faire approach that has been applied in some other states.
There are other aspects of this bill on which I have been quite conscious of trying to find ways of highlighting the point that my perspective is not just that of someone who is opposed outright to this conduct. This is a reasonable perspective on some problems with the way the bill is drafted at the moment, because it does not meet the COAG intention of a strict regulatory regime. Some of the amendments moved by Senator Bishop and me, and by some of the other senators, have deliberately gone back to that COAG communique and said: `This is what COAG said but this is not in the bill. We think that we should go back to COAG and implement the full intention of COAG.' Some other approaches have said, `COAG is silent on this issue, but standard legislative practice would deal with this issue in this way.'
For reasons that are either unsatisfactory—as discovered in the Senate committee process—or unexplained, the bill takes a different path. We will seek to address the problems we see in how the bill meets the intention of a strict regulatory regime. I am not aware at this stage of a single amendment that seeks to go to the position of a ban on this behaviour by default. I do not believe that there is a single amendment in this pack that seeks to go back to that position. It is up to each senator to appraise the merit of any issue on a case-by-case basis. Some will obviously be better informed than others because they were able to participate in the committee process. I particularly encourage senators to look at the issue of the current NHMRC guidelines, because there is a position being put at the moment that the current NHMRC guidelines impose good, strong, solid controls.
The reality is that these guidelines are based on voluntary guidelines that have been in place in most states that have not had a ban on research involving human embryos. When, in the Senate committee process, we tried to get to the bottom of what those guidelines were, we went through what was referred to in the bill. It simply refers to earlier guidelines. We went to the earlier guidelines, and they indicate quite a number of things, but there is now an interim note that relates to behaviour that also then refers back to those guidelines. During the committee process the NHMRC actually had to correct their earlier advice to the committee about precisely where the guidelines were at and how they applied—and I thank them for that correction. The position on the current state of play is meshed in the guidelines, and we need to fix that. The bill, as currently framed, does not do that. At the same time, the very concerns that COAG had when they said, `We think it is best to have a good, strong, national framework,' were in part the concerns they had with how that framework was being applied in the states that do not regulate the field. 
Let me give the Senate one very brief example of that. We were told by the NHMRC that the guidelines, which have been in place since 1996, were under review; that they had been through the first phase of review; and that it was close to, if not at, the stage of being able to report back on stage 1 of the review. That then would be essentially dealt with on a draft basis and there would be a further stage of consultation beyond that before we could see how some key parameters in the bill are meant to be interpreted. I do not need to lecture senators about the best way to legislate. I think we all appreciate that, if at all possible, it is best to define key parameters of a bill in the bill—or, if indeed we need to take the benefit of expert advice, to allow that advice to be given and then act upon it.
The biggest concern I have is that, when the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee sought to understand how the current guidelines were being applied—because they were under review—the answer we got back was, `Sorry, we can't tell you how these guidelines are being applied, because we don't know and there is no framework for us to ascertain that information.' About the only information they could give us was that, since the interim note, they could consult health ethics committees and ask them to tell us how they had applied the guidelines in a couple of cases. The Senate ultimately got some information from Monash about how they applied the guidelines to the imported Singaporean stem cell lines. That is the state of knowledge about how these guidelines, which have been in place since 1996, have been applied. I think that should be of considerable concern to the Senate because those guidelines, we are told, are to underpin some key phrases in the bill.
One of my concerns with the debate to date—and I noticed this in a letter to the editor in the Australian today—is that there is some misunderstanding of the character of this debate. There is a view that parliament, or the Senate, is attacking the ethics of scientists. That is not the point—it is a long way from the point. As a collective group, scientists probably have ethics that are—and I am sure the general public thinks this—far better than politicians. The point is that scientists are humans. I will probably be attacked for my Catholicism on this point, but human nature will mean there will always be some who will seek to exploit a system. Our job in this debate is to try to create a regime, consistent with COAG's intention, that is strong, that is rigid and that will minimise the ability for humans, whether they be scientists or not, to act dishonourably if it is their intention to do so—we will be able to deal with that. That is our task; it is not to sling mud at particular scientists. The only occasions on which I have referred to such issues have been where they have demonstrated past problems that we need to rectify now.
I have been particularly conscious of how we as a Senate take account of the ethical issues—not from a religious background but far more from a secular approach. I have been particularly mindful, as we have been able to glean it—and sometimes it has been very hard to glean it because of the process; and I will probably reflect on that later—of the views expressed by the Australian Health Ethics Committee, within the NHMRC. Where they have proposed concerns and advice on how to rectify those concerns, I have listened carefully. In some cases my amendments have acted on that advice. You can see, in some of the dialogue we have had, that there has been a standard bureaucratic NHMRC response to the AHEC position on some issues. For the Senate's benefit, I will go to an example of one of those.
One of the issues that the Australian Health Ethics Committee raised in relation to this bill, and that my amendments deal with, is that, without further describing the parameters of a significant gain in knowledge and other similarly grey areas of the bill—for example, those open to interpretation such as proper consent—the proposed regulatory regime will not deliver the strict requirements of the COAG decision. This was, at least at one stage, a considered view of the Australian Health Ethics Committee. The response we had from the NHMRC was that AHEC executives should be reassured by the fact that the licensing committee will be relying on AHEC guidelines for the interpretation of these issues. The point is that it should not be the Australian Health Ethics Committee's guidelines that determine how we interpret a bill; it should be the parliament that determines how we interpret a bill. I am quite happy to take the NHMRC's and AHEC's advice on how to deal with interpretational issues, but it should ultimately be the parliament that determines the interpretations or the meanings in legislation. 
So some of my amendments are framed to deal with some of those issues from an ethical position based on advice from organisations such as AHEC, which are dealing with the day to day ethical issues around medical science. They are not coming from a particular religious perspective. I am trying to grapple with the notion of how we apply ethics in this type of field. The committee itself did that. There was a dialogue in the committee chair's report on an ethical `third way' position. Unfortunately, there is no theological, ethical or philosophical basis for the dialogue in the chair's report, and I note that Senator McLucas and Senator Stott Despoja sought to give a more considered and broader position on some of that debate.
But my point is that that debate is in its infancy. The only other alternative I can find from an ethical position in dealing with these issues is, in many senses, to go to somewhere like the Australian Health Ethics Committee. I have sought to bring some element of independence when we have contemplated the ethics of some of these issues, quite mindful of the fact that people often try to resort to religious fundamentalism as an excuse not to consider an argument. I have been accused of being a staunch, rigid Catholic for years—something I have never been. These are not the points and I hope people will take these factors into account. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2002-11-14,"—I move amendment (1) on sheet 2689 revised:
(1)	Clause 3, page 2 (lines 12 to 17), omit the clause, substitute:
3  Object of Act
		The object of this Act is to address concerns, including ethical concerns, about scientific developments in relation to human reproduction and the utilisation of human embryos by:
	(a)	regulating activities that involve the use of certain human embryos created by assisted reproductive technology; and
	(b)	limiting the number of human embryos used in those regulated activities to the minimum necessary to achieve the purposes of those activities.
This amendment is to the objects clause of the Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002, one of the more critical clauses if the bill should ever be the subject of interpretation in the courts and the meaning is unclear as to its intent from a plain and literal reading of a particular clause of the bill. One of the established ways that a court determines the purpose or intent of a bill is to have regard to the objects clause of the bill. So, for that and other reasons, the objects clause is important. One of the deficiencies I have identified in the objects clause of the bill is that it does not include any requirement or objective to minimise or restrict the number of human embryos that will be destroyed or the various processes that are authorised or permitted under the bill.
When I first became aware of that situation it struck me as odd because the process by which the bill was put together, the guidelines for the drafting of the bill, if you like, derived from the work carried out under the authority of the Commonwealth and various state governments, which was then publicly released in the COAG communique. If you refer to the many comments that the Minister for Health and Ageing, who is at the table, has made in this debate, and indeed to the fundamental and guiding position of the Australian Labor Party in determining its position in this debate, they are based on what is in the COAG communique. If something was in the COAG communique, then, prima facie, high regard was had for it and it was to be included. If something was deliberately omitted from the COAG communique, it was the position of the government and the position of the Australian Labor Party that the matter would not be considered because it was not part of the COAG process or the COAG communique. 
That is a narrow framework, and I will address the restrictions that that necessarily implies in other forums within the Australian Labor Party in due course, because by definition such a restrictive approach is completely and fundamentally at odds with parliamentarians being able to have a conscience vote on any issue. A narrow framework that has been agreed to in advance and that cannot be departed from necessarily prevents proper consideration on a merit basis of the issue at hand, apart from the mechanical process of exercising the right to vote. A conscience vote means more than just the vote itself; it means a conscientious approach, an impartial approach and a deliberative approach to the issue at hand. This whole process has been perverted and is not being allowed to occur, because both of the major parties are having high regard for the COAG communique and the deliberations of COAG. Having said that, I refer to the introductory paragraph to appendix 1 in the COAG communique where it says:
Governments agree to put in place a strict regulatory regime under nationally-consistent legislation and administered by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) as the national regulatory and licensing body.
...	...	...
... and that the approval is given on a case by case basis that ...
...	...	...
the procedure involves a restricted number of embryos and a separate account of the use of each embryo is provided to the ethics committee and the national licensing body;
So the officials, the various state premiers and the Prime Minister deliberately and specifically included in their communique the reference to a minimal number of embryos being used. Again I stress that it says, `The procedure involves a restricted number of embryos.' For reasons that are not yet clear, and perhaps the minister will explain, the government has determined that it is not necessary for that reference in the COAG communique to be included in the bill. It is that omission, that deficiency, that gives rise to this amendment. The COAG decision, which this legislation is meant to reflect, stated that in the regulatory regime for the licensing of research involving the destruction of human embryos, a licence would only be issued on a case by case basis provided that `the procedure involves a restricted number of embryos'. As I say, that decision has not been included in the bill and the amendment that is before the chair now for discussion seeks to add those words.
This issue of why a reference that was determined by COAG was omitted presumably will be responded to by the minister in due course. But it is worth putting on the record that throughout the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee hearing, throughout the evidence on public record of all of the witnesses and throughout all of the submissions—1,800 in total—that were received by the committee, from memory, there was not even one submission that advocated no limit on the number of embryos that were to be created and used in this process—not one. From memory, every person and every organisation, no matter where they stood throughout the spectrum, said that there should be a limit. Certainly there were variations in the number to be used and there were variations between organisations as to the purposes for which they were to be used, but no-one said that there should be open slather, that we should have an unlimited number of embryos, that we should have unlimited access and that we should be allowed to go into unrestricted manufacturing of embryos. They all accepted a limit.
Indeed, in the deliberations in this chamber—if one reads the speeches made during the second reading debate—it has been the repeated observation of those who argued mildly or strongly in favour of this bill that the manufacture of embryos is an unfortunate process that has to be engaged in and that those embryos that are surplus are going to be used for research purposes, medicinal purposes or in order to give hope in the future to those suffering from debilitating or life destroying diseases. But, in essence, they rationalised or argued for the acceptance of use of those embryos on the basis that there was hope or potential that in the future great good would come from the use of such objects. I do not recall any individual advocating that the embryos that were surplus from ART procedures were just a bunch of tissues—no different in nature from cutting off a piece of hair or a fingernail—and hence could be used for any purpose that the person so desired. All persons advocated restricting the number. 
This amendment does not seek to say that you cannot have access. It does not seek to limit it to a specific number. But it does seek to reflect the agreement determined by the various state premiers and the Prime Minister under advice from the various officials who put the communique together and presumably engaged in the deliberations. It presumes to reflect the overwhelming view of all persons who addressed the issue in their speeches during the second reading debate and it seeks to reflect overwhelmingly, if not totally, the evidence given to the Senate committee.
My concern is that those indicators of purpose and intent that all of those who have engaged in the process have publicly stated on the record—and indeed many people have indicated privately in discussions—are not being reflected in the bill; that is, the bill does not reflect the stated desire of those who authorised its drafting—the signatories to the COAG agreement. That is the reasoning behind this amendment. It seeks to put on the record that, as far as public policy is concerned, it is a desirable objective that the number of human embryos that are going to be destroyed for the purposes authorised under the act are to be limited. If that is not there, one asks: what is the alternative? The alternative is, by implication or because of express omission—and express omission and rejection of a critical part of the COAG communique—that public policy does support the use of an unlimited number of embryos. Those are my reasons for moving the amendment.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2002-11-14,"—I would like to support this amendment by making the case that the communique makes it very clear that we are talking about access only to embryos created before 5 April 2002. I also point out that clause 21(4)(a) of the bill specifically provides that the NHMRC Licensing Committee must have regard to `the number of excess ART embryos likely to be necessary'. In clause 24(5)(b) it says that the conditions specified in the licence may include conditions relating to `the number of excess ART embryos in respect of which' et cetera. So the issue of quantity and numbers is very much part of this bill. I think it is clear from the communique that the Prime Minister, the premiers and the chief ministers were concerned to regulate with respect to that matter. That is specifically why this whole arrangement is based on embryos created before 5 April 2002 being the only ones able to be used for research. I think it is inherent in this bill. I think it is a commendable amendment proposed by Senator Bishop. I hope very much that Senator Patterson is in a position to accept the sensible amendment.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2002-11-14,"—I rise in support of the amendment and agree with Senators Minchin and Bishop. I will not go through all the arguments again, but COAG in its communique of 5 April clearly talks about the protocols to preclude the creation of embryos specifically for research purposes. It talks about the NHMRC reporting within 12 months on the adequacy of supply and distribution for research of excess ART embryos which otherwise would have been destroyed.
That is a very important point—and it probably has not been raised this morning— that is, within 12 months we are going to have this council deliberating on the adequacy of supply and distribution for research of excess ART embryos. And what are they going to say? Will there be any guidelines? Will there be any thought or sense from this parliament as to what sort of message it is sending? That report obviously will be an important one. It is being done for a reason and, if they are going to comment on the adequacy of supply and distribution, they need some sense from us as to a limit. There should be a minimum number of excess embryos for research purposes, and that is the point that Senator Bishop has been making. 
We have been asked by COAG to develop a strict regulatory regime, and that is what we are doing, or attempting to do, under the Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002. As Senator Minchin said, there is a limit on the number of these excess embryos of, apparently, about 70,000. The COAG communique says that it is restricted so that human embryos are not created specifically for research purposes. The Hon. John Anderson made it clear that he was concerned about the `slippery slope' argument—that you will find that over time there will be enormous pressure to obtain human embryos for other purposes, whether it be for research or whatever. 
This was brought to the attention of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee and is set out on page 52 of the committee's report. I will not go through those arguments, but a number of witnesses put the view to our committee quite strongly that they are concerned about the slippery slope—about the number of embryos that will be available in time. One of the witnesses to our inquiry, Professor Illingworth, gave a broad estimate that the non-viable human embryos from ARC centres, at this stage, was around 40,000 per annum. I just make that point.
I am concerned about the open slather situation. If this amendment is not included in the bill, what will be the consequences? The consequences will be that the bill may in time be interpreted—and there will be a review in three years or prior to that if COAG sees fit—as allowing for this 5 April deadline to be removed, and there is an amendment relating to that. If that is not there, what is the interpretation under the bill? I will be concerned if this is not included in the objects clause. There is such a good argument that can be put for this amendment. I say: what happens if it is not in the bill? Surely, there is a possibility of open slather, of unrestricted access to human embryos, and this has to be a major concern. It has been reflected throughout the committee hearings, in public debate and by the COAG agreement that there must be a strict regulatory regime covering the number of human embryos that can be obtained for research purposes or for other purposes down the track. This is the concern. We need to set some guidelines and we need to express the intent of this parliament. I really hope that we can come together on an agreement such as this and say that we need a strict regulatory regime and that we can be consistent and support one another on this particular amendment.
Let us go to the proponents of the bill. What do they say? They say, `We don't need any at all at the moment' or `We need only a very limited number of human embryos for research purposes.' Some talked about 50, 100 or a couple of hundred human embryos. That is all they require to do the research they need to do. I say, `Okay, if that is all you need, that is the way it has to be.' This amendment is consistent with that. We are limiting the number of human embryos to the minimum necessary to achieve the purposes of those activities. Why can't we just accept their views? They are the proponents of the bill; they are the scientists. I say, `Okay, I will go along with that; under this bill we will limit the number.' Obviously, I do not support the actual bill but, if we do have to have a bill, let us have a strict regulatory regime. I have made the point about the review in three years time. Currently, under the bill, the 5 April deadline goes—and then who knows what will happen? That is the slippery slope argument that I am concerned about.
If this amendment is not in the bill, we have an open chequebook, an open slather possibility. I just hope that the minister, the government and others in this chamber will see the merit of having these guidelines tightly framed so that there is a limited number of human embryos necessary to achieve the purposes for which those activities are conducted. I support the amendment. I think it has merit, and I hope that others who are perhaps listening in their rooms or in other places can see the merit. This is directly consistent with the COAG agreement and follows through on that, and it is consistent with what the proponents of the bill actually want and seek. I hope that the minister and others in this chamber and elsewhere have thought through the arguments and will support the amendment. ",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NP,2002-11-14,"—I will be brief. I have read the amendment and it is absolutely consistent with what COAG want. COAG have said that they want the minimum use of embryos. They have also said that, if the Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002 is to proceed, they want it done with the minimum use of embryos. We were told in the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee on a number of occasions that an additional 50 to a couple of hundred embryos would be required. I think we have 70,000 embryos in storage at the moment. I do not know how many of those would be able to be brought into use, but they are available. It also brings back to the parliament the right, every 12 months, to review the findings of what is happening. Senator Bishop's amendment proposes:
	(3)	The NHMRC Licensing Committee must cause a report to be tabled in either House of Parliament on or before:
	(a)	30 June of each year;
	(b)	31 December of each year ...
I think these amendments are very necessary. We are the people who are passing this legislation. We do not have the right to wash our hands of it and just say, `We've passed it,' or, `We've amended it. Therefore, we don't ever want to follow what is happening thereafter.' We should have the right—and it is not only our right but our responsibility on this very important issue involving ethics, business and a number of other issues—to monitor these reports and see what is happening after 12 months as a result of this bill. I cannot think of one reason why this amendment should not be carried. It is a good amendment, a lot of thought has gone into it, it has been argued well by both sides of the house; and I certainly give it my support.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-11-14,"— This amendment of Senator Bishop's proposes to amend the object of the Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002 to include as one of the objects of the legislation `limiting the number of human embryos used in those regulated activities to the minimum necessary to achieve the purposes of those activities'. I will not be supporting the amendment because I do not believe that changing the object of the act is helpful.
The NHMRC Licensing Committee will have the power to limit the number of embryos permitted to be used under each licence issued by the committee. They will do this by having regard, under clause 21, to the number of embryos likely to be necessary to achieve the goals of the activity or project proposed in the application. This information will be contained on the publicly available database of licence applications so that the public will have full information about the total number of embryos permitted to be used under licences issued by the NHMRC Licensing Committee. I believe that this provides a high level of transparency and accountability and will also provide us with very valuable information to inform the review of the legislation in three years time.
The object of the act is not meant to include every detail relating to the implementation of the act but to be an overarching statement of intent. The object of the act was developed in consultation and it addresses the intent of the legislation, which is to regulate the use of excess ART embryos. There is a range of concerns raised by COAG which are not directly addressed in the object, such as the need for informed consent and the likelihood of significant advance in knowledge. These issues are, however, all addressed in the body of the legislation.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2002-11-14,"—With respect to Senator Patterson on this issue, it perhaps highlights the comments I was making of a very general nature, and I will now go to another example. If we trace the regulation of this field to its origins, we go back to the 1996 guidelines. We see those guidelines saying that an institutional ethics committee should only approve such projects in exceptional circumstances. We have not sought to adopt that language, because that is not consistent with what COAG came forward with. At 6.4, the COAG communique says: 
·	there is a likelihood of significant advance in knowledge or improvement in technologies for treatment as a result of the proposed procedure ...
That is what has been adopted straight into clause 21 of the bill. The next one is:
·	the procedure involves a restricted number of embryos ...
If we go back to clause 21 of the bill, we see that the restricted part has been removed. All that the licensing body is to take into account is the number. There is no intent to restrict the number, and that is the issue. When I first looked at this issue I went back to the 1996 guidelines and I said, `Fine, that's what those guidelines say should be in place.' When I found that discrepancy, I went to the COAG communique for guidance. If we go to the COAG communique, we see in appendix 1 of the communique that the first point that should be taken on a case-by-case basis is:
·	... a likelihood of significant advance in knowledge or improvement in technologies for treatment as a result of the proposed procedure ... 
And the second point is:
·	the procedure involves a restricted number of embryos ...
I have to question why, when we are adopting these provisions from the guidelines into the bill at clause 21, we have moved from a `restricted number' to just take account of `the number'. So the next stage of the reasoning was to go back to the objects and see if the objects give us some guidance on what the intention should be for the licensing committee. And there is the problem, because the objects do not reflect the COAG decision either that the licensing body should take into account restricting the number. That is what the communique says as well. So then you look at the bill as it is currently phrased and it just says that the licensing body take account of the number—but there is no guidance on for what purpose. Is it so that we can record it or so that it can be available for public information? The point was that the guidelines, which have been in place since 1996, have chartered bodies to look at how they restrict the number. And that is what has been removed—quite inconsistently with the COAG communique.
I listened to Senator Patterson's response on this and the similarity between that and my own advice from the NHMRC and, indeed, the committee's advice from the NHMRC on this issue was interesting. We are told that taking into account the number really means restricting the number, and it does not. There is nothing that charters the licensing committee to have an objective to restrict, and that is what COAG told us was its intent. The bill does not include it, and for all we know future guidelines may not include it. We do not know.
Let us take a different mental attitude to this particular amendment, and that is: what harm does it generate? For the life of me I cannot see what harm it generates to put in the objects of the bill the intention of COAG which was, in part, to restrict the number. Indeed, Senator Stott Despoja and Senator Bishop will probably recall that on about the second day of hearings before the committee we heard about how the British system seeks to restrict the number of embryos. The way the British system seeks to give effect to that objective is indeed to have a stem cell bank. The problem with our bill, which we are told will generate a strict regulatory regime and restrict the number of embryos, is that there is nothing in the bill that either indicates that intent or gives it effect—nothing at all. I ask senators, in considering this amendment, to go back to the COAG communique and read what it says. It says that approval is given on a case-by-case basis and that the `procedure involves a restricted number of embryos'.
There is perhaps another way to deal with this amendment, and that is for the committee to wait until we get to clause 21, where the drafters of this process have removed this provision, and reinsert it so that 21(4)(a) says, `In deciding whether to issue the licence, the NHMRC Licensing Committee must have regard to the following: (a) restricting the number.' That is one other alternative. We are told by the NHMRC that this is not necessary. I ask the minister, why is it not necessary? When COAG tells us that their intention is to restrict the number of embryos, and it is in the guidelines currently and slabs of those current guidelines have been used in clause 21 in this bill, but for some strange reason the `restrict' word has not survived the process, I ask why. I ask the minister if she can seek advice on what in the consultation process led to that, in my mind vital, word being removed. What rationale was there for that vital word, unlike most others in that part of the guidelines, being removed? 
The reason I ask this question is that I have been told in relation to another of my amendments—the one which raises concerns about commas that have been put in in other aspects of the NHMRC guidelines which, in my view, separate the meaning regarding the acquiring of a significant level of knowledge and that that knowledge should be related to medical treatment purposes which comes from the history of the guidelines—by some who participated in the drafting process that at one stage the drafters had removed the words `for treatment'. For some reason those `for treatment' words made it back in again, but it made me highly sceptical about why the commas were put in. I understand that there is fairly general support for the notion that we go back to the precise wording in relation to my amendment dealing with those commas in clause 21. I would encourage senators to think of the precise wording on this matter.
 I should foreshadow that, if senators cannot support this way of trying to give effect to COAG's intent because the drafters thought the other way was not appropriate for reasons yet unknown, perhaps we should go back to that rigid wording as exists in the current guidelines and insert that into clause 21. I would rather simplify the process and proceed the way that has been suggested with this amendment. All it simply does is indicate in the bill what the guiding intent from COAG was so that the licensing committee can have that in mind when it looks at the number—for what purpose it is looking at the number, that is, to restrict—but that should be a second level approach to it. I am not sure the minister heard my question earlier, but I am interested in whether the NHMRC can advise the chamber as to why the word `restrict' was removed from the wording that has been incorporated into clause 21. Everything else from that section of the guidelines is reflected there. We refer to the number, but we do not carry over that other objective, which is in the guidelines, which is to restrict the number.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-11-14,"— Senator Collins has noted that the AHEC guidelines require that the research involve a restricted number of embryos. My concern is that that is not sufficiently certain for the implementation of legislation. `Restricted' is an uncertain term. Do you mean restricted to seven, restricted to 10, restricted to 100 embryos? The licensing committee will first of all decide whether the research is necessary, appropriate and justifiable and then determine how many embryos are required to implement that research. The bill makes it clear that the committee has to look at the number that is likely to be necessary to achieve the goals of the project. Just putting `restricted' does not give you that information. It is how many are necessary—not an unrestricted number but the number likely to be necessary. That is entirely consistent with COAG. The number of embryos allowed to be used will also be detailed, as I said before, as a condition of the licence and will be publicly available. That, as far as I am concerned, meets the COAG intentions. I say again I will not be supporting the amendment.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2002-11-14,"—With respect, Senator Patterson, you actually highlight the reason why we have not gone down the path of just putting `restrict' into clause 21. We accept the view that `restrict' is a difficult term for a licensing committee to apply in that context. The point I am making is that in the absence of this amendment nowhere in the bill does it refer to the objective of COAG, which is to restrict. This is why we have sought to put that into the objects.  
I would also like to bring to the chamber's attention that in any of the ethical discussions on this issue—and I have to say this third way ethical position that was canvassed in the process is not mine—it seems implicit in many people's view that these embryos are human and they have some status, though in going to the state of extremes that status is not equivalent to that of an adult human being. If you accept the logic of that, then what flows from that position is the view that they do not attract full human status—a clumsy way to express it. 
But what do they attract? Nearly the first thing that comes forward in ethical discussions is that if research is to occur it should occur only under tight restrictions. It should not occur easily and should not involve large numbers of embryos. I recall that Professor Hearn was one of the people who was very keen on that issue—that there should only ever be restricted numbers. But that object is nowhere in this bill. This is my point. It is in the AHEC guidelines. Other key parameters in the AHEC guidelines have been adopted but not the ethical concept not only that we take account of the numbers—that is not the point—but also that the licensing committee should take account of restricting the numbers. I do not want to see this bill just turned into a log of the numbers. That is not how the licensing committee should operate. Certainly I know AHEC understands this, but for the life of me I cannot understand why the bureaucracy within the NHMRC cannot. It is clear that COAG understands it, it is clear that AHEC understands it, it is reasonably clear from my discussions with people who accept this philosophy about embryos that they understand it; and Professor Hearn understands it. Many others have expressed that view in the debate. My point is that nowhere in this bill do we give effect to that ethical position that the number of human embryos used in these processes should be restricted.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2002-11-14,"—The minister says that she does not know what the term `restrict' means. What does that matter? The minister is sitting there refusing to accept any amendments. Why? Because of COAG— `We can't do this because of COAG.' If that is her approach to every amendment that is going to come up, here is an amendment that does conform strictly with what COAG decided, and it has been deliberately taken out of this legislation. Page 241 of the appendix to the COAG agreement says:
... A licence would only be issued where that project has the approval of an ethics committee established, composed and conducted in accordance with NHMRC guidelines, and that the approval is given on a case by case basis that:
...	 ...	 ...
·	the procedure involves a restricted number of embryos and a separate account of the use of each embryo is provided to the ethics committee and the national licensing body ... 
As has been asked by the mover of this amendment to the legislation and the other speakers, why has that not found its way to the objects of the legislation? The authorities, including the licensing authority, would be looking to the objects of the act in order to decide their view on the matter—on the application, for example. Unless you have the word `restricted' there in the objects of the act, as is proposed—and I would have thought it would be better to have the word in the body of the act—then you are acting contrary to the COAG process itself.
I ask the minister: why does she refuse to accept these words as is proposed to amend the guidelines? It is a very serious matter. We have the minister stating that she will not accept them, but she has not said—as she has on previous occasions—that she will not accept them because they are contrary to the COAG communique. She cannot, because they are not contrary to the COAG communique. It is quite the contrary: her refusal is contrary to the COAG communique, which, I repeat, includes the words:
... the procedure involves a restricted number of embryos ...
To refuse to have that included in the legislation is, I believe, contrary to not only the spirit but the letter of the communique.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2002-11-14,"—I want to readdress this issue because it seems to me that, with the way this debate is being conducted, we are not going to be given any adequate response to legitimate questions that are raised from the floor. The minister outlined at the outset her reasons for not accepting the amendment. They were in two parts. Firstly, she said that not all parts of the communique are necessary to be included in the objects of the act. As a statement of fact that is probably correct, and as a matter of possible legal interpretation later it is arguably correct as well. I accept that reasoning. I then go to her second point about why the government would not accept the amendment limiting the number of human embryos. The minister referred the chamber to clauses 21 and 24, and she made specific reference to subclauses contained in those clauses which say that the NHMRC Licensing Committee must have regard to a number of matters, primary among which is the number of excess ART embryos likely to be necessary to achieve the goals of the activity or project proposed in the application. 
As discussed by other speakers, that wording in clause 21(4) and clause 24(1) is deliberately at variance, deliberately at odds, with the decision of the Prime Minister and the various state and territory leaders. The communique that they signed up to was the result of consensus after deliberations between the Commonwealth and the states on that issue. The officials who were involved in those negotiations from a Commonwealth level were from Senator Patterson's own department. They were officials from the NHMRC. They were the body that gave advice on the content of the communique. They were the officials that gave advice on the phrasing and the wording and who either suggested in the communique that the number of embryos to be used be restricted or, alternatively, accommodated and gave expression to the direction of their political masters. Either is acceptable, appropriate and proper, but when the bill went to the drafting stage in the Department of Health and Ageing, via the respective officials, the decision of the COAG participants to have that intent was deliberately omitted from clauses 21 and 24. So the bill as it is currently expressed is completely at variance with the decision of the COAG participants. It was the political decision of the COAG participants in a unanimous fashion to go down a particular path. They outlined their concerns and their solutions and they all signed up to it. Officials of the department of health were given responsibility for drafting to give effect to their political decision.
I can accept that the government may now have a different view and may want to have unrestricted numbers of embryos available for researchers and scientists to have access to. In some sections of this debate, that is a perfectly legitimate and ethical position to hold. If embryos have no intrinsic merit, if they have no value, let hundreds of thousands bloom. It does not matter. If that is the position of the government, the government should come along and say that and explain it. That is their right. That is Senator Patterson's right. That is the Prime Minister's right. I do not quarrel with that. If they want to be able to manufacture an unlimited number of human embryos and dispose of those for research purposes, as approved of by the relevant committees, that is their right. Let them come along and say it.
But there are also in this debate obligations that the government and the opposition have chosen to adopt and to bind upon themselves. This has to do with the nature of the conscience vote. A conscience vote is not simply a mechanical process whereby individual elected members of a parliament, representative of a party, may with authority depart from the vote or the properly decided decision of their own party. It is more than that. A conscience vote means that people have to inform themselves. They have to participate properly in the process. They have to give reasonable explanation for their decision. They have to give explanation for their position. That is the necessary implication of a conscience vote. The Australian Labor Party, the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia—and the Democrats, in another context—all freely chose to accept those constraints and restrictions. In my own party, that means I have to go to considerable lengths to explain a position which would perhaps not otherwise have to be explained in debates or which could be rolled through a committee.
It is similar on the government's part. If they have a particular view of the world for the use of embryos—they are elected, they went through the process, they have a majority on the floor of the House—they have an absolute right to have a policy position on embryos, how they are to be used and the numbers to be used, and to put it in this place. I do not quarrel with that. But when they as a political party and their representatives freely choose to restrict their ability by having conscience votes, that means there has to be thorough explanation as to reasons. The question I am asking is why the government does not want to limit the number of embryos used. I do not say they cannot have that position but I do say that, having gone down the path of conscience voting, there is an added or additional obligation to explain that reasoning. 
Secondly, the whole position of the Australian Labor Party and the government parties in this debate has in reality been to slavishly follow the advice of the NHMRC. It is the NHMRC, amongst others, who are providing the primary advice to the government and to the opposition. Certainly, other sources of advice are available and can be used. But the one set of advice is going to the two major parties—to both the government and the potential alternative government. There is no variation. If the government does have a different position now, then I think we are entitled to know why it has changed. I go back to the original question that opened up this debate: why is the government wishing to depart from the communique? The communique says:
... the procedure involves a restricted number of embryos ...
The phrase `restricted number of embryos' is deliberate. Obviously, the political masters gave the tick-off to that. But they did not say `an unlimited number of embryos'. They were not issuing a direction that there should be open slather in this debate. It may well be the case that in three, five or seven years time the premiers and Prime Minister of the day might well decide that community sentiment has shifted, public values are different, the greater good is more relevant than it is now and there should be hundreds and hundreds of thousands of surplus embryos manufactured, with the eggs farmed from women—or by whatever process; I will not get emotional. They might decide that there should be hundreds of thousands of embryos available and that there should be no restrictions applied. But that is not the decision. That was not part of the consensus building process on the day that gave rise to the COAG agreement.
The consensus building process that occurred and resulted in the communique that we are referring to resulted in the Commonwealth and the states choosing to apply a number of limitations to this field of activity. They also said that we are going to have a review of the act within three years time, and that is going to be done by an independent committee also to be set up by the NHMRC. So Caesar is going to be judging Caesar on the act that Caesar created. That is fine; it is good work if you can get it. But they have not given the reason as to why we should willy-nilly accept the government legislation of the day.
If this was any other bill and there was no conscience vote then the government would have a perfect right to just stand up and say: `The government's had a meeting. It's the view of the cabinet minister and the caucus that this is the particular path to go down. The legislation gives expression to that policy. We have the numbers. Thank you for your comments, opposition; go away.' But in this case the government and the opposition chose to accept a different set of rules: they chose to accept conscience voting, with the necessary limitations that go with that. But in this debate, the constant in both the government and the opposition has been to rely on the steadfast restrictions that have been established by the states and premiers via the COAG agreement. I can understand that. I do not like it, but I certainly understand the logic and reasoning behind it.
If it is the role of the Commonwealth parliament simply to give expression to agreements reached between the states and the Commonwealth without amendment or interference, then I can understand that process. But the COAG communique was issued in the full knowledge that both the Australian Labor Party and the two opposition parties were going to give to their members of parliament a conscience vote. They knew it was going to their respective organisations and that their respective organisations would, and eventually did, give that conscience vote. So those who signed up to the COAG communique must have had in their minds, must have anticipated that amendments would come from the floor of the Senate or the House or indeed from any other chamber of a state parliament around Australia and that because it was a conscience vote there might be variations that emerged from the strictures that were to be applied by COAG. So again I simply ask the minister why the government has departed from the COAG wording, why it no longer believes it to be appropriate to limit the number of embryos that might be accessed and why it believes it to be appropriate to have an unrestricted number of excess embryos that might be able to be accessed.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2002-11-14,"—Firstly, I indicate that the Labor Party will be opposing Senator Bishop's proposed amendment to the objects clause. We will be doing so because we accept the logic that the objects clause was determined as part of the COAG process and we think it adequately meets the objectives of the act. Senator Bishop's amendment, in the sense that it modifies the objects clause, is therefore not necessarily a useful addition. I formally put that on behalf of the Labor Party and indicate that there will be a conscience vote of Labor senators on that issue anyway.
I want to make a couple of personal comments which go to this debate. It is important that we actually concentrate on this issue. I am not sure that the objects clause is the way to do this. I have heard the strength of the argument put by Senator Bishop, and I think there is some strength to it and I think it is something that the Senate will want to grapple with. I would not deal with this issue in the objects clause, and that is a personal decision; Senator Bishop has done it there. From formal Labor advice and in my personal view, that is not the place to do that.
The debate has highlighted a concern that the COAG agreement has not been fully reflected in the bill. That is a difficulty for those who have argued that the bill ought to go through as is on the basis of the COAG agreement. This highlights a broader problem which we have a couple of weeks to rectify. We may well get a vote on this clause; but, as senators know, at 12.45 p.m. we will adjourn this debate. We will all come back refreshed in three weeks. The minister will have had a nice holiday in Bali, and she will be keen for the fray—even if she has got nothing to wear! I am assured the minister is doing important work representing the Australian government and the Australian people in a most important ceremony in Bali, and I wish her well with that.
The debate on this issue highlights that, in a long committee stage process in the Senate where a conscience vote applies, strength of argument—not our traditional process, which is based on where the numbers fall and which party has the numbers—will in the end win the debate. It is necessary in the committee stage of the debate, however uncomfortable that might be and however unusual it is for the government, to actually win the argument. While people are focusing on the conscience vote, they have to focus on the fact that the difference in this debate is that people have to win the intellectual argument. That is something that the government ought to give consideration to in the next couple of weeks: senators will be exercising conscience votes, they will be listening closely to the argument and they will want to be convinced.
I have not done the numbers but, judging from the indicative votes on the cloning bill—and I could be wrong in terms of the embryo bill, so I will not put this too strongly—there seems to be a small majority of senators inclined to support the legislation. But I do not think that that majority will hold on all occasions just because someone says COAG said this or because someone says the government wants it that way. We had an indication of that the other day with the 63 to 9 vote on a particular amendment. On that occasion, the official Labor Party view was to support the amendment. That accounted for some of those numbers, but it certainly did not account for them all. It was a reflection that senators who listened to the debate had not been convinced and voted accordingly. I am sure that that will be the case in the committee stage of this bill. I do not want to lecture or patronise anyone about this, but it is important that we understand that people will need to win the intellectual debate by the strength of their argument. I point out that I am speaking on my own behalf as an individual senator searching his conscience on this issue at the moment, but I do think it will be necessary for us to win discussions inside the chamber by strength of argument. 
Therefore, I will not be supporting the amendment proposed by Senator Bishop. I do not think that is appropriate in the objects clause—that is a personal and party view. But I do think that Senator Bishop has raised an important issue about whether COAG's decision is fully reflected in the bill. He has also raised the concern, which has been expressed around the chamber—which I think is shared by all senators and, I am sure, is shared by Senator Patterson—that, to the extent possible, we limit the number of embryos who are impacted on by any research needs. There will be opportunities later in the process of the bill to come to those issues again. I am sure that Senator Bishop has the persistence to again raise these issues under a different heading. I gather there is some debate over whether it is applicable but, clearly, section 21 seeks to lay out the conditions that would apply. As Senator Bishop has pointed out, it does strike people as strange that there is nothing that gives effect to what seems to be the broad COAG agreement and the broad Senate view that, to the extent possible, we ought to be limiting the number of embryos who are affected by legitimate research needs. I say that again without my formal ALP hat on as a cautionary note and to reflect the view that, while people will want to give force to COAG decisions, they will not necessarily accept an argument purely on the basis that COAG decided it. Senators will want to exercise their own conscience and their own decision making powers.
Having said that by way of a personal interlude, I return to put on my Labor Party hat, which up to now has been consistent with the positions I have, without any concern, adopted. I have supported the official Labor Party position personally and have been very happy with the approach taken. But I do think we need to exercise caution about how the debate proceeds when we return in a couple of weeks time. We need to seriously address those arguments that have been raised on this issue and provide a serious response. The intervening period will allow that to occur, but obviously we will have similar issues on other amendments and we have to make sure that rigour is applied. I know that that will be the view of senators, and they have displayed that already. That is worth our taking on board. As I say, with my official Labor Party hat on and in my personal view, I do not think the objects clause is the place to do what is proposed by Senator Bishop's amendment. I do not support Senator Bishop's amendment, but I think he has raised a very important issue that will be the subject of consideration. If it is not carried here, I am sure it will present again in some other form.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2002-11-14,"—I have not participated directly in the debate this morning but, having listened to the debate on this issue, I now share the concerns that have been raised by Senator Evans in his non-party-political hat, speaking as Senator Evans. These concerns have also been expressed by other colleagues around this chamber. I think this really gets to the difficulties that may well be experienced in this debate. I think it is something, as Senator Evans has said, that needs to be taken into consideration. The committee knows that I have moved a number of amendments to this bill. I have always been an advocate of this bill progressing as swiftly as possible and that is what I have always endeavoured to do in my attempts to participate in this debate.
It seems to me that a number of the amendments that I have raised arise specifically out of the issue of COAG. It is very important—and I think this is something that needs to be done, as Senator Evans has indicated—that those amendments be taken into consideration over the next fortnight. In that way it may well be that the bill will be expedited in its passage through here. There are still going to be other issues where there are fundamental areas of disagreement between the views of a number of people around this chamber and the government view. I think that will lead to a healthy, robust debate. 
As Senator Evans said, if you have the consent and agreement of a sufficient number of colleagues in this place on your amendment then it will get up. That is fair enough. On this occasion, many of the senators are paying very close attention to the debate that is taking place. I think Senator Evans was correct in saying that shifts and changes in voting patterns will take place on a number of amendments that are before this chamber. One would hope that is the case, otherwise it will be a very sterile debate indeed. It will be a debate that, at the end of the day, will account for naught in terms of giving the Australian people the best piece of legislation that this parliament can possibly deliver.
I looked at the COAG agreement and I just want to refer to a couple of the clauses, because I think this really gets to the heart of things. In clause 6 it says:
The following principles should underpin nationally-consistent legislation ...
Clause 6.1 says:
... legislation should ensure appropriate ethical oversight of research involving embryos based on nationally-consistent standards ...
So that is fine. Clause 6.2 says:
... the nationally-consistent standards should be clear, detailed and describe the ethical issues to be taken into account, research which may be permitted and the conditions upon which it may be permitted ...
It goes on:
... these national standards should be applied consistently throughout Australia, recognising that jurisdictions may use different mechanisms to establish that proposals comply with the national standards ...
So we are not necessarily trying to write legislation for the individual states; we are adopting Commonwealth legislation for use by the Commonwealth government. Obviously, the aim of that legislation is that there will be consistency throughout the various jurisdictions in Australia. Clause 6.4 then goes on to say:
... the system should provide for public reporting of research involving embryos so as to improve transparency and accountability to the public ...
Forget the reporting for one moment. To me, transparency and accountability are significant issues in any piece of legislation that comes before this parliament and none more so than in this piece of legislation. There should be both transparency and accountability. The transparency comes about in the application of the COAG agreement. While this is meant in the end not to dictate to but form part of a nationally consistent framework, one would expect that this committee nonetheless will bear in mind the appropriate agreement that has been made through the COAG principles.
I turn to appendix 1, which is headed `Regulatory regime criteria for research uses of excess assisted reproductive technology (ART) embryos'. It states:
Governments agree to put in place a strict regulatory regime ...
So it is not a loose regulatory regime, but a strict regulatory regime. To me, the word `strict' is fairly confining and defining. Yet, based on the issue that has been raised by Senator Bishop and a number of others here today, although I have not got Senator Bishop's amendment before me at this stage—and while Senator Evans says that he thinks the objects clause is not the correct place for the issue of limiting the number of embryos available for research—that clearly is the intent of the COAG agreement. The third dot point under appendix 1 says:
... the procedure involves a restricted number of embryos and a separate account of the use of each embryo is provided to the ethics committee and the national licensing body ...
So I do not think it is unrealistic for Senator Bishop to ask in his proposed amendment for a limit on the number of human embryos used in regulated activities to the minimum necessary to achieve the purposes of those activities. I do not think it is unfair at all. I am not going to proceed much further because I think that the debate should really be got on with, but I believe, Minister Patterson, that there needs to be some fairly solid analysis done of the amendments that are being proposed where they raise issues of consistency with the COAG agreement. Whilst the government may not necessarily agree to the words proposed by the various amendments, it may well be able to seek an alternative amendment which may be acceptable to the proposers of the amendments. I think there is an opportunity here for a number of the amendments to be worked over and an agreement to be arrived at. 
I do not know about other senators' amendments, but when I circulated my proposed amendments—and I note that Senator Bishop and Senator Collins did the same—I added a small explanation as to why each amendment was being sought, because of the difficulties that a number of senators are having in this debate. It is quite different from debates on other bills, because they are being asked to address the issues based on their own conscience, and for everyone to get around every amendment and understand the importance of that amendment to the person who is proposing it is not necessarily easy. Not everyone is watching this back in their room at every moment of the day. People have other commitments. I know that would upset a few people, but there are committees of the Senate sitting and there are people with other commitments who do not know precisely what is going on in the debate. That is why I have circulated my amendments with those explanations. I do not know if it is possible for any other senator who is involved in this debate to do that for their amendments, but it may well assist the process of expediting this bill through the Senate. Senator Bishop has raised some very valid issues indeed. I commend to the minister that the issues that I and others have raised be taken into consideration over the next non-sitting fortnight.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2002-11-14,"—In addition to some of the more informal discussions that are occurring around the chamber, I will make a brief comment on the record. I think Senator Evans made some very appropriate points. Firstly, I make it clear, as I have done in informal discussions, that I will not be supporting the move to insert these changes into the `Object of Act' clause. Notwithstanding the vigorous debate and the convincing arguments that have been put forward, I do not think it is an appropriate place for such an insertion if you want to make reference to limiting or restricting the number of embryos.
I do think the purported inconsistency between the COAG communique and the legislation is an area that deserves attention, and that vibe has certainly been picked up by most people in the chamber. I certainly do take to heart Senator Evans's point that the exciting aspect of conscience votes in this chamber is that we are forced to think about individual amendments and bits of legislation and also that we get robust debate and need convincing. Sometimes we need very strong counterargument too. I appeal to the government and to advisers to consider that if there are questions such as, `Why is there a distinction between the COAG information and the legislation with which we are dealing?' and these issues have not been sufficiently explored at the committee stage or we have not had a response that has satisfied some members of the parliament, and if there is a good reason why there is an inconsistency and that is explained to the chamber, there are people who are more than happy to be swayed by those counterarguments, inasmuch as we are prepared to listen to and be swayed by the amendments before the chair as well.
My position in relation to changes to the `Object of Act' clause has not changed. We will not be supporting that proposed amendment, and that has been conveyed privately and now. Secondly, if over the coming weeks, as Senator Evans has suggested, the government would like to provide a different or enhanced rationale but at the same time other members of the Senate would like to look into whether there is an appropriate place to discuss this issue and make changes—certainly section 21 of the bill has been proposed as a possible area for amendment—let us do that. Let us use the next two weeks to resolve some of these outstanding issues. That would give us a better chance to look at all of these amendments in detail and then hopefully on 2 December whip through this bill— 
—Whip!
—Let us be honest then: we will probably spend all night working very hard on this legislation in the hope that we can get a regulatory system and scheme up and running that also solves all of our concerns and aspirations.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2002-11-14,"—Thank you, Senator Stott Despoja and Senator Evans. I endorse your reflections on an alternative way of dealing with this, and I am glad you have responded to my detailing of the situation in relation to the current guidelines, the COAG decision and this bill. Before Senator Bishop foreshadows his response to that, there is one issue, alluded to by Senator Evans, that I should comment on briefly which I think will assist further debate. If I understood Senator Evans correctly he indicated that, to his knowledge, COAG had informed the drafting of the objects provision of this bill. So far I have not seen an indication that that is the case. For instance, I am not aware that the communique details—
—Okay. Perhaps that is a point it would be useful for senators to understand. Did the bill itself return to COAG and to what extent did they inform detailed decisions about areas where the bill strayed from the COAG communique? Certainly, the communique is pretty clear on their intent in quite a number of areas, but I am not aware that the precise detail that arose out of the consultation process was actually returned to COAG, or if indeed there was any detailed consideration of issues such as those we are addressing now concerning areas where things are expressed differently and how that might impact on a strict regulatory regime.
I am interested in an answer to that question beyond just, `Yes, it went back to them at some meeting and they said, “Yes, that's great,” and off it went'—that is, I am interested in the extent to which COAG may have been informed of the various bits of advice that the Senate has now received through its committee process, such as AHEC's views about whether this would in fact achieve a strict regulatory regime and their suggestions. I use as an example there—and I hope by now that Senator Patterson is aware of this example, which relates to my amendments (1) and (2)—the exemption in the bill for diagnostic testing. I am aware that in the debate in the House of Representatives the minister indicated that he was still not satisfied with how well that provision had been drafted. The committee then sought to explore that issue further. Through the committee's explorations we discovered, in a way we would not have been informed by the NHMRC, that AHEC had indeed not been satisfied with the drafting changes to the diagnostic exemption. We are now in the position of being able to reflect on AHEC's advice on how they think we can most appropriately close that loophole.
So on the one hand you can say, `Yes, mechanically it might have gone through a COAG process,' but if we do not know whether COAG was informed of some of these issues and in fact addressed them, it is very difficult to say that COAG had a role in the drafting of this particular object provision. I would encourage senators not to take a loose interpretation of those sorts of reflections. It is good for us to know if COAG had an active role in the way a particular provision in this bill is worded, but if that is not the case, I would encourage any of the advisers to the parliament in this process not to seek to portray that as being the case. Perhaps between now and when we come back to this debate we can get some clarity on many of the issues relating to how some of the drafting provisions have been established. I will go back to the two commas as an example. At no stage, even though I did raise this informally with the NHMRC, have I had any explanation for how or why, in the drafting process, that occurred. I can only reiterate Senator Evans's comments that what we will require in this debate is the intellectual case to justify these circumstances—and light references to `Oh yeah, but COAG ...' are not going to satisfy this committee.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech

—I'll be shot now!
—I have just ended his career. We are all professionals! His advice was useful and I have taken it on board. Accordingly, I withdraw amendment (1), which is currently before the chair for discussion. I indicate an intent later in the committee proceedings to move a similar amendment to clauses 21 and 24, and other clauses if appropriate. I take on board, and will consider, the comments made by both Senator Stott Despoja and Senator Evans that the appropriate place for such a provision, if there is to be such a place, is not the objects clause but may be elsewhere in the bill.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2002-11-14,"—I notice the time factor, Mr Temporary Chairman, so thank you for the opportunity in the time available to speak to these amendments, which relate to the issue of consent—a very important part of this Research Involving Embryos Bill—which is set out in clause 8 of the bill. At the moment I believe the clause is deficient, thus the reason for the amendments. I have prepared an explanatory note that I have forwarded to other honourable senators in the last few days, but I would like to go through that and get it on the record so that people are aware and, over time, can consider the arguments. Amendment (R3) specifies some elements of the nature of the proper consent—
 (Senator Cook)—Senator Barnett, you need to seek leave to move your amendments together.
—Indeed, that is a very fair comment, and I seek leave to move the amendments together.
Leave granted.
—I move amendments (R2) and (R3) on sheet 2694 revised:
(R2)	Clause 8, page 6 (line 26) to page 7 (line 7), omit the definition of proper consent, substitute:
proper consent has the meaning given by section 8A.
(R3)	Page 7 (after line 20), after clause 8, insert:
8A  Meaning of proper consent
	(1)	In this Part:
proper consent, in relation to the use of an excess ART embryo, means:
	(a)	consent obtained in accordance with the Ethical Guidelines on Assisted Reproductive Technology (1996) issued by the NHMRC; or 
	(b)	if the Chairperson of the NHMRC Licensing Committee specifies, by notice in the Gazette, other guidelines issued by the NHMRC—consent obtained in accordance with those other guidelines. 
	(2)	It is a condition of proper consent that the donor:
	(a)	receives independent counselling; and
	(b)	receives written notification of, understands and consents in writing to the specific application to which the ART embryo will be put; and
	(c)	has a cooling-off period of 7 days.
	(3)	At all times a donor is to have access to the information about the use to which that donor's embryos were put.
—I ask for clarification: are they amendments (1) and (R2)?
—It is (R2) and (R3).
—What happened to amendment (1)? Is it on one of the sheets that I have in my hand? Is that what we are looking at?
—I am just obtaining an answer for you, Senator Harradine.
—Perhaps I can help with that one. That is actually set out on page 5 of the running sheet, in relation to clause 42 and clause 2. They go together, so we need to debate my amendments to clause 42 and then, subject to what happens to it, we move to clause 2. It is all related to clause 42; it is a consequential amendment. It relates to an anomaly in the bill.
—I think the answer to your question, Senator Harradine, is that it is there but we have not got to it yet. 
—The amendments specify some elements of the nature of proper consent that this bill will require to be obtained from all responsible persons—that is, parents, gamete donors and their spouses—in relation to excess ART embryos before such embryos may be used for research under a licence from the licensing committee. The bill refers to the present ethical guidelines on ART 1996, and that is an important thing to take into account. It is the ART 1996 guidelines that the bill refers to specifically, and I will talk about that shortly.
The consent provisions in these guidelines primarily deal with consent of participants to ART treatment. They do not adequately address the very different consent to the use of excess embryos for research purposes that will ultimately and inevitably involve their destruction. The guidelines allow for counselling in relation to ART treatment to be carried out either within the clinic where the treatment will be received or independently. The amendments specify that counselling must be independent. Couples undergoing ART treatment at a clinic often form very complex relationships with clinic staff as they go through the emotional roller-coaster ride of successive attempts at IVF treatment.
It seems a better safeguard to ensure a fully free and informed consent to require counselling in relation to the use of excess embryos to be independent of both the clinic and the researchers seeking to obtain the embryos. Similarly, legislation relating to organ donation requires that discussion regarding such donation be conducted by a person independent of both the clinical team treating the patient and the transplant team. So we are looking at a process that is not dissimilar to the organ donation process in terms of consent.
Importantly, and I think this is incredibly fundamental, the amendments require a person to be notified in writing and that they should understand and then consent in writing to the research. Specifically, part of the amendment reads:
receives written notification of, understands and consents in writing to the specific application to which the ART embryo will be put;
This is important and is entirely consistent with COAG. I would like to refer to the COAG 5 April communique where it talks about consent. It says:
... including requirements for the consent of donors and that the embryos were in existence at 5 April 2002. Donors will be able to specify restrictions, if they wish, on the research uses of such embryos.
It is in the communique; the amendments are consistent with the communique. What is not in the bill is what has been said in the communique and, not only that, it was said widely and publicly time and again that the donors would be able to specify the type of research their embryos would be used for. I know what the response from the government advisers will be: `Oh, well, we can set that out in the guidelines.' That is not good enough. We are setting the guidelines here in this parliament; we are creating the legislative framework today that will apply for months and years well into the future, and saying that it will be set up under the guidelines is not good enough.
Let us talk a little bit about the guidelines. Senator Collins has previously discussed the guidelines—the ethical guidelines for ART 1996—at some length in this place. They have been referred to in our committee report at some length. They are draft guidelines. They are currently under review. As a committee, we were not able to comprehensively consider or review the guidelines because the response from the advisers was, `They're currently under review, so they're not that relevant to the committee today.' I find that staggering: we are creating a framework which will apply for years into the future and we have draft guidelines which are currently under review. So we do not even know what the guidelines are. I find that hard to comprehend, and that is why I will be supporting the foreshadowed amendment from Senator Collins which states that this whole regime cannot start until the guidelines are agreed to and the regulations are in place, because what we are doing is setting up a regime to start without knowing what the regime will look like in any event. 
The amendments are entirely consistent with the COAG agreement, and that is a key point that I want to make about that part of the amendments. Amendment (R3) contains three subclauses. The second subclause includes reference to a cooling-off period of seven days. As the excess embryos that may be used in research will be in frozen storage, and research projects require substantial planning time, there seems to be no valid reason not to allow people sufficient time for reflection before they consent to the irreversible destruction of and research on their human embryos for which they are the responsible persons. Cooling-off periods are standard in contractual legal agreements like this for all sorts of reasons and for things less weighty than agreeing to destructive research on human embryos.
Finally, amendment (R3) provides that each responsible person be given access to information about what actually happens to their embryo. This is similar to the needs of organ donor families who are given information about the outcome of the donation. Not every responsible person will want to follow up on this—that is fine; that is within their rights—but those who desire information about these things should have the legal right to obtain it. I notice that that sentiment is consistent with the principle set out in a recent motion by Senators Andrew Murray and Aden Ridgeway regarding access to certain information about their past heritage.
They are the points that I would like to make. In light of the time available, it may be of merit for this chamber—because there are a lot of other things I could add—to receive a short response from government advisers so that we get a feel for where we are at, having regard to the time situation. If all the amendments are entirely acceptable, we can move on. If they are not, we can look at the reasons why and consider those reasons more carefully in this three-week period that we have to consider these amendments. 
I commend the amendments to the committee. I can anticipate the response: `The guidelines are already there.' But they are for ART technology, which is totally different. They could say that the guidelines could be set up in the future but, if we accept that proposal, if these amendments do not go through, what we are saying is, `Here is a blank cheque; here is a blank regulatory regime.' At this stage a one-line signed consent would be adequate. That is totally unsatisfactory, and we need a better regime. We are creating the legislative and regulatory environment today in this chamber, and it needs to be tight. I hope to receive a response, at least at an interim level, from the government.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2002-11-14,"—On this particular matter, I would like to draw the committee's attention to an issue that I raised earlier in relation to the Australian Health Ethics Committee. This is a theme that will carry through quite a number of the amendments. I have sought to get advice—different from my own personal ethical position—on how best we make this the strict regulatory regime that was the COAG intention. The Australian Health Ethics Committee has also touched on this issue in its opinion that the proposed regulatory system would not deliver the strict regulatory regime required by COAG if it did not deal with some grey areas of the draft bill—for instance, those terms open to interpretation such as `proper consent'.
This area of consent is one where AHEC has also indicated that a more detailed approach is necessary. We are in a similar position on this issue to the guidelines matter. Whether the parliament seeks to detail every single aspect of what we think is adequate in relation to how such matters should be interpreted to deliver a strict regulatory regime or whether we rely on the NHMRC and AHEC to detail how they think the likes of guidelines or regulations in such matters are best expressed is open to debate. Certainly, in this case, Senator Barnett has sought the `let's try to detail it thoroughly in the bill' approach. I think AHEC's position on how best to deal with this issue is, in my mind, still quite grey, because it has been very difficult to get full details. The committee will be familiar with my approach in trying to ensure that AHEC gave us the benefit of their advice.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2002-11-14,"—The Australian Animal Health Council (Live-stock Industries) Funding Amendment Bill 2002 will enable levies and charges to be appropriated to Animal Health Australia to repay the Commonwealth for underwriting the livestock industry's share of costs of responding to emergency animal diseases. In 1998, the then Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand, known as ARMCANZ, agreed to develop a national policy on funding principles for pest and disease emergency management. The Australian Animal Health Council, also known as Animal Health Australia, undertook industry consultation and coordinated the development of a new emergency animal disease response cost sharing arrangement. The government advises that this arrangement has broad industry support. This arrangement, known as the Emergency Animal Disease Response Agreement, provides for cost sharing between affected industries and government. It replaces a previous Commonwealth-state agreement.
Under the Emergency Animal Disease Response Agreement, the Commonwealth will underwrite the costs of reacting to an emergency animal disease outbreak, subject to an appropriate repayment scheme involving participating industries. Livestock industries subject to this arrangement will fund their responsibilities through a new animal health disease levy. The levy will initially be set at zero with the exception of the honey bee industry, as this industry has chosen to impose a levy to create a funding reserve. 
The new animal disease response levies and charges will be imposed on the participating industries by regulation under the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Act 1999 and the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Act 1999. To allow the repayment arrangements to come into law, it is necessary to amend the Australian Animal Health Council (Live-stock Industries) Funding Act 1996. These amendments will enable repayments to be appropriated to the Australian Animal Health Council from consolidated revenue and used to repay the Commonwealth. Once a debt to the Commonwealth is known, the emergency animal disease levy will be activated and the levy funds will flow to the Commonwealth. These funds will then be disbursed to the Australian Animal Health Council. That council will manage the funds on behalf of the relevant industry and repay the industry's debt to the Commonwealth.
The bill provides for any levy funds collected in excess of the Commonwealth debt to be redirected to the promotion or maintenance of animal health, including redirection to the industry's research and development corporation. These levy funds redirected to research and development will not be matched by the Commonwealth. The government—particularly the current Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, I might say—do not have a great record on livestock industry matters. The minister's ongoing war of words with the beef industry's peak bodies and his bungling of the administration of Australia's US beef quota are good examples of that poor performance. Nonetheless, I would have to say that it seems the minister has, in this instance, been prepared to work cooperatively with Australia's livestock industries to develop a new animal disease response arrangement, and this bill is a key component of this arrangement. In this case, I am therefore pleased to indicate the support of the opposition to the government's legislation.

"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2002-11-14,"—The Labor Party has circulated a second reading amendment to the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002. This legislation amends the Broadcasting Services Act to delay the start of the high definition television, HDTV, obligations on broadcasters. The proposed opposition amendment delays the introduction of the 20 hours per week high definition quota on metropolitan, commercial and national television broadcasters by six months—that is, until July 2003. This is a holding action to enable the government to finalise legislative changes to the government's high definition television legislation, including flagged changes for an annualised rather than a weekly high definition quota. To ensure industry certainty in the television broadcasting sector, Labor will not oppose the bill. However, we do condemn the Howard government and Senator Alston for their botched digital television policy. Therefore, on behalf of the opposition, I move: 
At the end of the motion, add “but the Senate condemns the Government for:
(a)	continuing to fiddle with its disintegrating digital television regime without addressing the overall problems inherent in the regime;
(b)	refusing to acknowledge that its digital television regime is failing, particularly with respect to the very poor consumer take up of digital receivers;
(c)	creating confusion in the broadcasting sector by promoting multi channelling but not acting to enable it to occur;
(d)	maintaining a failed datacasting strategy which has been completely rejected by the media sector;

Those features are well understood by the government and clearly by the opposition. The government made some changes to ensure that families would have more choice, which will avoid them getting overpayments. I say `overpayments' because I do not know of a family who expects to get more than another family in the same circumstances. Where that family has had an overpayment, that family would expect to pay it back. It is not a debt in the sense of money owed in some other way; it is an overpayment of a benefit. I do not know of a family that has argued to me—I cannot recall one—that they should get more money than another family in the same circumstances.

Will the minister advise the Senate of recent developments in ACCC appointment processes? ",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission</title>,Questions Without Notice,27,1,question
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2002-11-14,"—I thank Senator Brandis for his question and his ongoing interest in the ACCC as a professional barrister and as a senator. It is extremely disappointing that a majority of states and territories have failed to support the Commonwealth's nomination of Mr Graeme Samuel as Deputy Chair of the ACCC. Currently the Chair of the National Competition Council, Mr Samuel is a highly intelligent and competent person with extensive credentials in understanding and implementing competition policy. As the Australian Financial Review reported this morning—quite rightly—lawyers with experience in both business and competition policy who are willing to work in the public sector do not grow on trees. It is a small pool, and it is going to become smaller if every nominee is treated in the same way as Mr Samuel. He has previously been supported by states and territories, including those with Labor governments, in his work at the National Competition Council.
While Mr Samuel's nomination received strong support from some states, there has not been sufficient endorsement for his nomination to proceed, very sadly. The Treasurer has made it quite clear that some of the comments by state governments about the adequacy of the nomination are simply wrong. The process that was followed for this nomination was the same process that has been followed in every appointment in the ACCC since its inception in 1995. It is a process required by the conduct code agreement between the Commonwealth and the states and requires the Commonwealth to invite nominations from the states. The Treasurer wrote to the states and territories not once, as required, but twice—on 31 May 2000 and 5 September 2000—inviting nominations for a number of ACCC positions, including that of the deputy chair. Only one nomination was received in response, and that came from former Chief Minister Carnell of the ACT. She nominated Mr Allan Asher, the incumbent deputy chair, who was not available for reappointment. Five months after the Treasurer's second letter, the Acting Premier of New South Wales, Mr Andrew Refshauge, wrote suggesting a person for the deputy chairman's position. The Treasurer noted that in his recent discussions with Premier Carr he had indicated that he did not wish for that nomination to proceed. After considering possible candidates, the Treasurer then wrote to the states and territories again nominating a candidate: Mr Samuel. The states have had the opportunity to indicate their views. It is absolutely false to suggest that proper consultation processes have not been followed. Indeed, the consultation process that was followed for the nomination of Mr Ed Willett for an ACCC commissioner position followed exactly the same process as that of Mr Samuel for deputy chair. Yet it is only Mr Samuel's nomination that is being opposed.
What could possibly be driving the rejection of Mr Samuel? The real reason the states said no to Mr Samuel, of course, comes down to it being widely reported that New South Wales was behind the push to reject his nomination. What factor could be so powerful and consuming that it could make a Labor premier or treasurer reject a person they knew to be a talented, capable and qualified candidate? At a meeting on 24 October at the Trades Hall Auditorium in Goulburn Street, Sydney, there was a meeting, and minutes recorded that `the President, Comrade Sandra Moait' was in the chair. It was a meeting of the New South Wales Labor Council, and it called on the Premier of New South Wales to oppose the appointment of Graeme Samuel as ACCC deputy chairman. Guess what? That is where it came from. Surprise, surprise! It was pursued, and within two weeks the comrades of the New South Wales Labor Council had directed Premier Carr not to endorse Graeme Samuel, and that is how it happened.

On 12 November, Mr Tanner put out a media release asking the same question. In answering Senator Faulkner's questions, I indicated to the Senate that there was nothing to suggest that I had contacted Detective Sergeant Keuris and that I had absolutely no recollection of speaking to Detective Sergeant Keuris.
I wish to inform the Senate today that I have indeed spoken to Detective Sergeant Rod Keuris—today, for the first time in my life. This morning, Sergeant Keuris rang my office. The record of conversation taken by my office states:
Rod Keuris called reception saying that he wanted it to be on record that he has never spoken to Senator Alston in his life.

He left his mobile number ... 
After being informed of that conversation, I rang Sergeant Keuris to ask him whether he was happy for me to mention this matter in the Senate, given that it had been the subject of questions earlier this week. He indicated that he was happy for me to do so and strongly reiterated his concerns about the behaviour of the Labor Party regarding this matter. Some of us in this game are required to have thick skins, but innocent people like Sergeant Keuris do not deserve to be the playthings of the Labor Party.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2002-11-14,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Family and Community Services (Senator Vanstone) to questions without notice asked today.
I want to discuss the flawed family tax payments system that this government brought into operation some three years ago. Before I address some of the comments in the Ombudsman's report, it is probably useful to remind senators and put on the record the details of the system that the government brought in some three or four years ago.
The details of the package are well known. The government, in introducing the package some years ago, said the changes were going to mean more money, greater benefits and more simplicity for families. The design features of the scheme are also well known. Proposed recipients advise Centrelink of their anticipated income and then advise Centrelink of variations to the proposed income that occur from time to time in an economy such as ours. The recipients receive family tax payments based on the information provided, as amended, to Centrelink, and at the end of the financial year there is the usual balancing activity. Overpayments are recovered as debts; underpayments are paid out. The overpayments are, by and large, stripped back through the taxation system. That is essentially the system that the government brought in some three years ago and which was going to bring much heralded change—more benefits for families, improvements to the system and efficiency introductions. The bottom line was that there would be more, immediate and larger benefits to families, particularly low-income families.
It is obvious to just about anyone—excluding, perhaps, the Minister for Family and Community Services—that the entire system which she brought in is in an absolute shambles. Over 650,000 families—and the figure is going up—were overpaid and have debts, and 400,000 families were underpaid their fortnightly entitlements and only now, at the end of the year, have a catch-up payment. This means that in excess of one million families—around one in two in this country—are not being paid their correct fortnightly benefits. That is almost impossible to comprehend. A system designed to assist families has resulted in one in two families who receive benefits receiving the incorrect payment every fortnight. Both of these groups are being disadvantaged. Those who were overpaid are being hit with debts from out of the blue and those who were underpaid missed out on vital payments throughout the year when they needed them.
If we go back to the origins of the system, it was to assist families on a fortnightly basis, particularly low-income families who have need of such assistance. This system has been the subject of some examination in recent times by the Commonwealth Ombudsman, after a special investigation into the government's administration of this system. The Ombudsman acted on many complaints that he, his office and members of parliament had received which indicated that many families had been caught up in the government's debt trap. The Ombudsman's report has identified 12 core concerns which he saw as indicative and which reflect the problems that families are experiencing now because of the design features of the system introduced by Senator Vanstone some three or four years ago. 
Let us look at some of the problems that ordinary families in this country are experiencing every day. Firstly, the Ombudsman said that the system inherently results in large numbers of debts and that these debts are significantly high. Secondly, he said that debts arising from the scheme are affecting many low-income families and their ability to operate satisfactorily. He said that there are situations in which debts are unavoidable, even when families fully comply with all of their requirements. So the design feature of the scheme requires changes in income levels to be notified. When families comply with that regularly, on a fortnightly basis, there are still problems that lead to unavoidable debts being incurred—a funny sort of system to design, you might note. He went on to say that there are situations in which debts seem to have an unfair retrospective effect—that is, changes in family circumstances cannot be anticipated and may be beyond their control, resulting in significant debts and/or losses or detriment. He also said that there may be particular circumstances in which it is difficult to avoid a debt, such as when a previously non-working parent in a two-parent family gains employment or receives some other income.

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2002-11-14,"—Senator Bishop is quite eager to play in, but what do Labor have to offer? Again, that is the question. Here we are again in a situation where we have had to come in behind Labor and fix up a huge mess. Senator Bishop complains that this system does not provide immediate benefits, but that is exactly what it is designed to do and exactly what it does. Senator Bishop seems to imply that Centrelink in some way is supposed to know exactly what the income details of these families are and yet the payments are based on the income details provided to Centrelink by the recipients. The recipients have the option of making a decision as to whether they underestimate their income so that they can get a tax cheque at the end of the year. A lot of families that I have spoken to make a deliberate decision to do that so that they know that there is going to be some extra money at taxation time. The average payment at the end of the year from the system is a bit over $1,000; $1,028 is the average top-up received by recipients under this system.
I find it a little amazing that the Labor Party want to get in and rattle the system that has made a real difference and provides some options for taxpayers. How much did the Labor Party provide as a top-up when they were in government? Not a cracker; absolutely not a penny. If you were underpaid, that was it. The Labor Party kept it in the bank. They never came near you and never told you that you were underpaid. That was it; it was just too bad. Bad luck. If a person was underpaid, how much did the Labor Party give back? 
—The system was based on the previous year.
—So what we are doing is basing it on the current year's income; that is exactly right.
—That's not what happens. They put the information in and it gets stuffed up by Centrelink.
—That is a pretty bold statement.
—It's true. That's what they're complaining about. They give the information to Centrelink and Centrelink still gets it wrong.
—This government has a proud record of achievement for Australian families. First and foremost, it has provided sound economic management: low interest rates, the lowest inflation in a generation, real growth in wages—something that did not exist under the Labor Party, I might add—and a fairer tax system, where more people are paying lower tax. Again, that has a significant positive impact on families. A single-income couple who have two children and are living on minimum wage received about $9,500 in support from the Commonwealth—a significant level of support from this government that really does have a significant, caring attitude towards families and places a real priority on looking after the family unit. The income-testing arrangements are much more generous: more families are receiving maximum levels of assistance and families are able to keep more of each dollar they earn—again through the lower tax system. Over the next two years, $144 million will be provided through the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy—again, a significant investment by this government in families. From 1 July 2002, families have been able to claim the government's new first child tax refund—again, more for families, for Australian people. 
The government has also made significant improvements to child care—a $600 million increase over three years in child-care payments and $18.872 billion in assistance to families through the family tax benefit, the child-care benefit, the parenting payment, the maternity allowance and the maternity immunisation allowance. This government has a significant record in looking after and caring for Australian families. The baby bonus is a further measure aimed at looking after Australian families.
—Mutter, mutter, mutter.
—That's what you're doing. Why don't you get on with it? Get on with it.

"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2002-11-14,"—I also rise to take note of the answers given by Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Family and Community Services. As mentioned in question time today, I have previously asked the minister a very similar question to the one I outlined today— namely, a question about the situation that a person finds themselves in when they receive inconsistent child support payments and the effect that this has on their entitlement to the family tax benefit. When I last asked Senator Vanstone a question along these lines, I was told that the senator did not answer hypothetical questions—although at the time Senator Vanstone did offer to investigate the matter if I forwarded the information that I had to her. That was back in August. I must say that I am still waiting for an answer— and so is the constituent whose case I referred to the minister.
The issue I have with the case I quoted today is that we are seeing exactly the same procedural stuff-up that we saw in the case I referred to her in August: a person who— through no malice, no intent, no failure to make an effort—is being made to pay back an amount of money that they had no control over. Indeed, the Social Security Appeals Tribunal in this matter have upheld the decision to recover the money, but that is only because they must do so according to the law. The law as it currently stands does not give them the flexibility to make any alternative arrangements. Given the fact that there are numerous examples of how recipients who are also receiving irregular child support payments—and unfortunately there are far too many of them—can hardly ever accurately estimate their income and therefore are always in risk of debt, one has to conclude that the system must be reformed. The system as it currently stands unfairly penalises people that access a certain amount of their income through the Child Support Agency. At the very least, in my view, the law should be changed to allow some flexibility to the people administering the legislation to take this into account and, indeed, to allow the Social Security Appeals Tribunal to also take this into account. In ruling on the case which I referred to earlier today the SSAT state:
However, these factors can only be taken into account where a debt or a portion of a debt is attributable solely to administrative error.
Unfortunately, with irregular child support payments that is not solely due to administrative error. They go on to say that they accept that the individual `did not contribute to the debt in any way whatsoever'. And, finally, they state that they appreciate that the applicant is `frustrated at being faced with a substantial debt that she had no idea that she was incurring and no way of avoiding in the future'. Therein lies the heart of the problem. This issue existed for the applicant last year, it exists this year and, unless there is a change to the law and the way that it is administered, it will exist next year as well. The system as it currently stands is condemning this applicant to a treadmill of debt year after year with little or no means of repaying it. This is not the hypothetical Wright family that the minister referred to in this place when she had a previous portfolio; these are real people confronting the impossibility of the current system that she has created. 
When you look at this law and the way that it is administered and the minister's view on this law, can you really trust what Senator Vanstone has to say? In fact, it has been brought to my attention that on Radio Nationalyesterday, when talking about the breaching regime, she said:
This regime that we now have was in fact endorsed by parliament completely and has subsequently been softened by the government—not by the Labor Party, by the government.
You used to have a system where when you got breached you lost all your payments. It's a Liberal government that changed it to a system where, on your first breach you lost a portion of your payments for a period of time, second breach a larger portion for a longer period, third breach you lose them altogether for an even longer period.
Have I got news for Senator Vanstone. Let us calm down and not rewrite history. Back in 1996 the government destroyed the skilling and training infrastructure that was provided to unemployed people under Labor and proposed an unbelievably harsh regime to strip people of their social security entitlements completely.

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2002-11-14,"—The most amazing ingredient in this chamber at the moment is the capacity to recite the problem but with no solution—to tell us how bad it is out there and offer nothing; to simply regurgitate the Ombudsman's factual assessment of the complaints he has had and then bring them into this place and let them lie on the table so that we can look at them with not one suggestion, iota or hint of a policy. It is a black hole over there. It is a black hole of policy, initiative, energy and ability, sadly.
The facts are, starting at the very top of the tree, that mortgage interest rates are the greatest panacea for families in this country today and there is only one party that can claim any ability in this regard. Of course, that is my party, the government. We have the lowest rate of unemployment, so mortgage payers are benefited not only by low rates of interest but also by very good jobs. In addition to that, we have agreed to top up family allowance. Let us analyse exactly what that means. If you get the assessment, evaluation and estimation of your income wrong, and you receive less than your entitlement, this government will top you up, this government will pay you up to your entitlement. The previous Labor government did not do that. It refused to do that. It drove around doing that. We also say, on the other side of the ledger, something that in my respectful submission is fair and reasonable and the Australian way: if you get a payment that is more than your entitlement—that is, to the exclusion of another Australian family—you have to pay it back, and you have to pay it back in an orderly fashion via your tax refund or by agreement or by future reduction. That logic is inescapably fair and reasonable. 
Of course, the policy that lies underneath the complaints on the other side is that there will be no top up. That is the policy position of the Labor Party. They will not tell you that, but that is their position. You will not get a top up. If you fail to anticipate a decline in your income, such that you are owed money under family allowance, you will not get a top up under Labor. That is the obvious position that they bring to the table.
We have 403 projects, worth $56.2 million, under the Stronger Families And Communities Strategy. An amount of $144 million has been set aside for that. We have allocated $600 million over three years to cover the increased costs of child-care payments. Over the next year, this government will spend $18 billion in direct assistance to families in, among other things, maternity allowance, parenting payments, immunisation allowances, family tax benefits, child-care benefits et cetera.  
Let us have a sample of what we are seeing from Labor, or what we would see were they to be in power. The fact is that costs for electricity, gas, car registration, public transport and, particularly, insurance have gone through the roof in states such as Victoria and New South Wales. Notwithstanding those hikes in charges, New South Wales, in the face of the worst drought in our living memory, has an underspend of $39 million. That is absolutely outrageous. In the face of families doing it tougher than ever before in outback New South Wales, it has an underspend of $39 million. It boggles belief. 
The Labor Party opposed the GST because it attacked the most vulnerable in the community. Yet where do they think the principal amount of $196 million in South Australia, from a gambling tax hike, comes from? Obviously from the most vulnerable, and from families. It is very hollow to come here talking about these issues when the track record is a very sorry, sad one.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2002-11-14,"—I take note of answers to questions from Senator Vanstone, the Minister For Family and Community Services. I particularly want to focus on the answer, or the lack of an answer, that Senator Vanstone gave to the question by Senator Denman regarding the Job Placement, Employment and Training Program, often referred to as JPET. I might pick up on the last comments of Senator Johnston, when he was endeavouring to refer to the most vulnerable. One of the most vulnerable groups in our society, in this country, is homeless youth or youth who for various reasons—as a result of family breakdown and so on—are dependent on welfare. When the last Labor government was in power, the then Minister For Health, Housing and Community Services, Brian Howe, introduced the Job Placement, Employment and Training Program. It was specifically targeted at helping young people in desperate situations to get employment and to get access to accommodation rather than living on the streets. 
When this Prime Minister, John Howard, came to power one of the first things he did was establish his very own Youth Homelessness Task Force. I recognise that the Prime Minister himself recognised the importance of this issue. There was a lot of concern in the community about the issue of youth homelessness and other issues affecting youth such as suicide and drugs. One would have thought that, as a result of that, Mr Howard and his government would be concerned about continuing to assist the young disadvantaged members of our community. His task force undertook its work. One of its main findings was that assistance towards employment was the key to pulling young people out of homelessness and away from a lifetime of being dependent upon welfare.
In particular, the Prime Minister's own task force recommended that the Jobs Placement, Employment and Training Program be not only retained but also expanded and the government supported the task force recommendation. Subsequent inquiries have reinforced that position. Indeed, most recently an independent review of JPET concluded that the JPET program is:
... competitive in achieving employment and education/training outcomes, and that it also offers a wide range of other physical, emotional and educational supports that assist young people with multiple barriers to employment, training and education make lasting transitions to sustainable and independent lifestyles.
You could not get a much stronger and more positive endorsement of this very worthwhile program—started by Labor and continued by this government up until now. This is the basis of the question that was asked of Senator Vanstone. What has happened is that Minister Vanstone wrote two weeks ago to 70 JPET services across the country and informed them that, as of the end of this year, 31 December, they would no longer be receiving any funding. That is more than half of the JPET services across the country. There are 138 JPET services; 70 of them received letters saying that their funding ceases at the end of December. Naturally there was an outcry about this, and representations have been made.  
What is significant is that more than 50 per cent of these services that will lose their funding are in Victoria and New South Wales. What is happening in Victoria and New South Wales in the next couple of months? There are going to be state elections. The federal government woke up and thought, `This is not a good message to be sending prior to a state election,' so the minister has written back and said, `We are actually going to extend your funding to the end of March 2003'—taking it beyond the date of the state elections. They recognise the electoral backlash of this decision. But it is still going to cut out at the end of March, and that is only because they were cynical enough to try to delay the closure date of 31 December this year to March next year. This is a disgraceful decision by this government and it flies in the face of their own earlier recommendations. (Time expired).

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2002-11-14,"—On behalf of the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Nelson, I table a statement and document on the National Report to the Parliament on Indigenous Education and Training. ",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Indigenous Education and Training Report 2001</title>,Ministerial Statements,30,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2002-11-14,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the statement.
Today the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Nelson, tabled a statement based on the National Report to the Parliament on Indigenous Education and Training 2001. In his statement he says he does so with `mixed emotions'. That is the term he uses. When I read this report I can assure you that the term `mixed emotions' is one that somewhat understates one's response. When we talk about inequalities in education it is important to reflect upon the extent of social inequalities in this country. If ever there was an instrument to highlight that, then this report is such an instrument. 
Along with Dr Nelson, and presumably all thinking Australians, the opposition would celebrate the achievements of many Indigenous people who are doing well and obtaining very fine results in our education and training systems. However, having said that, it is important to point out that there is not a great deal to celebrate. When it comes to the issue of the failure of our education systems to ensure equality of opportunity, I think reports such as this draw that starkly to our attention. I note that particularly with regard to the failure of our education systems in this country to meet the needs of young Indigenous Australians, particularly in education and training but also in health, housing and human rights. 
It is important for us to acknowledge progress and also to acknowledge the complexity of the policy issues that are involved in Indigenous education. But it is important also to appreciate just how small the progress has been. If you look in this report, for instance, at just one minor statistic—the numbers of Indigenous students in higher education by gender, a table to be found on page 95—you will see that in 1993 there were 1,241 male Indigenous students who commenced higher education. In 2001, the number had grown by six to 1,247. I am sure there are many other statistics there that highlight that sort of trend and there are many others that will show greater achievements in other areas. But that stands in sharp contrast to what we would expect throughout the general community.
I say that in a context of bipartisanship in this country. One of the highest levels of bipartisanship in education is on the issue of Indigenous education. There is a real understanding across the political spectrum, from most thinking politicians, about just how serious these questions are. I think it is important to appreciate just how serious or how complex and how daunting the task also is.
This report draws attention to the fact that Indigenous students' completion rates in all areas of education are much lower than the national average. Something like a third of Australians at large have post-school qualifications, whereas in Indigenous communities it is 14 per cent. If you think about the numbers of students in a broader context, you get an even more profound set of statistics. The infant mortality rate amongst Aboriginal babies is twice the national average. Life expectancy is 15 to 20 years less than the average. The average life expectancy for Aboriginal men in this country, according to this report, now stands at 56. That is the same level as for the general male community 100 years ago. If you look at the death rates amongst Indigenous people in the age group 35 to 54, you will see that they are six to eight times higher than for the general population. While 71 per cent of Australian families live in dwellings that they own or are purchasing, only 31 per cent of Indigenous households own or are buying their house. Seven per cent of Indigenous people live in dwellings with 10 or more people. That is 50 times the rate that other Australians live in such dwellings. If you examine the broader issues of family breakdown, domestic violence, diet and alcoholism, then you see that the problems are compounded. 
What this points to in my mind is that you cannot look at education in isolation. There are a whole range of issues that need to be examined and, to me, the impact of poverty stands central in that discussion. When we look at the impact of education on life chances and also on health, then I think the correlations are even more daunting. The prevalence of hearing loss and vision impairment—the results of poor living conditions and the lack of access to reliable water supplies—and the fact that kids cannot even get to school suggest to me that there is a huge amount that this parliament has yet to do. Overcrowding and substandard dwellings are not appropriate conditions in which learning can take place. It is no wonder that the sorts of figures reflected in this report and the sorts of concerns reflected in the minister's statement are there.
Senator Crossin will no doubt want to say something on this. Her direct experience working on these issues is much greater than mine. In the work I have done in this parliament, these issues have come up again and again, and the progress reports have remained as meagre as this one. It strikes me that we have to find ways of improving our capacity to provide assistance. We have to understand the social and economic conditions in which people actually live, as distinct from the conditions in which we would like to believe that they live. When we are looking at issues of costs, I think the cost of not providing a decent education to all Australians has to be borne in mind. The Commonwealth has to fulfil its obligations in that regard and make sure that the states fulfil theirs. If they do not, then I am afraid there is a heavy burden for us as a parliament to bear, but it is an obligation that we will have to carry forward. I argue that the cost of not providing assistance is huge and is perhaps not adequately reflected in an official report of this nature, nor can it be.
It is important to also highlight that there have been a number of policy failures by government. The government's position on Abstudy, for instance, has highlighted just how the failure of government to appreciate its responsibilities can accelerate the decline in participation rates. We can look, for instance, at the enrolment numbers and the infrastructure support that is provided in vocational education and in higher education. That is not adequately reflected in this report. These issues were addressed in the Universities in crisis report by the Senate. The government's response to that in recent times has been so grossly inadequate as to defy description.
This is a report that we should welcome. We should welcome the way in which the minister has presented it to the parliament, the fact that he let us know it was coming and the fact that this government shares with, I think, all the parties in this parliament very deep concern about the situation. We have to appreciate that the sorts of objectives we have for this country rest upon our capacity to ensure that equality of opportunity actually means something. It is quite apparent that we have a long way to go. The vicious cycle of poverty and lack of opportunity is going to constantly reinforce what is a great black mark against this country.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Indigenous Education and Training Report 2001</title>,Ministerial Statements,30,1,speech
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2002-11-14,"—I would like to briefly respond to the ministerial statement and the National Report to Parliament on Indigenous Education and Training that has been tabled today. The Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Nelson, tabled his report with mixed emotions, presumably because on the one hand he welcomes the first baseline study of exactly where we are in relation to Indigenous education and training and on the other hand he is overwhelmed by what he euphemistically refers to as the `significant challenges' that lie ahead. I too have mixed emotions about the report and the ministerial statement—not for the same reasons as the minister but because of the amount of time that it has taken for this report to be produced. It is a long overdue report. It beggars belief that this is the first time the Commonwealth government has ever commissioned a baseline study to collate data about preschool, school and vocational education and training for Indigenous Australians. 
To give that some context, the Senate needs to be reminded that the Commonwealth has had responsibility in this area since 1967, when 90 per cent of Australians vested authority in this regard with the national government. How is it that no Commonwealth government of any political persuasion even established the scale of disadvantage that existed and that the needs of Indigenous people, particularly in the area of education, were neglected for some 35 years? It is an indictment of the parliament that it has taken so long to even establish some baseline figures. Surely we are all in agreement that education and vocational training is perhaps one of the most important issues to confront Indigenous people and Indigenous communities, particularly in terms of being able to access and take advantage of opportunities but most of all in terms of being able to break the cycle of welfare dependency and endemic poverty that exists in many communities.
The significant thing about this report is that it is telling us that only a minority of Indigenous students are able to ever achieve levels that are comparable to their non-Indigenous classmates, that for the vast majority the situation is deplorable and there are no quick fixes to their circumstance. It has now been estimated, following on from this report, that it will take another 40 years before Indigenous participation in secondary education is equal to that of non-Indigenous students. That is a long time, and I think we have got to act quickly to make sure that another generation is not lost. I do not believe that we can afford to sacrifice these people to the unemployment queues or what sometimes seems like a permanent pathway to juvenile justice detention centres across the country and, in adulthood, jails. I think that if this report tells us anything it is that we have to start investing by putting forward the resources now.
This fact becomes more and more pressing when we look at the demographics of Australia's Indigenous people because, unlike the rest of the national population, most Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are under the age of 25. In fact, of the 410,000 Indigenous people in this country, there are about 240,000 under the age of 25, and most of them are under the age of 18. Whilst I acknowledge that there are marginal improvements on some fronts, the comparative disadvantage of Indigenous people is now beyond dispute. We have to ensure that we are providing the opportunities and the support mechanisms that are required to turn this situation around.
I do not intend to restate the raft of depressing statistics that are compiled in the report. They are all before us in black and white. They begin at preschool and extend across the board right through to tertiary study and vocational training. What I think is worth noting today is the dropout rate of Indigenous students, particularly from high school and tertiary education, which is something that I raised earlier this year when the ABS released the five-year figures in relation to Indigenous demographics in this country. As the minister has acknowledged in his statement today, the retention rate to year 12 for Indigenous students was at 30.6 per cent in 1995 and since then has improved to 35.7 per cent in 2001. But we have to keep that in context, because those figures really tell us that that rate is less than half the rate for non-Indigenous students in 2001, which stands at 76.2 per cent.
I have spoken to a number of professionals in the education field, and it is so often the case in their experience that most Indigenous people do not complete their education because of financial difficulties. It might be seen as a simple increase in the bus fare to the university or a rise in rent, or problems in being able to access Abstudy; it might be a matter of only a few dollars difference to their weekly income that decides whether or not a student can finish a degree or even get their Higher School Certificate. 
Similarly, in the broader sense, there is also often a link between health issues and poor retention rates. Dropping out of school might be preferable if the student has been suffering from an undiagnosed hearing impairment or vision impairment that has held them back in terms of literacy or numeracy skills being acquired. It seems to me that if there was a greater integration of health and education services we might be able to provide some answers and some reasons for the poor retention rates being there in the first place, because we could detect and deal with them at a much earlier stage.
I want, on this occasion, to encourage the minister, his department and all of those responsible for the whole-of-life approach to look more closely at the reasons behind the retention rates being so poor for Indigenous students and to gather data on this front as well. One thing that I can think of that perhaps may be a suggestion is to make it a compulsory requirement of funding for education providers to also look at compiling exit reports so that we can at least gather some data and some information to start to understand the range of reasons that people do not get the education they are entitled to.
Another important thing that perhaps needs to be identified as a critical issue is the central place that Indigenous cultures must have in the education process. I am sure I am not the first person to raise this with the government; I am aware that the Federation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Languages did so at the time that the parliament was dealing with the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Bill 2000. Their concern back then—and it continues now—is that often it is very difficult to fit cultural outcomes into the straitjackets of performance indicators and targets, as the act requires.
But I think the incorporation of culture into the education process for their children is perhaps one of the most important outcomes, particularly for Indigenous parents, regardless of whether they are in Broome, Cape York or even Redfern. The education process is where cultural transmission and reinforcement of family values can and should be occurring. It may be as simple a thing as recognising the role of elders, their cultural knowledge and the need for that to play a more central role in our institutions of learning.
If police forces around the country have managed to employ and value Indigenous trackers for hundreds of years, why is there is still resistance and reluctance on the part of the education system to do exactly the same with Indigenous knowledge holders in other areas, such as horticultural knowledge, linguistic expertise or artistic skill? Why can't we be more willing to recognise and accredit cultural skills in other areas that are just as critical to the survival of Indigenous identity and our social wellbeing?
I have to ask the question: why is it that Australia's Indigenous languages remain outside the official language status of the country and, as a consequence, receive little financial resources when compared with the so-called international economic languages like French, Japanese or German? Australia's Indigenous languages are not even recognised as national languages, and this is despite the fact that there has been an increased willingness to support and promote languages which are seen as an economic benefit to Australia.
The education system has embraced with fervour Asian languages, especially Indonesian and Mandarin, yet Indigenous languages continue to remain a complete mystery, a relic of traditional communities in only the remotest parts of the country, to the majority of non-Indigenous Australians. Senator Crossin will no doubt raise this issue, but we have to ask why there has been a deafening silence on the part of the Commonwealth government about the Northern Territory government's decision to progressively phase out— (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Indigenous Education and Training Report 2001</title>,Ministerial Statements,30,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2002-11-14,"—I rise to take note of the ministerial statement and the National Report to Parliament on Indigenous Education and Training tabled today by the Minister for Education, Science and Training. I will say at the outset that, while this report is welcomed, from my knowledge of the history of Aboriginal education in this country there has not been a comprehensive report such as this one tabled in the parliament today since the introduction of the original Aboriginal education program—which has now been rebadged as IESIP, the Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Program—11 years ago. It is pleasing to see that, as a result of amendments made to the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000, this report will be annual.
A review of the Aboriginal education program was conducted by Mandawuy Yunupingu midway through the first 12 years of its operation. But time has moved on and many more millions of dollars have been pumped into Aboriginal education, yet we still see very little change. If you look at some of the statistics, you will see that year 12 retention rate for Indigenous students, for example, was 30.6 per cent in 1995, and that has increased to 35.7 per cent in 2001. On that basis, there has been a 5.1 per cent increase in the year 12 retention rate for Indigenous students in this country in six years, but non-Indigenous students have a year 12 retention rate of 76.2 per cent. That is a 40 per cent difference. On that basis, if we are going to make five per cent improvements over six years, year 12 retention rate of Indigenous students will not equal the non-Indigenous student retention rate for another 48 years. In terms of Aboriginal life cycles, that is nearly two, possibly three, generations away. The improvements, while there, are clearly not good enough. The growth in some areas is moving ever so slowly, and in other areas it is moving backwards.
Senator Carr, in pointing to Indigenous students in higher education, highlighted the difference between the number of male Indigenous students in 1993 compared to today. There was a time when the number of Indigenous people undertaking higher education peaked—in 1998 and 1999. In 1999, for example, the figures for Indigenous participation in higher education in this country were: males, 1,542; and females, 2,598. Those numbers have gone backwards since then, and this document shows us that today there are 1,247 males and 2,319 females in higher education. Both those figures are significantly less than the figures for 1999. There is a very clear answer as to why that is the case: that was when this government introduced significant changes to Abstudy. We can pinpoint exactly why and when these numbers fell dramatically. Since the changes to Abstudy, Indigenous people have not been able to get the financial assistance they need to undertake higher education courses—so they do not do it or they drop out or, as this government would want us to believe when trumpeting a major increase in the number of students who have enrolled in vocational education and training, they undertake VET. The figures show us that Indigenous people have moved from higher education into VET. They do not bother about higher education any more; they enrol in vocational education and training.
The other issue is that we do not know the completion rates of Indigenous students. Page 97 of this report refers to those figures. If the figures are right—the report only says `apparent retention rates'; these are not definitive figures—the apparent retention rates of Indigenous students were just hovering above 0.59 per cent in 2001, 0.58 per cent in 2000 and 0.61 per cent in 1999. Again, we see the figures going backwards. Why is that? I believe it is because in some areas of Aboriginal education there are very bad policies which are not assisting and supporting Indigenous people to enter into the education system and to operate as effectively as non-Indigenous people do. We know that in higher education the amount of money provided to universities, for example, to supplement and assist Indigenous people is based on the number of students enrolled in higher education.
Based on the figures that I have just given this chamber, those figures are decreasing. The amount of money that supports Indigenous students in universities therefore decreases, because the two are linked. And we wonder why we are not getting more Indigenous people enrolling in universities, staying at universities and completing their courses. That is just one area of the education sector. Probably, if I had a chance, I would like more than 10 minutes to speak. 
We know from Bob Collins's Learning lessons report that a low retention rate is one of the critical factors as to why Indigenous children in this country are not advancing at the rate they ought to—they simply do not go to school. In the time that I have had to glance at it, this document does not tell us much. It gives us the percentages of children who are not attending school, but in relation to what? Is it in relation to those who ought to be attending school or is it somehow a figure based on the population basis of that area? Clearly we still do not know exactly how many Aboriginal kids out there never go to school and have never been to school as opposed to those children who were once enrolled in schools and now do not attend. Are those attendance figures in this book based on previous enrolments or on the population that we know exists out there and has never attended school?
On secondary education, the new Northern Territory government, to their absolute credit, have moved on this and have decided to do something about Indigenous education. They have actually decided to implement the Learning lessons report, something that the previous CLP government did not want to touch. They have now decided to trial, as Senator Ridgeway said, a total approach to education in four areas in the Northern Territory, where education and health services will be combined and where parents in the community will be assisted in taking a large role in the education of their children. But there are nearly 190 remote schools, and I am only talking about the Northern Territory here. I acknowledge that the Commonwealth government has put additional funds into assisting the Northern Territory government to achieve those aims, but only in four areas in the Northern Territory.
Clearly it is time for this government to sit down and rethink the whole approach to Indigenous education in this country. More money is needed to assist governments like the Northern Territory government to actually get on top of Indigenous education and the lack of outcomes we are having. This government needs to pour buckets of money into creating secondary schools in the Northern Territory. There are at this stage two secondary schools outside of the Stuart Highway radius in the Northern Territory and they have been built by the community or by the Christian schools association. This government needs to assist parents to encourage their children to go to school. All in all, while this is a welcome report, there does need to be an acceptance by this government that it must stop pumping money into programs that just entrench the outcomes that we are getting—or not getting—and that are not improving at a significant enough rate.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Indigenous Education and Training Report 2001</title>,Ministerial Statements,30,1,speech
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2002-11-14,"—Madam Acting Deputy President, I seek leave to incorporate the remainder of my speech in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
Why has there been a deafening silence on the part of the Commonwealth Government's silence about the Northern Territory Government's decision to progressively phase out bilingual education programs for Indigenous students?
There is no doubt that centuries of proactive, institutionalised hostility towards Indigenous cultures and identity have taken their toll.
Indigenous communities have paid a heavy price.
We have all seen newspaper articles which chart a very bleak future for Indigenous languages in this country—like the Northern Territory News in May this year, which claimed that one Indigenous language is disappearing every three years and the decline is accelerating.
Worse still, are research articles like that written by Dr McConvell of AIATSIS (Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies), where he has concluded that of the 15 strong languages left, there is a high risk these will all die out in the second half of this century.
In other words, the invisible web that binds language, culture and identity together, will inevitably break—probably within our lifetime and that of our children. 
I for one, would like to see more benchmarking of Indigenous language programs so that we can start to turn this problem around and save what remains of our languages for future generations.
Conclusion
In closing, I want stress that the Australian Democrats welcome the fact that it is as a result of the resolve of the Parliament in the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000, that all future Commonwealth Governments will have to report on the state of affairs in Indigenous Education every year and be accountable to the Parliament in this regard.
Given that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has excused the Government's lack of progress—even in regard to the very limited goals of “practical reconciliation”—by saying there is no baseline data to measure progress—at least on the education front this kind of excuse cannot be wheeled out in future.
We now have the baseline data—we can quantify exactly how bad the situation is—and we can build on the marginal improvements that exist on some fronts.
Indigenous people want to see improvements in this regard more than anyone else.
As Members of Parliament, we need to remind ourselves that there are only 410,000 Indigenous Australians—the largest total since Indigenous people were included for the first time in the national census in 1971.
This is a quite manageable number to deal with, and we do have the resources to turn the situation around.
We should not be prepared to accept the stereotype of Indigenous affairs as being a terminal case of public policy failure, or allow the needs of 410,000 people to overwhelm our imagination or our ability to formulate responses to familiar challenges within community development.
If nothing else, this report reaffirms the message that progress will only be possible if governments at all levels work in genuine partnership with Indigenous people, and create the opportunities for Indigenous communities the capacity to take control of their futures.
As the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs noted in this report (p.21):
“...children learn most effectively when there is a partnership between parents/caregivers and educators, when there is a sense of community between home and school environments. But the general level of interaction between schools and the local Indigenous communities is often poor.”
What we need to first acknowledge and accept is that:
“... Family involvement in education is more than simply getting families into the schools. ... Schools as institutions of practice and beliefs need to change to mirror Indigenous family values and community beliefs and practices. It is not up to Indigenous families to initiate change, but rather for education systems to reflect multiple world views and perspectives.” (Fleer and Williams-Kennedy, p.21).

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2002-11-14,"—by leave—With regard to the government response to the report entitled Inquiry into the outsourcing of the Australian Customs Service's information technology, I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
On 16 May 2002 the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee tabled its report, Inquiry into the outsourcing of the Australian Customs Service's information technology. The report focused on the Australian Customs Service's implementation of its cargo management re-engineering project, or CMR, and in particular on the information technology aspects of CMR. These involved the replacement of Customs' current range of cargo processing IT systems with an integrated system—the integrated cargo system, or ICS—and the introduction of a different IT platform that increased the role of the vendor, EDS, to replace Customs' current IT gateway, provided by a not-for-profit organisation called TradeGate. It is important to note that TradeGate has representatives from both Customs and industry on the board of that organisation. Also, it probably represented one of the earliest models in the world of an e-commerce hub. It achieved an extraordinarily high standard of e-commerce within that particular community—the import and export community—in relation to Customs.
The replacement gateway is known as the Customs connect facility, or CCF. The primary concern expressed through the inquiry was that changes would mean that the high-volume users of that facility would get lower costs. So many of the witnesses that appeared were arguing that the changes proposed through the CCF would in fact mean that customers of Customs—users of Customs services—that use the system on a high-volume basis would be given lower prices. This would unfairly disadvantage lower-volume customers or users of Customs services. 
The resulting impact would mean that the big end of town would pay lower prices for those services but the smaller users—the Australian SMEs, exporters and so forth— would actually pay higher prices for those services. The inquiry traversed this issue at some length. There have certainly been denials by the Australian Customs Service that price inequities would be the result. As yet we do not know the outcome of that particular matter, but it will certainly be worth watching.
The report also focused on part of the procurement processes adopted by Customs for the development of the ICS and the CCF. Early development of both of these was conducted by EDS Australia, the IT outsourcing vendor, under its outsourcing contract with Customs. Clearly there were concerns that EDS were, for whatever reason, not best placed to provide such a solution; hence, during 2001, EDS and Customs agreed that an alternative provider for the ICS development should be sourced. A consortium led by Computer Associates won an open tender for the application development of the ICS and commenced development in February 2002.
Given the dependency of the ICS on the provision of the CCF, Customs ensured that they contracted directly with the firms that EDS had engaged to deliver the CCF: IBM, Baltimore and SecureNet. Again, I think this reflects a growing awareness within Customs that they ought not become captured by their IT outsourcing vendor, EDS, and can be interpreted as an attempt by Customs to regain some control of that process, particularly given the need to mesh the CCF development with the ICS and so forth. Responsibility for the CCF application development rests with IBM and SecureNet under contract to Customs, as opposed to EDS, which goes some way towards alleviating some of the concerns expressed by witnesses who provided evidence to the inquiry.
The good news is that the government has agreed to both recommendations put forward by the committee. The recommendations were supported by all members of the committee. The first related to the concern that the consultation process with regard to CMR, CCF, ICS and all of those acronyms that they use was not adequate, was not effective and had in fact put at a specific disadvantage many of the stakeholders at the time. The recommendation was that Customs undertake a review of its consultative processes with a view to developing a strategy for consultation processes for the rest of the ICS implementation phase.
The Senate needs to understand that this recommendation comes on the back of several years of concerns and complaints about inadequate consultation. The government response to this was that it would try to improve its consultation processes. Indeed, a strategy was discussed with industry stakeholders on 29 April this year and the published statement includes various times for phases of implementation of the ICS. I will not go into it because I know the minister has tabled the document.
Another recommendation in the report was:
In order to provide certainty for industry, the Committee recommends that, in the event that the Customs Connect Facility and the Integrated Cargo System—
the CCF and the ICS—
... are not in place on the date required by the Customs Legislation Amendment and Repeal (International Trade Modernisation) Act 2001, Customs invoke the procedures described in Section 126E of that Act.
That is a very technical way of saying that, if the new systems are not in place by the time they should be, industry stakeholders will not suffer any unfair penalty or loss or any new penalty under the proposed new system. At the time when this report was prepared there was speculation about whether or not those aspects of the CCF and ICS would be in place. The speculation proved to be correct, so the concerns of the industry were subsequently dealt with by the government, ensuring that no stakeholder in the sector would be adversely affected by delays caused by the inability of Customs to get the new systems operational during the interim phase and that the existing arrangements would apply. As I would like to be able to continue to reflect on this report and this issue, I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,2002-11-14,"—by leave—I present the report of the parliamentary delegation to Indonesia and the 23rd AIPO General Assembly, which was held in Vietnam from 1 to 13 September 2002. I seek leave to incorporate a tabling statement in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
The delegation visited Indonesia between 1 and 6 September. The broad objective of the visit was to promote and foster relations between Australia and Indonesia and to examine the challenges that confront Indonesia over the short to medium term. The delegation met with a range of Indonesian government, private sector representatives and individuals to discuss:
·	Islam, politics and security;
·	poverty reduction;
·	decentralisation;
·	economic and trade reform; and
·	electoral and constitutional reform.
Mr President, as part of the visit, the delegation met with Islamic leaders and visited Muslim educational institutions. The purpose was to gain a clearer understanding of the role and influence of Islam in contemporary Indonesia. In particular, it was possible to discuss the impact and response by Islamic leaders to the events of 9-11, and the role of Islam in politics.
The Islamic leaders indicated their opposition to violent conflict and suggested that their religion placed emphasis on developing moral values and spiritual well-being. In particular, they were opposed to the creation of conflict on the basis of religion and extremism. 
In relation to the role of Islam in politics, representatives of the Muhammadiyah University commented that `Islam is not Indonesia'. Instead, Indonesians should focus on justice and the virtues of education. Background information suggests that Islamist political parties had yet to attract widespread political support.
Mr President, there are an estimated 40 million people in Indonesia living in poverty. There are more than 1 million internally displaced people (IDPs) who are now competing with a growing urban underclass for survival. The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) operating from 1 July to 31 December 2003 will help 2.1 million Indonesians who face the highest risk of hunger and malnutrition.
As part of the itinerary, the delegation visited an AusAid sponsored United Nations World Food Programme Project in North Jakarta providing food aid to the urban poor. Mr President, the level of poverty and deprivation suffered by these people is profound.
It is estimated that the poor survive on no more than US$2 a day. They go without adequate food, water and shelter, and the provision of essential infrastructure such as running water and sewerage. The site that was visited consisted of about 2000 people living in small corrugated iron dwellings that were joined and tracked along a river bank. These people were occupying the area illegally. The WFP explained that these people have no access to government social support because they are `illegal settlers in a shadow existence on the fringes of the economy.'
The visit formed an essential part of the delegation's itinerary by clearly demonstrating the significant challenges confronting Indonesia. If possible, all Australian delegations to Indonesia should seek to visit a World Food Programme in order to better understand the extent of the problem and the valuable role played by the poverty reduction programmes.
Mr President, the policy of decentralisation is about the devolution of government functions away from Jakarta to the regions. Key decentralisation laws came into affect in January 2001, and devolve to district level governments most government functions, with the exception of foreign policy, defence, the judiciary, national planning and religion, to be assigned to the districts. The central government transfers 25% of its revenue to district level governments with some modulation to ensure equity across all districts. 
The delegation explored some of the implementation issues and the possible impact of decentralisation upon the delivery of government services and investment. For example, regional administrations have the challenge of delivering programs and services. The Central government needs to develop systems and processes to ensure that services are being delivered according to agreed national standards, especially in the areas of health and education.
Mr President, Indonesia's growth rate is currently around the 3% mark. This is considered to be inadequate to generate sufficient levels of employment growth and help in the reduction of poverty. Some market economists suggest that growth rates of at least 6 to 7% are required to achieve sufficient employment growth. It is estimated that the current growth rate of 3% will result in almost 1 million people joining the ranks of the unemployed every year.
Some of the key issues affecting economic recovery include the level of government debt, decentralisation, and issues influencing investor confidence.
The delegation met with the Coordinating Minister for People's Welfare, Mr Yusuf Kalla, the Minister for National Development Planning Kwik Gian Gie and the Minister for State Owned Enterprises, Mr Laksaman Sukardi. One of the major themes during these discussions was economic recovery and Government debt.
The key problem with high levels of government debt is that it diverts revenue away from public programs designed to stimulate the economy. In addition to this are concerns about falling levels of private sector investment.
A key concern affecting investor confidence is the credibility of key public institutions and the impact of corruption, collusion and nepotism which Indonesians call KKN.
The delegation was advised that reporting and transparency in Indonesia has improved. The newspaper media seemed prompt in its reporting of alleged or proven cases of corruption. For example, the Jakarta Post of 5 September 2002 reported on the sentencing of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr Akbar Tanjung to three years imprisonment for corruption. The court said that Akbar was convicted of misusing US$4.44 million in State Logistics Agency funds that were supposed to be earmarked for a poverty alleviation program, when he was minister/state secretary in 1999 under President Habibie.
Mr Tanjung has decided not to stand down while he appeals the decision with the Jakarta High Court.
Mr Tanjung attended the 23rd ASEAN Interparliamentary Organisation (AIPO) General Assembly in Hanoi, Vietnam between 8-13 September 2002. The 24th AIPO General Assembly will be held in Indonesia in September 2003. Under the AIPO statutes, Mr Tanjung became President of AIPO at the conclusion of the 23rd General Assembly.
Mr President, the final issue that was examined during the delegation's visit was constitutional and electoral reform. The recent annual session of the MPR held in August 2002 finalised a series of constitutional reforms. These reforms are due to take effect before the 2004 elections. The key reforms include:
·	the creation of a two chamber legislature comprising the House of Representatives (DPR) and the Regional Representative Council (DPD) which will function like a Senate. The DPR and DPD sitting together will form the MPR with the power to amend the constitution;
·	removal of 38 seats reserved for the military and police who will under the reforms have the right to vote; and
·	direct election of the President.
The DPR now has the responsibility of framing legislation to implement these changes. The DPR's Legislation Committee has indicated that the DPR will give priority to the bills directly relevant to the elections in 2004, on political parties and on general elections. Bills on direct Presidential elections and the new structure of parliament which have yet to be drafted will be fast tracked.
Mr President, in concluding this section, the Parliamentary delegation to Indonesia fulfilled its primary objective of promoting parliamentary relations between the two countries. A range of meetings were held with key parliamentarians, parliamentary committees and Government Ministers. Through these meetings it was possible to discuss some of the key issues facing Indonesia during the short to medium term.
Mr President, Australia's interests are linked to Indonesia's stability and prosperity. In support of this goal, Australia provides aid assistance to Indonesia which is currently estimated at $121 million in 2001-02.
Mr President, the 23rd AIPO General Assembly was held in Vietnam between 8 and 13 September 2002. Parliamentary representatives of eight ASEAN countries, two special observer countries, and eight observer countries attended the Assembly. The Assembly provided a forum from which to examine, discuss, and propose solutions to issues of common interest throughout the Asia-Pacific region.  
One of the major features of the General Assembly was the Dialogue Session during which representatives of the ASEAN member countries discussed issues with the observer countries. During Australia's Dialogue Session, the key issues examined included:
·	regional and political matters;
·	trade and investment issues; 
·	educational and cultural cooperation; and
·	scientific and technology cooperation.
Regional and political matters
Mr President, the key discussion issue raised during this part of the dialogue session focused on Australia's level of integration with Asia as opposed to Australia's ties with Europe. The Australian delegation explained that Australia's commitment and integration with Asia is substantial and growing. On a trade basis, North Asia and South and South East Asia combined, account for almost 60% of Australia's merchandise exports. Trade with Europe only accounts for 13%. In relation to aid, Australia committed an estimated $376 million to ASEAN in 2001-02.
The Lao delegation highly appreciated Australia for maintaining good relationships and being a strong supporter of ASEAN and AIPO especially in the area of strengthening economic integration, particularly with new ASEAN members
The Cambodian delegation requested Australia to continue to send observer teams to Cambodia to observe the national elections to be held in July 2003. 
Trade and investment
The member countries of AIPO expressed their appreciation at Australia's level of trade and investment in ASEAN countries. Representatives of Singapore, Vietnam and Indonesia suggested that Australia should seek to increase the level of trade and investment where possible.
Educational and cultural co-operation
Mr President, it was acknowledged that Australia and ASEAN have good cooperation in education and cultural issues. During 2001, for example, there were about 70 000 ASEAN students studying in Australia. In August 2001 the Australian Government and the World Bank launched the virtual Colombo Plan with an Australian contribution of $200 million over five years. This joint initiative seeks to use information communication technologies to address the causes of poverty.
Scientific and technology cooperation
Developments and innovations in the area of science and technology, particularly information communication technologies, can contribute to development through enhancing education and training. These aspects of science and technology were understood by all delegates. The delegation suggested that Australia should enhance its technology transfer to ASEAN countries. In particular, the Vietnam delegation suggested that as Australia's farm practices are sophisticated, it should share its agricultural knowledge with ASEAN countries.
Meetings and inspections
Mr President, because Australia is an observer country to AIPO it does not have to attend all sessions of the conference. In view of this, the Delegation, with the assistance of the Australian Embassy, Hanoi, Vietnam, attended a series of meetings and inspections. 
The majority of these meetings were with non-government aid organisations which were receiving aid money through AusAid. These meetings provided an opportunity to appreciate at first hand some of the aid projects that are supported by Australia. The focus was on their effectiveness and their contribution in assisting with development objectives.
Mr President, in conclusion, the Australian Delegation's attendance at the 23rd AIPO General Assembly was very successful, and the Australian Parliament was ably represented. In addition to attending the General Assembly, the delegation attended 29 meetings during its visit to Indonesia and Vietnam. 
I would like to express the Delegation's appreciation to staff of the Australian Embassies in Indonesia and Vietnam. In particular, the then Ambassador to Indonesia, HE Mr Rick Smith provided the delegation with comprehensive policy advice. In addition, Ms Kate Callaghan deserves praise for developing an effective itinerary which more than met the needs of the delegation. On arrival in Hanoi, Vietnam, the delegation was provided with excellent support from HE Mr Joe Thwaites and his staff. In particular, Ms Sandra Henderson deserves praise for supporting the delegation and developing a time effective itinerary.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2002-11-14,"—The Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 and the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002 propose equivalent amendments for two acts: the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and Customs Tariff Act 1995. These cognate bills implement a national excise scheme for low-alcohol beer, remove the excise on the water component of emulsified diesel-water fuel blends and remove excise on certain non-recyclable oils and lubricants now subject to excise under the product stewardship oil scheme.
The decision to implement a national excise scheme for low-alcohol beer is welcomed by Labor. The key feature of this scheme is the cessation of state subsidies for low-alcohol beer, with assistance to be delivered instead through lower excise rates. Labor consider that there is merit in these proposals to simplify the excise system and eliminate the requirement for wholesalers to claim rebates for excise that they have paid. Labor commend this initiative and will support it. However, it is interesting to note that the excise rates for both low-alcohol and mid-strength beer will be reduced. For low-alcohol beer, it will be for both the draught and packaged product, while for mid-strength it will be for the packaged product only. This is expected to result in reduced prices for low-alcohol draught and packaged beer in all states and territories except Tasmania. However, the price of mid-strength draught and packaged beer will increase in all states and territories except Queensland and the Northern Territory. This is because the reduction in the excise rate will not compensate fully for the abolition of previous state and territory subsidies for this product.
This bill also contains amendments to the excise treatment of emulsified diesel-water fuel blends produced by licensed excise manufacturers. There is evidence to suggest that such blends offer a cost-effective way to reduce harmful emissions from heavy-duty engines without expensive modification to vehicles. At present, there is an anomaly in the excise treatment of these blends in that the water component of these blends is excisable in addition to the diesel component. To my knowledge, the Australian Taxation Office has never managed to levy a direct excise on water anywhere else in the taxation system, nor should it begin now. Instead, these amendments will properly address this anomaly by making the water component of blends produced by licensed excise manufacturers excise-free. Labor supports the removal of this anomaly. 
The bill also contains some changes to the government's product stewardship oil levy. This scheme seeks to reduce the impacts of waste oil through imposing an excise style levy on virgin oils and lubricants, and providing grants for the recycling and reuse of the oils. Labor supported the product stewardship oil scheme at the time of its inception. It attempts to address a serious environmental issue—namely, the current large-scale leakage of toxic waste oil into the environment. By providing an economic incentive for recycling and reusing this oil, it aims to prevent environmental damage by reducing the waste oil stream rather than having to remedy the damage after such waste oil is dumped into the environment. Given this intention, it is reasonable that, where oils do not enter the waste stream, they should be considered for exemption from the levy. The government sets out criteria in the bill for such exemptions—namely, where the oils are used in the manufacture of another product and are not contributing to the waste oil problem and are clearly distinguishable from other oils that do.
On this basis, this bill excludes certain food grade white mineral oils, certain polyglycol brake fluids and certain aromatic process oils. We consider that the government's criteria for considering the exemption of oils from the levy are reasonable. On these grounds, Labor will support the exemptions proposed, on the understanding that they meet the technical criteria set out in the bill. Finally, the bill also abolishes the automatic indexation of the PSO levy, to bring it into line with other petroleum fuels. Labor are opposed to automatic indexation of the excise of petroleum products; therefore, we support the removal of automatic indexation of the PSO levy. Labor support the bill.",SENATE,<title>EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,37,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-11-14,"—I rise to speak to the changes to the excise arrangements on alcohol, specifically the beer components, in the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 and the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002. Although the amendments that we are to move are not before you, we did send a draft of them to the Treasurer, the Treasurer's office, the shadow Treasurer's office, the Independents and the minor parties on 24 October, so they will have had the chance to have a look at them. I have slimmed them down slightly. I apologise; I had the understanding that they had already been circulated, but they had not.
The second thing I want to do, and I was assured that the explanatory memorandum would be somewhere in the chamber, is to table an explanatory memorandum that will cover my amendments to those bills. I seek leave to table the explanatory memorandum.
Leave granted.
—Moving on to my second reading debate remarks, these bills cover a number of areas. They cover the product stewardship oil scheme, the diesel water emulsion relief from excise and low-alcohol beer. I am going to restrict my remarks to the low-alcohol beer and related areas. Alcohol is one of those things that is a part of our community. Not surprisingly, there is not just cross-party consumption of the product—except for Senator Conroy, I might say on the record—but also cross-party support for addressing matters related to the use and abuse of alcohol. The Democrats have, in concert with credible and authoritative health campaigners who are experts in the alcohol field, long campaigned for the promotion of low-alcohol products. Well before the coalition's new tax system for alcohol was finalised in 1999, as portfolio holder for the Democrats I was keen to see an integrated low-alcohol policy introduced in Australia.
In the new tax system negotiations with the government, there was an agreement between the government and the Democrats to progress these issues over time. I have always been disappointed at the government's subsequent lack of progress. At various times, both formally and informally, I have tried to persuade the government and others as to the social and health desirability of introducing an integrated low-alcohol policy for Australia. The government has done good work over the past few years in putting forward changes that have helped to deal with low-alcohol beer. These bills are an example of addressing bureaucratic inefficiencies and standardising tax incentives for lower alcohol beer products. 
The government and the Treasurer are to be congratulated for the lengthy negotiations that have resulted in a much improved beer taxation regime. What is missing from this situation, though, and from government generally is a clear and genuine commitment to reform taxation arrangements related to low-alcohol products much more broadly. In recent years, as portfolio holder, I have written to the Treasurer a number of times advocating the reform of alcohol taxation in order to deliver better health outcomes and a more equitable taxation regime. No doubt his minders or offsiders or bureaucrats respond and he just signs the letters, because I have as yet seen little sign of his bright mind in the responses. I have always been willing, both within and outside this chamber, to act on a sound idea without regard to who may have put the idea forward. I get the distinct feeling that, because this is something that Treasury itself has not come up with, it really has not shown much enthusiasm. Why one would not show enthusiasm for delivering a comprehensive low-alcohol policy regime quite escapes me.
So, quite frankly, I am disappointed. The introduction of a comprehensive low-alcohol regime and the further removal of alcohol taxation anomalies is something all parties could and should agree upon and should act on within a reasonable time frame. This is also not the time for the opposition to be timid. The opposition has in the past adopted a small target strategy. This area of alcohol tax is one in which there are well-informed opposition members, and a shadow minister like Mr David Cox can make a significant contribution.
What is at stake here? Why do I emphasise the importance of a comprehensive low-alcohol regime? Of the 77 per cent of Australians who consume alcohol, health experts say that 36 per cent consume alcohol at what are considered to be harmful rates. About 70 per cent of young Australians aged between 14 and 19 consume alcohol. The rate of consumption at harmful levels by younger Australians is high, and 57 per cent of males and 74 per cent of females do so at harmful rates. In addition, the issue of either licit or illicit drugs used in conjunction with alcohol has become a substantial issue of concern.
In the late 1990s the estimation of the economic cost of alcohol consumption imposed on the Australian community was more than $4½ billion per annum. This costing, based on mid-1990s mortality and morbidity figures, comprised more than $3½ billion of tangible costs, including those associated with the loss of work force productivity, health care costs and resources used in addictive alcohol consumption. There is nearly $1 billion of intangible costs, including mortality, where the value of loss of life or consumption forgone by deceased and suffering imposed on the rest of the community are added together, and morbidity, which is how the pain and suffering of the sick and the suffering imposed on the rest of the community is calculated.
Drinking alcohol has health, social and economic costs and benefits for both individuals and populations and for the industry sectors involved, and even for governments, which get much revenue from that area. People who drink in moderation have better health outcomes—and I would suggest better social lives—than many of those who do not drink; although, abstainers do achieve very much better health outcomes than heavy drinkers. Drinking alcohol at risky and high risk levels introduces long-term harm and is estimated to cause over 3,000 deaths each year. Perhaps Treasury, which does not pay much attention to health issues, might just stick that number in their heads: over 3,000 deaths in Australia a year, accounting for about four per cent of all male deaths, two per cent of all female deaths and about 50,000 hospitalisations. The short-term and long-term effects of excessive drinking make roughly equal contributions to those deaths. Immediate personal and social environmental effects can see family, social and work related disruptions that can end up with severe workplace and relationship breakdowns. Ultimately, criminalisation is a high potential outcome resulting from extended use.
For men, alcohol is the leading cause of disability in developed countries and the fourth leading cause of disability in developing countries, out of a list of 11 major risk factors. Put simply, alcohol abuse is still a major problem in this country and this government will be negligent in its duties if it does not take every available avenue open to it to address this problem. Let me stress again: the government has to be given credit for a much improved low-alcohol beer taxation regime, but that is only part of the opportunity. In this bill, as a contribution to furthering and incentivising low-alcohol policy, the Australian Democrats recommend that all packaged low-alcohol ready to drink products other than cider should be subject to the same tiered excise regime that has successfully encouraged the production and consumption of low-alcohol packaged beer. There is no justification for the omission of RTDs from the national scheme that applies to low-alcohol beer. The scheme is designed to encourage the consumption of low- and mid-strength beverages by providing lower tax rates for lower alcohol strength products. 
Taxing low-alcohol packaged RTDs at a higher rate than packaged beer of the same alcohol content discriminates against individuals who prefer to consume lower strength RTDs and prevents the development of a market for lower strength RTDs. Some states and territories, like Queensland and the Northern Territory, pay a low-alcohol subsidy for low-alcohol RTDs. I would suggest to you that that is good social policy. There is no sound policy reason why the Commonwealth should not reduce the excise duty on packaged low-alcohol RTDs in the same way that it reduced its excise duty on packaged low-alcohol beer. There is no revenue cost; nothing hangs on it. There is no risk.
There is clear evidence that for consumers these products are direct substitutes for one another, competing for market share. Producers of RTDs would therefore be encouraged to produce low-alcohol versions of their products by lower associated tax costs. A submission to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee review of the bill from the only known maker of a low-alcohol RTD, Kirwan Quest Pty Ltd, has confirmed this view. There are significant community and health benefits to be obtained from encouraging production of lower alcohol RTD products. These benefits are unlikely to be limited to production of low-alcohol beer. That policy view is supported by a wide range of health industry groups, including the Alcohol and Other Drugs Council of Australia. I stress to the chamber that the alcohol health industry groups and experts support the route I am taking.
I am on the public record as supporting the volumetric taxation of wine. Those views are shared by a very large number of wine producers. Some who are attracted by my idea of having an option are the Wine Industry Association of Western Australia, the Queensland Wine and Grape Producers Association, the Vineyards Association of Tasmania and individual companies like Helm Wines and Stefano Lubiano Wines. I expect there will be substantial numbers of others who will be writing to me on this basis.
What do I mean when I talk about the volumetric option? There are two aspects to the volumetric taxation of wine. One aspect would be that, if it were applied to low-priced wines, it would raise the price of those wines. It has been found in research and from the policy decisions undertaken in the Northern Territory that, if you raise the price of cask wine, you lower alcohol abuse substantially in those communities. The second benefit of volumetric taxation of wine is that it lowers the price of higher value wines. The result of that is that it is good for jobs and the industry, without contributing to alcohol abuse.
The government is committed to WET. The Senate has passed the WET bills. I can see no prospect of WET, which is an ad valorem tax, being done away with. I recommend that the government seriously consider the option of entities or producers being able to choose to take either a volumetric approach or a WET approach by entity or producer. I can see no reason why that is not possible. As I say, there are large numbers of wine producers who are attracted by the option idea.
There are two benefits in a volumetric taxation approach. It is a means of raising the price of low-priced full-strength wines such as cask wines, which is desirable from a health policy perspective. The value-added wine equalisation tax has maintained, and in some senses increased, the low-priced, cheap alcohol cask market that is at the recorded centre of alcohol abuse. It is also a means of lowering the price of high-value wines, which is desirable from an economic and industry perspective. The value-added WET is seen to be punishing the premium and small-business bottled wine sector. The Democrats supported the introduction of the WET regime as part of the new tax system. The proposal that I am putting forward does not disturb that support or the WET itself. There is no low-alcohol wine category at present, so that is not a risk. The option regime is an entirely fair proposal. 
There is a clear need for taxation incentives to produce low-alcohol wines, especially low-alcohol cask wines. This is supported by much of the respected medical and health literature. For instance, on page 45 of the Australian Alcohol Guidelines, put out by the National Health and Medical Research Council in October 2001, it states:
A recent Australian study found that the beverages most commonly associated with night-time assaults and alcohol-related injury were the cheaper alcohol products—cask (not bottled) wine, and regular-strength (not low-alcohol) beer ...
That study was by Stockwell. The amendments I put to the committee will provide such an incentive. They would apply to 100 per cent grape wines not exceeding eight per cent alcohol by volume.
In summary, what I am proposing includes the implementation of a taxation scheme for low-alcohol wine, involving the removal of low-alcohol wine from the WET regime and the inclusion of low-alcohol wine in the Excise Tariff Act schedule. I am suggesting an increase in the rate of excise on brandy to bring it into line with other spirits. I do not understand why we have a brandy market where 40 per cent of brandy—namely in the form of cognac and foreign brandy—is taxed at a different rate to other spirits. It is cheaper to get imported brandy than it is to get Australian rum. Spirits are spirits; alcohol is alcohol. It should be taxed at the same level.
We also know that use of some alcohol products appropriately does assist in promoting a healthy and happy society in a number of ways. The Australian Democrats are not wowsers. We say that, where there are benefits, take advantage of them in moderation and, where there are consequences, take action to address these. Our message to the government is simple: you are not taking enough action, despite the great credit I give you for the efforts you have made on the beer side of things. Changes to the taxation laws that advocate low-alcohol products cannot be seen as anything other than a positive move for the health of our community.
We are advocating low-alcohol products. There is no revenue cost in doing this, as these low-alcohol products—either in wine or in RTDs—do not exist at present. The government will say, `Aha! But it will take volume away from products which do generate revenue.' Our answer to that is that the health and social benefit will outweigh the small revenue cost, and we should be able to evaluate the effects over time, even if we cannot at this stage cost them accurately. So we are advocating more choice—the coalition likes choice; more flexibility—the Democrats like flexibility; and more opportunities—Labor likes opportunities—for people within our community to choose to drink low-alcohol products. I referred earlier in my address to my second reading amendment, on sheet 2732, which has been circulated. I now move:
At the end of the motion, add “but the Senate, noting that many sectors of the wine industry are experiencing difficulties, particularly small producers in the bottled wine market, requests that the Government:
(a)	explore the feasibility of offering the wine industry the option to choose by entity/producer either to be taxed volumetrically or ad valorem, so that a volumetric wine taxation system could operate in tandem with the ad valorem WET system; and
(b)	arrange for the feasibility to be assessed either by an inquiry by a government appointed body, or by the Senate Economics References Committee, for report by the last day of February 2003 for consideration of their findings by the Government in preparation for the 2003-04 Budget”. 
That is a request. It is not an imposition. It is wise. I can assure the chamber that many hundreds of wine producers will be supporting that approach. I look forward to the support of the chamber for it. In closing, I say to the Labor Party and to the government that low-alcohol products are an issue where a bit of political adventurism is necessary. It is obviously a good health policy position and you do have the opportunity to make a difference.",SENATE,<title>EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,37,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2002-11-14,"—I thank Senator Conroy and Senator Murray for their contributions and constructive comments on the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 and the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002. There is very little on which I disagree with Senator Murray in relation to the principles which he is espousing. I think if you look at the actions the government has taken over six years, particularly with the introduction of the new tax system reforms, you will see that the government has moved significantly towards the sorts of principles that Senator Murray has espoused.
We argue, however, that these bills certainly do not set out to become a platform for alcohol taxation reform. Certainly, a significant amount of reform was put in place under ANTS. I think it is fair to say that that created significant costs and implementation expenses for a very important industry, particularly the wine industry but a range of other sectors of the industry. I think it is fair to say that most sectors of the industry benefited from some reforms there. I know as a Western Australian—and Senator Murray is also a Western Australian—that there is a significant sector of the industry in our home state of Western Australia that would have preferred us to take that opportunity to go further and introduce volumetric taxation. But I think those of us who have been in this debate for a long time know that there are equally strong views put by grape growers and wine producers in other geographical zones of Australia—or `appellations', as they call them on the Continent.
There has been a vigorous debate in this industry about this form of taxation. I think it is an important debate. It is a debate that will continue. It is a debate that the government will closely monitor but it is not something that we would seek to enter into in a piecemeal fashion. I think it is fair to say—and I think Senator Murray would admit—that he has approached reform in a piecemeal fashion. The government has made significant reform. Senator Murray has commended that. These bills seek to do a number of things and in relation to the taxation of beer they seek to bring in a replacement to the existing state and territory schemes with a uniform, national, administratively efficient concession scheme for low-alcohol beers.
The changes in these bills do not represent a change in policy in relation to the taxation of alcohol; they simply represent a transfer of responsibility from the states to the Commonwealth. These are not bills that seek to change alcohol taxation. They validate a range of tariff proposals, one of which happens to concern beer. In the government's consideration of alcohol taxation arrangements which took place with the introduction of the new tax system—and that was only four years ago—manufacturers of pre-mixed drinks, for example, did benefit in particular from the outcome of that review. Excise rates were reduced on those, comparable to the rates on spirits, to something closer to the rates for full-strength beer and there were drops of up to 37 per cent in the rate applicable to pre-mixed drinks.
In relation to wine, the reforms in the new tax system, when you combine them with the rebates offered by the states, allow wineries to effectively sell their wine free of the wine equalisation tax at the cellar door or via mail order up to a retail value of around $600,000 per annum. Small producers who are not registered for the GST—that is, with a turnover of up to $50,000—do not pay wine tax at all. The government's commitment to the health aspects of alcohol consumption is, I think, on the record. We have put into place a series of actions over the years, particularly through the new tax system, and the government are also interested in seeing the outcome of the inquiry requested by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing into the marketing and promotion of ready to drink or pre-mixed alcoholic products to minors. I understand that the parliamentary secretary has asked the National Expert Advisory Committee on Alcohol to undertake this inquiry and it might shed some light on the sorts of influences on drinking behaviour that we have to think about. The government will not be supporting Senator Murray's and Senator Murphy's amendments. The government will not be supporting the second reading amendment that Senator Murray has moved in relation to a proposed review by either the Senate Economics Committee or an independent body. 
We believe that the reforms that took place under the new tax system have only just been bedded down by a large and important industry and that it is important to have some certainty. That does not, however, rule out change or reform in the future. There is, as I said earlier in this contribution, merit in many of Senator Murray's arguments. From my position, I am certainly not going to rule out any future reform in this area. I welcome the debate; I think it is a very important debate. I have spoken particularly about the wine producers in Western Australia who I have dealt with—I know there are other supporters around the country; I just happen to be in closer proximity to those in WA. I enjoy being in proximity to them, especially when I do my regular tours around the wonderful vineyards of my old stomping ground in the Swan Valley and the Margaret River region. I think that most of those wine producers took the same position that Senator Murray did in relation to the WET tax. They saw the benefits of the ANTS reforms, the new tax system reforms. They would have liked more reform but they saw that it was incrementally moving to a better system. Of course, those who support volumetrics say you could have an even better system.
I do not think that even Senator Murray would underestimate the challenges involved in moving further down the path of alcohol taxation reform. There are significant public policy issues, broadly, and also significant political issues that you cannot ignore—you have to deal with those. I know Senator Murray is genuinely trying to be helpful in that regard and I welcome that assistance in the debate. The government will monitor and engage itself in consideration of further reform in a timely and diligent fashion, as always.
Question negatived.
Original question agreed to.
Bills read a second time.",SENATE,<title>EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,37,1,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2002-11-14,"—I can say that I am extremely pleased to speak on the Egg Industry Service Provision Bill 2002 and the Egg Industry Service Provision (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Bill 2002 because these bills provide for a new egg industry structure, including the declaration of a new industry services body. The industry services body will provide promotion and research and development and other services to the egg industry. The Egg Industry Service Provision Bill provides for the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry to declare a new industry services body and then enter into a funding agreement with that body for the receipt of levies collected by the Commonwealth for the industry's promotion and research and development and the Commonwealth's matching funding for research and development expenditure.
The second bill, the Egg Industry Service Provision (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Bill, provides for the transfer of assets from the existing egg subprogram of the Rural Industry Research and Development Corporation to the new body. In relation to the current industry structure, egg industry services are currently provided by the Australian Egg Industry Association, the industry peak body, and the egg subprogram of the Rural Industry Research and Development Corporation. A levy of 7.87c per laying chicken is currently imposed under the Primary Industries Excise Levy Act 1999. The levy funds are largely devoted to research and development through the Rural Industry Research and Development Corporation egg subprogram, with some funds directed to residues and animal health matters. 
In 2001 the Australian Egg Industry Association presented a proposal to the Commonwealth seeking a new industry structure, including a corporations enacted company, to undertake egg promotion, research and development, and to provide other industry services. Under the proposal the existing Rural Industry Research and Development Corporation egg subprogram would transfer to the new company. The Australian Egg Industry Association has also sought a new statutory promotional levy at 32.5c on each laying chick purchased from a hatchery. The proposed levy would be imposed on egg producers but collected by the hatcheries. All egg producers who pay the statutory promotional levy will be eligible to become members of the new industry body. The Australian Egg Industry Association engaged in extensive consultation on the industry reform, including the new levy, between April and September last year. The results of an industry ballot suggest significant support for the Australian Egg Industry Association's proposal from both producers and hatchery operators. 
The bill provides for the new industry structure sought by the Egg Industry Association, and the new regulations will implement the proposed levy regime. The existing levy for research and development residues testing and animal health will remain in place. With regard to the industry and the need for these reforms, the Australian egg industry has suffered from declining fortunes over the past decade. In the period 1989 to 1999, Australia's annual egg consumption declined by six per cent, from 146 to 137 eggs per person. Per capita, egg consumption is much higher in comparable countries. In New Zealand, for example, the average annual consumption is 208 eggs per person. The industry attributes the difficulties to outbreaks of Newcastle disease, enforced changes to hen caging and an inability to engage in generic marketing or to fully benefit from industry research and development. Previous attempts by the industry to introduce and manage voluntary promotional levies have failed. The industry believes a new industry services body will have the capacity to engage in effective generic marketing to boost egg consumption and to better capitalise on the links between product promotion and research and development. 
The Egg Industry Service Provision Bill 2002 will provide authority to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry to declare a company limited by guarantee as the industry services body. Before the declaration is made, the minister will be required to enter into a funding contract with the company. The contract between the Commonwealth and the company will establish obligations in respect of the use of levies and matching research and development funding and the company's accountability to its members and the Commonwealth. Further accountability measures will be contained in the company's constitution. Once the declaration is made, the Commonwealth can make payments to the company. Agri-political activities will continue to be undertaken by the Australian Egg Industry Association as the peak industry body. 
With regard to the levies, the effective use of statutory levies can assist producers to pool resources and work collectively on research and development, promotion and other priority industry tasks. Most traditional industry sectors have a levy system and a number of key primary industries have recently amalgamated their research and development and marketing functions. For example, Australian Pork Ltd and Horticulture Australia have been created as a result of change in research and development and marketing arrangements in the pork and horticultural industries.
The opposition has recently received representations from some members of this industry opposed to the imposition of the levy as proposed. I have received a copy of a petition signed by 76 industry members that specifically addresses opposition to the levy. I know other senators have received letters and telephone calls urging opposition to the new industry arrangements. The imposition of industry levies is, of course, often a difficult matter. It should be noted, however, that these bills do not impose the proposed levy; rather, they provide for a new Australian egg industry structure, including the declaration of a new industry services body. The matter of the proposed levy will be the subject of a yet to be introduced regulation. 
During the examination of this legislation by the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee into the provisions of the bill, a number of concerns were raised in respect of animal welfare and the accountability of the new industry body. The committee, while noting these concerns, recognised the following: the legislation is not actually concerned with specific animal welfare issues, as you would have gleaned from my earlier comments, and the new company will provide generic promotion and research and development functions for the whole industry. Additionally, issues relating to animal welfare are more appropriately covered through other activities and through state legislative arrangements. With respect to the accountability of the new company, the committee formed the view that the provisions are adequate and similar to those for other companies operating under Corporations Law. I might say that the opposition concurs with the conclusions of the committee in respect of these matters. 
In conclusion, the opposition supports the implementation of this new egg industry structure, as requested by the industry and developed by the industry itself. The coming months will be crucial for the future prosperity of the Australian egg industry, and of course one of the main challenges is the crippling consequences of the current drought. Egg producers, like pork, chicken and beef feedlot growers, are currently facing uncertain feed supplies and escalating prices. The opposition has called for a national grain audit to address concerns about grain hoarding, uncertain supplies and skyrocketing feed prices. Thus far, the government has ignored the opposition's demands. For the sake of Australia's intensive industries, including our egg producers, I renew the call for a national grain audit today. The opposition agrees to the passage of these bills and trusts that the new industry structure will assist the industry to build a more secure future for its members.",SENATE,<title>EGG INDUSTRY SERVICE PROVISION BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,38,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-11-14,"—On behalf of the Australian Democrats, in particular my colleague with responsibility for agricultural issues, Senator Cherry, I speak to the Egg Industry Service Provision (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Bill 2002 and the Egg Industry Service Provision Bill 2002. The bills were the subject of a brief committee report which, again, I think is a good example of the value of the Senate committee system. Rather than senators chewing up a lot of time in the Senate chamber, asking questions backwards and forwards in the committee stage, the committee was, in the space of a few hours, able to get a lot of facts from the department, the industry and from bodies with interests in the legislation and, from there, develop a report.
The Democrats have a couple of concerns with these bills and with the way in which the rationale has been put forward about what the bills are and are not about. It is a bit strange to the Democrats for the government and the opposition to suggest that these bills do not and should not have anything to do with animal welfare when one of the reasons provided in the majority report for this levy is that in part it is to address issues associated with negative consumer perceptions about the nutritional benefits of eggs and animal welfare concerns. So if we are passing bills enabling a levy to be put in place to address animal welfare concerns, it seems a bit strange to the Democrats that the government and opposition are saying that the bills do not have anything to do with animal welfare and that we should stop trying to raise animal welfare issues as part of it. 
It is not surprising that there are negative consumer perceptions about the egg industry. Whilst I do not think that it is the worst industry in terms of the infliction of animal suffering, it probably is the most well known one in the public's mind. The public's reasonable instinctive concern with cramming a large number of birds into a small cage for their entire lives is very difficult to overcome. One wonders why consumers and producers are expected to fund a levy to overcome negative perceptions rather than perhaps to address the root of those perceptions, which is the fact that 92 per cent of the egg industry still operates out of cages. You can reduce the negative animal welfare implications of caged hens but you cannot remove the animal welfare problem while the cage exists. 
The only way to fully address animal welfare problems is to get hens out of cages. That does not mean that there are no animal welfare problems with the other systems— that is, farm laid and free-range methods— but they can be addressed if they are done properly. You cannot properly address animal welfare issues while birds continue to be caged for their entire lives. That is not the utopian dream of a few tree huggers; it is a widespread approach that has been adopted by many countries, particularly in Europe, where cages are to be phased out over the next 10 to 15 years, at different rates in different ways in different countries. There is a clear move away from the cage. Any suggestion that the industry would collapse as a consequence has been proven wrong by the fact that that move is happening.
During the committee hearings one member of the committee seemed to think that animal welfare concerns interfered with consumers' ability to choose. It is true that you can choose between free-range and cage-produced eggs; although, as came out in the inquiry, the labelling of those eggs is not particularly clear and has not progressed very far—that is, whether eggs are accurately labelled as being produced from a caged-hen system. Choice and availability are not as clear-cut as that. Choice is dramatically hindered by the overpricing of eggs produced through the barn-laid and free-range systems. Because it is a boutique, niche type market, producers are able to price eggs far over the rate that reflects the extra production costs. As the Productivity Commission's report a number of years ago showed, once an adequate volume of production is reached, production costs from more animal welfare friendly systems such as a free-range system are fairly small per egg. Nonetheless, other concerns need to be addressed.
In many ways it is fair to say that this bill sets up a body that follows down the path of a few other primary industry bodies in recent years and to ask why there is a problem with this one. That is a fair argument but some accountability issues are coming to the fore. Accountability is not just about reporting requirements under the Corporations Law. I do not have any concerns in relation to that and I agree with the committee's assessment of that matter, but the issue is broader than that, particularly in terms of what still does not happen. We are passing legislation even though there is no full detail about what the constitution of the AECL will be or about the contract between that body and the government. Parliament's ability to oversee research priorities to ensure that the body operates in the way suggested—that is, as an industry-wide body rather than one that focuses on specific sectors—will be reduced because it is to be an incorporated private body outside of government control.
The Senate recently encountered such a problem when it passed a motion, which I moved, seeking a report by Livecorp, which is a similar body to the one we are about to create: an industry body created by statute. The government refused to table an animal welfare related report produced by Livecorp about conditions on a ship that was exporting animals. The government claimed that the report was held by the company, that it was a private organisation, that it was the company's report, that it was nothing to do with the government, and that the government cannot force it to provide or publish the report. That is a perfect example of the public and parliament being prevented from gaining access to materials that are critical to our ability to oversee the operations not just of that body but of the industry more widely.
Clearly, in the case of live exports, whatever view you take about them on an economic or animal welfare ground, there is public interest and parliamentary responsibility in being able to oversee how the industry is operating. The fact that a report about that issue was prepared by Livecorp, a private body created by statute, means that we apparently cannot access it, even through something that is supposedly significantly powerful—that is, the Senate's power to pass returns to order requiring the government to table documents. 
Again, that is another example of where parliament's ability to scrutinise areas that are supposedly in our sphere of responsibility is being lost tiny piece by tiny piece and being ceded to agreements between state and federal governments and to agreements between the executive and industry bodies, with parliament being cut out of not just the process but the ability to scrutinise ongoing activities. There are genuine accountability issues here for the Democrats—and not specifically because this is about the egg industry as opposed to any other industry—and they need to be scrutinised bit more closely. There is a fair prospect that this will not be the last industry body established by statute that this parliament will be considering. The problem that we have identified needs further examination.
In relation to the issue of consultation, and Senator O'Brien flagged this, the information provided by the Egg Industry Association to the committee claimed that the proposal for the development of a promotion capability for eggs was the subject of a comprehensive national process of consultation with egg producers last year, as required under Commonwealth levy guidelines. They stated that it resulted in overwhelming levels of support by over 90 per cent of those who participated. In the government's explanatory memorandum it was claimed that the consultation was extended in order to ensure that all stakeholders were aware of the proposal and had the opportunity to provide comment. There should not have been any exclusions based on whether or not people were actually members of the Egg Industry Association.
Despite that, as Senator O'Brien noted, in the last couple of days I have received a flurry of phone calls to my office and petitions or letters from producers. I had 74—a couple more must have come to Senator O'Brien's office, because he said `76'—producers opposing this levy. If, as the Egg Industry Association says, there are only 344 commercial producers, and 76 of those have written in either saying they oppose the levy or, even more concerning, saying they were not aware of it, that raises some question marks about the validity or the veracity of the consultation process that occurred. Again, that needs to be probed a bit further because it appears to me—and as this has only come up in the last few days I have not had the opportunity to fully explore it—that these producers that have expressed concerns are of the smaller scale. One of the concerns expressed in relation to the bills was that they were basically going to be dominated by the big producers. The sudden triggering of concern in the last few days from, I believe, small producers reinforces the fear that the body will operate predominantly for the few large producers who dominate the industry and obviously enable them to dominate it even further.
That ties back to the animal welfare issue. Whilst many of the large producers have free-range or barn-laid alongside the caged systems—in some cases as part of the whole establishment—the fact is that they are doing that to cater to the small boutique market while seeking to continue to expand the intensive side of the industry, which is of course the caged hens. The complete failure of state ministers a couple of years ago to act to phase out the cage—instead entrenching it with an absolutely minimal increase in size—is something that should be condemned.
I find it ironic that the industry is now seeking that the parliament pass a bill to enable a levy to be imposed to help it promote itself better to overcome the negative public perceptions of the fact that it is still insisting on caged hens. It might make more sense and be cheaper in the long run for the industry not to have to impose levies to help it overcome a negative public perception image by getting rid of the problem that is causing the negative public perception, which is cramming all the birds into the cage. I suspect that if one did an economic cost-benefit analysis one might actually find that you would come out better in terms of dollars and cents at the end, and obviously the hens would come out a hell of a lot better.
The narrow-minded, short-term focus of the industry and their incredible reluctance to change, which I have witnessed over many years, in many ways works against their own long-term interests. The stubborn refusal to act to address what is widespread public concern about the ongoing widespread use of the battery cage is going to continue to dog the egg industry. I think that is self-evident. As senators might be aware, I have had an interest in this issue for a while. I still have some postcards in my office if you want me to autograph one! I think it is one that will continue, regardless of whether I continue to campaign on it, because it provides a clear, easy focus for people. Most people have a general, inherent dislike of seeing animals suffer. There is no more obvious and clear-cut symbol of a suffering animal than having a cage with three or four birds squeezed into it—which are unable to turn around, stretch and flap their wings—and having them caged for what is also a dramatically shortened life. I do not think you can ever overcome the negative public perception about that, quite frankly, and I think it is ridiculous for the industry to impose a levy on themselves, and therefore the consumer, to help promote themselves out of a negative perception. I will not draw analogies because people will find them offensive, but it pretty much speaks for itself. 
The promotion is also meant to deal with negative public perceptions about health issues relating to eggs. I am not going to get into a debate about whether eggs are healthy for you or not. Contrary to some media reports and perceptions, I am not a vegan; I do eat eggs from time to time, although not particularly regularly. There is certainly a significant body of credible scientific research that highlights health problems with egg consumption. The industry comes up with another body of credible scientific research that says eggs are really healthy for you and you should eat more. Indeed it gave evidence to that effect to the inquiry. There have been number of reports recently about egg consumption being linked directly to an increased risk of ovarian cancer. I cannot imagine that the industry is necessarily going to be out there promoting that in the public interest, but I suppose it is unrealistic to expect an industry to actually promote information that is against its own interests.
Again, it raises the question of the appropriate use of these levies. It is a levy that the industry wants to impose on itself. There are also arguments about whether the economics of generic promotion actually work. I think the evidence for that is fairly flimsy. However, if the industry wants to put a levy on itself to promote itself because it thinks it will work, who am I to argue with it? Let it do it and see how it works. I am pretty dubious, but if that is what it wants to do that is fine.
In conclusion, for the long term the Senate needs to have a closer look at some of the accountability or transparency issues that occur when we set up this type of body. When I use the word `accountability' I am not implying corporate wrongdoing, and that is why the Corporations Act provisions are fine; I am talking about transparency and the ability for the public and the parliament to know what the money is being used for, and that ability is weakened. There are obviously going to be ongoing issues in terms of animal welfare implications. You cannot run away and hide from that. You cannot just build nicer, cleaner and bigger buildings with better security systems to keep people like me out. The public will continue to be aware of the reality. I know egg producers continue to say that they are concerned about animal welfare and that they are building nicer facilities with temperature controls and all that. That is all well and good, but the fact is that the birds are still in very small cages with other birds for what passes as company. That basic fact cannot be overcome. Putting more and more research into ensuring hen welfare when they are going to continue to be in that system seems to me to be fairly pointless and a waste of money.
The fundamental point, and this is why it is an animal welfare issue from the Democrats' point of view, is that if this generic promotional levy does work, if it increases egg consumption and if it is only focused on a neutral industry-wide body then there is no doubt that, if it continues to include 92 per cent of the egg industry, it will be 92 per cent of a larger number of eggs. As a result of that, a larger number of birds will be in cages. In effect, people who buy free-range eggs will be subsidising that promotion to expand the caged egg industry. That is also a bit unfortunate. Having said all that, the bills will obviously pass. It is something that the industry—or parts of it—want and the ongoing scrutiny of the activities of this corporation, once it is established, is obviously something the Democrats will keep a close eye on. ",SENATE,<title>EGG INDUSTRY SERVICE PROVISION BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,38,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2002-11-14,"— I thank honourable senators for their contribution to the debate on the Egg Industry Service Provision Bill 2002 and the associated bill, the Egg Industry Service Provision (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Bill 2002. This legislation has come about as a result of moves within the egg industry to rationalise its marketing and research and development activities, and to provide other industry services to the egg industry which will enable it to be more responsive to the challenges that it faces.
I would like to deal with some of the issues raised by senators during their speeches and certainly with the issue flagged by Senator O'Brien and continued by Senator Bartlett about the opposition to the levy. As Senator O'Brien remarked, there was a formal consultation period from April 2001 until 30 September 2001, and during the period since only two letters of complaint have been received. Ninety-four per cent of 238 producers who voted on the proposal were in favour of this legislation and the implied levy and they represent over 96 per cent of the laying hens flock.
I should also point out that I too have had some comment on the issues raised by the protesters. The signatories to the petition that has been circulated have not been able to establish bona fides. It has not been shown that all the signatories are producers or will be paying a levy under the new arrangements to be implemented. It is still an absolute fact, and has been clearly shown, that the majority of the industry is vastly in favour of the establishment of the corporation. I have a letter from the Australian Egg Industry Association telling me that. They have analysed those figures and still maintain that around 94 per cent of voters voted in favour of these proposals. As I will be the one who decides these matters for the egg industry, I am perfectly satisfied with that demonstration of support for the legislation.
With regard to Senator Bartlett's comments on animal welfare, I believe that the establishment of the new company will provide the industry with a greater resource base and a more focused means of providing a way of addressing issues of concern to the industry. That includes the need for the industry to respond to any regulations or resolutions relating to animal welfare. Obviously, the company would not have any direct role, and it is not proposed that it would have any direct role, in enforcing animal health and welfare issues, because these are clearly matters for state legislation. However, it is expected that under the proposed new arrangements the new company will be able to provide direction and leadership to industry in addressing these concerns, as well as assist with the development and implementation of initiatives relating to animal health and welfare arising out of the primary industry standing committee framework and other relevant fora.
Moreover, as an industry services body, the new company will have the capability to undertake, on behalf of the industry, policy research and analysis on important industry issues such as animal welfare standards. The new company will take on the research and development functions that are currently provided to the egg industry under a subprogram of the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation. As one of its priorities, that organisation has a focus on animal welfare and the new arrangements will not affect the Commonwealth's ability to require the industry to meet these priorities through the new company in the future.
With regard to Senator Bartlett's concerns about parliamentary access to the new company's operations—and he quoted his dealings with Livecorp recently—the contract between the Commonwealth and the new body is in the draft stage. However, it is expected to include a clause which will require the company to provide all reasonable assistance required by the Commonwealth in respect of any evaluation or inquiry into the company's performance. That includes any inquiry conducted by parliament or by a parliamentary committee. I commend both the Egg Industry Service Provision Bill 2002 and the Egg Industry Service Provision (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Bill 2002 to the Senate. 
Question agreed to.
Bills read a second time.",SENATE,<title>EGG INDUSTRY SERVICE PROVISION BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,38,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2002-11-14,"—The Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill 2002 was introduced into the House of Representatives on 21 March 2002. A previous bill, substantially similar to the one now before the Senate, was introduced last year and lapsed when the election was called. In introducing the bill, the Attorney-General stated that bankruptcy had been devised as:
... a shield that might be used, in the last resort, by an impecunious debtor to seek relief from his or her overwhelming debts. Over the years, some unscrupulous debtors have learned to use bankruptcy as a sword to defeat the legitimate claims of their creditors.
That sentiment—the idea that bankruptcy is used by the rich rather than the broke—has been on the rise over the previous year, given the prominence which has been given in the media to high-profile bankrupts, including a number of lawyers who appear to be living the high life while being officially bankrupt—some of them more than once. If the bankruptcy law is being abused, it is appropriate that it be reviewed and amended to ensure that loopholes cannot be exploited.
Labor certainly supports those measures in the bill which will make it harder for otherwise well-off people who are using bankruptcy improperly. However, despite the hype generated by the Attorney-General, there is little in this bill which will have any substantial impact on cracking down on the top end of town. On the contrary, much of the reform is squarely directed at low-income people who are forced to go into bankruptcy because they cannot pay the debts they have incurred. They are the people referred to in ITSA's recent report entitled Profiles of debtors. This is a bill which is typical of a government that protects the greedy, not the needy. The last major overhaul of bankruptcy legislation was in 1996, shortly after the coalition came to office. The 1996 bill was substantially based on Labor's 1995 bill and incorporated amendments recommended by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee in September 1995.
This bill does a number of things. It gives official receivers a discretion to reject a debtor's petition where it appears that, within a reasonable time, the debtor could pay all the debts listed in the debtor's statement of affairs and that the debtor's petition is an abuse of the bankruptcy system. It abolishes early discharge from bankruptcy. It will make it easier for trustees to lodge objections to a person's discharge from bankruptcy and harder for bankrupts to sustain challenges to objections. It clarifies that a bankruptcy can be annulled by the court, whether or not the bankrupt was insolvent when a debtor's petition for bankruptcy was accepted. It doubles the current income threshold for debt agreements to allow and encourage many more debtors to choose this particular alternative to bankruptcy.
Other changes proposed by the bill streamline the operation of the act or are a consequence of the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia—that is, ITSA—having become an executive agency. The 2002 bill drops a measure previously included in the 2001 bill which would have introduced, in relation to most debtors, a mandatory 30-day cooling-off period under which the debtor may have withdrawn the petition within 30 days of the official receiver having accepted it. This measure was heavily criticised, as it would have lengthened the period of harassment already faced by bankrupts from creditors and debt collectors, without showing any appreciable benefits for creditors. While Labor supports the need for bankruptcy reform, there are a number of aspects which are less than satisfactory which I now wish to touch upon. 
Concerns were expressed during the Senate committee hearing on this bill that, in drawing up the reforms, the government paid little attention to those organisations who most closely represent the interests of those people for whom the bankruptcy legislation exists—that is, low-income people. When somebody comes to the realisation that they cannot meet their debt repayments—it may be that they have too many credit cards and just cannot cope with the financial situation in which they find themselves—one of the first people they often see is a financial counsellor. These people are at the coalface of our personal insolvency system. Often, by visiting a financial counsellor, it is possible to provide people with the assistance to budget their way out of debt. Other times, the only option is bankruptcy.
I would have thought that, in framing a personal insolvency system, one of the most important groups of people to listen closely to would have been the financial counsellors. But the Wesley Community Legal Service expressed the view:
... proper consultation with interested and relevant community based welfare organisations did not occur but rather lip service was paid to a few select organisations ... financial counselling organisations were not consulted properly.
The detailed provisions of the bill, which are targeted more at the low-income bankrupts who are in over their heads than at the bankrupt barristers who sit back in their harbourside mansions, reflect that lack of interest in the experience of financial counsellors. As the Wesley Community Legal Service submitted, the bill will `disadvantage many of the poor in society and their families' while debt collectors stand to gain. That is a shocking indictment of a government which has professed to govern for all Australians but which instead has been caught time and time again knocking down those who are least able to stand up for themselves.
The bill proposes to abolish the provisions which allow early discharge for low-income bankrupts. The first point to make is that those who will be affected by this measure will be among the most vulnerable in our society. Therefore, you would think that the government should present compelling evidence why it is necessary for the good operation of bankruptcy law in this country that the provisions be abolished. The government has not made a convincing case at all for the abolition of early discharge.
Administrative early discharge provisions were introduced in 1992 in response to concerns that low-income earners did not have any real capacity to avail themselves of the existing early discharge provisions that required an application to the Federal Court. At that time, only a very small proportion of bankrupts availed themselves of the early discharge provisions, because of the costs involved in making an application to the court. In almost all cases where early discharge was sought, the order was granted. In respect of early discharge, the second reading speech tabled by Senator Bob McMullan, as he was then, on 22 August 1995 stated:
Commonly, persons who succeed in obtaining orders for discharge have become bankrupt as a result of failed business activities, and seek early discharge so as to enable them to resume such activities. These are usually also persons who have the capacity to contribute to the estate from income, but do not do so. The proposals in the Bill will restore equity to the operation of the early discharge system, and the eligibility and disqualification criteria are designed to ensure that where a person has become a bankrupt because of commercial culpability, he or she is disqualified from early discharge.
Under the current early discharge provisions, a bankrupt may apply for early discharge after six months from the time when he or she files a statement of affairs with the registrar. The eligibility criteria are: firstly, the bankrupt has no, or insufficient, divisible property to enable a dividend to be paid to creditors; secondly, the bankrupt has not disposed of property in a transaction that is void against the trustee; and, thirdly, the bankrupt earns an income that is less than the actual income threshold amount applicable to him or her at the time the application for early discharge is made. 
Disqualifying criteria include where the bankrupt has previously been bankrupt or the unsecured liabilities of the bankrupt exceed 150 per cent of his or her income in the year prior to the date of bankruptcy, more than 50 per cent of the bankrupt's unsecured liabilities are attributable to the conduct by the bankrupt of business activities and the bankrupt has given false or misleading information about his or her assets, liabilities or incomes. From these qualifications and disqualifications, it is clear that the abolition of the early discharge provisions will only affect low-income earners and will only affect them in respect of their first bankruptcy. Early discharge is not available in respect of second and subsequent bankruptcies.
There is no evidence that these provisions are being abused. Public hearings by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee into the bill were characterised by a complete lack of evidence as to the need for the abolition of the early discharge provisions. Mr Donald Costello, Acting Adviser for the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia, who provided evidence to the committee on the policies underlining the proposed changes, summed it up in this way:
There are no statistics which would be available to help make a decision as to whether or not early discharge is an appropriate regime to have. All we can provide is feedback from Credit Union Services Corporation of Australia Ltd, which is a significant lending group representing a substantial number of credit unions, plus persistent correspondence from mainly small business creditors over the years who say that it is too easy for people to walk away from their debts.
I believe that the abolition of these provisions is actually an expression of this government's attempt to divide Australians by scapegoating the most disadvantaged. I am confident that Australians will reject the negativity of this government, just as Northern Territorians rejected attempts by Mr Denis Burke to divide the Northern Territory community by running on the issues that he did.
The key feature of the early discharge provisions is that they were designed to deal with the increasing number of consumer bankruptcies which were due `more to misfortune than misdeed'. This is happening to Australians across the country. With an explosion in the use of credit cards over the last decade, more and more people have access to easy credit and more and more people are running into financial trouble—so much more that now Australians are faced with paying an extra 10 per cent on everyday items whenever they go to the cash register.
And what is this government's approach? Instead of recognising that its policies have forced greater financial hardship on individuals and small businesses and in many cases sent them to the wall, this government is now in denial that people run into debt trouble not because they are irresponsible about spending their money but because the pressure on them is so great that they are driven into debt. In introducing this bill, the Attorney-General said:
The provisions were targeted at a new category of bankrupt—consumer debtors with low asset backing who over-extend and then cannot repay their debts. However, many believe that bankruptcy in this group is due more to lack of financial responsibility than to misfortune.
This is a cold and heartless statement from a cold and heartless government—one which has inflicted so much hardship on struggling Australians and which then seeks to blame them for that hardship. The government should not be blaming struggling Australians for the hardship that it has visited upon them.
Labor does not support the heartless philosophy behind the abolition of these early discharge provisions and believes that no compelling justification has been advanced for their abolition. Instead, Labor will seek to amend the bill to retain the early discharge provisions but to allow early discharge only after two years. This proposal will create a greater incentive for potential bankrupts to enter into alternative arrangements such as debt agreements to avoid bankruptcy, while still providing some relief for low-income debtors who have bitten off more than they can chew by virtue of the increased difficulties forced upon them by this government. The bill also seeks to amend section 265(8) of the Bankruptcy Act, which provides: 
A person who has become a bankrupt and, within 2 years before or she became a bankrupt and after the commencement of this Act, has contracted a debt provable in the bankruptcy of an amount of $500 or upwards without having at the time of contracting it any reasonable or probable ground of expectation, after taking into consideration his or her other liabilities (if any), of being able to pay the debt, is guilty of an offence and is punishable, upon conviction, by imprisonment for a period not exceeding 1 year.
The bill proposes to amend the section by removing the minimum threshold requirement of $500. The government says that the amendment will prevent the situation arising where a person could not be prosecuted when, before bankruptcy, they went on a spree and ran up a number of debts of less than $500 each but who at the time had no `reasonable or probable ground or expectation of being able to pay the debt'.
The government also claims that the amendment will bring the Bankruptcy Act into harmony with the equivalent Corporations Law provision. Labor's concern is that the abolition of the threshold may result in the prosecution of debtors who have incurred small debts—of amounts less than $500—for example, in respect of unpaid utility bills or overdue rent payments. This is more evidence that the government is out of touch with the basic needs of struggling Australians. The inability to meet the costs of these necessities of life should not result in the possibility of prosecution.
While there is an interest in bringing the insolvency law into harmony with the Corporations Law, the approach should not be inflexible. After all, corporations do not have to incur basic personal expenses necessary to live, whereas people do. Accordingly, Labor will seek to amend the section so that a person cannot be prosecuted for incurring a debt in respect of a reasonable or necessary personal or household expense without any reasonable ground or expectation of being able to pay the debt.
Section 271 of the Bankruptcy Act effectively retrospectively criminalises gambling in the two years prior to the declaration of bankruptcy. There are a number of problems with this provision. First, problem gamblers are not aware and could not be expected to know that their gambling may later place them in breach of section 271 of the Bankruptcy Act. Second, the existence of section 271 acts as a disincentive to problem gamblers declaring bankruptcy to begin to address their debt problems and turn their lives around. Third, and this is probably most concerning, fear of imprisonment may actually increase suicide risk for problem gamblers contemplating bankruptcy as a last resort. I think we would all agree that a person should not be discouraged from declaring bankruptcy for fear that doing so will turn him or her into a criminal. Whatever the reason behind the introduction of section 271, it appears out of place today, now that we have a greater understanding of gambling as an addiction.
While the government has focused on removing protections for low-income earners, it has shirked the real issue: cracking down on those people who use bankruptcy as a means of avoiding their tax obligations. Labor is concerned that the proposals put forward by the government do not at all address loopholes—which are predominantly taken advantage of by high-income bankrupts—in part X of the act. Part X provides for three alternatives to bankruptcy: entering into a deed of assignment, a deed of arrangement or a composition with creditors.
While the use of part X arrangements has declined in recent years, ITSA has stated that part X arrangements are `generally used by higher income earners and people in business who are able to offer their assets or payment from income to creditors'. Part X has generally been seen as a useful mechanism for bringing a debtor and creditors together to work out arrangements that may result in a superior outcome for all parties than the bankruptcy of the debtor. Nevertheless, over the years it has become clear that the procedure is open to abuse and some legislative amendments have been proposed to cure perceived defects.
In 1987 the Australian Law Reform Commission report identified abuses including: debtors giving misleading or inadequate information to creditors; controlling trustees convening meetings in obscure places and not giving sufficient notice of meetings; debtors stacking meetings with persons who exercise or purport to exercise voting rights in favour of the debtor; and conducting meetings without an impartial chairman. Many of these recommendations have never been acted upon. Labor has moved a number of amendments to address weaknesses and flaws in part X—provisions which high-income earners are over-represented in utilising. 
I welcome the fact that the Attorney-General has recently responded to Labor's call for a review of part X. It certainly came as a surprise, after a spokesperson for the Attorney-General was quoted in the Age earlier this year as saying there was no need to reform part X `because the rules are already designed to provide as much protection as possible to creditors'. Now it appears that the Attorney-General is not so sure. While a review is welcome, it must be backed by meaningful action to crack down on part X abuses. The government cannot simply sit on whatever recommendations ITSA makes as it has sat for 10 months on the bankrupt barristers report.
As I have said, if bankruptcy laws are being abused it is appropriate that they be reviewed and amended to ensure that loopholes cannot be exploited. Labor supports the measures in the bill which will make it harder for otherwise well-off people who are using bankruptcy improperly. However, I urge the government to support Labor's amendments when they are moved at the committee stage because they would restore a degree of balance, equity and compassion to the government's bill.",SENATE,<title>BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,39,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-11-14,"—With regard to the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill 2002, the Democrats are generally supportive of the government's program to reform bankruptcy law. In recent years there has been a substantial increase in the number of bankruptcies, particularly of individuals, and the government is attempting to encourage people to consider alternatives to bankruptcy and to clamp down on those who abuse the bankruptcy system.
Particularly offensive was the revelation that senior Sydney barristers have been using bankruptcy as a means of tax evasion. Their poncing, if you like, in the courts of this land and their assumption of morality impugn the reputation, credibility and good faith of the vast bulk of barristers and lawyers, who conduct their tax affairs appropriately. That revelation has highlighted the need to ensure the integrity of the bankruptcy system. I note that some provisions in these bills increase the powers of regulatory bodies to deal with those high-income earners who do use bankruptcy for debt avoidance purposes.
Unfortunately—perhaps it is a reflection of human nature—the government's legislation is unlikely to put an end to some of the more outrageous abuses of the bankruptcy system by a few high-income earners. Australians are rightly angry to see some corporate or former corporate high-flyers claiming bankruptcy and avoiding creditors despite having obvious wealth at their disposal through some third-party entity or third-party family member. I have heard the government's words of condemnation of those practices and I hope that they continue to bring forward legislation which tightens the screws on such people.
Such people should not be able to avoid creditors through artificial arrangements that secure their own financial wellbeing but result in great hardship to others who have entered into business arrangements with them in good faith. While it is true that the bankruptcy system must guard against abuse, care in addressing the abuses must not result in preventing access to bankruptcy by those with a genuine need to do so. We should always understand that bankruptcy laws were designed right from the very beginning as a safety net for those experiencing unfortunate circumstances in life.
Most bankrupts today—as always, probably—are low-income earners who owe relatively small amounts of money. Those who genuinely require recourse to bankruptcy should not face unnecessary or artificial barriers or be subject to unduly punitive measures. These are matters, obviously, which will be discussed further, given the amendments before us. 
I note that this bill proposes to address bankruptcy law but, regrettably, it certainly does not address sufficiently the root causes of bankruptcy. Terry Gallagher, the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy, has commented:
While it is no easier to go bankrupt now than it has been for many years it is likely that excessive borrowing prompted by ready credit availability, perceptions of attainable living standards and a lessening of the stigma of bankruptcy have contributed to this increase.
Another cause of bankruptcy and financial difficulty is gambling. I will read some correspondence regarding this legislation that I have received from the Interchurch Gambling Task Force. It reads:
The Inter Church Gambling Task Force has for a number of years been concerned about the impact of bankruptcy provisions on the seeking of assistance by people who have developed a problem with gambling. This has become particularly evident since the mass availability of gaming machines in Victoria since 1992. Numbers of people presenting to services for assistance have gambling problems and should be encouraged to consider bankruptcy as a means of financial stabilization. This stabilization is often necessary before the gambler can consider other personal and family support services to deal with other long-standing difficulties, which may have contributed to the gambling behaviour.
The current provisions of the act serve to discourage people from seeking assistance and certainly from disclosing their gambling difficulties if they are considering bankruptcy. Section 271 of the act, as we understand it, provides that a person commits an offence if, in the two years prior to the presentation in which the person's bankruptcy occurred, they gambled or speculated rashly or hazardously, other than in connection with a trade or business.
While few people are recorded as reporting gambling as contributing to their financial distress, the reports from services with which the Interchurch Gambling Task Force is associated indicate that gambling is a factor in many bankruptcies of individuals where there are relatively small amounts owing. The act as it currently stands appears to be doubly punitive to people with gambling addictions who have got themselves into financial trouble. It fails to give recognition to the vast changes in public policy, which have not only legalised mass gambling and ensured mass exposure but also legitimised it in the minds of some of the public as a means of getting money when times are desperate.
In the absence of mandated adequate information on gaming machines about the chances of winning and the losses accumulating, it almost seems entrapment—
although that is obviously not its intention—
on the part of the government to keep in place provisions which preclude gamblers from seeking relief through bankruptcy under the legislation. The Interchurch Gambling Task Force believes that, even though section 271 is little used for prosecution, the act should be amended to remove reference to gambling, thus allowing transparency for individuals with problems and for the services which support them.
The Democrats are concerned about the existence of section 271 of the act, which provides for a maximum one-year prison term for people who become bankrupt partly as a result of gambling. The provision dates back at least to the early 20th century and reflects attitudes towards gambling that are not consistent with contemporary views. Bankruptcy is not a crime. It is a legitimate option for some people and an important way of allowing people in dire financial difficulty to make a fresh start. In the process of going bankrupt, unfortunately some people commit crimes. They will steal or commit fraud in attempts to pay their debts. They are quite properly subject to punishment for those crimes, but not for the fact that they have gambled or have gone bankrupt; it is the fraud or the stealing which is the crime. Inconsistently, gamblers can be punished, possibly with a jail term, simply for going bankrupt. It is inconsistent to punish bankrupts who have gambling addictions but not to punish people with other addictions, such as alcohol or drugs, or, for that matter, anyone else who goes bankrupt. 
My office has been contacted—as, no doubt, other senators have—by a number of groups who counsel gamblers. The view that has been strongly presented to us is that this punitive approach to gambling does not assist the process of helping gamblers to deal with their problems. For many gamblers, petitioning for bankruptcy provides the opportunity to stabilise and make a fresh start as part of the recovery process. If gamblers cannot take advantage of the bankruptcy system for fear of imprisonment, their progress can be significantly hampered. Frankly, if you want to help gamblers who have got themselves into difficulty in large numbers, you need to savagely reduce the gambling opportunities available, particularly in the pokies halls. Those of us in the chamber today who are from Western Australia know that the Western Australian restriction on pokies has had very positive social benefits. 
The Democrats will be moving an amendment to remove section 271 from the act so that gamblers are no longer liable to imprisonment for bankruptcy. We will also be moving an amendment to make related companies liable for the debts of an insolvent company in certain circumstances. That amendment is in accordance with the 1988 Harmer report of the Law Reform Commission into insolvency. We have moved that amendment on four occasions in the past. I recall three occasions, at least, when Labor supported it—maybe all four, but certainly three of them. We are looking, frankly, to avoid a repeat of occasions such as the Ansett-Air New Zealand situation, where one company manages another company and can simply walk away from employees and creditors.
In relation to these last amendments, I acknowledge to the government that these bills are a slightly unusual vehicle for the moving of these amendments. The situation I face is that the government has made a commitment to address the matters that form the substance of the amendments but has failed to do so. In my view, this is my only opportunity to put these essential amendments to the chamber in legislative form. I remind the chamber that these are recommendations based on the 1988 report of the Law Reform Commission, so they have been around a long time.
The government made a commitment on this issue months ago. My view is that, if they can produce a border protection bill in 24 hours—with all the complexities that go with that—they can certainly address this issue within the much longer time frame that has been available to them. Let me make it clear that, if the amendment is passed, I will be happy to accept changes the government may make in the House of Representatives to those amendments that preserve its substance. It is important that the substance and the principle get through, not that the particular words that I have put are passed.
I will be moving a second reading amendment that is designed to ask that, as part of the way in which the act is administered, a substantial review be undertaken of the causes of bankruptcy and of the operation of the changes to the act. It would explore ways of providing a solution at the point of causation to eliminate the need for later actions which result when people go bankrupt.
I know that the government will argue that there is already in place a review system— and this is correct. It is a useful review system, except that the existing review seems to us to be basically a desktop process undertaken annually by the inspector-general. While this covers some of the essential areas that need to be covered, it does not include a comprehensive, stakeholder-engaging review component. This results in the present review not actually cutting down into the core problem areas that are the causation of bankruptcy and not providing tangible solutions at the root beginnings of bankruptcy. 
Most importantly, the review for which we are seeking support from the government and the opposition is designed to look far more deeply into the foundation causes of bankruptcy and methods for addressing this increasing problem. Being a second reading amendment, the government will be able to react to it and address it in a manner which achieves the outcome we want but with some freedom as to its design. We are seeking from the government a genuine commitment to investigate the causes of bankruptcy and a commitment to have a cross-representative group when that review is under way.
Bankruptcy amongst non-business people is becoming a significant problem. Wearing one of my other hats, which include the hard-headed ones of finance, I say that we are all aware that credit availability has soared and that the amount of household debt has increased. In an economic sense, the Reserve Bank has not exhibited any real alarm at this stage. But the fact remains that there are signs that some Australians in some circumstances are experiencing great financial difficulties because they have gone over the top with regard to credit availability. 
Credit availability has increased exponentially. As we know, you can use the equity of your home to take out a mortgage and expand it. That mortgage can even be used for current and discretionary expenditure, which can lead people to take risks with moneys which otherwise should be locked up in their homes. It is worth noting that credit availability is now the third-highest reason given for bankruptcy, behind unemployment and domestic discord. We simply must start focusing on preventing things from getting to the stage of people using the option of bankruptcy to get their affairs in order.
Having said all that, it is obvious that we welcome the government's bill. We are pleased that they have brought it forward and are addressing the issues at hand. The numbers of amendments assist the bill, in my view; they do not gut it or alter its intent significantly. I will conclude by moving my second reading amendment, which has been circulated on sheet 2677. I move:
At the end of the motion, add “but the Senate, noting in particular the growth in non-business bankruptcies since the late 1980s, urges the Government to undertake reviews every 5 years of the fundamental causes of business and non-business bankruptcy in Australia and to report to the Senate on the outcome of these reviews, together with suggestions for such legislative reform as may be necessary to address these causes of bankruptcy”.
I would envisage, Minister, that if that amendment were to be passed and if the government were to act on it you would obviously see means by which you could combine the existing reporting process with this proposed process so that it would be in one document. That would be the easiest way to do it.",SENATE,<title>BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,39,1,speech
"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2002-11-14,"—I rise to speak on the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill 2002. As Senator Ludwig said earlier, the opposition do not oppose this bill but we will be seeking to move amendments during the committee stage to address the provisions which we believe impact harshly on low-income bankrupts. In doing so, Labor wish to emphasise that, despite the government's claim that the bill is tough on bankrupts, the reforms will in fact impact harshly on low-income bankrupts whilst not adequately addressing bankruptcy rorts at the big end of town.
Both the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill and the Bankruptcy (Estate Charges) Amendment Bill 2002 were introduced into the House of Representatives on 21 March this year. Previous bills substantially similar to these bills were introduced during the last parliament but lapsed when the November 2001 election was called. It has been said in the chamber this afternoon that in recent times we have seen some very high-profile bankrupts—for example, barristers who have not met their tax liabilities for a number of years and have then sought to avoid those obligations through bankruptcy. Labor has argued that the law must be changed so as to prevent high-income earners from using the bankruptcy law to their advantage. It is for this reason that Labor supported the thrust of the proposed amendments in the House of Representatives but expressed its concern about the impact of the changes on low-income bankrupts. In the other place, Labor shadow Attorney-General, Mr McClelland, argued that the bill should have gone further to prevent abuses of bankruptcy law by the top end of town, particularly with respect to part X arrangements. Labor argued there, and will also argue in this place, that this should have been the focus of the government's legislative response to bankruptcy rorts rather than aiming the reform at those at the lower end of the economic spectrum—those who are more likely to become bankrupt as a result of consumer debts.
The last major overhaul of bankruptcy was in 1996, shortly after the coalition was elected. In 1996 the government then introduced legislation that was substantially based on Labor's 1995 bill and incorporated amendments by the Senate recommended by the then Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee in September 1995. The bill before us today introduces a number of measures. Firstly, it gives the Official Receiver a discretion to reject a debtor's petition where it appears that within a reasonable time the debtor could pay all the debts listed in the debtor's statement of affairs and that the debtor's petition is an abuse of the bankruptcy system. Secondly, the bill abolishes early discharge from bankruptcy. Thirdly, it will make it easier for trustees to lodge objections to a person's discharge from bankruptcy and it will make it harder for bankrupts to sustain challenges to objections. Fourthly, it makes it clear that a bankruptcy can be annulled by the court whether or not the bankrupt was insolvent when a debtor's petition for bankruptcy was accepted. Fifthly and finally, it doubles the current income thresholds for debt agreements so as to allow and encourage many more debtors to choose this particular alternative to bankruptcy. Other changes proposed by the bill have the effect of streamlining the operation of the act or are as a consequence of the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia having become an executive agency. Those changes are of a technical nature. Labor supported them in the other place and will also support them in the Senate. The 2002 bill drops a measure that was previously included in the 2001 bill which would have introduced, in relation to most debtors, a mandatory 30-day cooling-off period under which the debtor may have withdrawn the petition within 30 days of the Official Receiver accepting it. Labor was pleased to see that provision removed from the bill. 
While Labor supports the need for bankruptcy reform, there are a number of aspects of this bill which are less than satisfactory. A number of these aspects were referred to by Mr McClelland in the other place and also by Senator Ludwig in this chamber this afternoon. Firstly, it has been said that the consultation process surrounding the bill was not as broad as it should have been. This concern was expressed during the Senate committee hearings on these bills. In particular, the government paid little attention to financial counsellors who give advice to the low-income earners who are affected by debts which may lead to bankruptcy. The Senate committee heard that the bill will disadvantage many of the poor in society and their families while debt collectors stand to gain.
The first of Labor's concerns regarding the specific provisions of the bill is in relation to early discharge. The bill proposes to abolish the provisions currently contained in the act which allow early discharge for low-income bankrupts. Labor has concerns that those who will be most affected by this measure will be those who are most vulnerable in our society. As has been said, the government has not made a convincing case at all for the abolition of early discharge. Administrative early discharge provisions were introduced 10 years ago, in 1992, in response to concerns that low-income earners did not have any real capacity to avail themselves of the existing early discharge provisions that then required an application to the Federal Court. At that time only a very small proportion of bankrupts availed themselves of the early discharge provisions, because of the costs involved in making an application to the Federal Court. In almost all cases where early discharge was sought, the order was in fact granted.
Under the current early discharge provisions, a bankrupt may apply for early discharge after six months from the time when he or she files a statement of affairs with the registrar. There are restrictions on the eligibility criteria for this early discharge. Firstly, there has to be a determination that the bankrupt has no or insufficient divisible property to enable a dividend to be paid to creditors. Secondly, the bankrupt must not have disposed of property in a transaction that is void against the trustee. Thirdly, the bankrupt must earn an income that is less than the actual income threshold amount applicable to him or her at the time the application for early discharge is made; that is, they are not at a level where income would actually be distributed during the course of the bankruptcy to creditors.
There are also several disqualifying criteria. These include, firstly, where the bankrupt has previously been a bankrupt; secondly, where the unsecured liabilities of the bankrupt exceed 150 per cent of his or her income in the year prior to the date of the bankruptcy; thirdly, where more than 50 per cent of the bankrupt's unsecured liabilities are attributable to the conduct by the bankrupt of business activities; and, fourthly, where the bankrupt has given false or misleading information about his or her assets, liabilities or income. These are quite strict and, importantly, apply only in respect of the first bankruptcy. Early discharge is not available in respect of second and subsequent bankruptcies. As I and a number of other members have said, there is no evidence that these provisions are being abused. 
Public hearings held by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee into the bills were characterised by a complete lack of evidence as to the need for the abolition of the early discharge provisions. Labor is concerned that the government, in introducing these measures, is singling out those who become bankrupt as a result of troubled times, rather than addressing the underlying causes of their difficulties. The key feature of the early discharge provisions is to deal with the increasing number of consumer bankruptcies which are due more to misfortune than misdeeds. As Labor members, including me, have said in this chamber recently, the blow-out in credit card debt, in addition to the burden imposed by the high mortgages resulting from the dramatic increase in property values in Australia, is imposing tremendous burdens on Australian families. We say that the error of the government's approach is that the government, instead of recognising that its policies—in particular the GST— have imposed greater financial hardship on individuals and small businesses, is introducing laws that target the people who are suffering as a consequence of its policies. The Attorney-General almost said as much when he said, in introducing the bill, that the provisions were targeted at a new category of bankrupt—consumer debtors with low asset backing who have overextended and then cannot repay their debts. Labor says that this is a harsh way to treat one of the most vulnerable groups in our society. The government, rather than trying to change the law to make life harder for these people, should be directing its attention to changing the policies that it has introduced, those policies that have imposed financial burdens particularly on families who have very low levels of income.
Labor does not support the abolition of early discharge provisions and will not be supporting them in this place. We believe that an appropriate balance could be achieved to try to prevent people from too easily going into bankruptcy in the first place and also to permit them to try and get their lives in order. In order to achieve this balance, we are seeking to move an amendment which will allow an application for early discharge to be made after a two-year period. As Senator Ludwig said earlier today, the effect of this proposal will be to create a greater incentive for potential bankrupts to enter into alternative arrangements, such as debt agreements. Labor believes that this balance that I have described reflects a more appropriate balance between the two competing policies.
The second area of concern that Labor has is the incurring of debts within two years prior to bankruptcy. This is set out in section 265(8) of the act. The effect of this section is that it provides that if a person contracts a debt of an amount of $500 or more without having, at the time of contracting it, `reasonable or probable ground or expectation' of being able to pay the debt then such a person is guilty of an offence which is punishable by imprisonment for a period not exceeding one year. Labor's view is that to remove this $500 threshold is particularly harsh. The government's argument is that the section enables rorting. The government says that the effect of the section is that people could go on a serial spending spree purchasing a number of small items but, nonetheless, running up a total of more than $500 and therefore equally offending the principles contained in the section of the act.
The government's other argument is that it brings it into line with the Corporations Law. But it is quite clear to most of us, particularly to those on this side, that bankruptcy law applies to individuals, not corporations. Furthermore, individuals are not corporations. Individuals, particularly those who are supporting families and children, need to incur debts—everyday household expenditures such as rent, electricity, gas, telephone bills and the like—in order to survive. We say that it is harsh in the extreme to suggest a change to the law which could see a parent jailed for incurring a necessary expense for, say, their children's schooling or other needs. We say that this is a particularly harsh and inflexible approach. Labor has proposed that there be a proviso included in the section whereby a person cannot be prosecuted for incurring a debt in excess of a reasonable or necessary personal or household expense without any reasonable ground of expectation of them being able to pay that debt. 
The third area of concern to Labor is in respect of the offence of contributing to insolvency by gambling in the two-year period prior to bankruptcy. Labor is well aware of the financial devastation that gambling can cause to individuals and families. Effectively, though, section 271 of the act retrospectively criminalises gambling. The difficulty with this section, however, is that problem gamblers are not aware, and could not be expected to know, that their habit is going to be such that it could well lead them to financial devastation. Indeed, it may well be a disincentive to problem gamblers obtaining advice before declaring bankruptcy in the fear that they could actually face these penalties. Again, imprisonment could be a penalty arising from a prosecution under this section. The effect of this could well be to increase the personal problems of problem gamblers and could lead to devastating consequences, even suicide. There is no doubt that problem gambling needs to be addressed but periods of imprisonment are not the answer to the serious social problem that gambling brings about.
The final provisions that I wish to refer to are those that go to the operation of part X of the act. These provisions apply to those who have or have had substantial assets. Labor's concern is that the proposals put forward by the government do not address the loopholes in part X of the act. Part X provides for three alternatives to bankruptcy: entering into a deed of assignment, entering into a deed of arrangement or entering into a composition with creditors. Labor recognises that these provisions are important because, if they are properly used, they often result in debtors receiving more than they would have received if the person simply became the bankrupt. But ITSA itself has recognised that these provisions are generally used by higher income earners and people in business who are able to offer their assets or payment from income to creditors. Part X generally has been seen as quite a useful mechanism for bringing debtors and creditors together to work out arrangements that may well result in a better outcome for all parties concerned. Nevertheless, over the years it has become clear that the procedure is open to abuse and some legislative amendments have been proposed. 
Back in 1987 there was a Law Reform Commission report on these perceived defects of part X. This Law Reform Commission report included four principal points. The first point was the need to prevent the use of these provisions where debtors have given misleading or inadequate information to creditors regarding their financial circumstances. The second point dealt with controlling trustees convening meetings in obscure places and not giving sufficient notice of meetings. The third point related to debtors stacking meetings with persons who purport to exercise voting rights in favour of the debtor. Finally, there were concerns about conducting meetings without an impartial chair—coming back to someone who may have been, for example, a professional adviser to the debtor.
All of these measures are measures that Labor believes need to be addressed. Labor has devised amendments that will address these concerns. It hopes that the government will see that they are constructive changes. As Senator Ludwig pointed out, finally the Attorney-General has recently responded and said that there will be a review of part X. Labor welcomes this review but urges that it must provide positive outcomes that remove the loopholes to which I have referred. I urge senators to support Labor's amendments in the committee stage, which we believe will seek to restore, as Senator Ludwig said, balance, equity and finally compassion to this bill.",SENATE,<title>BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,39,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2002-11-14,"—I thank honourable senators for their contribution in this debate. I just flag at the outset that we, as a government, I think will be opposing all of the amendments and propositions put to us but we will not be seeking to divide on them. That should not be understood as meaning that we are not serious about pursuing the bill as drafted by us and that we do not accept that amendments have been put forward.  
As I said before, I thank honourable senators for their contributions and I will seek to deal with them in order. The first contribution was made by Senator Ludwig. I simply indicate to him that I think Brian Burke has had sufficient allegations made against him without having had such a heinous allegation as you have just made in this chamber visited upon him as well.
—You know very well who I was referring to.
—Yes, I thought you might have been referring to another Mr Burke. Senator Ludwig made a number of points in relation to section 271, the gambling provision—and I note Senator Murray has moved a similar amendment. That has in fact been in the act since 1966, on my advice, so it has been around for 36 years. Labor have had 15 years in office during which time they could have dealt with it, but they were not interested in dealing with it. I will go through some of the issues that the Senate ought to take into account in relation to this.
—Times change!
—Times do change and what has unfortunately changed, Senator Murray, is the fact that we have a bevy of state Labor governments around on a feeding frenzy on gambling. I would not be surprised if some of them have said, `Wouldn't it be a good thing to remove this provision from the Bankruptcy Act because it might act as a disincentive for people to gamble.' I believe it just shows again that Labor is unfortunately soft on this issue.
In reality—and that is what we need to deal with here—600 bankrupts last year stated that gambling was the cause of their bankruptcy. Yet the actual number of prosecutions under this provision was small. It is a very tall high bar for the prosecution to be able to get over to prove both `rash and hazardous'. The statistics are: 2001-02, one person charged and a conviction recorded; 2000-01, one person; 1999-2000, one person; 1998-99, none; 1997-98, one; and 1996-97, three. So we are dealing with a very small number of people.
—Or a lazy government.
—A lazy government? In other words, we ought to be prosecuting more; is that what you are saying, Senator Ludwig? I thought you wanted to remove the section from the bill. Then when I point out how very few get prosecuted we are told that we are being lazy. That amazes me. The important thing about this section in the bill is that it acts as a great disincentive because some people who seek to play the bankruptcy law say, `I lost a lot of money in recent times through gambling,' and, once the provision is read to them and the possibility of a conviction for `rash and hazardous' gambling is pointed out to them, all of a sudden the truth is told, money is found in other places, and creditors benefit. The fact that the Labor Party—and, even more surprisingly, the Democrats—would seek to have this provision removed, which has been an effective tool—
—On anecdotal evidence.
—Believe it or not, Senator Ludwig, I do not stand here and just make up these things. In fact I have the benefit of being given advice from ITSA. I indicate to you that, in one recent case investigated by ITSA and recommended for prosecution, there was no evidence whatsoever of gambling prior to the person becoming aware that a bankruptcy notice was about to be issued. This person then went on a gambling spree which left no money for creditors. According to Senator Ludwig and the Democrat amendment, that is good public policy. We as a government say no to that.
Senator Ludwig talked about the review of part X. I simply suggest that there is a review currently underway which will identify any needed changes through a process of extensive and rigorous consultation. Might I respectfully suggest that that is better than a knee-jerk, ill-considered and rather hasty change of the kind moved by the opposition. If I am correct, those consultations have been taking place as we speak. They have been in Perth and Adelaide, and in my home state of Tasmania today. As we speak, these consultations are actually taking place. I submit to the Senate that it would be better for the Senate to have the benefits of that review before we decide on making any hasty change to the legislation. 
Senator Ludwig also referred to early discharge and suggested that this be extended from the current six months to two years. One of the present disqualifying factors from applying for early discharge is that the bankrupt's unsecured debts exceed 150 per cent of the income derived by the bankrupt during the year immediately before bankruptcy. That is section 149Y. This provision can discriminate against some bankrupts.
—You are quite right when you consider a situation where a husband and a wife have gone bankrupt with joint debts and the husband earns an income while the wife is engaged in home duties or child rearing duties and has no income. He would be allowed to be discharged but of course the wife would not. Section 149Y will frequently disqualify the wife while the husband may still apply. The opposition amendments do nothing to address that situation. Senator Ludwig also suggested that financial counsellors had not been consulted properly. The financial counsellors' peak body is represented on the bankruptcy consultative forum, and the forum was consulted extensively in relation to the bill. Senator Ludwig also referred to certain high-rolling barristers who have disgraced their profession and should have been—
—I am not sure if there are any in Tasmania, Senator Ludwig. I would hope not. I am not aware of any, but that does not meant that they do not exist. We know they exist, but whether they exist in Tasmania, I do not know. The fact is that they do exist in Australia and it is important for the government to deal with these high-income professionals in an appropriate way. A joint task force was established to investigate abuses of the bankruptcy and family law schemes to avoid payment of income tax. The government is well on the way in relation to that. 
Senator Murray suggested it is wrong to have a punitive approach to gambling and that the offence of 271 should be repealed— which is the same point that Senator Ludwig made. I indicate that not all gamblers are in fact addicts. In one case prosecuted by the DPP, there was no evidence of gambling by the debtor, as I indicated earlier, until he was actually served with a bankruptcy notice. It is rarely prosecuted and the elements of the offence are such that only the most serious cases are prosecuted, and of course the Director of Public Prosecutions has a discretion as to whether to pursue it. The existence of the offence acts as a deterrent to dissuade bankrupts from concealing assets while saying that all their property has been frittered away on gambling. 
Senator Kirk made some points in relation to early discharge, and I think we can deal with that further in the committee stage. Senator Kirk also said that the income threshold for debt agreement would be doubled—that is, increased by 100 per cent.
—Fifty per cent.
—Exactly, Senator Ludwig; it is 50 per cent. What she indicated to us was not correct. The previous bill did propose that, but it is somewhat coincidental that she just happened to make the same mistake as the shadow Attorney-General made whilst debating this bill in the lower house recently. Might I suggest to Senator Kirk—I think she used to lecture in law, didn't she?—that there is such a thing as `reading other people's assignments and then just regurgitating it'. I suggest to her that she ought should to do her own research and not rely on the shadow Attorney-General for her advice. Might I add, however, she would be better advised to listen to Senator Ludwig because he did get it right. Out of the three of them who contributed, I confess Senator Ludwig did get it right, and I congratulate him on that.
Senator Kirk also referred to household goods. The opposition's proposed amendment would exclude `necessary household or personal expenses'. I suppose I am a fairly frugal sort of person, and the Labor Party's necessities may well be my luxuries. So how we or the courts would define `necessary household or personal expenses' would be a great one for the courts and lawyers to have fun with, and chances are some of these bankrupt barristers—if they were allowed to practise again, which I doubt—might be able to get some income again trying to argue about these provisions and what is actually necessary for them as opposed to a luxury for them. That is something that I will undoubtedly hear more about from the Labor Party during the committee stage. I thank honourable senators for their contributions.

That the Senate take note of the document.
I rise to put some comments on the public record about this response from the government. This government is in absolute denial about the state of the higher education system in this country. I was a member of the Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education References Committee that spent many months travelling around this country, taking quite a number of submissions, hearing witnesses and making the effort to go to each state and territory and to as many universities as possible during 2001. I clearly remember the President of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, in about July last year, after we had heard from many lecturers, dozens of students and many university vice-chancellors, admitting to us on the record that the system was in crisis. That is why the committee came up with the title of its report: Universities in crisis. It is a report on the capacity of public universities to meet Australia's needs in respect of tertiary and higher education.
That was not a title that we orchestrated. It was not a title which was determined other than by an admission by this country's leading vice-chancellor at the time, who headed up the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, the peak body to which the vice-chancellors of each and every one of our 38 universities belong. He actually admitted to us on the public record that universities were in crisis. Now we have a government that is in absolute denial—it believes that that is not the case. It has the blinkers on and it wants to pretend that the policies that it has instigated since 1996 have been good for this country and have tried in some way to assist the higher education sector in this country. This government has ripped out over $860 million from this sector in only six years.
During the inquiry we heard evidence about the stress being suffered by university staff as they try to cope with more hours of lecturing, increased numbers of students and dwindling resources. We heard about university libraries struggling to maintain their efforts to provide higher education students with the resources they need. University libraries have had to stop subscriptions to magazines, not renew resources and not buy new library books. We heard about universities that were unable to replace outdated information technology equipment or to replace simple things such as computers, let alone buy the state-of-the-art equipment that our engineering or science students need not only to get up to speed with what is happening in the rest of the world but also to become leaders in their area of research or study. 
We heard from university students who told us time and again that they would enrol in university courses at the start of the year and turn up to the first classes only to find that they were cancelled. Why was that? It was because the university did not have enough operational funding or capacity to meet the demand of students around this country. We also heard from engineering academics, scientists and humanities staff around this country that they have had to cut courses and close departments because there was simply not enough money being put into those sectors by the universities. 
The Northern Territory University has had three major restructurings since 1996. The first restructuring saw the demise of the English department. The second restructuring saw a range of faculties having to be amalgamated and some fine arts departments diminished. The most recent restructuring saw the announcement that 42 general staff would be made redundant. Why is that? It is because the sector has not had enough money put into it since 1996. It has been severely neglected by this government, to the point where it has withdrawn operational funding and made universities embark on private enterprise paths to cope with that shortfall.
One of the significant findings of our inquiry was that universities are relying heavily on the private sector to compensate for the lack of funds. We have a private institution attached to the University of Melbourne. We have a number of universities such as Adelaide University that need to encourage the donation of funds from big businesses such as Santos. While that may be a welcome development in higher education, it is becoming a replacement for the public funding that ought to be going into universities. It is not additional to it or a top up, it is replacing, and significantly replacing as the years go by, the amount of public funding that should be put into the higher education sector by this government. Students around the country were able to prove to us that they now need to undertake part-time work and, increasingly, complement it with their study. The changes to the youth allowance, combined with an anticipated HECS debt, were a very large financial burden for students. To compensate they needed to undertake significant part-time work just to survive while studying.
What have we seen this year? This year we have seen a government which is now responding to that report and of course denying that the university sector is in crisis and denying that any of these problems exist at all. This year we have seen a minister who has embarked on a review of the higher education sector and has released seven documents. Each of those seven documents or discussion papers—they are not so much policy positions, although they will become policy positions—go to the very areas that I have just talked about. They go to the funding of universities. They go to the role of students and the payments that they will need to make in order to obtain a higher education in this country. They go to Indigenous students participating in this country, and there are a range of other areas.
This is a minister who is going to pretend that he is embarking upon a national consultation process in relation to these papers. He has invited submissions—although I notice that there have been no public hearings in the Northern Territory, and I suppose that is the case for most regional and rural, let alone remote, places in this country—but, at the end of the day, all I would suspect that we are going to see is a repeat of the leaked cabinet document in 1999. This minister is a little bit clever though. He is going to embark upon what he sees as a consultation process, but there is no doubt that, at the end of the day, his policy that emanates will be no different; in fact, it may even reflect those positions that were put in the leaked 1999 cabinet document—that is, that students should pay more for their higher education in this country and that there should be less public funding. This is a minister that believes that universities are not in crisis. This minister is blinded by the fact that this is a sector that is struggling to survive because of the lack of funds and the lack of good policy that this government fails to provide for it.

During the inquiry we heard evidence about the stress being suffered by university staff as they try to cope with more hours of lecturing, increased numbers of students and dwindling resources. We heard about university libraries struggling to maintain their efforts to provide higher education students with the resources they need. University libraries have had to stop subscriptions to magazines, not renew resources and not buy new library books. We heard about universities that were unable to replace outdated information technology equipment or to replace simple things such as computers, let alone buy the state-of-the-art equipment that our engineering or science students need not only to get up to speed with what is happening in the rest of the world but also to become leaders in their area of research or study. 
We heard from university students who told us time and again that they would enrol in university courses at the start of the year and turn up to the first classes only to find that they were cancelled. Why was that? It was because the university did not have enough operational funding or capacity to meet the demand of students around this country. We also heard from engineering academics, scientists and humanities staff around this country that they have had to cut courses and close departments because there was simply not enough money being put into those sectors by the universities. 
The Northern Territory University has had three major restructurings since 1996. The first restructuring saw the demise of the English department. The second restructuring saw a range of faculties having to be amalgamated and some fine arts departments diminished. The most recent restructuring saw the announcement that 42 general staff would be made redundant. Why is that? It is because the sector has not had enough money put into it since 1996. It has been severely neglected by this government, to the point where it has withdrawn operational funding and made universities embark on private enterprise paths to cope with that shortfall.
One of the significant findings of our inquiry was that universities are relying heavily on the private sector to compensate for the lack of funds. We have a private institution attached to the University of Melbourne. We have a number of universities such as Adelaide University that need to encourage the donation of funds from big businesses such as Santos. While that may be a welcome development in higher education, it is becoming a replacement for the public funding that ought to be going into universities. It is not additional to it or a top up, it is replacing, and significantly replacing as the years go by, the amount of public funding that should be put into the higher education sector by this government. Students around the country were able to prove to us that they now need to undertake part-time work and, increasingly, complement it with their study. The changes to the youth allowance, combined with an anticipated HECS debt, were a very large financial burden for students. To compensate they needed to undertake significant part-time work just to survive while studying.
What have we seen this year? This year we have seen a government which is now responding to that report and of course denying that the university sector is in crisis and denying that any of these problems exist at all. This year we have seen a minister who has embarked on a review of the higher education sector and has released seven documents. Each of those seven documents or discussion papers—they are not so much policy positions, although they will become policy positions—go to the very areas that I have just talked about. They go to the funding of universities. They go to the role of students and the payments that they will need to make in order to obtain a higher education in this country. They go to Indigenous students participating in this country, and there are a range of other areas.
This is a minister who is going to pretend that he is embarking upon a national consultation process in relation to these papers. He has invited submissions—although I notice that there have been no public hearings in the Northern Territory, and I suppose that is the case for most regional and rural, let alone remote, places in this country—but, at the end of the day, all I would suspect that we are going to see is a repeat of the leaked cabinet document in 1999. This minister is a little bit clever though. He is going to embark upon what he sees as a consultation process, but there is no doubt that, at the end of the day, his policy that emanates will be no different; in fact, it may even reflect those positions that were put in the leaked 1999 cabinet document—that is, that students should pay more for their higher education in this country and that there should be less public funding. This is a minister that believes that universities are not in crisis. This minister is blinded by the fact that this is a sector that is struggling to survive because of the lack of funds and the lack of good policy that this government fails to provide for it.

"Buckland, Sen Geoffrey",ALP,2002-11-14,"—Tonight I rise to speak on what is becoming a very important issue for many Australians living in rural and regional Australia. It may come as no surprise that this concern is about the further sale of Telstra. This week we have heard a lot of news about the government's impending sale of the remainder of Telstra, and tonight I would like to bring all that has been said this week into perspective and clarify what this really means for Australians living in rural and regional Australia. The government have said that they would not sell Telstra until, firstly, regional communications are up to scratch; secondly, they can get the legislation through the Senate; and, thirdly, they can get the right price for Telstra. Earlier this week it was revealed that the government have always intended to sell the remainder of Telstra. That has been the government's position since the last election and they have overtly misled the electorate.
On Tuesday, the Treasurer let it slip that the government had wanted to sell all of Telstra three years ago. I just wonder if that was a slip or whether that was a deliberate statement by him to say, `We always wanted to do it.' This did not eventuate, because Labor stopped it. The Labor Party from day one has unreservedly been against any further sale of Telstra. We also learned from Treasurer Peter Costello that the proceeds from the impending sale of Telstra have been included in the budget and they have been there for some time. An amount of $654 million has been designated to go to merchant bankers in Melbourne and Sydney or overseas to assist with the sale. However, the most outstanding revelation was that the Telstra sale would proceed regardless of service levels—their key promise. On Wednesday, the coalition's attempt to deceive voters in rural and regional Australia came to an end when National Party leader, John Anderson, admitted that rural and regional Australia would not get anything from the sale of Telstra. Mr Anderson has now agreed with the Prime Minister and the Treasurer that the entire proceeds from any further sale of Telstra will go to reduce government debt.
To add insult to injury, the government is also pushing through unfair Telstra price rises. Australians everywhere now will be paying more for phone line rentals, with no guaranteed reduction in local call costs. The government's massive line rental increases, which are now locked in until 2005, were supported by the Democrats yesterday. That was the last bastion of keeping the bastards honest. They stumbled and they fell. By the government's own calculations, Telstra's profits will increase by $170 million from this new package. The Democrats dual deal with the government has left not only rural and regional Australians but Australian consumers generally $170 million worse off. All this was done with the aim of increasing the share price of Telstra when it goes on sale. It is expected that the standard phone line rentals will hit a whopping $32 per month for the next few years. Without doubt, it will hit low-income earners the hardest, but of course this government has no concern for those who are on low incomes in our country.
A recent study by Macquarie Bank has found that Australian broadband prices are 30 per cent higher than those in the US and UK, and they are the comparable countries. The government's recent Estens report has been nothing but a whitewash—an attempt to give credit to this whole sordid, dirty affair. The Estens inquiry ignored the hundreds of submissions it received that complained of poor mobile phone coverage, phone network faults and poor Internet services in regional Australia. Those things exist and will not improve. It ignored all the critical facts and evidence. Coincidentally, the inquiry was run by National Party mates of John Anderson. It ran for only two months and held no public hearings, but that is typical of this government's consultation process: `Don't talk to the people who use the services; you might be told.' During question time on Tuesday, Peter Costello said: 
... it would take time before Telstra were in a position to have those additional shares offered to the market. As the Prime Minister said on the 7.30 Report, we would obviously take price into account so that it offers—if that should occur—at a time which maximises shareholder value.
He went on to say:
When T2 was floated off, it was $7.80, and the Labor Party opposed the offering of additional shares.
And then he said:
The financial effect of opposing that sale was, between T2 and T3, the loss of $30 billion on the share price.
...	...	...
The difference between the proceeds as they would have been at the time Labor stopped further sale at the time of T2 and today is $30 billion.
What does this really mean? Did the Labor Party lose $30 billion or did the Labor Party make a saving of $30 billion for the average Australian? I think that the latter was the case.
This accusation is the same as last year's example where Peter Costello gambled and lost $5 billion in currency swaps, causing Australia to go into greater deficit. This is not to mention that in the space of six months the government was able to create a $1.7 billion turnaround from surplus to deficit, and this was after 10 years of continuous strong economic growth. It can do it well when it comes to losing money. This is a government that has gone into deficit when it is not in recession.
So it is now expected that rural and regional Australia should pay the price for this economic mismanagement. How is this the case? It is the case by their being expected not only to pay top dollar for shares in the impending sale of Telstra but also to miss out on using the proceeds from this sale to bring services up to scratch in rural and regional Australia. These same people in rural and regional Australia will also be expected to pay an increased cost of phone line rentals, another $170 million out of their pockets, as well as cope with poor mobile phone coverage, numerous phone network faults and poor Internet services—not to mention the 30 per cent higher cost of broadband prices, compared to some of our international counterparts. Peter Costello has the audacity to say that Labor caused a $30 billion loss between the sale of T2 and T3. To the average Australian, this is really a saving and not a loss.
