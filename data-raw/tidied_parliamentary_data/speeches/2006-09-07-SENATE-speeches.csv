That the Senate take note of the report.
As people know, the references committees are winding up. The committee felt that it was very important that we put our thoughts on record and record where we are up to in our inquiry. This is an extremely important issue and it was largely prompted by the question of whether Australia should be concerned about peak oil. Peak oil, in this case, refers to the fundamental geological reasons global conventional oil production will reach a peak and then start an irreversible decline soon enough to be of concern. In their arguments, proponents of peak oil commonly predict a peak somewhere between now and 2030. They suggest that this could cause serious economic hardship if mitigating action is not started soon enough.
There was a great deal of interest in this inquiry. I think part of that was prompted by the most recent oil prices and subsequent flow-on to petrol prices. We received 192 submissions, which we felt was a large number of submissions. The submissions were very comprehensive and they came from a broad section of stakeholders, including the petroleum industry, peak oil groups, various academic experts, government agencies from around Australia, the renewable energy industry, non-conventional oil industry representatives and local government. We held nine hearings around Australia. If it was not already clear in people’s minds, it became obvious during those hearings that this is an extremely complex area. There was a very large range of issues that were covered during our hearings.
I would say that most of the submissions we received generally agreed that peak oil was an issue; I think where they disagreed was the timing of it. We heard from peak oil proponents, who gave a very detailed critique of official estimates of the world’s future oil supplies. I might add that everybody agreed that Australia’s oil supplies were declining. There was much more debate around how rapidly global oil supplies were declining. But the peak oil proponents actually dealt with these arguments in a lot of detail, as is articulated in the report, and the committee felt they had very plausible arguments. The committee, however, is not aware of any official agency publications which attempt to rebut the peak oil arguments point by point in similar detail. In other words, the committee received a lot of information critiquing the figures of the oil industry, in particular, on global oil supplies but there were not similar arguments from the reverse perspective.
In the committee’s view, the possibility of a peak of conventional oil production before 2030—even if it is no more than a possibility—should be a matter of concern. Exactly when it occurs—which, it points out, is very uncertain—is not the important point. The committee feels that Australia should be planning for it now, as Sweden has with its plan to be oil free by 2020. The committee also felt that it is clear that gas should be carefully looked at and that there was a need for longer term planning. As was aired in the media, there was a lot of criticism of ABARE’s predictions on oil prices and our reserves. Their predictions came in for a great deal of criticism in, I think, virtually every hearing that was held.
The range of issues that the committee considered was extensive. We were asked to look in particular at Australia’s oil vulnerability and we looked at issues at a national, international, state and local level. We looked at our cities’ vulnerability to oil depletion. We looked at agriculture, and agriculture is particularly vulnerable. We received a lot of submissions on that. We also looked at the impact on, in particular, people living on the outskirts or in our inner urban fringes. We looked at the economic and social impacts. We particularly noted the convergence between the issues of peak oil and climate change and felt that any solutions that we reach for peak oil also needed to be reached for climate change.
The committee looked at issues around oil demand and oil supply. Of course, propositions were put to us that Australia needs to increase its oil exploration activity. While the committee felt that it remains to be seen whether the government initiatives will have a significant effect on oil activity, they pointed out that, if significant reserves are found, extraction of the oil from these new sources, which are likely to be in deep water, would come at a much higher cost. So, in fact, they might not address the issue of oil prices, which we were asked to address. In fact, oil prices would continue to rise if new resources were found.
As to whether the appropriate level of resources was being allocated by government and corporations to explore for more oil, there was a question about whether those resources should in fact be redirected to look at other alternative sources of fuel. The committee have not yet reached a conclusion, but we did note that the costs and benefits of more exploration must be assessed against the costs and benefits of other options to reduce our oil dependence. The committee felt that they are significant issues that need to be addressed and that will continue, I hope, to be addressed in the final report.
The issue of biofuels came up and we heard a lot of evidence from people working on biofuels and looking at the various options, whether they be from waste or grain, for ethanol and biodiesel. Again, we heard a lot from the agricultural industry on these areas and we also heard about the promise of lignocellulose in providing a more sustainable long-term source for biofuels.
We heard that there does not seem at present to be an overall approach or national approach being taken to the issue of peak oil and oil depletion. The committee felt that that was an area that needed to be looked at. We also looked at the areas of energy efficiency, conservation and public transport. Again, those were areas that we heard a lot about. We made a number of comments further on in the report about where we need to be looking in the future with respect to the committee process. A lot of concern was expressed to us about the lack of public transport services in many of our cities. I add a bit of home-grown parochialism here—that is, many of the submissions to the committee praised Western Australia, Perth in particular, for its foresight in providing the excellent train system that we have in Perth. I think it is fair to say that we heard people around Australia commenting on that, but people expressed concern that in other cities the public transport system at this stage would not be up to meeting increased demand for services if people made a sudden switch from private vehicles to public transport.
Another issue that came up very strongly was, as I said, how peak oil intersects with climate change and also how the cost of carbon in the future needs to be taken into consideration. The committee have not reached a conclusion on that. We made some comments on that, but it is certainly an area which has been flagged for future work and which needs to be taken into consideration in future options.
Those are some of the issues that the committee highlighted. I am sure my colleagues on the committee will raise other issues. I believe it was an extremely important area of inquiry, and I look forward to seeing the final committee report.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,19,1
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2006-09-07,"—It is a very important inquiry that the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee has been conducting. It is an inquiry that has attracted quite a deal of attention and has canvassed a range of issues to do with the propulsion of the Australian public in the future in various vehicular modes and what will happen with the fuelling systems that are needed to continue that. It is regrettable that the government’s concertinaing of the Senate system has forced the committee, which has been looking at this report, to provide an interim report before the inquiry had time to fully consider all the ramifications of the submissions before it. That is because the government has a majority in this place and has decided that it wants to take complete and utter control not only of the Senate but also of the committee system, and that it could not tolerate the fact that there were committees of this Senate that were chaired by persons other than members of the coalition.
We have seen an important inquiry effectively concertinaed, and we have seen the committee forced to present an interim report. What does that mean? It means that there may or may not be a full consideration of this matter, and there may or may not be a continuation of the deliberations of the committee—depending upon the structuring of committees that results from the considerations currently taking place. The committee structure may or may not be torn up and a new one put in its place and different issues placed with different committees. I understand there is some talk of the transport section of this committee being moved to another committee, which I must say concerns me.
This report in its draft form reached members of the committee earlier this week, and for that reason it has been given as much attention as possible in that very limited time. In a general sense, it has the support of the opposition. But we are not in a position to rewrite sections of the report as we might have wished them to be. I direct no criticism at the secretariat or the chair of the committee for the situation that we find ourselves in. As I say, this is an action forced upon this committee by the actions of the government, acting in their own interests and not in the interests of the Senate or in the interests of this committee.
I will quibble with one of the passages in the report, the last passage in the report talking about the future for hydrogen as a replacement fuel for oil. The committee report suggests that that fuel might be considered in the distant future but is not a useful option to consider in Australia’s ‘current or medium-term transport fuels mix’. I am not sure what ‘medium-term’ means in that context. We had evidence from Hydro Tasmania of a proposal for a project which they were not able to proceed with, with assistance from the Low Emissions Technology Development Fund, because of the limitations of funding available under that fund for what would have been, in my opinion, a very useful project to develop an understanding of just how useful hydrogen would be. On 30 June this year, evidence from Mr Titchen on behalf of Hydro Tasmania outlined the nature of a project that was being considered to be run in the state of Tasmania that involved a small fleet of buses, a fleet of approximately 200 vehicles, and a number of refuelling stations involving hybrid hydrogen-electric technology. I know there are hydrogen buses operating in, I think, Perth at the moment, but this would be a very useful project for this country.
Tasmania has a renewable energy system, with wind and hydro power overwhelmingly providing the energy resource for the state. The generation of hydrogen to fuel those vehicles would be a completely renewable resource and, of course, the development of a technology involving electric and hydrogen fuelled vehicles with no emissions would be a very useful study for this country. But, unfortunately, what was seen to be a $60-plus million project could only receive $20 million in funding from the Commonwealth, from the Low Emissions Technology Development Fund. It is not unsurprising that Hydro Tasmania decided that the risk to Hydro Tasmania—for a very limited return, one must say—given an investment of in excess of $40 million, while the Commonwealth would only put $20 million towards the project, was high. That meant that the board of Hydro Tasmania decided it was not appropriate for them to continue to pursue such an application. While levelling no criticism at them for making that commercial decision, it is regrettable in terms of the national interest that we are not able to pursue that.
Some people might say that it is all very well for Tasmania to talk about renewably generating hydrogen given the energy sources that are used in Tasmania. But it surprises me that no-one is connecting the vast development of wind farms in this country to the potential for the use of renewable energy in the generation of hydrogen for vehicle use right around this country. Certainly wind and solar power create some such options right around this country. But there seems to be a blinkered approach by this government to wind power. We have even seen the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry rail against wind farms in a quite unseemly fashion, almost, in my opinion, depicting himself as somewhat of a troglodyte in terms of the development of new technologies. There is no doubt that in Europe wind power is a very important energy source. It is being used to replace fossil fuels. It is being used to generate clean energy in the Northern Hemisphere.
We have similar opportunities here. We do have a lot of coal, but coal is a major source of CO emissions. We cannot ignore the evidence of global warming, which grows daily. The findings from that ice core that was reported earlier this week, showing that the level of carbon emissions in the last 100 years has exceeded those of the thousands of years before it, should be telling us that we need to make some changes in the fuel use that we have so that we do not impose upon this world enormous climate changes which, I should not have to tell the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, will have a devastating effect on agriculture in this country.
We are talking about drought in south-eastern Australia at the moment. We have seen repeated drought circumstances in south-eastern Australia over the last decade. But here we have the responsible minister railing against one of the technologies which can contribute to the reduction of CO emissions, the reduction in greenhouse gases, so we can try and do something about climate change. But this government has no intention of doing anything about climate change; this government is content to sit back on its haunches and let things go wrong and hope—and, frankly, that is not good enough. This report starts to address some of the issues. Perhaps we will do some more after this report has been handed down. I am not going to hold my breath. We need to look very closely at these issues and we need to make sure that we have a government which looks at all of the issues and makes sure that this country proceeds down the path of alternative fuels, because we are going to need them.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,19,1
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2006-09-07,"—I rise to comment on the interim report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee inquiry into Australia’s future oil supply and alternative transport fuels. I am absolutely delighted with the way this inquiry has proceeded. When I moved for this inquiry last year it was because, from the minute I got into the Senate, it was apparent to me that no thinking is going on at the highest levels of government about the fact that the world is facing a convergence of two megaproblems that we have not faced before: global warming—climate change—and oil depletion. We are facing these problems at the same time and there is absolutely no thinking going on in Australia about how we take on our global responsibilities, mitigate climate change to stop it from getting worse, adapt to climate change and, at the same time, adapt to oil depletion.
I moved for this Senate inquiry to get some thinking going on Australia’s future oil supply—where we are going to get our transport fuels from—and to make sure that, in thinking about alternatives, we do not make the greenhouse gas problem, the global warming problem, worse. We moved for this inquiry, and I am delighted that it was supported in this chamber. We have had 192 submissions. I would argue that the inquiry has raised a great deal of interest in the Australian community about what is going to happen in Australia in the future.
It is timely to recognise that, on Geoscience Australia’s figures, over the next 20 years Australia’s self-sufficiency in oil and petroleum will decline from 84 per cent to 20 per cent. I would argue that that is a very optimistic figure. Globally, we are facing the end of the age of cheap, plentiful and easily accessible oil. Australia’s self-sufficiency in oil is running down at a very fast rate. That means Australia will have to import oil and be subjected to higher and higher global oil prices.
Those who believe in the operation of the free market, including some of the agencies that came before the inquiry, say: ‘That’s all right. Australia will just buy oil on the international market.’ ABARE argues that we can just go out and buy oil, at whatever high price, and that it is not going to make much difference to us, because we will also be exporting energy in the form of gas, and the high prices we will be getting for it will offset the high price we have to pay for oil. This argument takes no account of the depleted global supply and the fact that Australia is busy selling off our major transition transport fuel—gas—to China and other places on long-term contracts. That is why the Premier of Western Australia has moved to establish a gas reserve. I am delighted that the committee has decided that Australia should have a national gas reserve.
The other thing that came out very clearly is that there is no thinking at the highest levels of government about the need to reduce our dependence on oil. Sweden moved for an oil commission tasked with finding out how Sweden could reduce its exposure to world prices in the future and, at the same time, reduce greenhouse emissions. They came up with a plan to make Sweden oil free by 2020. Whether or not they achieve that is not the point. The point is that, by establishing that goal, they are now investing in a whole lot of alternative technologies that might get them there.
In Australia, what we have found from talking to a number of people who have come before the inquiry is that all this talk about trying to have just a marginal change in the price of petrol does not address the fact that we need to redesign Australian cities to make them less car dependent. We have to invest heavily in public transport—that was an overwhelming response from the inquiry. We need more bicycle lanes and much better public transport, not only to make us less car dependent but also to address obesity. There are lots of issues this would address. It would reduce city congestion, improve air quality, improve the health of Australians and make our cities more livable and efficient. If Sydney and Melbourne want to be regarded globally as competitive international cities, they are going to have to have much better public transport than they currently have.
A social justice issue that emerged very clearly is that the poorest people generally live furthest from the centre of the city in the areas least well served by public transport. The upshot is that those people are going to suffer the double whammy of higher interest rates and higher petrol prices—and they often have the oldest and least fuel-efficient vehicles; that has been mapped quite clearly. That is why we need to be thinking about redesigning cities.
I must say that my colleague from Western Australia, Senator Siewert, the chair of the committee, was not expressing a bias when she said there was overwhelming evidence congratulating Western Australia. Western Australia came out of this inquiry very well, because it has seriously started to address these issues. That is because Western Australia has a vibrant NGO sector, which is looking at transport issues, an engaged academic sector and a state government that is prepared to listen. Western Australia has invested heavily, without Commonwealth help, in public transport—the railway system in Perth. At the same time, they have invested heavily in alternative fuels—and I congratulate them for that.
We need a combined effort. We need to reduce our oil dependency by investing in public transport and redesigning our cities. At the same time, we need to have vehicles that are more fuel efficient—and mandatory fuel efficiency standards are an absolutely sensible option. Another strand to this is that we need to invest heavily in alternative fuels.
If you look at the Australian car fleet, you find that Holden and Ford are becoming increasingly uncompetitive. If you look at the private vehicle fleet, you find that people have moved to smaller, fuel-efficient vehicles. It is the fleets that are using Holden and Ford—the big six-cylinder vehicles—because the drivers are not paying for the fuel; it is on the fleet.
One thing that came up very strongly was that we need to get rid of the fringe benefits tax, which encourages people to use their vehicles more. One of the recommendations has been that we should look at a way of using concessionary approaches to assist employers to make available public transport options instead of the fringe benefits tax.
Another clear thing that came out of this concerned the role of ABARE. I think that all the evidence we have before us shows that they are out on their own. Nobody takes them seriously anymore, except the government. It would be laughable—and people did laugh about ABARE’s predictions about future oil prices—if it were not so serious. But the tragedy for Australia is that ABARE advises government and that advice is the basis on which AusLink makes its projections about interstate transport. As a result, they are building more and more freeways instead of getting into upgrading the railway network and the internodal transport connections that we need. It is a tragedy for this country that they have got it so wrong. And why have they got it so wrong? Because they are relying on going to coal to liquids. They are saying: ‘There’s no problem. If we run out of oil, we’ve got plenty of coal; we’ll just liquefy coal.’
The point I made at the beginning, and which I return to now, is that coal to liquids is not an option for Australia if you are serious about addressing global warming. In this inquiry it came out very strongly that, to achieve even exactly the same oil emissions as we have now from coal to liquids, you have to have geosequestration. So, in other words, we have to spend millions on geosequestration to achieve tailpipe emissions from coal to liquids exactly the same as those from conventional oil. That is not acceptable.
We should be investing in ethanol, particularly lignocellulose. That, again, is where Western Australia is leading the way. I would argue—and this is not a committee recommendation but it certainly came out of the evidence as far as I am concerned—that we should switch all of the investment we are currently putting into coal to liquids across to lignocellulose. That would have the benefit of improving salinity and biodiversity. If you went with the mallee, as they have done in Western Australia, you would get the biodiversity and the salinity outcomes you want, you would produce an oil which could be used to make biodiesel and you would have a biomass which could then be converted, via lignocellulose, to ethanol. Going down that path would be a fantastic option for Australia, which would have many benefits. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

While the committee felt that it remains to be seen whether the government initiatives will have a significant effect on oil activity, they pointed out that, if significant reserves are found, extraction of the oil from these new sources, which are likely to be in deep water, would come at a much higher cost. So, in fact, they might not address the issue of oil prices, which we were asked to address. In fact, oil prices would continue to rise if new resources were found.
As to whether the appropriate level of resources was being allocated by government and corporations to explore for more oil, there was a question about whether those resources should in fact be redirected to look at other alternative sources of fuel. The committee have not yet reached a conclusion, but we did note that the costs and benefits of more exploration must be assessed against the costs and benefits of other options to reduce our oil dependence. The committee felt that they are significant issues that need to be addressed and that will continue, I hope, to be addressed in the final report.
The issue of biofuels came up and we heard a lot of evidence from people working on biofuels and looking at the various options, whether they be from waste or grain, for ethanol and biodiesel. Again, we heard a lot from the agricultural industry on these areas and we also heard about the promise of lignocellulose in providing a more sustainable long-term source for biofuels.
We heard that there does not seem at present to be an overall approach or national approach being taken to the issue of peak oil and oil depletion. The committee felt that that was an area that needed to be looked at. We also looked at the areas of energy efficiency, conservation and public transport. Again, those were areas that we heard a lot about. We made a number of comments further on in the report about where we need to be looking in the future with respect to the committee process. A lot of concern was expressed to us about the lack of public transport services in many of our cities. I add a bit of home-grown parochialism here—that is, many of the submissions to the committee praised Western Australia, Perth in particular, for its foresight in providing the excellent train system that we have in Perth. I think it is fair to say that we heard people around Australia commenting on that, but people expressed concern that in other cities the public transport system at this stage would not be up to meeting increased demand for services if people made a sudden switch from private vehicles to public transport.
Another issue that came up very strongly was, as I said, how peak oil intersects with climate change and also how the cost of carbon in the future needs to be taken into consideration. The committee have not reached a conclusion on that. We made some comments on that, but it is certainly an area which has been flagged for future work and which needs to be taken into consideration in future options.
Those are some of the issues that the committee highlighted. I am sure my colleagues on the committee will raise other issues. I believe it was an extremely important area of inquiry, and I look forward to seeing the final committee report.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Interim Report</title>,COMMITTEES,19,2
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2006-09-07,"—It is a very important inquiry that the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee has been conducting. It is an inquiry that has attracted quite a deal of attention and has canvassed a range of issues to do with the propulsion of the Australian public in the future in various vehicular modes and what will happen with the fuelling systems that are needed to continue that. It is regrettable that the government’s concertinaing of the Senate system has forced the committee, which has been looking at this report, to provide an interim report before the inquiry had time to fully consider all the ramifications of the submissions before it. That is because the government has a majority in this place and has decided that it wants to take complete and utter control not only of the Senate but also of the committee system, and that it could not tolerate the fact that there were committees of this Senate that were chaired by persons other than members of the coalition.
We have seen an important inquiry effectively concertinaed, and we have seen the committee forced to present an interim report. What does that mean? It means that there may or may not be a full consideration of this matter, and there may or may not be a continuation of the deliberations of the committee—depending upon the structuring of committees that results from the considerations currently taking place. The committee structure may or may not be torn up and a new one put in its place and different issues placed with different committees. I understand there is some talk of the transport section of this committee being moved to another committee, which I must say concerns me.
This report in its draft form reached members of the committee earlier this week, and for that reason it has been given as much attention as possible in that very limited time. In a general sense, it has the support of the opposition. But we are not in a position to rewrite sections of the report as we might have wished them to be. I direct no criticism at the secretariat or the chair of the committee for the situation that we find ourselves in. As I say, this is an action forced upon this committee by the actions of the government, acting in their own interests and not in the interests of the Senate or in the interests of this committee.
I will quibble with one of the passages in the report, the last passage in the report talking about the future for hydrogen as a replacement fuel for oil. The committee report suggests that that fuel might be considered in the distant future but is not a useful option to consider in Australia’s ‘current or medium-term transport fuels mix’. I am not sure what ‘medium-term’ means in that context. We had evidence from Hydro Tasmania of a proposal for a project which they were not able to proceed with, with assistance from the Low Emissions Technology Development Fund, because of the limitations of funding available under that fund for what would have been, in my opinion, a very useful project to develop an understanding of just how useful hydrogen would be. On 30 June this year, evidence from Mr Titchen on behalf of Hydro Tasmania outlined the nature of a project that was being considered to be run in the state of Tasmania that involved a small fleet of buses, a fleet of approximately 200 vehicles, and a number of refuelling stations involving hybrid hydrogen-electric technology. I know there are hydrogen buses operating in, I think, Perth at the moment, but this would be a very useful project for this country.
Tasmania has a renewable energy system, with wind and hydro power overwhelmingly providing the energy resource for the state. The generation of hydrogen to fuel those vehicles would be a completely renewable resource and, of course, the development of a technology involving electric and hydrogen fuelled vehicles with no emissions would be a very useful study for this country. But, unfortunately, what was seen to be a $60-plus million project could only receive $20 million in funding from the Commonwealth, from the Low Emissions Technology Development Fund. It is not unsurprising that Hydro Tasmania decided that the risk to Hydro Tasmania—for a very limited return, one must say—given an investment of in excess of $40 million, while the Commonwealth would only put $20 million towards the project, was high. That meant that the board of Hydro Tasmania decided it was not appropriate for them to continue to pursue such an application. While levelling no criticism at them for making that commercial decision, it is regrettable in terms of the national interest that we are not able to pursue that.
Some people might say that it is all very well for Tasmania to talk about renewably generating hydrogen given the energy sources that are used in Tasmania. But it surprises me that no-one is connecting the vast development of wind farms in this country to the potential for the use of renewable energy in the generation of hydrogen for vehicle use right around this country. Certainly wind and solar power create some such options right around this country. But there seems to be a blinkered approach by this government to wind power. We have even seen the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry rail against wind farms in a quite unseemly fashion, almost, in my opinion, depicting himself as somewhat of a troglodyte in terms of the development of new technologies. There is no doubt that in Europe wind power is a very important energy source. It is being used to replace fossil fuels. It is being used to generate clean energy in the Northern Hemisphere.
We have similar opportunities here. We do have a lot of coal, but coal is a major source of CO emissions. We cannot ignore the evidence of global warming, which grows daily. The findings from that ice core that was reported earlier this week, showing that the level of carbon emissions in the last 100 years has exceeded those of the thousands of years before it, should be telling us that we need to make some changes in the fuel use that we have so that we do not impose upon this world enormous climate changes which, I should not have to tell the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, will have a devastating effect on agriculture in this country.
We are talking about drought in south-eastern Australia at the moment. We have seen repeated drought circumstances in south-eastern Australia over the last decade. But here we have the responsible minister railing against one of the technologies which can contribute to the reduction of CO emissions, the reduction in greenhouse gases, so we can try and do something about climate change. But this government has no intention of doing anything about climate change; this government is content to sit back on its haunches and let things go wrong and hope—and, frankly, that is not good enough. This report starts to address some of the issues. Perhaps we will do some more after this report has been handed down. I am not going to hold my breath. We need to look very closely at these issues and we need to make sure that we have a government which looks at all of the issues and makes sure that this country proceeds down the path of alternative fuels, because we are going to need them.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Interim Report</title>,COMMITTEES,19,2
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2006-09-07,"—I rise to comment on the interim report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee inquiry into Australia’s future oil supply and alternative transport fuels. I am absolutely delighted with the way this inquiry has proceeded. When I moved for this inquiry last year it was because, from the minute I got into the Senate, it was apparent to me that no thinking is going on at the highest levels of government about the fact that the world is facing a convergence of two megaproblems that we have not faced before: global warming—climate change—and oil depletion. We are facing these problems at the same time and there is absolutely no thinking going on in Australia about how we take on our global responsibilities, mitigate climate change to stop it from getting worse, adapt to climate change and, at the same time, adapt to oil depletion.
I moved for this Senate inquiry to get some thinking going on Australia’s future oil supply—where we are going to get our transport fuels from—and to make sure that, in thinking about alternatives, we do not make the greenhouse gas problem, the global warming problem, worse. We moved for this inquiry, and I am delighted that it was supported in this chamber. We have had 192 submissions. I would argue that the inquiry has raised a great deal of interest in the Australian community about what is going to happen in Australia in the future.
It is timely to recognise that, on Geoscience Australia’s figures, over the next 20 years Australia’s self-sufficiency in oil and petroleum will decline from 84 per cent to 20 per cent. I would argue that that is a very optimistic figure. Globally, we are facing the end of the age of cheap, plentiful and easily accessible oil. Australia’s self-sufficiency in oil is running down at a very fast rate. That means Australia will have to import oil and be subjected to higher and higher global oil prices.
Those who believe in the operation of the free market, including some of the agencies that came before the inquiry, say: ‘That’s all right. Australia will just buy oil on the international market.’ ABARE argues that we can just go out and buy oil, at whatever high price, and that it is not going to make much difference to us, because we will also be exporting energy in the form of gas, and the high prices we will be getting for it will offset the high price we have to pay for oil. This argument takes no account of the depleted global supply and the fact that Australia is busy selling off our major transition transport fuel—gas—to China and other places on long-term contracts. That is why the Premier of Western Australia has moved to establish a gas reserve. I am delighted that the committee has decided that Australia should have a national gas reserve.
The other thing that came out very clearly is that there is no thinking at the highest levels of government about the need to reduce our dependence on oil. Sweden moved for an oil commission tasked with finding out how Sweden could reduce its exposure to world prices in the future and, at the same time, reduce greenhouse emissions. They came up with a plan to make Sweden oil free by 2020. Whether or not they achieve that is not the point. The point is that, by establishing that goal, they are now investing in a whole lot of alternative technologies that might get them there.
In Australia, what we have found from talking to a number of people who have come before the inquiry is that all this talk about trying to have just a marginal change in the price of petrol does not address the fact that we need to redesign Australian cities to make them less car dependent. We have to invest heavily in public transport—that was an overwhelming response from the inquiry. We need more bicycle lanes and much better public transport, not only to make us less car dependent but also to address obesity. There are lots of issues this would address. It would reduce city congestion, improve air quality, improve the health of Australians and make our cities more livable and efficient. If Sydney and Melbourne want to be regarded globally as competitive international cities, they are going to have to have much better public transport than they currently have.
A social justice issue that emerged very clearly is that the poorest people generally live furthest from the centre of the city in the areas least well served by public transport. The upshot is that those people are going to suffer the double whammy of higher interest rates and higher petrol prices—and they often have the oldest and least fuel-efficient vehicles; that has been mapped quite clearly. That is why we need to be thinking about redesigning cities.
I must say that my colleague from Western Australia, Senator Siewert, the chair of the committee, was not expressing a bias when she said there was overwhelming evidence congratulating Western Australia. Western Australia came out of this inquiry very well, because it has seriously started to address these issues. That is because Western Australia has a vibrant NGO sector, which is looking at transport issues, an engaged academic sector and a state government that is prepared to listen. Western Australia has invested heavily, without Commonwealth help, in public transport—the railway system in Perth. At the same time, they have invested heavily in alternative fuels—and I congratulate them for that.
We need a combined effort. We need to reduce our oil dependency by investing in public transport and redesigning our cities. At the same time, we need to have vehicles that are more fuel efficient—and mandatory fuel efficiency standards are an absolutely sensible option. Another strand to this is that we need to invest heavily in alternative fuels.
If you look at the Australian car fleet, you find that Holden and Ford are becoming increasingly uncompetitive. If you look at the private vehicle fleet, you find that people have moved to smaller, fuel-efficient vehicles. It is the fleets that are using Holden and Ford—the big six-cylinder vehicles—because the drivers are not paying for the fuel; it is on the fleet.
One thing that came up very strongly was that we need to get rid of the fringe benefits tax, which encourages people to use their vehicles more. One of the recommendations has been that we should look at a way of using concessionary approaches to assist employers to make available public transport options instead of the fringe benefits tax.
Another clear thing that came out of this concerned the role of ABARE. I think that all the evidence we have before us shows that they are out on their own. Nobody takes them seriously anymore, except the government. It would be laughable—and people did laugh about ABARE’s predictions about future oil prices—if it were not so serious. But the tragedy for Australia is that ABARE advises government and that advice is the basis on which AusLink makes its projections about interstate transport. As a result, they are building more and more freeways instead of getting into upgrading the railway network and the internodal transport connections that we need. It is a tragedy for this country that they have got it so wrong. And why have they got it so wrong? Because they are relying on going to coal to liquids. They are saying: ‘There’s no problem. If we run out of oil, we’ve got plenty of coal; we’ll just liquefy coal.’
The point I made at the beginning, and which I return to now, is that coal to liquids is not an option for Australia if you are serious about addressing global warming. In this inquiry it came out very strongly that, to achieve even exactly the same oil emissions as we have now from coal to liquids, you have to have geosequestration. So, in other words, we have to spend millions on geosequestration to achieve tailpipe emissions from coal to liquids exactly the same as those from conventional oil. That is not acceptable.
We should be investing in ethanol, particularly lignocellulose. That, again, is where Western Australia is leading the way. I would argue—and this is not a committee recommendation but it certainly came out of the evidence as far as I am concerned—that we should switch all of the investment we are currently putting into coal to liquids across to lignocellulose. That would have the benefit of improving salinity and biodiversity. If you went with the mallee, as they have done in Western Australia, you would get the biodiversity and the salinity outcomes you want, you would produce an oil which could be used to make biodiesel and you would have a biomass which could then be converted, via lignocellulose, to ethanol. Going down that path would be a fantastic option for Australia, which would have many benefits. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2006-09-07,"—I am in continuation after being rudely interrupted the other day. Unfortunately, this debate has dragged on over about four days as a result of changes to the order of business. We are debating a disallowance motion moved by Senator Brown, Senator Murray and I concerning the government’s regulation which seeks to increase members’ printing entitlement by $25,000 to $150,000 a year and to alter the Senate printing arrangements.
Our main concern is that the government is motivated by partisan political interests rather than the interests of serving the public. I think it has become a sort of a metaphor for the government’s approach this term. It seems it is governing for its interests rather than the interests of the Australian public. These measures make a serious contribution to entrenching members in power. They provide extra resources way beyond what is reasonable to allow a member to defend themselves politically in the next election. It is using taxpayers’ money to resist the forces that are poised to drive members of the government from office and it is a measure that allows all current members a huge advantage over other candidates in the election. I think it shows that the government’s priorities are wrong and that they are focused on their interests and not the interests of the Australian public. This range of measures introduced by the government since it gained its majority in the Senate seeks to entrench the government in power by the use of taxpayers’ money.
The measure not only increases the printing entitlement for a current member of the House of Representatives to $150,000 a year; it also introduces a provision that allows the member to roll over 45 per cent of their unused entitlement from one year into the following year. It is the first time that a member has been allowed to roll over this entitlement and it is interesting—and I will come back to this—that the same provision does not apply to senators. When you are looking for consistency of principle and approach, you do not get it here. You do not get it, because it is about a political fix to ensure that current members of the House of Representatives have enormous taxpayer funded resources to defend themselves at the next election, not in their role as parliamentarians but in their role as candidates in the election. It is a huge advantage to incumbents; it is a taxpayer funded advantage to incumbents.
The government’s defence of this measure is paper thin. The government says: ‘It’s time for an increase and this is reasonable.’ A $25,000 increase? There was no justification. The only defence the minister has offered is that ‘it only equates to $1.61 per elector and that that is not an unreasonable position—$1.61 is a reasonable position to take’. It is a huge increase in entitlement. There has been no justification for it and, as I say, the provisions allow these things to be used in the defence of a member in an electoral context rather than in their role as a parliamentarian.
As I say, there has been no justification made for this in any credible way, but I want to focus in part today on what I call the Howard re-election clause. The Howard re-election clause is the amendment to schedule 1, subregulation 3 contained in this measure which allows for 45 per cent of the entitlement to be rolled over to the following year. Not only are you entitled to $150,000 of taxpayers’ money to print material for distribution to the electors; you are allowed for the first time to roll it over and spend more than that in one year. In fact, under this arrangement, it is possible for the member to accumulate $217,500 worth of printing entitlement in one year. So not only are we increasing the printing entitlement; we are giving the member the opportunity to hoard that entitlement for use in an election year. So not only do we have $25,000 increase in the total but, by virtue of the rollover, we allow a $92,500 increase in the entitlement for one year. Which year will it be used in? You can bet your bottom dollar it will be used in election years. The amount is quite frankly staggering but it is even worse if you think about it in terms of the current context.
The year 2007 is a federal election year. This provision comes in on 1 July 2006, so we have a provision that says: you can spend $150,000 in 2006-07 and $150,000 in 2007-08. That means you can accumulate $300,000 worth of printing entitlement to spend in an election year. We have gone from having a printing entitlement of $125,000 to a provision, the Howard re-election clause, that provides for a member of the House of Representatives to access $300,000 worth of printing entitlement in one year, the election year—that is, a $300,000 head start on any other candidate that stands for election, a $300,000 benefit paid for by the taxpayers of Australia.
In a sense, we argue against self-interest for all the Labor members of the House of Representatives but, if you analyse it from a perspective of what is good for democracy and what is good for the taxpayers of Australia, this provision is indefensible. It is much more insidious than you would expect at first glance. This clause, the Howard re-election clause, allows the rollover of money from one year to the next, which will effectively mean that those who want to save their printing allowance in one financial year are able in an election year to spend $300,000 on printing primarily directed at their re-election—$300,000 funded by the taxpayer to allow them to print material that is focused on their re-election. Think of the poor independent candidate standing against them in the re-election—not a cent to start and with very little capacity to raise money. It is a complete perversion of the democratic process. It completely advantages incumbent members of parliament and ought not be supported. It is an anti-democratic measure.
We concede there are arguments for members being able to communicate with their constituents. It is about finding the right balance. Labor argued last time the government tried this that about $75,000 a year was a reasonable limit. The government could not get its way last time it tried to increase the allowance to what we thought was an unreasonable amount. And here is the government having another go, in the year before the election, knowing that it has the numbers in the Senate to pass the regulation. Today’s disallowance motion will fail. It will fail because the government will exercise its numbers to ensure that the provisions apply.
Although I have but little time available to me, I want to make the point of the comparison with the senators. The new arrangements move from a cap on the reams of paper and printing via the Senate printing office, which senators have access to, to a universal cap of $20,000 per annum for all printing requirements. The government argues that that will not actually disadvantage senators, when compared with current arrangements, and that it is more sensible. I do not want to go into all those arguments, although I think it restricts senators in a very serious way in terms of their capacity to develop larger documents that discuss policy issues and that look to debate important issues of public policy. I think my colleague Senator Carr will probably focus on those issues, so I will not delay the Senate further on those points for the moment.
The members of the House of Representatives are having their allowance increased to $150,000 per annum, whilst senators will enjoy a cap of $20,000 per annum. The minister has defended this move on the House of Representatives printing allowance on the basis that it means a printing allowance of only $1.60 per elector, that it is a reasonable increase and that it is therefore a reasonable provision. But what does the same provision in that same regulation mean for a Western Australian senator? For senators in my own state it means 1.6c per elector per senator. What is the logic of that? What principle of communicating with your electors is involved with that? There is no principle. There is no policy underpinning that. This is a political fix for House of Representatives members to defend their seats. It is about incumbency. It is about the use of taxpayers’ funds to allow incumbent House of Representatives members to defend themselves against challenges in elections.
If you look at a larger state like New South Wales, you see that, while a House of Representatives member in New South Wales will get an allowance equating to $1.61 per elector, a senator from New South Wales will get an entitlement of only 0.46c per elector. That is the absurdity of the proposition being put to us when the government attempts to defend it on the basis of allowing members and senators to communicate with their electors. The reality is that this is a political fix in terms of increasing the entitlement of the House of Representatives members to campaign for their re-election. And it is all funded out of the taxpayers’ purse.
This has got beyond a joke. It has got to the stage where the government is using taxpayers’ money to defend itself from the electoral consequences of its arrogance and failure to develop policies in the interests of Australian citizens. This is about a government governing for itself. And if you look at all the other measures that go with this one—such as the abuse of advertising money—you see the fact that the government has used hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars of taxpayers’ money to advertise in defence of itself. In the last 10 years, over $1 billion of taxpayers’ money has been spent on advertising, largely for defending government policies. We saw the outrageous expenditure of $55 million of taxpayers’ money for the government to try to defend its Work Choices law. It failed, of course, because the Work Choices legislation is indefensible, but it spent $55 million of taxpayers’ money in doing so.
This regulation ought to be disallowed by the Senate, because it is an abuse. It is an abuse of the government’s power and it is an abuse of taxpayers. It goes way over the top in terms of what would be reasonable for members of the House of Representatives to have as a printing entitlement to use for communicating with their electors.
This ‘Howard re-election clause’ shows the cynicism and arrogance of the government. It shows that the government is about ruling for itself and entrenching itself in power rather than acting in the national interest. It effectively allows the taxpayer to pay for $300,000 worth of advertising by each member in an election year. It is a rort. It ought to be opposed. Labor will join with the Greens and the Democrats in opposing it. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>SCHEDULES 1 AND 3 TO THE PARLIAMENTARY ENTITLEMENTS AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2006 (NO. 1)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,MISCELLANEOUS,23,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2006-09-07,"—What the Senate has been hearing in relation to this debate has been a whole stack of hyperbole and exaggerated rhetoric. Mr Acting Deputy President, what we as a Senate ought consider in examining the assertions of the Leader of the Opposition in this place is when the printing allowance came into being. The printing allowance for members of parliament came into being under the Australian Labor Party government in the year 1990. And do you know what? Was the Labor Party’s printing entitlement in 1990 limited? It was not. It was uncapped. It was the reforms of the Howard government—indeed, whilst I was Special Minister of State, if I might say—that put a cap on the expenditure of the printing entitlement.
So it is a nonsense when the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate comes into this place and asserts that this is somehow a political fix for the re-election of the Howard government, because under Labor’s jurisdiction there was no cap in any way, shape or form. And so of course you had people like the person whom we nicknamed ‘Bob the printer’. I think he was the former member for Paterson. We called him Bob the printer. What occurred was that people were expanding—
—Where was he on the list? He was 14th on the list. There were 13 coalition members above him in terms of expenditure.
—I listened to your nonsense in silence; you might like to listen to my facts in silence. Of course the honourable senators opposite get twitchy as soon as you expose the duplicity and the hypocrisy of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. Why did the Australian Labor Party introduce a printing entitlement which was uncapped? Was it for the re-election of the Keating government? Was it for the re-election of the Hawke government? Of course not. When Labor does it, it is to communicate with the electorate. It is all good and wholesome. But when we as a government seek to cap it, there are nefarious reasons behind it. What nonsense. The people of Australia can see through this duplicity of the Australian Labor Party.
Let us get back to when it was introduced. The printing allowance was introduced by the Labor government in 1990 as part of the Parliamentary Entitlements Act, and it was uncapped. In other words, it was an unlimited entitlement. You hear the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate go on with the nonsense that allowing somebody to roll over their entitlement into the next year—and I will get to the reason why that should happen—means that somebody can spend $300,000. But, guess what? Under Labor they could have spent $300,000 and more on their re-election campaign, because it was uncapped. Yet they have the audacity to come into this place and assert that somehow we are seeking to manipulate the system. Indeed it was in September 2001 that I announced, albeit with the Prime Minister, that as of 1 January 2002 the entitlement would be capped at $125,000 per annum as part of a comprehensive package of entitlement reforms. We had under the Labor regime some members of parliament, and I confess that there were some on my side as well, spending up to $400,000. We stopped it. We put an end to it; something that Labor could never bring themselves to do. We put a cap on it. We put an end to it. We asked: what would be a reasonable figure to enable communication with your electorate? We had to keep in mind that, whilst printing is expensive, there is in fact a postage limitation on every member of parliament and therefore it is not as though you can put a sheet of paper into everybody’s letterbox every single day of the week. This sum is limited by virtue of the amount that can be used by way of postage.
That original decision to cap it at $125,000 was taken some five years ago. It makes good sense that that figure should be reviewed from time to time. If you start with the inflation rate and you then compound that over the past five years, a raise to $150,000 seems to be reasonable. It means that an MP would have about $1.60 per year per elector. It is interesting to note that Senator Evans, in his hyperbole, says that $300,000 for re-election is immoral. I have already pointed out the hypocrisy of Labor, because they would have it uncapped, which would mean that they could have spent $500,000 or $600,000. We put a limit on it. But all we are talking about here is an increase of $25,000. When he says that $300,000 is an inappropriate figure, what he is really saying is that $250,000, which is the current cap, would be appropriate. So somehow that $50,000 figure is the inappropriate amount—if you were to be honest with the electors. Of course, we know from Labor the tactic has always been ‘opposition for opposition’s sake; don’t do as I do, do as I say’. When they are in government, we know what they will do. If they ever get the numbers again, they would uncap it—as they were happy to have it uncapped when they introduced it in 1990.
We have heard all sorts of things from Senator Brown about this being an outrageous hike et cetera. I simply say to him that, with all his hyperbole, the mere repetition of his false assertions does not make those false assertions right. He can repeat and repeat and repeat the false assertions, but that does not clothe them with any integrity or any truth. Senator Murray made a contribution to this debate. He quoted Norm Kelly. I understand he wrote an article in recent times and is now an academic ensconced at the Australian National University. Unfortunately what Senator Murray did not remind us was that this Norm Kelly, if I have the right one, is in fact a former Democrat member of parliament in Western Australia. Senator Ruth Webber is acknowledging that for me. And so, with great respect, for these academics who try to pretend that they are somehow clothed with academic independence, there is an issue of integrity here. It would be helpful if they were to say, ‘And by the way, I am a former Democrat member of parliament with a particular persuasion and with a particular axe to grind in this debate.’ I have dealt with most of that which Senator Evans spoke about, including that this was somehow a perversion of the democratic process.
We as a government say that there should be an absolute limit in an election year of $300,000 with this rollover. That it would be spent, I would doubt, but nevertheless potentially it is possible. But, if $300,000 is a perversion of democracy, it behoves the Australian Labor Party to tell the Australian people why their uncapped approach, which would have allowed $500,000 or more to be spent, was not a perversion of democracy. It will be very interesting to hear Senator Carr try to dance around that one. I do not think he will be able to.
When we were on entitlements—and I remember when this suite of entitlements was introduced—the Labor Party and the minor parties tried this same stunt. Labor joined with the Democrats and Greens to disallow the increase to the printing allowance which would have assisted all members. But, of course, what the Labor Party do not tell you in this debate is that, at the time the printing cap was put in, which they found outrageous—which is interesting, seeing it was previously uncapped—they could not find it in their conscience to disallow a range of entitlements that were specifically designed in fairness in this democratic process to help the Labor Party and the minor parties, such as enhanced transport arrangements for opposition and minor party MPs, including new charter transport arrangements for them. Was the cost to the taxpayer referred to by Senator Evans or Senator Murray in their contributions? No, because, if it is something they might be able to avail themselves of, that is good and wholesome—and so we do not talk about that. When we allow business class travel for some of their staff and more computers and more mobile phones for these staff, the whiff of hypocrisy in this is quite overwhelming. In fact, it is no longer a whiff; it is a stench of hypocrisy of these honourable senators opposite.
It is interesting, because the Labor Party have been out on this issue banging the can for quite some time. Mr Thomson from the other place is their public accountability spokesman. He appeared on Perth radio on 17 August and said that the $125,000 was already too high. Interesting: a $125,000 cap is too high, but uncapped is not too high—that is okay! Of course, what he does not—or he might, in fact—know is that the member for Griffith, Kevin Rudd, spent the whole of that $125,000 less 1c on his printing entitlement. So what does that tell you about Mr Thomson’s approach to Mr Rudd? He believes Mr Rudd has wasted taxpayers’ money.
Labor members are finding the need to spend this money on their electorates. Is Mr Thomson willing to condemn the member for Griffith—the potential leader of the Australian Labor Party if Bill Shorten does not beat him to it? They are the sorts of issues that Senator Carr should be addressing in the event that he does in fact make a substantial contribution. He never has, so I am not really expecting him to. But Mr Thomson tells us:
I think people ought to be able to do their communication with a budget of under $100,000.
That is Mr Thomson’s view of the world. We have just heard Senator Evans saying it ought to be $75,000. Which is it? Let the Labor Party come out. They said, when they introduced it, it should be uncapped. Now that we have capped it so there cannot be an abuse, one says it should be $100,000 and another says it ought to be $75,000. What is it? If you are an alternative government, you ought to have a position fair and square and tell us and the Australian people what it is. But, of course, typical of Labor’s style, it is opposition for opposition’s sake—and then they cannot even get their story together.
But, if the limit ought to be $100,000, guess who spent $110,000 last year in communicating with his electorate? None other than the member for Brand. Who might be the member for Brand? None other than Mr Beazley. So here we have Mr Beazley making a conscious decision that, in communicating with his electorate, he should be spending $110,000, yet his shadow spokesman says that $100,000 ought to be the limit. Senator Evans has undermined Mr Beazley even further by saying that the limit ought to be $75,000. In other words, according to them, Mr Beazley has wasted $35,000 on excessive communication with the electors of Brand. Indeed, when Mr Thomson was really pressed on this, he tried to assert that a previous cap was in the order of $62,000. Of course it was not; there was no limit in any way, shape or form, and that is where the whole Labor Party argument came undone.
Even Mr Thomson himself is a good spender of this entitlement, as indeed is the member for Batman, who is on record as saying that a legitimate level of expenditure is only $30,000. He is a very senior shadow minister: the member for Batman happens to rejoice in the name of Mr Martin Ferguson. Here we have a range. When Labor was in power, uncapped; now that we cap it, Labor have all this mock hysteria and mock outrage. When they are pressed as to what the cap should be, you have Mr Martin Ferguson saying $30,000; somebody else, $75,000; somebody else, $100,000—all this faux outrage. Really, can I say to those opposite that what we are doing is not unrealistic: it is fair, it is reasonable and, what is more important, there is an actual cap, unlike what Labor had.
On what senators may or may not need in relation to communication, if we were able to communicate with every elector, that would be a serious impost on the taxpayers. It is interesting to note that a former distinguished senator in this place, now deceased, Senator Cook, wrote a lengthy and, might I add, well-considered and well-constructed letter to the chairman of the Remuneration Tribunal. This is what he said:
Members of the lower house traditionally have a much closer relationship with the electorate than is the case with members of the upper house who represent their state as a single electorate. It is therefore not appropriate to base the entitlement for senators on the size of the constituency.
That was from a former distinguished Labor minister, who, I think at some stage, even served as their deputy leader in this place. So that was the Labor view when they were in government. In his letter, he said:
In the United States, members of the House of Representatives are able to send out six mass mailings each year to each postal patron within their congressional district.
We do not allow for that—far from it. We allow for one mailing per annum, not six. If you do a worldwide comparison, you will see how very sensible and reasonable we are and, what is more, unlike Labor, we have capped it. Another example that Senator Cook pointed out was Canada. The members of the House of Commons there are able to send out four mass mailings each year and up to eight in an election year. I tell you that the House of Representatives members here would not be able to send out eight mailings to each constituent in an election year.
Despite this moral outrage about this ‘perversion of the democratic process’, a lot bigger entitlements in the United States and Canada do not seem to have perverted the democratic process there, so why should a smaller entitlement in Australia somehow pervert the democratic process?
I invite senators to also reflect that in the United Kingdom, as Senator Cook pointed out in his letter, members of the House of Commons are entitled to free postage for parliamentarians’ business in the country—in other words, it is absolutely unlimited. Mr Blair has not changed that. He has been in government for quite some time. I ask the simple question: if it is not a perversion, with all these unlimited, quite generous entitlements in the United Kingdom—and much more generous in all these other comparable democracies—why is our modest entitlement somehow a perversion of democracy? I will tell you why, Mr Acting Deputy President. This is another example of the Australian Labor Party doing opposition for opposition’s sake, not looking at things objectively, opposing anything and everything the government does and being absolutely and utterly blind to the fact that, when they introduced the printing allowance, they did so on an uncapped basis. We brought integrity into the system by capping it—something that Labor could never bring themselves to do—and we believe that at this stage of the life cycle of the printing entitlement, it is appropriate to have a modest increase. The government oppose the disallowance motion.",SENATE,<title>SCHEDULES 1 AND 3 TO THE PARLIAMENTARY ENTITLEMENTS AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2006 (NO. 1)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,MISCELLANEOUS,23,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2006-09-07,"—The minister has just given us a dissertation on stench. I always find it an interesting concept, coming from a man—
—You live in it!
—He says that we live in it. That is his approach to the matter. We see from him a presentation that has all the enthusiasm of a salesman for the new product. No matter what the product is, he has enthusiasm for it. But in fact what you are seeing is a rather sharp, somewhat sleazy and slimy approach being taken to the presentation of what is a very weak case of a government. He has all the morality of a used car salesman when it comes to the selling of his product. In the first instance he says that, when the Labor Party was in government, it did not have a cap on printing. He knows, as he has been a former minister, that the policy of the Labor Party was to support a cap for many years. He knows that Senator Ray is on the public record and he knows that I and Senator Faulkner, as former shadows in this area, have both made statements to the effect that we support a cap on the printing entitlement. He knows that to be the case and he has wilfully misrepresented the Labor Party’s position on these matters.
He commented on the generosity the government has shown towards the opposition. I know that Senator Ferris wrote to him when he was the minister, at least on three occasions, requesting support for phones for the whip’s office, which was denied by him. I understand it was the current Special Minister of State, Mr Nairn, who finally agreed to the provision of extra phones for the whip’s office. We have opposition frontbenchers who do not have enough computers in their rooms. Those computers have been denied because it suits the government to restrict the opposition in terms of the facilities available.
What I am particularly concerned about is the abuse of ministerial power that flows from the actions of the government. We have seen the case that has been put in terms of advertising. We know the additional moneys the government are spending to support their case for re-election—over $1 billion in advertising from public sources. We know the changes they made to the electoral laws to undermine the franchise in this country, to undermine the Australian ballot. We know the actions that they are taking to restrict people’s capacity to participate. We now have this provision with regard to the printing entitlement, which is all about the re-election of the government. Those combined measures have to be seen.
However, what I am particularly concerned about is how the government seeks to use the ministerial office in a manner to undermine the position of other members of this parliament to the point where, just last month, we saw the current minister, Minister Nairn, releasing details of entitlement spending of some members of the Labor Party. Of course, that practice was pursued in 2001, where Minister Abetz today referred, once again, to the member for Paterson, who was the 14th member on the list of spending at that particular time. That was a clear attempt by the government to smear and misrepresent the situation. In that case we had 13 coalition members spending more money than the member for Paterson at that time. We now hear a reference to the member for Brand and the member for Griffith and their spending entitlements, so we see a clearer pattern being established by this government of gross misrepresentation of ministerial authority and abuse of ministerial office.
We have a clear situation where these are not matters that are subject to the Remuneration Tribunal. These are not the patterns of deliberation made by some independent authority. These are the political decisions of government made for the interests of government and aimed to extract the maximum advantage out of incumbency. I take the view that there ought to be a clear balance on these questions. All that we have said—and I have said this in terms of my responsibilities in this parliament on the questions of entitlement—is that there ought to be caps on the printing entitlements. We have made that very clear. But what we say, though, is that we cannot have a situation where members can take advantage of the $300,000 in an election year, which Senator Evans has pointed out, in circumstances where the audit provisions are extremely weak.
However, I want to concentrate on other aspects of these new regulations that the government is introducing by ministerial fiat. We cannot amend these regulations; we can only move to disallow them. So there is no question of saying we do not like this amount and would prefer another amount; it is about either disallowing them or accepting them, and we are moving to disallow them, because these are regressive regulations. The government claims that these changes in respect of the Senate are designed to regularise the arrangements for senators. Nothing could be further from the truth.
We now have a ludicrous situation, as a result of this government’s actions, where senators are effectively banned from using the Senate printing office, where senators are not entitled to use the Senate printing office. However, what I am particularly concerned about is the fact that the President of this chamber is said to be the source of this advice to the government to restrict the capacity of senators to use the Senate printing office. I refer directly to the minister’s letter of 30 August that confirms that the printing office will no longer be responsible for senators’ printing. He says:
As a consequence of the fact that the newsletter and stationery entitlements of senators have now been amalgamated, the Senate printing office will no longer be responsible for printing any items for senators.
What an extraordinary proposition! And Minister Nairn’s letter of 15 August points out that these changes were the results of representations by the President himself. I know he has been concerned for some time to see the use of Tasmanian paper in the printing office. He does not like the use of imported paper. I can understand the view about using domestic paper for the printing of government documents, but I think it is a long way to go from that to suggest we should have some sweetheart deal with local printers so that we can win the services of friendly local printers for the printing of our materials—and I look forward to the acquittal processes that will come from those arrangements.
I am particularly surprised by the acquiescence of the President to the transfer of the administrative responsibility for these matters from the department to MAPS. We have a situation where the presiding officer should not acquiesce to the executive, because I understand that the real source of the authority for this change in the Senate printing entitlements is a decision of the Prime Minister himself. He is the one that has been pursuing these questions, because he is very concerned about the way in which some senators in this chamber are actually using their printing entitlement to canvass ideas. Shock horror!
—See Senator Ray’s comments in Hansard. Talk to Senator Ray!
—I raise the point, Minister: who did the President consult? Which senators did he consult? Who did he ask about these changes? What constituency was the Senate President actually seeking to serve by these changes?
The minister for finance tells us that we have an average expenditure of $15,000 on the services that are currently available. I would like to know on what basis he calculated that cost. I would like to know on what basis as to the quality of services provided were these assessments made. What allowance was made for the commercial costs of the printing that we are supposed to be undertaking? We understand the new provisions will mean that all senators’ printing—everything from their Christmas cards and their calling cards to their compliments slips and their fax cover sheets—will have to be done privately. You would have to ask yourself what additional costs will be involved in that process.
I am particularly interested to know how the government will seek to establish the pro rata amounts between a senator and a member of the House of Representatives. We clearly have a situation with the carry-forward provision, as Senator Evans has pointed out, where there is a great disparity in the amounts of money that are available for senators and House of Representatives members. No-one on this side would suggest that there ought to be equality in terms of the amounts, but the disparity is now at a point where it is clearly ridiculous. If you think about the amounts of money that are actually available for the electoral cycle, we are now looking at a figure of some $540,000 that is available for members of the House of Representatives to be used for their own re-election. That equates with nothing like the amounts of money that are available for senators to undertake their work.
I take the view that it is not just a question of the size of the envelopes or whether or not we now have to go down to the MAPS store and ask the MAPS people to deliver envelopes to our office for us to then personally transfer to a local printer. That is all irrelevant to this major issue, although there are clearly additional costs involved that the minister for finance has not calculated. What I am very concerned about is the impact of these changes. One of our critical roles in this place as senators is to debate matters. Our critical role is to assess what is going on in this country at any particular time. We actually live in a bizarre age. We are seeing with this current Australian government, particularly under this Prime Minister, a severe case of antipodean cretinism. We have a clear case of the degrading of the importance of rational debate, of intellectual rigour, of the assessment of social and economic options. It is a dumbing down, Minister—and you are the perfect example of it. There is a dumbing down of the level of political debate in this country. Parliament ought to be the centre for the battle of ideas. It ought to be the arena in which issues and policies of enduring national significance are debated and thrashed out. It is the site where different visions of society should be tested and canvassed. The Senate has a particular role in that regard, and under the current arrangements the capacity to produce larger documents, policy documents, discussion documents, magazines and journals is of course apparent to us all; the ability to swap the paper entitlement around means that has occurred.
What we are seeing under this government is that the Senate’s role as a house of review is being restricted—and I do not just mean review of legislation; I mean reviewing the work of government, public policy and our vision of ourselves, our country and our place in the world. All of these matters are being restricted. A senator ought to be allowed to have the highest level of intellectual commitment—a commitment to rational debate and analysis—and the capacity to make appropriate judgements. But, under these regulations, we are confined to doing that on four sheets of paper; if it does not fit onto four sheets of paper, it is not to be covered by printing. We cannot print any documents that are longer than four sheets of paper. What is the mentality of a government that creates that as part of its regulations?
I take the view that the contest of ideas should occur not just in this chamber but throughout the community at large. It also ought to occur in the back rooms of parliament. Labor has a long tradition of emphasis on political debate and journalism. There is an equally long tradition of Labor politicians who have recognised and used the platform offered by journalism and the political press. Red Ted Theodore, John Curtin, Frank Anstey and a whole host of people have used their jobs as members of parliament to argue their case in the public debate using the printed word. Even Billy Hughes, in his early days, was interested in these sorts of things.
These regulations seek to change the communications entitlement to wilfully—and, I say, quite intentionally—frustrate senators who have an interest in fulfilling that important part of their work. What we have here is an attempt by this Prime Minister, through his deliberate personal intervention on this matter, to stifle debate and stunt the development and evaluation of policy and policy options. No case has been made for this, but we are now told that there is to be a restriction on what we can do. There will be a limit of $20,000 a year for all printing entitlements, and documents can be no more than four pages in length.
We are told that the changes that are being taken—moving away from the Department of the Senate—will be an improvement. I have had no trouble at all getting material published through the Black Rod’s office; it is not a restriction. I have put forward policy documents, journals of essays and a range of matters. I have used my entitlement to the full, without restriction by the Black Rod’s office. We are now told that this is the excuse that is being used to justify the transfer of these arrangements to DOFA. We are being told that if it does not fit on four sheets of A4 paper—we can have it on glossy paper if we want, of course—it does not count and that is not the appropriate way for it to be done.
It strikes me that this is an attack on our rights and our capacity to undertake our job. It will mean that some senators who currently use this allowance to do the job will not be able to do it. Senator Brandis, Senator Mason and even Senator Fifield have an interest in this sort work. They produce journals; they are interested in contributing to journals; they are in the business of articulating views about the direction in which this country should go. I happen not to agree with them, but I defend their right to do it—and it would seem that I defend it much more strongly than this Prime Minister does. We have a situation in which the work of senators is being undermined by the actions of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has targets whom he cannot abide. I have mentioned Brandis, Mason and Fifield. They are not left-wingers; they are probably moderates. They are conservative libertarians; they are not particularly revolutionary men. But this Prime Minister aims to silence them. They join another group: Petro Georgiou, Bruce Baird and Judi Moylan. This is not exactly a roll call of John Howard’s favourites. What we are seeing with this device is the Prime Minister’s determination to silence the Peter Costello acolytes. This device is being used by the Prime Minister to restrict—
—You are desperate!
—the articulation of opinion in this chamber. It is as much a factional move by this Prime Minister—and the likes of Senator Abetz—to restrict his opponents as it is anything else.
Some senators are able to publish their own documents because they are able to use their own resources. Senator Santoro’s magazine The Conservative is a case in point. Senator Santoro is the editor of this journal and he is clearly aspiring to be a leader within the Liberal Party. This journal draws upon the thinking of notorious people within the Liberal Party such as Mr Gerry Wheeler, who contributed to the last two editions of that journal. It is supposed to be printed quarterly—it is falling a bit behind. I read the initial issue, which was sponsored by the patron Senator Minchin. Mr Gerry Wheeler stood unsuccessfully for Liberal preselection for the Senate in 2002. He has been described by a former party colleague as:
… a hardline right-wing member of the Liberal Party who was once part of a group known as the ‘bronweenies’—young Tories who worshipped Bronwyn Bishop, who for a brief while fancied herself as a saviour of the Liberals after John Hewson lost the 1993 election.
With Mr Wheeler comes an attitude that strikes one as being like that of the rabid anti-communists of 1950s America. Formerly an adviser in Mr Howard’s office, although what he actually did there was always a mystery to most of us, Mr Wheeler is a man who detests the ALP—and the left of the Liberal Party for that matter—with a passion.
Another report suggests that Mr Wheeler has other political interests such as the right to bear automatic arms, the privatisation of the ABC and the SBS, opposition to economic sanctions against South Africa and all the rest of it. That is his long history.
So Senator Santoro’s journal is very interesting. It is privately funded by a Sydney not-for-profit company and it is not in his declaration of pecuniary interests. I always find it very interesting that this should be the case. My point is simply this: senators ought to be able to use their printing entitlement for the discussion of ideas about policy. They should not have to rely upon privately-funded, undeclared, not-for-profit companies to organise the articulation of their points of view. There should be an opportunity for senators to undertake their job properly. These measures by this government are part of a package of measures aimed not only at ensuring that the incumbency of this government is maintained but also at enabling the Prime Minister to mount a direct assault on his factional opponents.

Question put:
That the motion (That the motion (Senator Bob Brown’s) be agreed to.) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>SCHEDULES 1 AND 3 TO THE PARLIAMENTARY ENTITLEMENTS AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2006 (NO. 1)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,MISCELLANEOUS,23,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-09-07,"—I continue my remarks in the second reading debate of the Financial Transaction Reports Amendment Bill 2006. There is a startling and profound lack of public awareness about these laws, which should be an issue of serious concern for any person interested in seeing Australia’s long liberal democratic traditions continue. However, it is not only the mandatory nature of the loss of privacy that is of concern; there is also the fact that there is a reduction in control over a person’s personal financial information. When a person divulges information to a bank, they are potentially also allowing a number of other government departments to access their information.
Under the current laws, when a bank is required to give customer financial information to AUSTRAC, an entire network of other government agencies can also gain access to the information. In their submission to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee inquiry into the exposure draft of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Bill 2005, the Australian Privacy Foundation noted that the information given to AUSTRAC is made available online to nearly 30 partner agencies, some of which are authorised to disclose the information to other overseas agencies. Yet how many ordinary people are aware of the extensive intergovernment departmental information exchange system that exists? If more people did know about it, would there be unanimous support for such a system? Concern over the lack of public awareness was also voiced by the Australian Bankers Association in their submission to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee inquiry into the Financial Transaction Reports Amendment Bill 2006.
While there is a genuine need for anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws, there is also a serious need for an increased campaign of public awareness about what goes on in these respects. The Australian Privacy Foundation noted, in their submission referred to just moments ago, that the Financial Transaction Reports Act regime ‘makes a mockery of continuous assurances about banking confidentiality’. In all the various legislative responses that have been implemented in the post September 11 world, it is important to not forget whom these laws are meant to protect: the people of the strong democracy of Australia.
Recognising the need for some things to change and that we do need a tighter regulatory environment is, of course, entirely acceptable and proper, but it must be done with a recognition and understanding of consequences and results. I encourage the government in its efforts to implement a sound legislative framework which minimises money laundering, exposes the financing of terrorist and criminal activities and reduces the evasion of tax. However, it is also of fundamental importance that, in the enacting of such laws, the competing interests of the privacy of personal information be balanced against the need to outlaw and prohibit activities and actions which run contrary to a safe, civil and enduring society. The Australian Democrats will support this bill but note that the legislation will need careful monitoring for its effects and consequences.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL TRANSACTION REPORTS AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,24,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2006-09-07,"—in reply—In summary, the primary purpose of the Financial Transaction Reports Amendment Bill 2006 is to vary the amendments to the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988, the FTR Act, made by schedule 9 of the Anti-Terrorism Act (No. 2) 2005, the ATA. The aim of the amendments made by the ATA to the FTR Act was to bring Australia into closer compliance with special recommendation VII of the Financial Action Task Force, FATF. Variations to those amendments have been made to address practical issues raised by industry. The government accepted the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee’s recommendation to hold further discussions with the ABA and GE Money on issues they raised in relation to the bill. The government amendments address all but two of those issues.
The government has informed the ABA that it will discuss the issue of the inclusion of credit card account numbers in IFTIs with other FATF members to explore the options for international solutions. GE Money raised an issue about corporate treasuries which will be addressed by way of regulations and can be resolved without requiring an amendment to the bill. There has been extensive consultation with industry in relation to the AMLCTF Bill which is still ongoing. In the course of that consultation, industry have identified issues which have been addressed. This means that changes needed to be made to the FTR Act. Such amendments are important for the proper operation of that act.
Industry must have certainty about its obligations in this complicated area, and the amendments to the FTR Act will achieve that result. It is acknowledged that the AMLCTF Bill has privacy implications. However, the government is committed to bringing Australia into compliance with the recommendations of FATF and, in the present context, special recommendation VII. The AMLCTF Bill will strike an appropriate balance between privacy rights and the need to combat money-laundering and terrorist financing.
It has taken time to develop the AMLCTF Bill because of the amount of consultation which has been needed to develop a package which will be both effective and cost efficient for industry. It is important to get things right and introduce balanced and effective legislation. The government makes no apology for taking the time to consult with industry in this difficult and complex area. Senator Ludwig raised a number of points which again demonstrate the opposition’s lack of understanding of the process required and the complexity of the AMLCTF reforms. Senator Ludwig complained about the time the government has taken to introduce AMLCTF reforms. The government has always said that this is a comprehensive reform, which must not only reflect security concerns but also not inappropriately burden the private sector. The government has engaged in extensive consultation with industry—which industry requested.
—Again.
—Can I put on record, yet again, that we are a government that does not hide from consultation. We are a government that is proud of our consultative record. For the Labor Party to interject and say we have consulted ‘again’ just indicates that the Labor Party is now accepting that which the Australian people believe—that is, that we do consult.
—Mr Acting Deputy President Hutchins, I rise on a point of order going to relevance.
—This is frivolous.
—I am allowed to take a point of order. The issue is relevance. You know that you did not consult in the beginning. You are now misquoting me by saying ‘again’. What I have said right from the start is that there was no consultation in the beginning.
 (Senator Hutchins)—Your point has been made, Senator. I call the minister.
—With respect, Mr Acting Deputy President, no point of order has been made and you should rule accordingly.
—There was no point of order. I call the minister.
—Thank you.
—Feel better now?
—Yes, I am very happy now, after that wounding intervention by Senator Ludwig!
—Bring in the bandages!
—Yes, the old lettuce leaves will be wearing out very shortly! I confirm that the government has engaged in extensive consultation which industry requested. I repeat that the government does not shy away from the need to consult in any area, but especially not in an area where there are complexities.
Other countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States of America have gone through a similar process and they are still working on anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism financing reforms. Consultation has been necessary in order to produce a well-developed package that will be effective and cost efficient for industry. It is important for industry to understand their obligations under this complex piece of legislation, and the government makes no apology for taking the time to consult with industry to get the bill right.
My very good friend and colleague Senator Ludwig also stated that there was a lack of consultation on the ATA. It was not possible to conduct extensive consultation on the ATA given the urgency of that bill. However, extensive consultation has been undertaken in the context of the AMLCTF Bill—
—Congratulations!
—Thank you very much for that, Senator Ludwig. Extensive consultation has been undertaken in the broader context of the AMLCTF Bill, which has ensured that industry has been able to raise its concerns and consult with the government on them. As a result of these discussions, amendments were made to the FTR Act. As a result of the Senate committee inquiry and consultation with industry, we have developed amendments which we consider to be worthwhile.
—Again.
—Yet again, my good friend and colleague Senator Ludwig clearly does not understand the complexities of AMLCTF reforms, and his insistence on speedy passage again demonstrates the opposition’s lack of understanding of the need to consult with industry on what are very important reforms. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2006-09-07,"—I would like to speak on behalf of Senator Nick Sherry, during his absence, in relation to the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Superannuation Safety and Other Measures) Bill 2005. This bill amends three acts—the Superannuation Acts of 1976, 1990 and 2005—by changing some provisions for public servants to make them more consistent with the private sector regulation of superannuation. Specifically, the bill allows negative credit rates to be applied to member accounts in the CSS. Allowing a negative credit rating will mean that the CSS, in line with other super funds, will apply a negative in a poor investment year. Currently, what is called a ‘smoothing’ is carried out in a negative earnings year by declaring a zero rate of return and transferring the losses forward to the following year or years by a reduction in the positive rate of return. This is carried out by the use of a reserve account. Members’ accounts up to 1 July 2006 will be quarantined and accumulations only from this date will be affected.
Maintaining smoothing is now very difficult for two reasons. Firstly, the introduction of investment choice will allow members to actively switch investments to higher risk categories and members who do not do this subsidise members who do. Secondly, the CSS is closed and will experience a rapid decline in membership over the next 10 years. If negative earnings occur, the members who have left the fund due to retirement are subsidised by the remaining members—a rapidly declining number—who will be required to make up the losses.
Also this bill will ensure the operation of the PSS and CSS are consistent with the requirements of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, the SI(S) Act, concerning fitness and propriety standards for superannuation fund trustees. This is a common-sense approach and ensures that a ‘fit and proper person test’, with the power of removal if an individual does not meet the test, covers public sector superannuation, as it does private superannuation, trustees. It is a necessary safety improvement. Labor supports the bill and provisions contained within.
However, given this is a superannuation safety bill, Labor is greatly concerned about what is not in the bill. Labor has been greatly concerned for some years about two further aspects of safety for superannuation—theft and fraud, and employer insolvency. Labor has actively advanced policies to solve the gaps in protection. In respect of theft and fraud, current law only guarantees protection for up to 90 per cent of moneys lost. The Liberal government has tried unsuccessfully to reduce this to 80 per cent. The current compensation mechanism provides that where theft and fraud occur a levy mechanism is applied across fund assets, currently totalling some $905 billion, to compensate the individuals affected. Fortunately, incidence of theft and fraud is minute in the context of total savings. This levy, when activated, represents a reduction of some 30c to 40c on members’ fund balances. However, theft and fraud are catastrophic for the few hundred out of the millions of fund members affected each year.
Given superannuation is compulsory, long term and for retirement, there is a very strong public interest argument that in these circumstances individuals should be fully compensated. Labor’s second reading amendment reflects this. In respect of employer insolvency the General Employee Entitlements Redundancy Scheme, GEERS, pays compensation for all unpaid wages, all accrued annual leave, long service leave, pay in lieu of notice and up to 16 weeks redundancy entitlements, as per community standards. Statutory entitlements and community standards are covered, except for one—unpaid superannuation contributions, the superannuation guarantee.
Each year some 20,000-plus employees miss out on approximately $100 million in mainly compulsory superannuation contributions. This figure is an updated one based on the Australian Taxation Office compliance program 2005-06. Often the unpaid super is greater than other protected entitlements. For example, a worker on a wage or salary of $50,000 a year who has, under GEERS, three weeks annual leave owing and a week’s notice would receive approximately $4,300, but the unpaid super would amount to $4,500. So that statutory superannuation payment is unprotected. Labor’s second reading amendment calls on the government to consider extending the GEERS to protect this major statutory entitlement—superannuation. I move Labor’s second reading amendment:
At the end of the motion add:
“but the Senate notes that:",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SUPERANNUATION SAFETY AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,25,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-09-07,"—The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Superannuation Safety and Other Measures) Bill 2005 amends three superannuation acts: the Superannuation Act 1976, governing the operation of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme, known as the CSS; the Superannuation Act 1990, governing the operation of the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme, known as the PSS; and the Superannuation Act 2005, applying to both the PSS and the CSS.
The bill comprises three schedules. Schedule 1 makes a number of changes to all three superannuation acts and amends existing legislation such that: board members will be able to participate in board meetings whilst overseas via the use of proxies; the range of people to whom CSS and PSS boards can delegate their powers will be broadened; CSS and PSS boards will be able to require employers to distribute information to their employees as required under the Corporations Act 2001; the new fitness and propriety operating standards under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 will apply to CSS and PSS board members; and the Minister for Finance and Administration may terminate the appointment of any board member who does not meet the standard. And this of course leads you to ask how that evaluation will be done and how due process will occur.
Schedule 2 amends the Superannuation Act 1976 to allow the CSS board to apply negative crediting rates to CSS member accounts, in effect meaning that the members will bear the investment risk relating to their account balances as appropriate. Schedule 3 includes provisions to rectify the situation where a group of CSS members have received benefits in breach of superannuation laws. The explanatory memorandum states that the bill has no financial implications for the Commonwealth. The bill seems to be amending certain superannuation acts so that the CSS and PSS are brought into line with those standards that generally apply to other funds in the superannuation industry. Consequently, any competitive advantage is removed and, to use that overused phrase, ‘the level playing field’ might be seen to have been created. By broadening the scope of the board members’ delegation powers administrative efficiency may be improved, but of course that is always up to the standard and quality of the people on those boards.
The removal of the restriction and the declaring of negative rates of return will enable a more equitable allocation of investment returns and losses between continuing members and departing members of the CSS. Currently, there is the potential for losses to be borne disproportionally by those members who stay in the CSS. My eye was caught by two items in particular in the Bills Digest. On page 7 the Bills Digest for this bill says:
Should the proposed changes allowing the declaration of negative crediting rates for the CSS not be passed it is unclear if the current wording of the 1976 Act will cover the new Exit Rate policy of allocating investment earnings and losses. This may have significant consequences for the equity with which the CSS investment earnings, and losses, are allocated in the coming years. The retirement savings of continuing CSS members may be significantly affected if the CSS experiences a large number of exits and also experiences significant investment losses at the same time.
I think that is as close as you will get to an endorsement from the independent library service that this bill is very much needed. The second item was in the concluding comments. Once again, I think this affirms the good policy that lies behind this bill. The Bills Digest also says:
If passed, the enduring legacy of this Bill is that the provisions of the SIS Act, relating to the fitness and propriety of superannuation trustees and licences will apply to the CSS and PSS boards. This brings the prudential supervision of these funds further into line with arrangements applying to other Australian superannuation funds and schemes.
That too endorses the policy of this bill. The Australian Democrats do support the bill. We think it is an appropriate bill for the needs. We note the remarks of Senator Stephens, representing the shadow minister. We think that the broad intent of Labor’s second reading amendment is such that it should be supported.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SUPERANNUATION SAFETY AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,25,1
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2006-09-07,"—I rise this afternoon to speak on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Superannuation Safety and Other Measures) Bill 2005. Unfortunately, unlike my two colleagues who spoke previously, my comments will not be brief. There is a very small section of this bill that impacts on a very small section of our population—in fact, on 12 or 13 people, to be precise, out of 20 million. The effect of this legislation on those 12 people has been somewhat devastating and disastrous. I think a large amount of time is warranted to actually lay out the facts about the fine print of this legislation and to uncover the devious nature of this government in that, when they are asked to do something for a small number of people, they turn their backs on them. I am quite surprised at the delay in bringing this bill before the Senate. We were expecting it months ago. We have had discussions with Senator Minchin’s office about the particular aspect that I am going to talk about. I am extremely disappointed that more effort has not been made to try to accommodate the needs of these 12 or so people.
This bill covers a number of elements to do with superannuation—we know that. But I specifically want to talk about the validation of certain lump sums. You will find it, in fact, in the back of the explanatory memorandum and in this bill almost in the very last lines of the last page. In fact, in the second reading speech given by the minister on tabling this bill, there is one sentence to do with it. He said:
The bill will also amend the Superannuation Act 1976 to authorize a small number of CSS benefit payments that were incorrectly paid.
Again, the opening paragraph simply makes a cursory remark about this. He said:
The bill ... authorises certain payments made incorrectly to a small number of CSS members.
We know that there are a small number of CSS members, but it actually took many months to discover how many members we were in fact talking about, the implication of this minor amendment in this omnibus legislation and the impact it was going to have on certain people. The section seems to be rather minimal. On the face of it, it simply seeks to ensure that the lump sum payments made under section 111A of the Superannuation Act 1976 are in fact valid. But for at least some members of the public this decision has been unfair and unjust, despite promises that something would be done to ensure that this dozen people would not be disadvantaged.
This sparked a discussion when it was discovered that perhaps some lump sum payments had been made incorrectly. This sudden adherence to a relevant legal opinion obtained by the Commonwealth Superannuation Board emanates from the application of the benefits payable under the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme. In particular, my encouragement, I suppose, to stand up today and talk about this at length is to do with a particular constituent of mine—a very eminent, well known and well respected educator in the Northern Territory who is in fact the principal of the local primary school that my kids have gone to at Leanyer. It has long been an established practice in the Northern Territory that, if you were employed by the Public Service Commissioner, you reached 55 or the five minutes to midnight and you were a permanent member of the teaching service, you could in fact retire, take your pension and lump sum payment under the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme and then continue your employment on contract—not with the Northern Territory Public Service as a permanent educator in the Northern Territory government but, rather, on contract employment with the Department of Employment, Education and Training.
I think that in fact signals some problem with the application of this legislation—whether or not a person who does that meets the condition of release. This government and, I think, the Commonwealth Superannuation Board would say that it does not meet the condition of release. No doubt the constituent I am talking about and the people who have gone before him believe they do. I have yet to see legal opinion that supports that stance one way or the other. But, if you are employed permanently by the Northern Territory Public Service Commissioner and you then retire and take up a senior executive contract signed between you and the secretary of the education department, I would have thought there was a change in your employment circumstances and you would meet the condition of release. So going from permanent to contract, being employed by the Northern Territory Public Service Commissioner as opposed to the education department, I would have thought would have been a large enough trigger for this government to say: ‘All right. We’re going to bring down the guillotine here in respect of a legal opinion we’ve had about previous lump sum payments but, because it’s going to affect just 12 others in this country, we’ll just move the goalposts a little bit.’ But, no, these people dug their heels in and, at worst, misled these people prior to the 2004 election—but I will get to that in a minute.
As I said, when people made this move, they would access their pension and their lump sum. In the case of the constituent I am referring to, a change in circumstance occurred in February 2001. That person chose not to be an ongoing active member of the scheme at that time; in fact, he deferred his benefit. Instead of deciding to action his benefit in 2001, he put it off until June 2004. We move ahead in time to June 2004, and my constituent decides to renew a contract—this is not the first contract but a renewal of a senior executive contract with the Northern Territory Department of Education and Training. In signing the second contract, he decides he will access his deferred benefit in June 2004. But, suddenly, the application is denied: ‘You can’t access your lump sum benefit.’ He says, ‘Why is that?’ We find out 150 colleagues before him have been able to do that. He is told that he actually has no entitlement.
On 24 June 2004, he signs a contract. On 25 June 2004, he applies for a benefit from the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme entitlement. On 28 June, he gets a letter saying he has got no entitlements; they are being disallowed. One would think that, if you applied for your deferred benefit and in the space of four days were told you could not have it, you could expect a comprehensive, reasonable explanation from either the minister’s office or the Commonwealth Superannuation Board about why that was the case. But, between this person and me, it took us months to get to the bottom of this story and finally, I might say, receive letters apologising for the incorrect information and misinformation that was given to this person.
In terms of a lump sum payment, we have got at risk nearly $192,000 for this person alone, and that has now increased. We see one line in a second reading speech or the fine print in an omnibus bill on superannuation and we give it some cursory sort of tick and flick in this place, but it impacts significantly on people’s lives. This is one case in particular that I wanted to highlight today. Numerous letters and questions have been generated that I think led to a gross lack of frankness by this government about the decision they took—an absolute lack of honesty and transparency. The constituent I am talking about—and I know this person does not mind if I use his name; I spoke to him two nights ago and he is happy for me to raise his case—Mr Gray, then says: ‘Why has the guillotine suddenly come down on me? What has happened? What is going on here?’
He seeks to get some answers but he does not get any answers. He is simply advised that suddenly the regulations have been interpreted in a different way. So he asks: ‘How have they been interpreted in a different way? What is different in that interpretation from what has previously been advised?’ There are no satisfactory answers. I have got a file full of correspondence that I have been cc-ed on between Mr Gray, Senator Minchin’s office and the Commonwealth Superannuation Board, who are all trying to find a reasonable explanation as to why suddenly 150 people are in and some people are out.
Remember this process all started in June 2004. The clock is ticking. We have a federal election on the horizon. Someone says: ‘Oh my God! Perhaps we’ve got a problem on our hands if we’re too honest with these people prior to a federal election.’ So Mr David Tollner, the member for Solomon, steps in—Mr David Tollner, who purports to be an expert on superannuation: fine on the big picture, sadly lacking on the detail when it comes to a very fine and well respected constituent of his seat of Solomon. Senator Minchin writes to Mr Gray and says:
Following representations from David Tollner on your behalf, I am pleased to confirm that a re-elected Coalition Government would conduct a review—
good one, you might say—
to examine the circumstances of CSS members such as yourself that have been unable to access their CSS benefit following a change in their employment conditions.’ So he does acknowledge there is a change in the employment conditions.
You might ask yourself: why doesn’t that satisfy the conditions of release—a little bit of inconsistency coming out here?
Such a review would encompass those members who had acted in good faith prior to the announcement of the change in ComSuper’s interpretation of this provision.
We come and go, the election is held and the coalition government is re-elected. We wait with bated breath for the ever-promised review. Does it happen? Yes, it happens all right. It happens internally. Do people like Mr Gray get asked about their view in this review? Not at all. In estimates of last year—so we are now 18 months down the track—I asked:
Who undertook that review?
Ms Doran from finance and admin says:
Members of my division.
Senator CROSSIN—How? By accessing single files? What was the nature of the review?
Ms Doran—They worked with ComSuper on the details of the types of individuals covered, looking at their circumstances and their relevance to both the SIS and the CSS legislation...
Senator CROSSIN—Were there some terms of reference for this review?
Ms Doran—Not in a formal sense.
                  …         …           …
Senator CROSSIN—So the review occurred by looking at individuals file by file and circumstance by circumstance.
                  …         …           …
Ms Doran—Not so much file by file, but based on their broad circumstances.
So, really, we have never got to the bottom of exactly what that review entailed. All I know is this: Mr Gray, it now transpires, is one of 12 or 13 people in this nation affected by this application. They were never written to about the review and were never ever asked for any input. I asked questions on notice about how and why this decision was made. I finally got an answer back in April 2005 that said:
No formal review has been undertaken.
A decision to simply bring down the guillotine was made when the Commonwealth Superannuation Board had a look at the circumstances after a concerned member had a query about superannuation entitlements where a Commonwealth agency may be sold.
The bottom line is this: the letter prior to the 2004 election was simply a letter to appease people like Mr Gray. There was never any intention to conduct any sort of genuine review. It was simply a letter in the name of Mr Tollner and the Minister for Finance and Administration to ensure that no such review would occur. The government had well and truly made up its mind in 2004 that those people who had accessed a benefit could keep it and that those people who had applied for a benefit, deferred a benefit or sought access to a benefit in a very small window of time would be totally cut out of the loop.
You have to ask yourself: why would the government do that for only a dozen people? The department tells us, ‘When you get a legal decision you get a legal decision.’ But the bill actually determines a date on which that decision will be applied. For the life of me, I still cannot get a reasonable explanation as to why those 12 people—who had applied, whose applications were in train but who had not yet received their benefit—are not included in this legislation.
To be fair to Senator Minchin, I got a letter back in May last year which said:
I intend to write to Mr Gray as soon as I am informed of my Department’s findings.
My understanding is that that never occurred. The letter also stated that I would be provided with a copy of the minister’s letter; I have not received any letter in respect of or further to that review either. You have to ask yourself why it is that the government would not assist those 12 members to access their deferred benefits. Was the promised review an election stunt to appease them, so that they would be led to believe the whole time that they were going to be assisted and helped to get their deferred benefits? So far there has been a shallow response—little action and no depth.
And then Mr Gray got a letter from CSS in November 2004. Interestingly enough, this letter makes some apologies for the misinformation. What does it say? Interestingly enough, it goes to the fact that the regulations had not been interpreted differently. It goes on to say that in fact the CSS had obtained a different and new legal opinion that meant that the application of the deferred benefit meant that people who had received it previously had done so illegally. The question is: why has it taken 18 months to get some truth out of the CSS board? Why has it taken 18 months to get some truth out of the minister’s office? Why has it taken 18 months for people like Mr Gray to get some satisfaction on their queries about the answers given as to why they have not been able to access their lump sum payments?
After assisting Mr Gray and digging around on this, I have simply come to conclusions about a number of things. There was never any real intention to have any kind of genuine review. Once the decision was made, in June 2004, that was it. People like Mr Gray have been seriously misled. There were high expectations and an anticipation that this matter would be resolved but, all along, the government had no intention of doing that. The government was not instructed by this minister to assist the Commonwealth superannuation people to go out of their way. There was no genuine attempt to put pressure on the CSS to try and get the matter resolved.
We now find, after many months, that people have been able to access their pension entitlement under the deferred scheme and that their lump sums have now been rolled over into another scheme. That was Senator Minchin’s answer for the 12 people late last year and early this year. But that is not what some of them wanted. Some of them wanted to be able to access their lump sum payment. It is a second-rate response to assisting those people, to go ahead and say to them, ‘You can draw down your pension from your entitlement but you have to still roll your lump sum into another scheme.’ Mr Gray received a letter from Senator Minchin on 1 June 2005. It said:
… when you applied to commence taking your benefit in June 2004, a few weeks after the error was discovered, the CSS Board and ComSuper were under a legal obligation to not pay your benefit.
                  …         …           …
My department has concluded that, even allowing for the initial error that has affected a number of CSS members, ComSuper could have handled your situation with more clarity—
an admission, at least—
particularly in relation to the two issues outlined above.
Senator Minchin goes on to say:
You are right to be upset at the way you have been treated and, notwithstanding the complexity of the circumstances, I appreciate your frustration at the lack of a clear explanation of your overall position.
Finally there was at least some acceptance of Mr Gray’s anticipation and frustration, and the lack of action on the part of the minister’s office was acknowledged. But that letter is dated June 2005. It was ‘timely’ because it was some seven months after the federal election. I have come to the conclusion that the promise of a review and the creation of anticipation that the matter would be resolved were, taken together, nothing more than an election stunt to protect Mr Tollner and ensure his re-election. This is a man who is fine on the superannuation big picture but who let down a constituent. Mr Tollner was the man most able to support and get a resolution for Mr Gray, and he has sadly failed in that.
Debate interrupted.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SUPERANNUATION SAFETY AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,25,1
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2006-09-07,"—The International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2006 is essentially driven by the need to change Australian tax law to facilitate the pursuit of non-residents living in Australia who have foreign tax liabilities. The government is seeking to aggressively align the Australian international taxation system with the OECD model tax convention. Article 27 of this convention provides for mutual assistance in the collection of tax debts. Under many of Australia’s tax treaties there are reciprocal obligations to take measures to pursue persons who have tax debts in one of those jurisdictions. This usually requires a change in the enforcement and investigation powers in each hosted jurisdiction.
There are a number of Australian residents with foreign tax liabilities. According to advice from Senator Kirk, who we know is a constitutional lawyer of great repute, the current statute law does not permit the commissioner to seek to retrieve these funds directly. In order to pursue the matter, the commissioner would need to take Commonwealth action on a case-by-case basis.
Schedule 1 allows the commissioner to create a register of taxpayers with foreign country tax debts and apply the tax collection conditions operative under Australian tax statutes. Provisions are also included to allow conversion of payments in foreign currency from foreign governments to repay Australian tax debts under the reciprocal arrangements of the OECD tax treaty system. Schedule 2 gives the commission information-gathering power for overseas tax debts. This follows measures in schedule 1 and permits exchange of information between nations otherwise captured by tax secrecy laws.
The schedule on the protocol with New Zealand aligns the Australia-New Zealand tax protocol with the OECD model tax treaty, clarifies where information can be exchanged and modifies the agreement to provide for enforcement action by officials on behalf of the other country. There is also a most favoured nation clause, which ensures Australia benefits from the reduction that New Zealand makes under treaties with other nations.
Labor supports these measures, as it is generally committed to the adoption of the OECD model tax treaty. In particular, there is no reason why Australian tax authorities should not cooperate with countries in the pursuit of tax debts if a satisfactory double tax treaty is in place.
I now take this opportunity to make some comments in relation to international taxation. Labor is listening to representations that have been received in the area of international tax. Particular concerns have been raised by Australian fund managers on this issue. Australia currently levies a rate of 30 per cent on income and foreigners earning dividend income in Australia. That is, if an overseas resident places money with an Australian managed fund to invest on their behalf they will pay 30 per cent withholding tax on the earnings as they are paid out. The industry argues that there are benefits to be gained, both to the industry and to the economy as a whole, from a reduction in the withholding tax to a more competitive rate.
Some sections of the Australian business community have called for imputation credits on foreign shares. In other words, if an instruction investor or company invests in a foreign company then this investor should obtain an imputation credit for company tax paid in the other jurisdiction, but this would be paid by the Australian government.
Labor is looking at all options at this stage. Still, there are some cautionary points to be made. Firstly, imputation credits on foreign shares is a very expensive measure. Secondly, it needs to be asked why Australian taxpayers should be responsible for paying imputation credits when the company tax has not been received by the Australian government.
In relation to the issue of dividend withholding tax, there is a benefit of having parity between the company tax rate and the dividend withholding tax rate. This would mean that the tax rate a foreign investor paid on dividends invested here was less than the tax paid by an Australian investor on Australian shares. This would, therefore, place Australian investors at a relative disadvantage. Some of these issues need to be considered very closely. Labor will follow the implementation of this legislation with great interest.",SENATE,<title>INTERNATIONAL TAX AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,26,1

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-09-07,"—The purpose of the Tax Laws Amendment (Repeal of Inoperative Provisions) Bill 2006 is to repeal substantial amounts of inoperative tax law, including 2,600 pages of income tax law and 1,500 pages of other tax related acts. As you are probably aware, Mr Acting Deputy President, over the last 10 years plus I have had the somewhat dubious distinction of having to deal with virtually every single tax bill that has come through the Senate chamber, bar a couple of minor ones. Over recent years I have made it a practice to continually make the point as to how many more pages we were adding with a particular bill that was before us. I was pleased to see that the international tax law bill we dealt with earlier was quite thin. Here we have nearly 200 pages of additional legislation to get rid of 2,600 pages. It shows what a very difficult task this is.
The bill is arranged into six schedules. Schedule 1 repeals inoperative provisions in the tax laws. Inoperative provisions are those that no longer apply to taxpayers. Schedule 2 contains consequential amendments to various pieces of Commonwealth legislation, which are required because of the effects of schedule 1. Schedule 3 repeals provisions in income tax laws which have been identified as becoming inoperative in the immediate future. So it is a prospective schedule.
Schedule 4 makes consequential amendments arising from the operation of schedule 3. Schedule 5 contains two parts. The first part repeals 68 tax law acts that have been identified as inoperative. The second part makes consequential amendments to 30 acts required because of the schedule 5 part 1 repeals. Schedule 6 is divided into three parts. Part 1 provides for the application of the amendments made by schedules 1 to 5, part 2 has a general savings provision, and part 3 has other saving provisions and transitional arrangements. These provisions are designed to preserve powers, duties, rights and obligations in relation to the time before the repeal or amendment.
I particularly wanted to talk to this bill, even though it is in the non-controversial section, because I think it is a good time to congratulate those people—those bureaucrats—responsible for identifying the inoperative provisions and acts. It can be hard enough to work out which provisions are operative, let alone which are inoperative. It is an extremely difficult task at the best of times, even for those who may be considered tax professionals, and those involved are to be commended for their efforts. I wish to offer those congratulations in person to the officers here and to the officers listening.
Identifying the inoperative provisions is a critical first step in simplifying tax laws, and the difficulty involved in that task alone should not be overlooked, ignored or forgotten. Australia has an extremely complex set of tax laws. Although the 1936 Income Tax Assessment Act, when enacted, was only 120 pages, by 2006 the combined length of the 1936 and 1997 statutes was more than 8,000 pages long. As Mr Gary Banks—who has been around forever it seems; he is the chairman of the Productivity Commission—noted in an address to the Conference of Economists Business Symposium in 2003:
Were the rate of this growth to continue unabated, I am informed by the end of this century the paper version of the Tax Act would amount to 830 billion pages ... would take over 3 million years of continuous reading to assimilate and weigh the equivalent of around 20 aircraft carriers!
Although it is extremely unlikely that the growth of the Tax Act will continue on such an expansionary trajectory—it is unlikely, isn’t it?—it nonetheless highlights the facts that Australia has experienced a massive growth in the size of its tax laws since their inception and that it is increasingly important that attention be given to their simplification and reduction.
Recently, the Taxation Institute of Australia commissioned John Taylor, associate professor at the School of Business Law and Taxation at the University of New South Wales, to prepare a report on the compliance and complexity element of Australia’s tax laws. That, by the way, is a matter that is also before the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, on which I sit—and I am part of that inquiry. The result was Beyond 4100: A report on measures to combat rising compliance costs through reducing tax law complexity. In that report it was noted:
In 2006 the Income Tax, Fringe Benefits Tax, Goods and Service Tax and International Agreements and Superannuation legislation (in some bindings) are published in five volumes that comprise one of, if not the largest, set of tax statutes in the world.
Tax law is an area of law which is inescapable for most law-abiding citizens, and has become an integral part of a modern and civil society. However, as anyone who has ever worked with, or tried to work with, the tax laws knows, it is a very difficult system to navigate through, and cumbersome to use. It is particularly difficult when you are dealing with legislation in this chamber because there is no way you can have the Tax Act with you to refer to and correlate with. The consequence—and it is a dangerous consequence—is that senators are often required to take on trust what is before them because they are simply not equipped to cross-reference and cross-cover the matters. So the need for simplification is essential and obvious to those who care to look.
A simpler system will result in a system that is easier to use and understand. This will be of particular use to small business who cannot always afford professional tax advice, as well as those in the tax profession who must work with the tax laws on a daily basis. Even the student at university—I have been known to employ a few—will benefit from a simpler set of tax laws when they are required to study it because of their university course.
The explanatory memorandum to the Tax Laws Amendment (Repeal of Inoperative Provisions) Bill 2006 contends:
The measures will reduce compliance costs for tax practitioners, and provide material benefits to practitioners and taxpayers who read, interpret and apply the tax laws.
That is a big claim and I hope it is a good claim. I am inclined to believe it. This conclusion is consistent with another of Associate Professor Taylor’s findings in Beyond 4100:
Empirical evidence suggests that, for individuals, the sheer size of the statute increases both the cost of compliance and the likelihood of non-compliance. Company tax has been found to have still higher compliance costs both in absolute terms and as a percentage of revenue collected.
While any effort to reduce compliance costs—and complexity—should be viewed in a positive light, it seems that there has yet to be any work done on forecasting or predicting the magnitude of the expected reduction in compliance costs. I do not expect such work to be done, because I think it would be almost impossible to do.
PricewaterhouseCoopers, a leading global accounting and consulting firm, are of the opinion, and argue, that while it is true that Australia is:
... notorious amongst OECD countries for the complex drafting and detail of its income tax laws ... the changes will do little to reduce tax compliance costs.
I was disappointed to note that remark. It is in complete contradiction to my own instincts and to that part of the explanatory memorandum which I just quoted.
Fundamentally, what Australia’s tax laws need is not only a revision of their operative and inoperative provisions but also a change in the way in which provisions are drafted. There needs to be a change in mentality from drafting highly complex and particular provisions to those which express and encapsulate overarching policy objectives and themes. This is a view which is also put forward by Associate Professor Taylor in Beyond 4100.

I commend to the tax office and the Treasury some of the remarks that have already made in the Hansard record of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit in its inquiry on tax with respect to the desirability of more draft exposure legislation in tax. Of course, I am commending it to you because I made those remarks myself, but nevertheless I think they have virtue and I ask the tax office and the departments to have a look at them.
Simplicity, along with equity and efficiency, is often considered to be one of the characteristics of a good tax system. At present Australia has a system that is far from simple. The Tax Laws Amendment (Repeal of Inoperative Provisions) Bill 2006 is an important and essential step in any greater efforts to change our tax law system and should be regarded as a positive step in the right direction. However, it is only part of the solution. I urge that the government build on this solid foundation and continue in its efforts to simplify Australia’s tax laws. As the Australian Democrats have long advocated a tax system that is fair, progressive, simple, transparent, effective and flexible and that has ease of compliance and encourages civic responsibility, we obviously welcome this bill and its entry into the Senate. Further, as this bill has the end goal of simplifying Australia’s tax laws, I am obviously of the view that we should support this bill, and we do support this bill.
In conclusion, I have noted some remarks elsewhere concerning this bill of a somewhat mean nature, I thought. Personally I think the Treasurer is to be congratulated on this initiative because I think getting rid of a substantial swathe of tax laws is an achievement on its own.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (REPEAL OF INOPERATIVE PROVISIONS) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,27,1
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2006-09-07,"—In noting Senator Murray’s contribution to this debate, I have to say that we in the Senate Economics Committee rely heavily on the fact that he has been representing and interpreting tax bills in this place for a decade or more, and that corporate knowledge is something that guides us in our deliberations about the legislation.
—Probably why it’s such a mess!
—I hardly think so. While Senator Murray commented about the extent of our current tax legislation, the fact that we are here debating the repeal of inoperative provisions is testament to the fact that we have one of the most complex taxation systems in the world, and something desperately needs to be done about it. In fact, what we believe is that in reality the Tax Laws Amendment (Repeal of Inoperative Provisions) Bill 2006 is an admission of enormous failure by the government when it comes to taxation legislation. Since the Howard government came to office the tax act has actually expanded by some 10,000 pages, and this has made the system much more complex and more confusing for taxpayers and has increased business costs.
In desperation the government asked the Board of Taxation in 2003 to identify inoperative provisions of the tax act. The board reported to the Treasurer in October 2005, identifying some 1,900 redundant pages of legislation. We need to be very clear about this legislation that is before us today: this is just taking away provisions that do not apply. It does not consider provisions that do not work well or are not used but provisions that have no legal effect. The Board of Taxation found 1,900 of these pages—an enormous number. It was a massive admission that 20 per cent of the tax act in Australia was of no legal effect, which is quite a scandalous record in tax legislation.
But then Treasury added a number of redundant sales tax acts to the list, leading to a reduction of some 4,100. That is not 4,100 pages reduced in the income tax acts at all, so the kinds of claims that are being made about the legislation and what it is going to achieve for us are quite complicated and a bit disingenuous. Major commercial publishers have agreed to print an archived volume of repealed provisions, so even these repealed provisions will not actually disappear from the shelves of tax practitioners. In addition, savings provisions come into operation by virtue of the Acts Interpretation Act. A repeal does not affect the operation of the act while it was in force. So the claim that 4,100 pages have been cut from the tax act is in fact quite an exaggeration.
However, the major problem is that repealing redundant provisions does not actually reduce the complexity of the act. The complexity in the operation of the tax system is naturally driven by the provisions that are operative. So in repealing the inoperative provisions the Treasurer, Mr Costello, is simply sanding back some of the rough edges of the structure. He is not reforming its fundamental shape.
The economic benefits from this measure are not significant, whereas real reductions in the compliance costs of tax for small business would enhance returns, economic growth, employment and tax revenue and would also lead to lower prices in a more competitive market. So in fact this bill is a missed opportunity for the Howard government. Although Labor welcomes the bill, we are calling on the government to actually do something that makes the operative provisions of the act work better. This, we believe, is just a half-baked effort. It does not go far enough.
Importantly, though, it should be noted that in some cases in this bill the government is not purely repealing provisions but also changing the law in only small ways. In the previous debate, we heard what the effect of a small change to an act can be and how it can have quite significant impacts on small sectors of the community. The best example is the change to section 26(e), assessable income of goods in kind. This has been rewritten and the operation of the act changed in a minor way. The point is that this bill is really mistitled. When savings provisions and rewrites are considered, the bill involves much more than the repeal of inoperative provisions.
As I say, the best example in this legislation is section 26(e). This makes goods received in kind assessable income, but it is never used due to the operation of the fringe benefits tax regime. What should really happen is that the 26(e) regime should be repealed and consequential amendments made to the fringe benefits tax laws. But the government has not done this; it has just rewritten 26(e). It is not much of a rewrite at all, actually. In fact, it certainly does not reduce the act at all. Again, it is an example of another wasted opportunity.
I would like to make some comments now about the Taxation Institute of Australia’s report, provocatively entitled Beyond 4100. The contents certainly justified the title, as the report indicates a range of areas in which real reform of income tax law can proceed. The Beyond 4100 proposals are about substantive tax reform, in contrast to which the current bill appears rather cosmetic. Some of the recommendations of the Beyond 4100 report are more easily accepted than others. Still, the most conservative and uncontroversial recommendations request that provisions that are either almost never used and cannot be enforced should be repealed or redrafted. Labor thinks the report is an excellent contribution to the debate and now formally indicates its support for some of the less controversial and more easily implemented elements of the report.
I move the second reading amendment standing in my name:

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2006-09-07,"—I think all senators and all Australians would welcome any attempt to simplify the tax laws. I listened with interest to Senator Murray’s very learned contribution to the debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (Repeal of Inoperative Provisions) Bill 2006 and I have to say that I agree with almost everything he said, and I think most would agree.
This is an attempt by this government to in a small way simplify the tax laws, but I think it is a little rich of the Labor Party to be moving second reading amendments to call, as I understand it, for more simplification when one might recall that, since we have been in government, the Labor Party has been a cause for proliferation of complex tax legislation. I need only to go back to the GST debate to indicate that a simple taxing arrangement under the goods and services tax was knocked off by the combination of the Labor Party and the Democrats. I concede that the Democrats allowed the principles of the bill to come in, but in doing so the government had to allow for a lot of exemptions from the simple scheme, which made that piece of legislation far more complex than it needed to be. It is no use rehashing that debate at the moment, but suffice it to say that, had the Labor Party supported that simple taxing measure in those days, at least one piece of legislation would have been simple. Even in those days the Labor Party—
—Simpler, I would say.
—It could have been much simpler, Senator Murray, had it not been for your amendments—which, as I say, I acknowledge were gratefully received at the time, because we were able to discharge the promise we made to the Australian people to bring in a goods and services tax. Unfortunately, we were not able to discharge all of the promise to bring in a simple system of goods and services tax, and it has turned out to be quite complex, as you rightly confess to, through your involvement. As I say, it is no use rehashing that now, but I was always of the view that the concerns you and your party and many of us had about increasing costs to various elements of society could have been better addressed in a way other than interfering with a taxing bill. Having said that, the calls that both the previous speakers now make for simplification have a touch of irony in them in that both those parties have been the cause in one bill—not this bill we are dealing with—of making tax laws far more complex than they needed to be.
There are, of course, simple ways to fix the complexity of tax. At various times people have called upon the abolition of income tax across the board—not that I am particularly advocating that today, but I do think governments should be working towards a system where tax is paid and tax returns lodged only for those above a certain limit. I will not even attempt to guess what the limit should be. The tax laws become very complex because of exemptions and concessions that governments make. If there were a simpler way of addressing the underlying principle of taxation so that you did not need to allow all the complex concessions and allowances, that would be a goer well worth attempting to achieve. But I think there is merit, particularly as far as ordinary taxpayers are concerned, to look towards a system where most Australians would not have to lodge income tax returns at all. There are other ways of raising tax. Perhaps if we had not been so generous to the Labor states and given all the GST money to the states we could have had substantial concessions in the tax we collect under the income tax and associated acts. The states, particularly my state of Queensland, are rolling in money as a result of the GST. They never concede that, but the facts speak for themselves. Queensland has done exceptionally well.
Many people still think that the GST is a tax that the Commonwealth collects and keeps. Of course, it does not keep it. It all goes to the states—all of which, regrettably, are Labor states; all of which are or should be rolling in money. But, in my own state of Queensland, they cannot keep the health system operable, they cannot keep police on the beats and they cannot do anything about the desperately needed infrastructure, particularly in south-east Queensland. One would have hoped, with all of the GST tax revenue that Queensland has received, that the state Labor government might have been able to do that. Unfortunately, as with all Labor governments, mismanagement of financial matters, increases in the number of public servants, increases in bureaucracy and putting mates into the Public Service—it has become quite politicised in Queensland at the moment very regrettably—are the sorts of things that happen when you trust Labor governments with big licks of money. Unfortunately, in those days we were desperate to get the GST legislation through and needed the states onside, but in retrospect perhaps we should have imposed more conditions on them. Perhaps we should have called for accountability in the way that they spent the money because, looking from this chamber at all of the states, particularly my own state of Queensland, the lack of accountability for the spending is something that is almost criminal.
I want to use the opportunity of this debate to raise the issue of the zone tax scheme. Perhaps, tongue-in-cheek, I could suggest that this bill could have been extended to remove from the income tax acts all reference to the zone tax scheme—that is, abolishing it. I say that tongue-in-cheek because the effect of the zone tax scheme as it was introduced in 1945 is no longer with us. In 1945 the scheme was introduced to provide special income tax concessions for people residing in certain remote zones of Australia. The ATO website actually says that it was introduced in recognition of the disadvantages that taxpayers are subject to because of the uncongenial climatic conditions, isolation and high costs of living in comparison to other areas of Australia. That applied in 1945. It applies equally today but perhaps not with the boundaries as they were in 1945.
For example, I live in Ayr, in coastal North Queensland about an hour south of Townsville, and I still get a zone tax allowance. I think it is $54. I do not consider that where I live has uncongenial climatic conditions, that it is isolated or that the costs of living are all that much higher than they are in the capital cities. They are higher, but not all that much higher. So perhaps places such as where I live do not deserve that $52 to $54 allowance—it is some figure in that order. I suspect if it were taken away, few taxpayers would even notice it. In discussions I have had with the Treasurer, he rightly says that if you take away any sort of concession that anyone gets, it has unfortunate consequences. I do not know that I agree with him and I might say that this issue of zone tax is, I suspect, the only area where I disagree with the Treasurer, who is quite clearly an exceptional Australian and an exceptional Treasurer. As I say, quite clearly Australia’s best Treasurer ever—

Senator Webber interjecting—

—and a guy who has done a fantastic job.
 (Senator Ferguson)—Senator Webber, you have been running a continuous commentary which is quite audible. I would ask you to please remain silent while Senator Macdonald is speaking.
—Regrettably, Mr Acting Deputy President, I have not heard the running commentary.
—Regrettably, I have.
—I can guess that it is saying, ‘Good on you; good point. I agree that Mr Costello is the best Treasurer ever.’

Senator Webber interjecting—

—It is a pity I have not heard the commentary, because I am quite sure that the senators opposite would be agreeing 100 per cent with everything I have said, including my praise of the best Treasurer Australia has ever seen. But, in the area of zone tax, I do think that further investigation is needed.
There are parts of my state of Queensland and other parts of Australia where a zone tax rebate is needed because the conditions in those areas, the isolation and the extremely high cost of living do deserve and need, in my view, assistance from the government. I think it is essential that today we revisit the 1945 zone tax rebate scheme and reimplement the principles that were so prominent there in legislation. In 1945, when that scheme was first introduced, the basic wage was about $7.38 per week, in today’s monetary system. The zone allowance in those days was $80 a year in current currency. So that is about 10 times the average weekly wage. Today the average weekly wage is about $700 a week, but the zone allowance for the year in remote areas is $338 per year, about half the average wage. If the relativity were maintained today, as it was originally, at 10 times the average wage the rebate would be something like $7,000 per year instead of $338 per year.
There is the huge and critical difficulty that country people have in getting access to health professionals, indeed professionals of all types—not only professionals but tradespeople as well. There is an extra cost; there is an inconvenience of living in some of the remote parts. For example, you cannot slip down to the next suburb to go to a concert; you cannot slip down the road and see a major sporting event. You certainly cannot go down to the end of your street and see a doctor. If you want to access a lawyer in some of these remote places, you have to travel for a minimum of six, seven or eight hours.
There are inconveniences and high costs of living in parts of country Australia and they do engender and promote two different classes of Australians: those who live in the capital cities and have all of the resources and lifestyle attributes there, and those who live in the more remote parts who can barely get access to the most necessary support—that is, in the health area. It is worst in Queensland because the current government is very much a south-east Queensland government. They look after the south-east and all of their focus is on it. They built a footbridge across the Brisbane River so that the good citizens of Brisbane—which is part of my electorate, I might add—could have a nice walk across the river. That bridge cost an enormous amount of money, whereas hospitals up in the north-west—even hospitals in Townsville, which is a major provincial city—are suffering for lack of money. Yet the current Labor government just spends money on the high-profile, feelgood things like the new sporting stadium in Queensland that gave Mr Beattie the opportunity of, yet again, smiling and grinning and telling everyone how good he is and how he looks after them. He is only interested in that area of the state because, of course, that is where all the voters are. He does not worry about those of us in the north or the west—out of sight, out of mind. Even if they all vote against him, it is not going to make any difference to the huge majority he has in parliament.
But I digress. I want to return to the issue of the zone tax rebate. I was told in my discussions with the Treasurer that there are suggestions that having a different rate of tax for different Australians could be unconstitutional. That may be the technical legal view from some of the QCs or very learned legal people in the Attorney-General’s office, but it is not one that I would suggest, from my very limited understanding of law, would hold water. One very strong reason I have for saying that is that it has been in place now for more than 60 years and no-one has challenged it yet, so I do not think suggesting that we should not look at it on the basis that it might be seen to be unconstitutional is a relevant response.
There should be ways that we can assist those who live in the more remote areas and this zone tax rebate scheme, when it was first introduced, was a great way of doing that. It has been sort of added to over the years, but it has not kept pace with inflation and now does not have anywhere near the impact that it had when it was first introduced and that it was intended to have. I suggest, tongue-in-cheek, that this bill could perhaps be added to by removing all reference to the zone tax rebate scheme because, quite frankly, it is now hardly worth the paper it is written on. But, rather than remove it, I would suggest that the Treasury should be looking at some way to bring it back to the principles that were so very obvious when it was first introduced and are so very obvious now. Any legislation that starts or continues the process of attempting simplification is one that we should support and I certainly commend the bill to the Senate.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2006-09-07,"—It gives me a great deal of satisfaction to see the amendments in the Privacy Legislation Amendment Bill 2006 before the parliament today. One aspect of the legislation before us is the issue of, finally, protecting in law genetic information. I have previously apologised in debates such as this for sounding like a broken record, but I have long campaigned for the protection of genetic information in law and to ensure that at some stage we outlaw discrimination on the basis of people’s genetic information.
In the debate on the original legislation, or the legislation that extended the Privacy Act to the private sector, I moved comparable amendments to these amendments in an attempt to protect genetic privacy. As I recall, on that occasion the Australian Labor Party supported those amendments but unfortunately they were rejected by the House of Representatives and, when they came back to the Senate, the Labor Party folded on those particular amendments. So it has taken a long time to get these protections in law, but I congratulate the government on finally acting.
The most recent impetus for these amendments has been the groundbreaking, comprehensive and world-class work that has been done by the Australian Law Reform Commission, specifically their report Essentially Yours: The Protection of Human Genetic Information in Australia. This examined the protection of genetic information in Australia. That report, No. 96, actually reported in March 2003. It has been a long process to see some of those recommendations find their way into legislation. I introduced a private member’s bill in 1998, which seems a rather long time ago now—the Genetic Privacy and Non-discrimination Bill 1998—in an attempt to deal with the issue of genetic privacy and opposition to and prohibition of genetic discrimination. At that time, as I recall, we did not actually have documented cases of discrimination on the basis of people’s genetic information. That is no longer the case. There are well-documented cases in Australia where people have been discriminated against—whether it is for employment purposes, insurance purposes or others—based on their genetic information. I wonder how different things might have been had we actually introduced legislation—whether it was as a stand-alone model, as the one that I proposed, or amendments to various aspects of current law, an approach that is preferred by the ALRC. I wonder if things would have been different. So this may be eight years too late, but it is better late than never. I am glad to see that Australia will protect on a Commonwealth level people’s genetic information.
There is more to this legislation. I have agreed with the government to this legislation being debated in this non-controversial timeslot not only in order to facilitate debate but also because of my sheer desperation to ensure that the genetic privacy amendments are not held up. I want to place on record very strongly on behalf of the Democrats that we do have concerns with and indeed opposition to schedule 1. I will not be moving an amendment to that effect, but, in fact, calling on the government to consider some proposals. In relation to this bill generally, it ensures that medical practitioners can continue to access relevant health information available through the PSIS without breaching the underlying foundations of the national privacy principles. Obviously it ensures that genetic information is covered by the national privacy principles and provides for health professionals to disclose genetic information to genetic relatives where there is a serious risk to the genetic relative.
The amendments that I feel strongly about, primarily covered under schedule 2, are those recommendations by the ALRC in relation to genetic information—that is, ensuring that the definition of health information and sensitive information expressly includes human genetic information about an individual. Another recommendation is to permit a healthcare professional to disclose genetic information about their patient to a genetic relative of that patient where disclosure is necessary to prevent a serious health threat to an individual. I am not suggesting that that has ever been anything but quite a complex debate, but certainly I acknowledge and agree with that recommendation. That is under schedule 2 of the bill. I note for the record that there are around 140 recommendations contained in that ALRC report. I know that the government has put on record that it will not be supporting some of them and that it needs more time to examine a number of them. I thought the government’s response to the report could have been more comprehensive. Nonetheless I do put on record that there are a number of recommendations still to be considered, implemented or enshrined in law in some way. I strongly recommend that the government reconsider a number of those recommendations. I will not address those in detail today.
I want to talk about the first schedule in this legislation and some of the concerns that the Democrats have. I understand that those concerns are not necessarily shared by other parties in the chamber and that is why I am not going to bring this to a vote and am thus dealing with it in a non-controversial way. The amendments to schedule 1 not only remove the need for an explicit balancing of privacy and other interests by the Privacy Commissioner through the public interest determination, the PID, process under the Privacy Act but also, by allowing for the collection of sensitive health information without consent wherever authorised by or under the law, mean that the opportunity for consideration of the balance in specific circumstances is lost. The amendments provide for the Prescription Shopping Information Service, the PSIS. They actually go further. I believe that they actually reduce the protection of sensitive health information in the private sector. So some of those key strengthened provisions, the provisions that were introduced when the legislation was extended to the private sector, are actually being undermined. You no longer require consent in those cases. I think it will be much more difficult to identify legislative provisions which may later be used as the basis for the collection of any sensitive health information without consent. I am not sure if the government are going to comment on those issues today. I am quite happy to put on notice to the government whether or not they would consider a backup amendment, if you like.
I know that there was an approach put forward by the Australian Privacy Foundation. They have argued, and I quote:
It would be much more difficult if not impossible to identify in advance legislative provisions or other authorities which may later be relied on as the basis for the collection of sensitive health information without consent.
The fact that the consent test will only remain for health information that is used outside health care seems entirely unjustified considering the test was considered good enough for health care in 2000. I guess I would like to know from the government: what exactly has changed? How is this being justified by the government? I am happy to treat that as a question on notice, for obvious reasons. The preferable approach that was put forward by the Australian Privacy Foundation—and I understand that this is a document that the Attorney-General’s Department have in relation to this legislation—was, and I quote:
We believe that a preferable approach that correctly balances privacy and other interests is to leave national privacy principle 10.2 unchanged and instead to legislate a requirement for the relevant approved suppliers to collect information where appropriate from the PSIS. This would put the PSIS on a proper legislative footing and also give the opportunity for conditions and other safeguards such as regular reporting, auditing et cetera.
They go on:
We consider it important to bear in mind that prescription information can be highly sensitive and the PSIS can potentially be used not just by the 11,000-plus registered medical practitioner prescribers but also by an unqualified number of pharmacists in a wide range of healthcare and welfare professions and other organisations.
The privacy implications of that schedule are concerning for the Australian Democrats.
I have a couple of amendments that are, I am sure, unsurprising to those in the chamber. They deal with the exemptions that are currently provided for in the legislation—exemptions that the Democrats have railed against before and have attempted to amend in the past. Indeed, in at least one case, we have a private member’s bill that deals with that. The first one relates to the exemption for, essentially, political acts and practices or political parties. I think it is high time that we ensure that any privacy legislation that applies to most businesses and other organisations in Australia, private and public sector, should also apply to us. I know that there will always be arguments that some professions have special circumstances, but I have yet to be convinced that we, as members of parliament or members of a political party—or even candidates, if we are talking about more recent privacy legislation—somehow deserve an exemption. People should be able to expect that their information is subject to the same privacy principles that it would be if treated by a business, a service or any other organisation.
So I will seek to remove that exemption again. I do not expect that will be successful, but it is important to maintain opposition to the exemption when I get the opportunity with privacy legislation. It is an absolute hypocrisy that we are exempt from the privacy laws that we expect everyone else to adhere to. Indeed, there is a small business exemption. This debate has been had a number of times in the parliament. I know this concern is shared by a number of other individuals and certainly political parties, but an attempt to remove that exemption is before you today as well. The other amendments, as outlined, are consequential.
As indicated, despite my concerns and the concerns of others, including the Australian Privacy Foundation, I will not be opposing schedule 1—but I do put on record that the Democrats do not support that schedule. The amendments that enshrine the ALRC recommendations in relation to genetic privacy in law are welcome and long overdue, but I feel a real sense of satisfaction today: it may have taken eight years, but this issue is a serious one. We now have to take the next step: to examine the issue of discrimination on the basis of genetic information.
It is one thing to protect it, ensure that it is made private and recognise that it is different from other health or sensitive information, but now we need to ensure that people are not discriminated against on the basis of their genetic information. We understand just how special that type of information is, the fact that it is different from health information in a general sense, the fact that it can be predictive and the fact that there are familial implications in terms of your genetic information, your data and how that can be used, and indeed used against, you. I urge the government to make that the next area for examination and, indeed, for action. I commend the amendments in my name, which I will be happy to move in the committee stage of this bill.",SENATE,<title>PRIVACY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,28,1
"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2006-09-07,"—I wanted to use this opportunity, when the issue of private health information comes up in the Privacy Legislation Amendment Bill 2006, to talk about an experience of mine which I think illustrates the importance of having provision for privacy. I was applying for personal income insurance in case of disability through my superannuation provider, AGEST—Australian Government Employees Superannuation Trust—and was required to get medical information to support that insurance. I went to my general practitioner, had quite a comprehensive blood test and an assurance from her that I was quite a healthy person, and I sent that off to AGEST. AGEST then came back to me and said that they wanted a full medical examination beyond the blood test.
When I got the details of that examination, I found that it asked for extremely detailed information. I have to say that the blood test included not only the usual iron levels, cholesterol and that kind of thing but I also had to have an AIDS test and a hepatitis test and be cleared on those things. That was all sent in. The further medical information I was asked to provide included information on whether I had ever been a prostitute and whether I had engaged in anal sex. It asked me the medical history of my family. It asked for complete doctors’ accounts of any illness that I had had in my entire life and of any illnesses in my family that might affect my health.
When I looked further at this medical information, I discovered that AGEST were outsourcing assessment of my insurance to the Commonwealth Bank. When I read the privacy information on that medical information, I discovered that the Commonwealth Bank were able to give that to their legal or financial counsel or anyone that they outsourced any of these activities to. So I discovered that, rather than dealing with my superannuation provider, AGEST, with whom I had a financial relationship, I was then dealing with an outsourced agency of the Commonwealth Bank. Suddenly that very detailed private information widens out to a huge level of people.
I thought I would rather not make three or four more visits to the doctor to get all this information and provide information that, given the detailed nature of the form, is probably incomplete and that my insurance would be refused in any case. So I wrote to AGEST stating that I wanted to withdraw my application for personal income insurance. I had not realised that my personal information could possibly be disseminated quite so widely through not only AGEST but also the entire Commonwealth Bank and anyone who was contracted by the Commonwealth Bank. I believe I wrote that letter approximately five or six weeks ago. I had no response. I went through the usual call centre process, where I was unable to talk to anyone actually in AGEST about the situation. I had asked for my application to be withdrawn and for my medical records to be sent back to my doctor and for any copies to be destroyed.
When I finally got through to someone in the call centre at AGEST, I was told that all that information had already gone to the Commonwealth Bank and that they were waiting on a reply. I asked if I could speak to someone in the Commonwealth Bank to ensure that I got my information back and was given a call centre number for the Commonwealth Bank and told that I probably would not get through to the relevant agency in any case. So my detailed blood tests are being circulated around the Commonwealth Bank and it appears that I have no ability to get in touch with anyone who can give me any information about where they are, whether they will be returned or whether any copies have been made.
I am only grateful that I did not fill in the even more detailed medical information that they were requiring. I would urge people to look more carefully at where their medical information is heading in these days of outsourcing, when we need to sign away such a wide-ranging waiver of our privacy requirements, I think we all need to be a bit more careful about what we do. We have seen instances just recently where people in the Taxation Office and also in Centrelink have been found to be accessing records that they should not be accessing. We all know that, in these days of computer databases, people can get access to records that they should not have access to as part of their job. When that privacy waiver is so broad, when any legal or financial people in the Commonwealth Bank can access my records officially—much less those who might be able to unofficially—and when in fact the waiver states that any of my own personal financial advisers contacted by the Commonwealth can access those records, when I may not necessarily want my accountant to know the status of my AIDS test, then I think we all need to be much more careful in this era of outsourcing.
I certainly commend the privacy legislation that is proposed and urge people to be very careful about their own privacy considerations. I wish to assure the house that my AIDS and hepatitis tests came up negative, so I had nothing in particular to worry about. It is the principle of the issue which concerns me.",SENATE,<title>PRIVACY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,28,1
"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NATS,2006-09-07,"—In response to Senator Stott Despoja’s proposed Democrat amendment, I have a couple of things I wish to say. Firstly, the proposed amendment on the national privacy principle would allow the collection of health information where it is necessary to provide a health service to an individual and where it is required or authorised by law. The Prescription Shopping Information Service is the only service currently authorised by law. It is possible that a health law in the future may authorise an additional collection of information. However, any new provisions authorising the collection of information will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny, either directly through parliamentary debate on a legislative amendment or through the disallowance process for legislative instruments. In either case, there would be specific opportunity for parliament to consider the privacy implications of any new provision authorising the collection of information. I advise Senator Stott Despoja that the government will provide her with additional information in writing as she requests or as is requested.

The answer read as follows—

I am advised that at the conclusion of Defence’s attendance at the Budget Estimates hearing on 1 June 2006, Senator Bishop requested Defence take on notice to provide the Committee with the total cost over the 30 year period of the amount to be paid by the Commonwealth, the annual service payments for the construction and operation of the joint headquarters facility, and the public sector comparator costs used in the value for money assessment, after those details became available.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2006-09-07,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked today.
In doing so I want to concentrate on the response of Senator Vanstone to questions relating to the subclass 457 visas. I would like to say at the outset that I very much enjoyed the minister’s theatrical performance in response to the dorothy dixer she got. She is very good at it. Some of the best comedy routines I have seen have been performed by the minister. But the key issue is whether or not she is meeting her responsibilities as a minister in dealing with the hard policy issues. On two occasions today, and once yesterday, I asked the minister to give an assurance that she was satisfied with the performance of her department in administering the subclass 457 visas. On each occasion the minister refused to endorse the department’s actions. The minister has refused to state that she believes the visa system is being administered properly and that there are not major flaws with the scheme.
What we have seen from the minister, time and time again, are these sorts of dismissive, theatrical performances—but she fails to answer the key questions. When she is confronted with the shocking examples of abuse of the subclass 457 visas—of workers being forced to pay $10,000 to come to this country; of workers being underpaid, exploited or working without proper safety conditions; of workers being required to operate in areas where they do not have the skills—she has no answer except to say that the fact that the complaints are being raised proves that the system is working. Have you ever heard anything more bizarre? The fact that there is example after example of workers being exploited under the 457 visa system is proof that the system is working. I do not know what planet she is from, but it does not make any sense to me and it does not make any sense to anybody following these issues. What she is saying is that the complaints system is working. I do not think that is right either. She failed to answer the questions asked of her today relating to the inordinately long time it took for the department to intervene in a range of cases—answers, incidentally, that Mr Ruddock was prepared to deal with over the last couple of days in the other place. He is obviously better informed on these matters than the minister.
I think it actually highlights the fact that she is not prepared to engage in the detail. She is not prepared to defend the department. She is not prepared to defend the department’s administration of the scheme, because she knows that, as in so many other areas in the experience of the department of immigration, there will be serious problems. We know there are serious problems. We have the stories in the papers of the serious problems in the way these people have been exploited. The minister will not engage with the detail. She is dismissive of any attempt to engage with the question of whether or not these people have been exploited.
I support the 457 visa system in the sense that it allows skilled workers to come to this country. But I do not support a system that allows exploitation of foreign workers. I do not support a system that allows the importation of labour into areas where there are not skill shortages in this country. And I do not support a system that allows people to work in unsafe conditions doing jobs that they do not have the skills for. I certainly do not support a system that ignores the training needs of young Australians in order to bring people in to do the jobs that they could do. We do need skilled workers. We do need to bring them in to fill the skills shortages. But we need to administer that properly. We need to ensure that they get justice. We need to ensure also that it is not part of a broader attempt by the government—which Minister Vanstone admitted was part of her motivation—to drive down Australian wages and to put pressure on Australian wages.
The minister let it slip out a month or two ago that one of the advantages of the 457 system was that it allowed downward pressure on Australian wages. So not only does it export foreign workers, but it actually helps to lower the wages received by Australian workers and prevents training Australians to take up skills. The minister has to engage and answer for the administration of the scheme. She cannot just go on pulling stunts. She has failed to answer key questions. She has still refused to provide me with the information regarding the occupations of principal applicants under the 457 visa system. She says I am wrong with the list I got from the Parliamentary Library. Let her produce the real list. Let her come clean. (Time expired)

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2006-09-07,"—I thank Senator Evans for his complete endorsement of the government’s policy and of the minister and her approach to the 457 visa issue. Having heard Senator Evans indicating his support—and we know, as Senator Vanstone very adroitly pointed out today, that of course Senator Evans would support it because the union movement, who gets Senator Evans where he is, sitting at the table there, are actually users of it—
—Not trying to undercut Australian wages and conditions like your mob!
—Senator Sterle!
—Senator Sterle, quite clearly the union movement has not got the skills in Australia to do these fairly simple jobs. People like you obviously do not have any skills, so they throw you into the Senate.
—Aren’t you bitter and twisted: you are the only minister to get the chop in the summer holidays!
—They throw you into the Senate, where you are not too much of a worry to anyone!

Senator Sterle interjecting—

—Senator Sterle! Senator Ian Macdonald has the call.
—Senator Sterle quite clearly should have applied for those jobs, but he could not compete with the skills requirement, so they had to import people from overseas to do the jobs which otherwise Senator Sterle might do.
This government, and I thank Senator Vanstone for her part in it, has presided over an economy which has seen the highest wages across the board for workers in Australia and, of course, the highest employment figures practically in history—certainly in the last 30 years. Each quarter new jobs are created by this government, unemployment continues to fall and it is because of the adroitness of the government that we have this situation—a situation which is almost bordering on overfull employment. It is for this reason that this 457 visa is so very necessary for Australia and so well appreciated by those businesses in Australia desperately seeking skilled employment.
I have mentioned in this chamber a number of times the critical shortage of workers at a goat processing factory in Charleville and another factory next door which processes kangaroos and wild pigs. They cannot get labour into those areas. They have been able to access, through the 457 visas, some Vietnamese families who have put in a fantastic effort there, side by side with Australian-born and Australian-naturalised workers and Indigenous workers—all working together in those processing factories in a very cooperative and worthwhile way. They get paid award wages. They get the same wages as Australian-born or naturalised workers who work next door to them.
This whole scheme is implemented with the right sorts of conditions and requirements to ensure there is no exploitation. Exploitation does occur and has occurred, and it is a credit to the minister and her department that these rare cases of exploitation have been followed up. They have been dealt with efficiently by the department and by the minister. There are some problems at times but the arrangement of the scheme is such that these can be followed through and addressed, and that is what is so very important in the scheme. The 457 scheme is a great credit to this government, as are the wages paid to all employees and the employment levels in Australia at the moment. I can only conclude by again congratulating Senator Vanstone on the way she administers a difficult portfolio and administers it so well. I thank again Senator Evans for his endorsement of the government’s policy and his endorsement of Senator Vanstone and her department.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Answers to Questions</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,32,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2006-09-07,"—What a poor effort we have seen in question time today from the government. First of all we had the spectacle of Senator Vanstone unable to provide a straight answer to a straight question about 457 visas. You have the usual bluff and the usual bluster from Senator Vanstone, but we all know what she is about here: driving down wages and working conditions of Australian workers. That is what it is all about, and her administration of this issue—in a badly administered department, of course—is a disgrace. Her administration of her portfolio responsibilities remains the greatest scandal in public administration in this country.
We had that; then of course we had Senator Santoro on his feet, trying to give a bit of gee-up for the Queensland election campaign—one of the great own goals in Senate history. First of all, he got the question from Senator Brandis, a joke in itself, because Senator Brandis is so jealous of the fact that Senator Santoro is on the front bench despite the fact that Senator Santoro has much less ability than Senator Brandis. It is true: Senator Brandis is much more able. But Senator Brandis is on the back bench; Senator Santoro is on the front bench—and every question he gets, he fluffs.
He managed to do that again today. He even forgot that Senator Boswell was a Queensland coalition representative in the Senate. Then, when he was reminded, he completely forgot about Senator Joyce’s existence. Anyway, he was reminded by this side of the chamber, his own team and a very red-faced Senator Joyce and Senator Boswell. Senator Santoro put in a shocker. We are used to that. Then of course we had Senator Abetz. He also tried to get into the Queensland election campaign to give a bit of a confidence builder to Senator Boswell by saying what a terrific job Senator Boswell had done at a public meeting—‘He’s not a bad bloke at all, he’s a patsy for the National Party, a patsy for the coalition, a patsy for the Liberal Party—a terrific bloke. We don’t like Senator Joyce, but Senator Boswell is a terrific patsy for the coalition and the Liberal Party in Queensland.’
It was an attempt to get a few votes in the Queensland election. It will backfire, it will boomerang and it will not work, as we know. Then we had Senator Ian Campbell, again, speaking on the orange-bellied parrot—another abysmal performance. One of the great fiascos of this parliament is Senator Campbell’s handling of the Bald Hills wind farm issue. He still cannot answer a question about how he has managed to balls this issue up so monstrously to have ended up with egg all over his face, worthy of what you would expect if you had thrown eggs in any propellers of any wind farm. What a performance, again, from Senator Campbell today. But this all pales into insignificance compared to what we saw from Senator Ellison.
Senator Ellison was asked a perfectly reasonable question by Senator Ray. Senator Ray asked: ‘Why are young Australian service men and women risking their lives in Afghanistan to protect a government that ignores poppy cultivation, which in turn has the effect of allowing heroin to be sent to Australia, with the resultant death of young Australians?’ Senator Ellison deliberately turned this round, suggesting that Senator Ray was suggesting that Australian troops were protecting poppy producers in Afghanistan. What a disgraceful, despicable and contemptible slur that was. Senator Ray will not say this, but I will say it: there is no person in this chamber who has given greater support to our defence forces and troops than Senator Ray. No-one has worked more closely with them, no-one has defended them more and there is no-one who has greater respect from them and there is no-one who less deserves that despicable attack from Senator Ellison. But how typical! Senator Ray called Senator Ellison a dog and withdrew it, but Senator Ellison is so gutless, so low, he would not withdraw that slur against Senator Ray. What a shocker, what an awful performance. (Time expired)

"McGauran, Sen Julian",LP,2006-09-07,"—There was no clearer and straighter answer given today than that from Senator Ellison to Senator Ray’s question. We all know that old political roue: he threw it out there and no sooner did it go belly up than he tried to reel it back in. The answer was straight and clear from Senator Ellison today: of course the government has a concern with regard to the Afghanistan poppy-growing industry. That it is and has been in the past and could well become a primary market in Afghanistan, the government is concerned about and is acting upon it. But the truth of the matter is that the main source of heroin to this country is South-East Asia. It is not Afghanistan. According to Senator Ellison, there have been samples and examples of heroin coming in from Afghanistan to Australia, but it is not the primary source into this country at all. That is the straight answer he gave you and that is the one you reeled back from mighty quickly, Senator Ray. It was pretty pathetic to see from someone with your background.
We know the committees that you represent, we know the information that you have and to take up a cheapjack question such as that was pretty pathetic indeed. There is no minister in this government who has had such a success rate with regard to the government’s Tough on Drugs policy than Senator Ellison. Don’t come in here and say that you have supported to the hilt the government’s Tough on Drugs policy. You have not. You have given it qualified support. That is the best I can say: you have given this government’s Tough on Drugs policy qualified support. You would not come out when most needed and condemn the New South Wales government when they brought in their harm minimisation program with the heroin injecting room policy. You went quiet and soft on that. You are tough on drugs when it suits you to be but, when one of your own introduces a harm minimisation policy, you go quiet.
In fact, you have given qualified support to the government’s Tough on Drugs policy, which has been enormously successful, and no minister has guided that policy better than Senator Ellison. It has a three-pronged approach: firstly, the education policy, which goes into schools and onto the television and into newspapers, educating the public and the young with regard to the harm that drugs bring; secondly, introducing the full force of the law, which is something you have shied at over there. You have shied at the full force of the law and the tough penalties. And what a result this policy has had. We have had record busts in heroin to the extent that we have a drought in heroin in this country. We are proud to say we have created a drought in heroin in this country. Senator Ellison cited the example of the Herald Sun, where it produced, alongside the disastrous and tragic road toll figures, the heroin overdose figures, which once remarkably and incredibly matched the road toll figures. That is no longer the case today. One of the reasons is the Tough on Drugs policy, the tough law enforcement and the greater resources given to the Federal Police and also the Australian Crime Commission, in tandem with the state police.
That has been incredibly successful in drying up the heroin coming into this country. We acknowledge that there has now been a shift towards amphetamines because of the focus of the Federal Police and the Australian Crime Commission on the heroin trade. We will now get tough on the amphetamine trade too. It is a never-ending cycle but if you are not tough, if you do not have the laws and you do not have the education policy you will not be successful. Senator Ellison has been a successful minister, a minister who is undeserving of that question. In fact, the questioner was undeserving in presenting that question. God knows where it came from out of the tactics committee. It was utterly undeserving. It was not worthy of Senator Ray and it was certainly not worthy of the minister. (Time expired)

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2006-09-07,"—We have heard from the pathetic defector from the National Party in Victoria talking about heroin drying up—and as a broad principle that is correct. But if he cannot see that the 162 per cent explosion in land cultivation of the poppy in Afghanistan is eventually going to affect Australia, I feel sorry for him. One of the reasons why most heroin comes from the Golden Triangle into Australia is that the rest of the Afghan heroin production goes to the rest of the world. But we are not isolated from the rest of the world. If it expands and blows up in Afghanistan it will be available to come into Australia. That is the first point.
Secondly, in my supplementary question I asked Senator Ellison what the Australian government is doing to assist the Afghan government to stop this explosion—no answer; that part of the question was not addressed at all. The part that was was addressed with a distortion of my question. My question was fairly explicit. It asked about Australian troops who were in Afghanistan—we know the reason they are there and we support the reason they are there—and whether the Afghan government is so inept that it cannot stop the explosion of poppy growing, which in turn, by the way, is funding the Taliban to be able to resist and threaten Australia’s troops. How you can move from that point there to say that my question alleges that Australian troops are protecting poppy growers, I do not know. It takes an awfully sick mind to get there. It is a pathetic diversion tactic, and it does not do Senator Ellison any credit. I did ask him to withdraw it. He refused.
I remind the chamber I made some silly interjection here about 18 months ago, it was not recorded in Hansard and a senator on the other side took objection to it and mentioned that to me. I came straight down to this chamber, I apologised to the senator and I withdrew the remark, and, apparently, only a couple of people ever knew what the remark was. So I have at least set the example. As for Senator Ellison, for the first time in this chamber in 25 years I ask for something that was said about me to be withdrawn—doesn’t happen, and the Leader of the Government in the Senate, who is sitting at the table, does not encourage it. I am disappointed in him.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2006-09-07,"—I present the government’s response to the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD on the private review of agency security arrangements, and I seek leave to incorporate the document in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—

Government Response to the Third Report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD


Private Review of Agency Security Arrangements

The Government has considered the Committee’s report on its private review of Agency security arrangements. The Government has decided to implement most of the Committee’s recommendations. This response sets out the action taken to deal with each of the recommendations.

Recommendation 1

That, as a first priority, the agencies address any existing or anticipated backlog in initial vetting and re-evaluation of TSPV security clearances to ensure that these processes meet PSM standards by 2003-2004 at the latest. Further, that the agencies include statistics on the number of outstanding TSPV re-evaluation cases and the times taken to process clearances in the reports made to this Committee as part of the annual review of administration and expenditure.

Accepted with a qualification.

ASIO reports that it does not have a backlog in initial vetting or re-evaluation of TSPV security clearances. ASIS and DSD report they have given priority to, and made substantial progress on reducing backlogs in initial vetting of TSPV cases, and anticipated increases in initial TSPV clearances. DSD was unable to complete the backlog of overdue re-evaluations in FY2003-04. The responsibility for re-evaluations transferred from DSD to the Defence Security Authority (DSA) in 2004. While priority has been given to clearances for new DSD staff, the increased demand for initial and upgrade TSPVs across Defence (particularly for operational deployments) and Defence industry, has placed increased pressure on DSA’s capacity to complete initial and upgrade TSPVs and to complete re-evaluations. The Secretary of Defence has issued a formal waiver of the Commonwealth Protective Security Manual requirements in this area and DSD has implemented more rigorous internal management of its staff in the meantime. The backlog of TSPV re-evaluations is unlikely to be completed before FY 2006-07.
Statistics on the number of outstanding TSPV re-evaluations in each agency, and the current timeframes for processing TSPV clearances, will be reported to the Committee as part of the annual review of administration and expenditure.

Recommendation 2

That the IASF review urgently areas where agencies are experiencing difficulties obtaining security-related information about personnel, such as the refusal by credit reference agencies to provide information direct to the Commonwealth, and develop proposals for appropriate legislative or policy action by the Commonwealth Attorney-General.

Accepted.

The IASF recognises that there are some difficulties in obtaining security-related information for vetting purposes. The Forum was of the opinion that legislative change may not be feasible at this time and other avenues should be explored first. The IASF directed the Personnel Security Working Group to look at current research and programs being undertaken by government departments, to help develop proposals for change to address these difficulties.

Recommendation 3

That, as a priority, DSD implement random bag inspection procedures at all its headquarters facilities and all other installations in Australia.

Accepted.

DSD reports that it has implemented random carried items inspections at the required locations.

Recommendation 4

The Committee recommends that, subject to the outcomes of the IASF working group findings, ASIO, ASIS and DSD allocate funding for the development and implementation of electronic article surveillance systems for all Australian offices and installations.

Not Accepted.

The Government will not be immediately implementing the Committee’s final recommendation to fund development and implementation of electronic article surveillance systems. Electronic tagging systems are easy to defeat, and readily circumvented unless the functionality of the item being protected is almost completely compromised.
ASIO has monitored electronic tagging technology continually since 2002. ASIO advised that research by its own T4 Protective Security element, and recent liaison with sister agencies in the UK and USA failed to reveal any systems in existence or development that are capable of overcoming the identified deficiencies.
The Government believes that the large investment costs needed to attempt to develop an electronic article surveillance system incapable of being easily defeated, or circumvented, cannot be justified. The limited areas of application of the system (in Australia and abroad) deny the prospect of any sensible returns on this investment in the unlikely event of successfully developing such a system. The Government considers investing in more effective through-life management of the personnel security processes, improving protective security education and awareness, and increasing auditing and accountability processes will deliver better security outcomes that deter and prevent the unauthorised removal of security classified assets.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>ASIO, ASIS and DSD Committee</title>",COMMITTEES,33,1
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2006-09-07,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
This response is well outside the three months required by the Senate but, when governments respond to matters related to intelligence and security, I would much rather that they give a considered opinion to the Senate and the House of Representatives than rush something that only pays lip service to the report—one cannot accuse the government of doing that on this occasion. There were four recommendations, and the government have given us a full, rational and reasoned response to each of the recommendations.
The first recommendation relates to the way intelligence agencies do positive vetting. There is no doubt that, at different stages, different agencies have fallen a little behind in this and a backlog has been created. Since this report has come down, further evidence has come to light that most of these backlogs are being eliminated—and the committee would view that with great pleasure.
When you consider that ASIO is going to grow from 600 staff to 1,800 staff over a four- to five-year period, you can see how important it is for these vetting processes to be on track and on time—and the efforts made by the agency to do so are quite impressive. We know that there is going to be considerable growth in ONA, ASIS and the various Defence intelligence agencies. This growth can only be effective if each of the new employees is given a security clearance. Security clearances are done more widely than in just those particular agencies, but it is essential that they keep up to date.
One matter of concern at the time was that employees have to be re-evaluated after five years. Circumstances can change and, therefore, employees have to be vetted again. There were minor lags in some agencies but that has been addressed by the agencies. I congratulate the agencies on continuing to improve in this area.
The final part of the recommendation, which the government has accepted, is that each of these agencies report to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security and give us the statistics on whether there is a backlog or otherwise. It would not necessarily be advisable for these figures to be published in annual reports, but the committee will continue to monitor progress and, if we find problems, we will be able to write directly to the minister in charge and draw them to his or her attention.
The second area on which we made a recommendation was access to credit rating agencies. This has to be part of the positive vetting process, but often credit agencies are not that cooperative. We recommend that the government consider legislating in this area because it is absolutely crucial that full positive vetting be done on these employees. The government have responded by saying that, whilst they are not ruling that out, they would prefer other methods to try to achieve that. I am quite happy with that. Let us give the government and the agencies time to establish a relationship with these credit agencies rather than having to bring in the heavy hand of legislation. But I do say to these credit agencies that, if they do not cooperate, in the long run we will have to legislate in that area.
The third recommendation we made was that DSD implement a policy of bag inspection—that is, employees going in and out will have their bags searched on a random basis. This is something that applies in virtually every other intelligence and security organisation. But, for historical reasons, industrial relations reasons or who knows what, in the mists of time there were not bag searches at DSD. We think that in the modern age that is unacceptable. DSD agrees and I think its employees now agree, so they will now be subjected to random searches. It is very difficult to search a bag every day but, as long as you know that your bag could potentially be searched, you would, I think, never try to run the gauntlet.
The final matter that we addressed in our recommendations was a hope that there would be development and implementation of electronic article surveillance systems for all Australian offices. Simply said, leaking is anathema to security and intelligence agencies—let us face it. If you can electronically tag documents so that you can retrieve and see the source of the document, you will prevent leaking. That sounds terrific to the committee. The government have rejected that by saying they think that is avoidable—that it is too easy to find a way around that system and still have documents go missing. I accept that—they are the experts—and they do believe that putting money into education and other security methods would be more effective than the ineffective electronic tagging of documents. I do not pretend to be an expert in this area but, on behalf of all the other committee members, we would accept the government’s recommendation with regard to this.
This will be the last such report that covers ASIO, ASIS and DSD because the remit of the committee, as you would realise Mr Deputy President, has been extended to DIO, DIGO and ONA. So, from now on, when governments respond to reports they will be responding to findings across six agencies, not three.
In conclusion, I have had the privilege to look at oversight of intelligence agencies recently in five countries. And I would have to say, without question and without doubt, that the oversight system in Australia is more effective and more comprehensive than in any of those other countries. For instance, I was surprised to find that France does not yet have parliamentary oversight of its security and intelligence agencies and that inspectors-general do not exist in most countries. Yet we have both: we have parliamentary oversight and we have the inspector-general’s oversight. So we do have comprehensive oversight of our intelligence and security agencies.
By the way, we should have because, year by year, we are giving these agencies wider scope and wider powers, all of which could potentially infringe on the human rights of Australian citizens. If we are going to do that, we are acting appropriately by widening scrutiny and supervision, all of which will prevent abuse. Abuse is normally prevented in Australian society through transparency. It is very hard to have transparency in intelligence and security organisations. Therefore, parliamentary supervision and independent supervision by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security provide the necessary balance for us to get the system right. I have to say that, compared with what most other countries are doing, we are getting it right. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2006-09-07,"—I present the government’s response to the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD on the private review of agency security arrangements, and I seek leave to incorporate the document in Hansard.

The document read as follows—

Government Response to the Third Report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD


Private Review of Agency Security Arrangements

The Government has considered the Committee’s report on its private review of Agency security arrangements. The Government has decided to implement most of the Committee’s recommendations. This response sets out the action taken to deal with each of the recommendations.

Recommendation 1

That, as a first priority, the agencies address any existing or anticipated backlog in initial vetting and re-evaluation of TSPV security clearances to ensure that these processes meet PSM standards by 2003-2004 at the latest. Further, that the agencies include statistics on the number of outstanding TSPV re-evaluation cases and the times taken to process clearances in the reports made to this Committee as part of the annual review of administration and expenditure.

Accepted with a qualification.

ASIO reports that it does not have a backlog in initial vetting or re-evaluation of TSPV security clearances. ASIS and DSD report they have given priority to, and made substantial progress on reducing backlogs in initial vetting of TSPV cases, and anticipated increases in initial TSPV clearances. DSD was unable to complete the backlog of overdue re-evaluations in FY2003-04. The responsibility for re-evaluations transferred from DSD to the Defence Security Authority (DSA) in 2004. While priority has been given to clearances for new DSD staff, the increased demand for initial and upgrade TSPVs across Defence (particularly for operational deployments) and Defence industry, has placed increased pressure on DSA’s capacity to complete initial and upgrade TSPVs and to complete re-evaluations. The Secretary of Defence has issued a formal waiver of the Commonwealth Protective Security Manual requirements in this area and DSD has implemented more rigorous internal management of its staff in the meantime. The backlog of TSPV re-evaluations is unlikely to be completed before FY 2006-07.
Statistics on the number of outstanding TSPV re-evaluations in each agency, and the current timeframes for processing TSPV clearances, will be reported to the Committee as part of the annual review of administration and expenditure.

Recommendation 2

That the IASF review urgently areas where agencies are experiencing difficulties obtaining security-related information about personnel, such as the refusal by credit reference agencies to provide information direct to the Commonwealth, and develop proposals for appropriate legislative or policy action by the Commonwealth Attorney-General.

Accepted.

The IASF recognises that there are some difficulties in obtaining security-related information for vetting purposes. The Forum was of the opinion that legislative change may not be feasible at this time and other avenues should be explored first. The IASF directed the Personnel Security Working Group to look at current research and programs being undertaken by government departments, to help develop proposals for change to address these difficulties.

Recommendation 3

That, as a priority, DSD implement random bag inspection procedures at all its headquarters facilities and all other installations in Australia.

Accepted.

DSD reports that it has implemented random carried items inspections at the required locations.

Recommendation 4

The Committee recommends that, subject to the outcomes of the IASF working group findings, ASIO, ASIS and DSD allocate funding for the development and implementation of electronic article surveillance systems for all Australian offices and installations.

Not Accepted.

The Government will not be immediately implementing the Committee’s final recommendation to fund development and implementation of electronic article surveillance systems. Electronic tagging systems are easy to defeat, and readily circumvented unless the functionality of the item being protected is almost completely compromised.
ASIO has monitored electronic tagging technology continually since 2002. ASIO advised that research by its own T4 Protective Security element, and recent liaison with sister agencies in the UK and USA failed to reveal any systems in existence or development that are capable of overcoming the identified deficiencies.
The Government believes that the large investment costs needed to attempt to develop an electronic article surveillance system incapable of being easily defeated, or circumvented, cannot be justified. The limited areas of application of the system (in Australia and abroad) deny the prospect of any sensible returns on this investment in the unlikely event of successfully developing such a system. The Government considers investing in more effective through-life management of the personnel security processes, improving protective security education and awareness, and increasing auditing and accountability processes will deliver better security outcomes that deter and prevent the unauthorised removal of security classified assets.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,COMMITTEES,33,2
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2006-09-07,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
This response is well outside the three months required by the Senate but, when governments respond to matters related to intelligence and security, I would much rather that they give a considered opinion to the Senate and the House of Representatives than rush something that only pays lip service to the report—one cannot accuse the government of doing that on this occasion. There were four recommendations, and the government have given us a full, rational and reasoned response to each of the recommendations.
The first recommendation relates to the way intelligence agencies do positive vetting. There is no doubt that, at different stages, different agencies have fallen a little behind in this and a backlog has been created. Since this report has come down, further evidence has come to light that most of these backlogs are being eliminated—and the committee would view that with great pleasure.
When you consider that ASIO is going to grow from 600 staff to 1,800 staff over a four- to five-year period, you can see how important it is for these vetting processes to be on track and on time—and the efforts made by the agency to do so are quite impressive. We know that there is going to be considerable growth in ONA, ASIS and the various Defence intelligence agencies. This growth can only be effective if each of the new employees is given a security clearance. Security clearances are done more widely than in just those particular agencies, but it is essential that they keep up to date.
One matter of concern at the time was that employees have to be re-evaluated after five years. Circumstances can change and, therefore, employees have to be vetted again.

"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2006-09-07,"—by leave—It is not usually a pleasure to ever have to correct a statement that you have made in this place, but in this case today it is somewhat of a pleasure to do that. Earlier today, I provided to the Senate some examples of the use of 457 visas by unions which were provided to me, partly by the department and partly by my office. They showed that unions were using the scheme, but the unions want to restrict employers from using 457s in Australia. One example used was the National Tertiary Education Industry Union. I was told they had employed an industrial relations officer on a 457 visa. I am now advised that that person was not seeking a 457 visa.
Nonetheless, it is an example of the same sort of thing I was talking about—namely, saying one thing and doing another. That particular individual has applied for a regional sponsored migration scheme visa, which requires a regional certifying body to certify it. The reason it was listed in the examples of saying one thing and doing another is that there has been criticism from my colleagues opposite about regional certifying bodies. It does appear that they would be happy to accept a yes from the RCB, if in fact a yes is given, because this application is in the process of being processed.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Skilled Migration</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,36,1
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2006-09-07,"—I rise to take note of the Department of Defence report for 2004-05. I have spoken previously on the issue of retention and recruitment within the Australian Defence Force and how important that is. This evening, though, I want to turn to a probably not often read page of the annual report but one that I have read previously and asked Defence for explanations on. I am sure, Mr Acting Deputy President, that you will be interested in this. It is part of their accounts, note 15, on executive remuneration. The table on executive remuneration sets out the remuneration bands in, it seems, almost $10,000 lots and lists the number of executives who fall into each of those bands.
A number of years ago when I raised this issue at the Senate estimates hearing I think it caused a little bit of consternation. There was a bit of concern on the part of Defence that, firstly, they could not find a proper explanation for what was happening. To their credit, they eventually came up with an explanation. Secondly, there were what seemed to be major shifts taking place within the bands. That is the concern that I, again, have on this occasion when reading the 2004-05 report. With respect to the executive remuneration and the band that covers the individuals—and I never sought the identity of the individuals—I have been concerned about the shift in the bands more than anything else. The calculation includes salary and allowances, accrued superannuation, redundancy payments, accrued leave, car parking, motor vehicle costs and fringe benefits taxes.
In addition, for Australian Defence Force members it includes the value of health and housing subsidy and a number of other miscellaneous allowances, including field allowances, career transition training and separation and retention allowances. It covers a wide range, particularly for those who are active serving members of the Australian Defence Force. The comparison is interesting to look at between 2004 and 2005. In the report for 2004-05 we see that a new band has crept in—that is, the band from $470,000 to $479,999; $560,000 to $569,999; and, $590,000 to $599,999. Indeed, they are not insignificant amounts. In 2004, there were no persons in these categories at all, but there were persons in the following categories: $400,000 to $409,999; $420,000 to $429,999; and, $440,000 to $449,999. There was one person in each of those categories.
It seems to me that those people have now been moved up into what I would say are substantially higher categories. Whilst there may have been a change in some of the circumstances of these people, it would be interesting to find out how much of that impact is brought about by salary and how much is brought about by other aspects of the remuneration package and what aspects are significant in what I believe to be a significant shift. If one could simply translate someone from the lowest level of what I quoted into what is now the lowest level then there is in the order of a 30 per cent increase in the value of remuneration. It must be of concern. There is no explanation, and I think that the table itself does not serve Defence well. Whilst it is common in many annual reports, it does not serve Defence well. I think that if Defence could provide a better explanation of the meaning of this table, it would take away many of the concerns that I would have and certainly a lot of other Australians would have about the remuneration for some of the people in our Defence Force. I seek leave to continue my remarks.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2006-09-07,"—I rise to speak on the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee’s First progress report—reforms to Australia’s military justice system. I would commend to the Senate this very important report. This is a very important issue, as I know all senators in this chamber understand.
I believe that the military justice system has been deeply flawed. There has been the perception that military justice has been about protecting the ADF from criticism rather than resolving problems and rather than fairness. If the committee’s unanimous recommendations had been implemented, criminal investigations would have been handed to the civilian police in the first instance and the matters dealt with in civilian courts, giving our service people access to the same principles of justice that are available to every other Australian.
The government’s response to the committee’s report was not to follow those recommendations. As the report of the committee reviewing progress has since found:
... many of the problems that were identified in the military justice report were manifestations of a deeply entrenched culture. Improvements in process will not of themselves change the culture.
I note that this happens at a time when the government is seeking to see a significant increase in the amount of recruitment in our Australian Defence Force. I also note the real and genuine concerns that are held about the high level of commitment of our armed services in overseas deployments. The government’s answer to this problem shows how out of touch it really is. What is it going to do? It is going to relax recruiting standards.
Recruiting standards ought to be regularly reviewed. Standards that are arbitrary and unrelated to capacity ought to be changed. But reviews and changes ought not to be based on some sort of desperate attempt to bolster numbers in the defence forces by lowering standards. When the Australian Defence Force has trouble meeting recruitment targets we ought to ask why that has occurred—what is the reason for it. We should ask that question and try to get some answers to that very important question before we have a headlong rush into lower standards.
One of the reasons why that has occurred was contained in the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee’s report into the military justice system in 2005. It is alluded to again in this progress report of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee. There is, and there is known to be, a deeply entrenched culture in the ADF that leads to bullying and the covert or overt endorsement of bullying by responsible officers. As we know, that leads to physical and sexual harassment and to the covering up of that harassment by abuse of process and attempts to blame the victim. That leads to the victimisation of those perceived to be weak—people who might be injured in training and the like or people who might be different because of perhaps their ethnic background or personal temperament. These are real issues. We also know that those who report wrongdoing—in other words, those living up to the best traditions of the ADF—are too often stigmatised and too often informally punished.
The references committee report demonstrated a mindset in the ADF that viewed making a complaint as seeking to subvert authority. The progress report notes that procedural changes are not in and of themselves enough to change a deeply entrenched culture—a mindset, if you like—that permeates an organisation. They are just not enough. We need the government to act to change the culture, to take initiatives. Until such a change can be demonstrated, the ADF is going to find it hard to persuade young men and women to join up.
We all know—we all acknowledge—that young people join the ADF because they want to serve their country. They join the ADF for the right reasons. We have a responsibility to ensure that when these young men and women do join the ADF they are treated fairly, decently and with respect. That is our responsibility—the responsibility of government, of parliamentarians and, of course, of the ADF itself.
This is a problem—a real issue, in my view—that the government must address. I think that the minister and the government have to do an awful lot more than just pay lip service to the ADF’s recruitment crisis.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee</title>",COMMITTEES,40,1
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2006-09-07,"—I do not know if Senator Faulkner read my mind, but I think we are very much along the same line.
—We so often are.
—We are; that is quite true. The Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee’s first progress report on reforms to Australia’s military justice system is terribly important indeed. I was a member of the committee that did the original inquiry. The committee’s view was unanimous that the military justice system had to be taken out of the hands of the military. Of course, that was not to be the case. The government determined that there would be some changes made in the processes and tried to bring in more transparency and accountability. Nonetheless, my reaction to the inquiry was—and I have said it here before—that I never want to revisit the sorts of situations that were put to us in that inquiry. We had to deal with the trauma that many parents had experienced where their children had been on the rough side of the military justice system.
One of my colleagues, in addressing this report on the last occasion that it was before the Senate, made a comment about my being fairly sceptical of what Defence might do. I think there is nothing wrong with being sceptical, in a healthy way, about Defence. I have learnt over a long period of time that what Defence says it does not necessarily do; as for what it does, sometimes you do not know about that and you have to dig deep to find out.
My colleague also said, I think, that I can be fairly dismissive of the approach that Defence adopts from time to time. That is true as well, but at the end of the day I have no ill motives towards the people who are in the Department of Defence or our serving forces. My motives are simply to ensure that we have the best conditions, the best equipment and the best training. Everything should be done to ensure that those who choose to serve their country are well and truly looked after and have everything at their disposal to enable them to perform their duty—in many instances a hazardous duty—in the best manner possible.
So, when it came to the review, for me the focus was on the need to change the culture, as it was during the original hearings. And I am still sceptical as to whether the culture has been changed. Obviously, it is not like switching a light on and off. One cannot just change the culture of an organisation overnight. And I must pay tribute to some of the senior personnel who are driving the cultural change within Defence to try and ensure that there is not a repetition of what we have seen previously.
But as to whether this reform has gone far enough, I must agree with Senator Faulkner: I do not believe it has at this stage. I still believe that there are some people within Defence who do not understand that Defence is a modern organisation which must, as such, respect the dignity, welfare and wellbeing of the people who serve us so well.
I will turn to the report for a couple of moments to address this issue of culture. Senator Faulkner hit straight on the appropriate quotes in this report, and I want to go to a couple of others. The committee noted in its report:
At this early stage of its implementation program, the ADF has demonstrated a commitment to improving Australia’s military justice system.
That is correct. There is a will, and it now has to be carried out. The report goes on to say:
The committee notes, however, that many of the problems that were identified in the military justice report were manifestations of a deeply entrenched culture. Improvements in process will not of themselves change the culture.
I am quoting exactly what Senator Faulkner quoted. Just changing the process itself will not change the culture that has, over a long period of time, left a number of people and a number of families scarred.
The report went on to note the role of the Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force, the IGADF. The report said:
The committee is heartened by the positive approach taken by the IGADF in conducting audits of the military justice system that are intended to reflect accurately the health of the system.
I must commend the IGADF for the independence that is being shown. It lends some hope that through the parliamentary scrutiny that is now taking place, we will see some reform in this military justice system. The report goes on to say:
It particularly welcomes the commitment shown by the IGADF toward ensuring that unacceptable behaviour in the ADF will be reported and especially his determination to stamp out any form of reprisal directed at members reporting wrongdoing or making a complaint.
The committee report goes on to note:
The committee, however, draws attention to the prevailing cultural environment of the ADF discussed at length in the military justice report. It notes that even where there are formal and known avenues for a person to disclose information or make a complaint about inappropriate conduct, the workplace may effectively render them useless.
That is a tragedy in this day and age. The report goes on:
The committee stresses that a fundamental change in the ADF mindset must also occur to overcome the stigma attached to reporting wrongdoing or making a complaint.
Then it says:
Registering a complaint should not be contrived as seeking to subvert authority. Authority must command respect, not demand it.
I think that that has been part of the problem in the past. There has been a confusion between the dispensing of military justice and the right of an officer or a senior NCO to command their troops. Anything that is seen as contravening the authority is therefore seen as being subversive and trying to break down the processes within the military itself. Of course, that is the furthest thing from the truth. As the report said, if a person seeks to complain about injustice that is prevalent or applying to a person in a particular situation within Defence, that should not be construed as seeking to subvert authority.
I know that from time to time there are people who will seek to use the system, but that is not everyone. There are very few, a very small minority indeed. But those who seek to use the system properly should not be discouraged or dissuaded from doing so by the use of military authority to suppress the rights and the wellbeing of those serving in our defence forces. Our defence forces are engaged in many theatres now, whether it be in Afghanistan, Iraq, the Solomon Islands, Timor Leste or wherever else throughout the world. They are entitled to know that they are going to be treated with respect as individuals in their serving capacity within the Australian Defence Force. I commend the report to those who have an interest in military justice and I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

This is a problem—a real issue, in my view—that the government must address. I think that the minister and the government have to do an awful lot more than just pay lip service to the ADF’s recruitment crisis.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,COMMITTEES,40,2
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2006-09-07,"—I do not know if Senator Faulkner read my mind, but I think we are very much along the same line.
—We so often are.
—We are; that is quite true. The Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee’s first progress report on reforms to Australia’s military justice system is terribly important indeed. I was a member of the committee that did the original inquiry. The committee’s view was unanimous that the military justice system had to be taken out of the hands of the military. Of course, that was not to be the case. The government determined that there would be some changes made in the processes and tried to bring in more transparency and accountability. Nonetheless, my reaction to the inquiry was—and I have said it here before—that I never want to revisit the sorts of situations that were put to us in that inquiry. We had to deal with the trauma that many parents had experienced where their children had been on the rough side of the military justice system.
One of my colleagues, in addressing this report on the last occasion that it was before the Senate, made a comment about my being fairly sceptical of what Defence might do. I think there is nothing wrong with being sceptical, in a healthy way, about Defence. I have learnt over a long period of time that what Defence says it does not necessarily do; as for what it does, sometimes you do not know about that and you have to dig deep to find out.
My colleague also said, I think, that I can be fairly dismissive of the approach that Defence adopts from time to time. That is true as well, but at the end of the day I have no ill motives towards the people who are in the Department of Defence or our serving forces. My motives are simply to ensure that we have the best conditions, the best equipment and the best training. Everything should be done to ensure that those who choose to serve their country are well and truly looked after and have everything at their disposal to enable them to perform their duty—in many instances a hazardous duty—in the best manner possible.
So, when it came to the review, for me the focus was on the need to change the culture, as it was during the original hearings. And I am still sceptical as to whether the culture has been changed. Obviously, it is not like switching a light on and off. One cannot just change the culture of an organisation overnight. And I must pay tribute to some of the senior personnel who are driving the cultural change within Defence to try and ensure that there is not a repetition of what we have seen previously.
But as to whether this reform has gone far enough, I must agree with Senator Faulkner: I do not believe it has at this stage. I still believe that there are some people within Defence who do not understand that Defence is a modern organisation which must, as such, respect the dignity, welfare and wellbeing of the people who serve us so well.
I will turn to the report for a couple of moments to address this issue of culture. Senator Faulkner hit straight on the appropriate quotes in this report, and I want to go to a couple of others. The committee noted in its report:
At this early stage of its implementation program, the ADF has demonstrated a commitment to improving Australia’s military justice system.
That is correct. There is a will, and it now has to be carried out. The report goes on to say:
The committee notes, however, that many of the problems that were identified in the military justice report were manifestations of a deeply entrenched culture. Improvements in process will not of themselves change the culture.
I am quoting exactly what Senator Faulkner quoted. Just changing the process itself will not change the culture that has, over a long period of time, left a number of people and a number of families scarred.
The report went on to note the role of the Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force, the IGADF. The report said:
The committee is heartened by the positive approach taken by the IGADF in conducting audits of the military justice system that are intended to reflect accurately the health of the system.
I must commend the IGADF for the independence that is being shown. It lends some hope that through the parliamentary scrutiny that is now taking place, we will see some reform in this military justice system. The report goes on to say:
It particularly welcomes the commitment shown by the IGADF toward ensuring that unacceptable behaviour in the ADF will be reported and especially his determination to stamp out any form of reprisal directed at members reporting wrongdoing or making a complaint.
The committee report goes on to note:
The committee, however, draws attention to the prevailing cultural environment of the ADF discussed at length in the military justice report. It notes that even where there are formal and known avenues for a person to disclose information or make a complaint about inappropriate conduct, the workplace may effectively render them useless.
That is a tragedy in this day and age. The report goes on:
The committee stresses that a fundamental change in the ADF mindset must also occur to overcome the stigma attached to reporting wrongdoing or making a complaint.
Then it says:
Registering a complaint should not be contrived as seeking to subvert authority. Authority must command respect, not demand it.
I think that that has been part of the problem in the past. There has been a confusion between the dispensing of military justice and the right of an officer or a senior NCO to command their troops. Anything that is seen as contravening the authority is therefore seen as being subversive and trying to break down the processes within the military itself. Of course, that is the furthest thing from the truth. As the report said, if a person seeks to complain about injustice that is prevalent or applying to a person in a particular situation within Defence, that should not be construed as seeking to subvert authority.
I know that from time to time there are people who will seek to use the system, but that is not everyone. There are very few, a very small minority indeed. But those who seek to use the system properly should not be discouraged or dissuaded from doing so by the use of military authority to suppress the rights and the wellbeing of those serving in our defence forces. Our defence forces are engaged in many theatres now, whether it be in Afghanistan, Iraq, the Solomon Islands, Timor Leste or wherever else throughout the world. They are entitled to know that they are going to be treated with respect as individuals in their serving capacity within the Australian Defence Force. I commend the report to those who have an interest in military justice and I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2006-09-07,"—I rise to speak to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee’s report on the Transparent Advertising and Notification of Pregnancy Counselling Services Bill 2005. The committee’s report revealed that the bill is an ideological attack on a group of largely voluntary community groups that have a conscientious objection to referring women for abortions. The bill is targeted at organisations that do not share Senator Stott Despoja’s view on abortion. The bill’s central concern is whether organisations refer for abortion, not whether they offer quality counselling or whether they offer women support to have a child.
I would like to thank the many groups which provided evidence to the committee, especially when they were so often questioned more about their organisations than their thoughts on the bill at hand. Family First is proudly pro woman, which is why Family First believes the bill should have focused on ensuring we have the best possible pregnancy counselling services for Australian women. We should have the highest possible standards of counselling and look at ways to improve existing counselling services.
The bill would oblige pregnancy counselling agencies that have a conscientious objection to referring for abortion to print a statement in all their advertising or publications similar to suggested words in the bill, which are: ‘This service does not provide referrals for termination of pregnancy.’ Failure to do this could result in a fine of more than $1 million. The bill would also ensure that pregnancy counselling agencies that do not refer for abortions are not allowed to be listed in the 24-hour health and help call pages of the telephone directory, regardless of whether they print the required statement in advertising and publications. So the bill dictates that agencies must refer for abortion, if asked, after counselling or be labelled by their published statement as biased. They are also not allowed the same rights to advertise as abortion-referring groups. This would have the effect of discouraging women from contacting pregnancy support agencies.
One witness at the hearings put the problem of printing a statement particularly well:
We would be very clear that we are not directive within our counselling and yet having to state that openly works in the reverse, if you like. By stating that I am not a non-directive service under your definition then in fact what I am stating is that I am directive, and my social workers would walk out on that basis, and rightly so, because they would be misrepresented by the organisation if I were to sign a form that effectively said they were directive counsellors.
Another said the following:
… the phrase ‘does not refer for abortion’ is a politically polarised phrase—we all know that. For that to be insisted to be in advertising is politicising what I see as a medical or community service to women in crisis pregnancy. I actually think it increases the misleading nature of advertising rather than decreases it.
There was some confusion in the hearings over the sort of counselling offered by agencies that do not refer for abortion. Senators Adams and Nettle claimed that Pregnancy Help Australia is ‘not allowed to give any information regarding a termination’. Others giving evidence appeared to have a similar misunderstanding. They seemed to confuse providing counselling and information with providing a referral. Pregnancy counselling organisations were careful to make the distinction between giving information to women on abortion, which they did, and referring women to an abortion clinic, which they did not.
Pregnancy Help Australia said:
All our counsellors are trained to say, ‘We cannot provide you with a referral for termination services. We can, however, talk to you about your options and give you information about abortion procedures, et cetera, if that is what you want to do.’
Family First was alarmed by evidence that women attending some agencies had same-day abortion referrals.
Another concern is that many women were not offered decision-making counselling, which helps women to make a fully considered decision that is right for them, but only the more limited pre-termination counselling, which is more a description of what to expect from an abortion. A witness from an abortion clinic conceded that the clinic provides same-day abortions for about half of their clients. The Royal Women’s Hospital said that, although around 75 to 80 per cent of women can proceed immediately to an abortion, ‘after they have indicated they are clear in the decision and they do not require further in-depth counselling’, the only reason they do not have a same-day abortion was ‘purely through the demand on the service’. It was conceded by one witness from an abortion clinic that:
I have heard of some women who have talked about a previous abortion where they have felt that they were rushed, where they have felt that they did not get the opportunity for any real counselling.
Family First was alarmed at evidence that some ‘providers actually impose a financial disincentive to continue a pregnancy’. The Preterm Foundation, as well as Australian Birth Control Services, ‘charge a counselling fee of $50 only in the event that the woman chooses not to proceed with the termination’.
Some witnesses and senators claimed the federal government provided more funding to Pregnancy Help Australia than to organisations that refer for abortion. The Department of Health and Ageing made it clear that Pregnancy Help Australia ‘is certainly not the only organisation the Australian government funds’ for pregnancy counselling. The Australian government also funds Family Planning Australia and its state and territory subsidiaries through the public health outcome funding agreements ‘to a substantially larger degree overall than this program’ for funding Pregnancy Help Australia.
Family First believes the Transparent Advertising and Notification of Pregnancy Counselling Services Bill 2005 is an ideological attack on the tremendous work of pregnancy support agencies that do not refer for abortions. That is outrageous. Sadly, the bill does nothing to address the quality of pregnancy counselling. Nor does the bill address the poor standard of counselling in agencies that do refer for abortion, and the bill fails to ensure that abortion referral agencies provide help to women who decide not to have an abortion. The bill merely dictates that agencies must refer for an abortion if asked after counselling or be labelled as biased. Family First strongly believes this bill should not receive support.

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2006-09-07,"—In going through this audit report, it occurred to me that it is very relevant to some of the debate we have been having over the course of the last several months in respect of the abuse of the 457 skilled worker visa. This report clearly indicates that there is already a very comprehensive employment exchange program, job placement program, managed reasonably effectively by DEWR. The purpose of that program is to link supply and demand, the supply being job seekers and the demand being vacancies. The employment exchange program, which DEWR have in place, sets up a vacancy database and a job seeker database, matches them and has a notification process. There is also a payment process for placements.
The primary audit objective was to assess whether DEWR’s management and oversight of job placement and matching services is effective and, in particular, whether DEWR effectively manages, monitors and reports the performance of the JPOs in providing job placement services; whether DEWR effectively manages the provision of matching services, including the completion of vocational profiles and provision of vacancy information through auto-matching to job seekers; whether the job seeker and vacancy data in DEWR’s job search system is of high quality and is managed effectively; and whether DEWR effectively measures, monitors and reports job placement service outcomes. In particular, the third area I mentioned, which was whether the job seeker and vacancy data in DEWR’s job search system is of a high quality and whether it is managed effectively, goes directly to the issue of the skilled migration visa.
It occurs to me—and I raised this yesterday in this place as well—that there is substantial abuse of this visa application, but there is also substantial proper use of this visa. When it is managed in an area where there are identified skills shortages, where work has been done to try to employ people from within Australia and where that cannot happen, the logical process, when those skills are needed, is to try to recruit them from overseas. That is step 1.
But it should not simply be as easy as that. What is the next step? Surely, we have a process where people who require skills on an ongoing basis should be asked: ‘What contribution are you making to ensure that this is not a long-term shortage? Have you advertised? Why can’t you fill the position from within Australia? If you cannot fill it from within Australia and you need to temporarily get skilled migrants from overseas, what are you going to do to ensure that this is not an ongoing skills shortage?’ Being an electrician by trade before I came into this place, I am very concerned that in the electrical and, indeed, the plumbing area we have situations in Victoria where large numbers of apprentices are being put off or being put on down time because employers cannot provide enough work for apprentices at the same time as they are bringing in skilled electricians and skilled plumbers on 457 visas.
The reason they can do that is that there is no process where people actually have to demonstrate to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs that they have advertised within this country and explain the reasons that they cannot attract workers to this country. They should also have to demonstrate to DIMA what they are doing to ensure there is ongoing training in the skills where there are shortages. I find it extraordinary that in areas of traditional trades where, because of the privatisation processes that have happened over the last 20 years, the public sector no longer fulfils a lot of that training need, the obligation has fallen on the private sector and they have failed to meet their obligation to train skilled workers. Yet, at the same time, they take the easy option of saying: ‘No-one else has done the training. I don’t do the training, so what I’ll do is try to get people from overseas to come and do that work and I won’t have a commitment to employing and training young Australians.’
VICTEC, the largest specialised electrical and plumbing group training company in the country based in Victoria, has 220 apprentice electricians. For this year up to 34 apprentices in any given month have been sent back from employers, have remained on down time and have not been paid, because employers have not got enough work to train these people. Out of the 65 plumbers at VICTEC, up to 16 of those apprentices have not been paid, being on down time, because again employers do not have enough work.
It does concern me that we have this visa system which is absolutely out of control. It seems to be the easy option for many employers—even though we have heard the minister say it is not an easy option—because employers are not being challenged. In my view, it would remove much of the abuse of this visa if employers first of all had to establish that there was indeed a problem in recruiting someone with those skills from Australia through an advertising process and then demonstrate that they actually had a plan to ensure that this was not going to be a long-term, ongoing problem. If you had that, you would get rid of a lot of the rogues who are using this visa purely for reasons of driving down wages and getting cheap, compliant labour to meet whatever objectives they seem to have. It really is beyond me that the government does not apply this simple test.
We have just seen reported in the press today—I am awaiting the formal details—that DIMA, I understand, has organised an agreement in the meat industry where employers will have to demonstrate that they have in fact advertised for those skills. That is a private agreement being negotiated between the meat industry and the appropriate department. If it is good enough there, where we know there has been substantial abuse, why isn’t that test being applied everywhere else? It is a logical test; it should be done.
No-one on this side objects to this visa if it is used appropriately where there is a demonstrated skills shortage. We do not have a problem with that. I urge the government, if they really want to have this visa used for the right purposes, to take away the opportunity for improper motives from employers by putting some few simple tests in place. It would take a lot of the heat out of this issue and we could get on with dealing with the problem of the general skills shortage in a more appropriate and structured way. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
