"Evans, Sen Chris (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",ALP,2008-08-26,"—Mr Clerk, I remind the Senate that the time has come when it is necessary for the Senate to choose one of its members to be President. I propose to the Senate for its President Senator Hogg, and I move:

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2008-08-26,"—Clerk, I draw your attention to standing order No. 6 and seek your advice as to when I may speak to my motion nominating Senator Milne as a candidate.
—When the other candidate has addressed the Senate, Senator. Senator Milne, do you wish to speak?",SENATE,<title>PRESIDENT</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,1,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2008-08-26,"—Thank you. Fellow senators, I submit myself to the will of the Senate and, in so doing, say that it would be my great pleasure and honour to preside over the Senate, if that was the wish of the Senate. Senator Brown will speak to my credentials for this role, but I would certainly serve the Senate without fear or favour, if it was the will of the Senate that I do so.
—Do any senators wish to address the chamber?",SENATE,<title>PRESIDENT</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,1,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2008-08-26,"—Senator Milne is the clear choice for this position if we are to take seriously this role of President of the Senate, and I do. The role is constitutionally the most important that any parliamentarian in either house can hold. It requires a person with great experience, and that includes public experience and, if possible, national and international experience. And it requires somebody who is going to serve this Senate without fear or favour, and Senator Milne would certainly do that. She is a candidate of enormous integrity and has a fearless ability to be honest and to be fair—qualities which are essential to a chair of the Senate. Senator Milne, besides 10 years parliamentary experience in Tasmania where, amongst other things, she very successfully led the party in the balance of power in the late 1990s, has now been in this chamber for a year more than a term and knows very well how it works and knows more particularly how better it should work. I point out that she was also Vice-President of the World Conservation Union in Switzerland—a United Nations associated body—for some years. She has also been chair of the global council of the World Conservation Union and remains chair of the Oceania chapter of the council. She is also a United Nations Global 500 award recipient.
I ask senators of the government and the opposition to listen carefully to this. This job should not be a sinecure. The arrangement between the government and the opposition whereby one takes the chair and one takes the deputy chair does not serve this Senate properly. The best person should be appointed and voted to the chair, and this should be a free vote. It should not be corralled by a cosy arrangement between the two big parties in this place. It is time that ended. That does not serve this Senate fairly or well, and the Greens—
Honourable senators interjecting—
—The interjections that I hear, Clerk, are an example of why we need a very strong President to ensure that the standing orders are adhered to by all, because the public gets a better outcome from the strict application of these rules—Senator Milne would do just that. She is the best candidate and I recommend her to all of you as voters with your own right to think individually rather than according to the dictate of party as to how you are going to appoint this chair.
—Do any other senators wish to address the question? There being two nominations, in accordance with the standing orders a ballot will be held. Before the Senate proceeds to ballot, the bells will be rung for four minutes.
The bells having been rung—
—The ballot will  now be held. Ballot papers will be distributed to all senators, who are requested to write upon the ballot paper the name of the candidate for whom they wish to vote. The candidates are Senator Hogg and Senator Milne.

A ballot having been taken—

—The result of the ballot is: Senator Hogg, 68 votes and Senator Milne, six votes. Senator Hogg is therefore elected as President of the Senate in accordance with the standing orders and will take the chair.

Senator Hogg having been conducted to the dais—
",SENATE,<title>PRESIDENT</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,1,1,speech
"PRESIDENT, The",N/A,2008-08-26,"—Firstly, I would like to acknowledge the traditional owners on whose land we meet. I think that is so important. Then I would like to thank the senators who have just placed their trust in me and given their support. I am honest, I am fair, and I am sure that as time progresses those who might not believe that will find it to be true.
On the occasion of being elected to this very high office indeed, I think it is an opportunity to reflect on my path here. In particular, I think that one does not get here by one’s good looks, charm, personality, political skills, wit or any other devices. One really achieves office—whether it be as a senator, whether it be as the President or whether it be as any other officer in this place—by virtue of a wide range of support that has been lent to one over a long period of time.
I think that is something that we should never overlook in our successes in life—that we never get there solely by ourselves. So I want to firstly acknowledge my party and those loyal people in the party who have elected me through our state council process to be a candidate for the party over a long period of time. I have witnessed in this place a number of senators who have not been so successful in their preselection processes, and of course it is a sad occasion indeed. The people who put you here are important, to say the least.
I want to thank my caucus colleagues, and I notice, in particular, that some of the members of the House of Representatives have ventured here this afternoon. Again, without their support, I would not stand before you. From my own state, I want to recognise Anthony Chisholm, the state secretary, and I have enjoyed the support of a number of state secretaries over a long period of time. I owe my success in part to my party. But, next, I want to acknowledge the electors of Queensland. Rightly or wrongly, in the minds of some people, they have returned me now on three occasions to this place, a great honour indeed.
I next wish to acknowledge my union. I am a proud unionist and always have been. In particular, my union, the SDA, has a long and proud tradition which has been fostered in my time with the union particularly by Jim Maher, who unfortunately cannot be here today, and Joe de Bruyn, who is the national secretary. Without my union, without the opportunities that my union gave to me, coming from a very humble background indeed, I would not stand before you. I next want to thank Chris Ketter, who is the current Queensland branch secretary of the SDA, for his long-term friendship and support of me. Also, last but not least from my union, I want to acknowledge Wally Major. Wally is represented by his daughter Joan here today. Wally was the person who fatefully gave me the job with the SDA over 32 years ago.
Again, as I said, one does not get here by one’s own good looks, talents or whatever else, and an enduring friendship with the Australian Workers Union and Bill Ludwig, who represents them here today, has been of great assistance to me in my career over a long period of time. I want to mention ‘Sciaccas’. Con Sciacca, Sciaccas Lawyers and his former partner, the Hon. Brian Kilmartin, who is now a magistrate, have supported me and given me great counsel over a long period of time.
Now I want to mention a name that will not mean a great deal to people outside of the SDA—a person who has given me great strength and courage over a long period of time by the name of Jim Cosgrave of Cosgrave Management Consultants, who taught me how to be patient and how to think in a positive way in developing the skills that I may well have. I thank my staff, Julie Christensen and Hazel Hubbard—who have endured me for 12 years as their employer and without whom my office would not have run successfully over that period of time—Darrell Main and of course Julia Clifford and Meredith Horne in Canberra.
I now turn to my family, because in this game unless you have the support of your family you are not going to make it. I have been extremely blessed with my family and the support that they have given me. It would be a proud moment if my late parents were alive, but obviously they are long gone. But my sister, Mary, is here. I thank you, Mary, for your support. I thank my son, Stephen, my daughter Elizabeth and my daughter Louise. You have been wonderful. You have put up with me through all of my union career and political career. I thank you for that. But the really solid rock has been my wife, Sue. Sue, you are amazing. As I said, this speech is about the people who have supported me over a long period of time; you have been a tower of strength to me and you have enabled me to achieve what I have achieved. I salute you and love you.
It is not possible in a brief speech such as this to thank and encompass everyone. But I think I have made my point that it was not done by me alone and that it was done with the support and cooperation of a wide group of people. Having said that, I make special mention of the two former presidents that I have served under: Alan Ferguson and Paul Calvert. In my time as Deputy President of the Senate they extended a hand of friendship to me that broke down party barriers, not that there were any party barriers in this particular high office. In particular, thank you to you, Alan. This period has not been easy for Alan and me. We knew that there was going to be a transition, but it has worked wonderfully indeed for both of us. I thank you, Alan.
Last but not least, I want to remind people that I come from very humble circumstances. I am proud of my heritage. Those who dig into my background will find that I have a great-great-grandfather who was a politician. He was the subject of Steele Rudd’s notice in Dad in politics, which goes back to the turn of the century. I never thought that I had anyone of that character in my background, but obviously I do and obviously it is reincarnated here today.
I look forward to working with all senators in a cooperative manner in the future. I am sure that we can make this chamber work in spite of the changing dynamics within it. I look forward to the challenges. Thank you very much.",SENATE,<title>PRESIDENT</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,1,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",ALP,2008-08-26,"—Mr President, on behalf of all senators, and particularly on behalf of government senators, I congratulate you on your election to the very important office of President of the Senate. It is one of the most important offices in the Australian democracy. It is important that the person elected to that position takes their function and role very seriously. We know that you will. I think you are superbly qualified for the position. You have served an apprenticeship as Deputy President of the Senate, which I think will serve you well in the role.
More importantly, I think it is because you have a reputation as being a very honest operator, a person of integrity, a person of mature judgement and a person who is balanced and conscientious—all qualities that I think are important for the role of President—that the Senate has shown the good judgement in electing you to this position. Your reputation for those qualities is accepted across the chamber, despite political differences and arguments. I think people accept you as being a good choice for the position, not just as a reflection of party numbers or convention.
I do acknowledge the role of the opposition in supporting the convention of the President coming from the government party. I congratulate them on honouring that convention. I have yet to check whether Senator McGauran also honoured that convention, but when we go to the ballots later we will see.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—There was one informal vote, I understand! That was not meant as any inappropriate remark in relation to Senator McGauran; it was just a reflection on an earlier event. But, Mr President, I congratulate you on your election. I look forward to you dealing with what I think will be a large challenge for you in the new Senate. It will place pressure on you. But I think your standing in the Senate will serve you well in that role. I am sure you will do the job admirably.
I would also briefly like to mention the service of Senator Ferguson as President. I think he did an excellent job. His humour and openness were a great credit to him. I acknowledge his integrity, in the face of being a member of the government that had the numbers in the Senate. It meant that he was able to do that job despite what I know would have been pressures for him to be more supportive of the government’s position. They are only natural pressures that occur in the job for any President, but I think the fact that he was able to maintain his reputation for impartiality despite those pressures is to his great credit.
So, Mr President, I congratulate you on your election. I think it was in part due to the shortness of your campaign speech! But there are other factors that served you well in this election, and we wish you all the best.",SENATE,<title>PRESIDENT</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,1,1,speech
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2008-08-26,"—Mr President, on behalf of opposition senators I warmly congratulate you on your election to this very high office. Your election, of course, for opposition senators, does reflect the disappointing reality that the Australian people decided to change the government at the last election. But it also reflects, as Senator Evans observed, the fact that our opposition does respect the convention that the government of the day should nominate the President of this chamber. We congratulate the Labor Party on nominating the best possible candidate that they could nominate, in you, Mr President, for this exalted position.
I must say that, for a Labor senator, you have done a remarkably good job as Deputy President of the Senate for the last six years. You have earned widespread respect from across the chamber. I and many others on our side have had the privilege of working closely with you—and, indeed, of voting with you on some of the more significant and difficult moral issues that come before this chamber. Many of us know and respect you personally from that experience. Your carriage of the office of Deputy President stands you in good stead and does reflect the fact that you are an outstanding candidate for President. I have no doubt you will do a great job. We do expect from you, and no doubt will get from you, the independence, the objectivity and the impartiality that is incumbent on the bearer of the great office of President. We do hope very much that you will enjoy this great office until August 2011—when, with great respect, we on this side look forward to you being succeeded by a Liberal senator! But enjoy the time until then. Thank you, Mr President.",SENATE,<title>PRESIDENT</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,1,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2008-08-26,"—Mr President, congratulations on your ascendancy to the presidency. We wish you the most rewarding and fulfilling years in that position and offer you every assistance that we can give you during this period. We look forward to working with you and, indeed, with all other members of the chamber in the coming three testing years.
I have one suggestion which you may consider—that is, to reflect the multipartisan nature of this chamber, the chair might recognise not just the government and the opposition but also the crossbench at the beginning of the sittings each day. That is something you may care to look at, Mr President. That said, congratulations. Enjoy the office.

"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2008-08-26,"—Mr President, on behalf of Family First, I congratulate you on your new role as President of the Senate. I have no doubt that you will act without fear or favour and, obviously with the numbers now changed and now we have a Senate that is no longer a rubber stamp and there is a decent chance for decent debate to be held, that there will be a sense of a fair go in debates across the board. We do congratulate you on your position.

"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2008-08-26,"—Firstly, Mr President, I congratulate you on achieving this office. As the previous occupier of that chair, I could not have wished for a more loyal and supportive Deputy President than you were. As has been said before, we did comply with the convention that has been in place for some time, that the government should supply the President, but can I also say that you won it on merit. I look forward to working with you and I offer you my wholehearted support. We look forward to your time as President and I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely congratulate you on attaining that office, which I am sure you will find is a very enjoyable one.",SENATE,<title>PRESIDENT</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,1,1,speech

Congratulations, Senator.",SENATE,<title>DEPUTY PRESIDENT AND CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,3,1,speech
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2008-08-26,"—On behalf of opposition senators, I warmly congratulate Senator Ferguson on his unopposed election as Deputy President. I should note for the record that it reflects well on Senator Ferguson and the stature that he has in this chamber that he was unopposed as both the Liberal nominee for the position of Deputy President and indeed, I am pleased to say, as the chamber nominee for Deputy President. I thank the government for respecting the convention to which we earlier referred that has as its flipside that the opposition nominates the person for the deputy chair. We thank the Labor Party for respecting that convention.
Of course, we are on our side, as I said in June, disappointed that Senator Ferguson was not able to continue in the position of President. He had but 12 months in that high office in which he demonstrated great dignity, impartiality and presence. He has of course been superbly trained for the position of Deputy President, having served as President. Indeed, as I understand it, there are only four senators in the history of this chamber who have served in both positions, and Senator Ferguson creates history today by being the first to go from President to Deputy President! So your name will be in the history books, Senator Ferguson. I have no doubt that across the chamber we all understand and expect that he will serve with great dignity and professionalism in the position of deputy chair.",SENATE,<title>DEPUTY PRESIDENT AND CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,3,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2008-08-26,"—Mr President, first let me thank you for acknowledging the crossbench. There is a little bit of history there, and I think that is a very positive start to your period as President—and I congratulate you on that. On that matter, I also congratulate Senator Ferguson on being elected Deputy President. Senator Minchin, however, tempts me to comment on this so-called convention: it is nothing of the sort. It is a cosy arrangement between the two big parties and—
Honourable senators interjecting—
—let me just say this—if we do not have an open vote on the best people to be elected to these important chairs, we are devaluing the currency of those positions. If the first act of a Senate is to make an arrangement in party rooms, behind closed doors, between the two big parties—
Honourable senators interjecting—
—then it does not bode—
—Order! Senator Bob Brown is entitled to be heard in silence. I call those interjecting to order.
—It is a very important and grievous matter that I am discussing here. This is not a ‘convention’. There are other words I could use. It is a matter of convenience between the big parties, to the exclusion of the best interests of the Senate and the Australian people, and it ought to be stopped. There ought to be more judicious and sensible thinking coming from the leaders of both the big parties so that, in future, we get a fair and proper and individually based assessment of who will make the best President and Deputy President.",SENATE,<title>DEPUTY PRESIDENT AND CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Election</title>,Miscellaneous,3,1,speech

—It was.
—I am not quite sure. Thank you, Senator Fielding. I look forward to sharing in this role. As I said earlier today, I have worked closely with Senator Hogg now for a number of years, both prior to me becoming President and since that time. I will enjoy working with Senator Hogg in the future for the betterment of this chamber, Senator Brown. I think that anyone who is elected to the position of a presiding officer or a deputy presiding officer does have the interests of this chamber at heart. I certainly have, as I hope I displayed when I was President. When we talk about a convention or, as you choose to use the term, a ‘cosy arrangement’, it represents the strength of the various parties in this chamber.
—It does not.
—It does represent the strength of the various parties in this chamber. Senator Hogg was elected on a vote based on merit. I certainly voted for Senator Hogg because I thought he was the best man for the job, and I think many people over here did as well. I look forward to working with Senator Hogg.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2008-08-26,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I listened carefully to the answer. Given that the minister has not disagreed that price increases fuel inflationary pressures as a general rule, can the minister explain why increasing the tax on and hence the prices of alcopops, cars and gas is not inflationary?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Inflation</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,question
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2008-08-26,"—I add my congratulations, Senator Hogg, on your elevation to President. The government has a very simple approach to trying to rein in inflation, unlike those opposite. This is a government that has inherited the highest level of inflation in 16 years. Those opposite remain in denial about the legacy that they have left ordinary Australians. Those opposite’s solution in the fight against inflation is to irresponsibly blow holes in the budget surplus. That budget surplus has helped the Reserve Bank to indicate that interest rates will possibly be reduced in the future. The Reserve Bank have done that because they have confidence that they have a government that is not asleep at the wheel. They are confident that they have a government that is up to the challenge of tackling interest rates and inflation. They are confident that they have a government that has introduced a responsible budget surplus that has taken some of the pressure off inflation and off interest rate increases. That is why they have given an indication that the interest rate environment is softening in this country. That is because of the responsible economic management adopted by those on this side of the chamber, not the cheap and populist panderings that are going on on the other side from those who have completely walked away from any pretence that they were responsible economic managers. I appreciate that, given that they had allowed the interest rates and inflation to grow and grow and grow—
—Now can you answer the question?
—The question, I understood, was about inflationary pressures. That is what I understood that the question was about. So let me be clear about this: the Reserve Bank have acknowledged in their recent statements that there is a softening in the interest rate environment because they are confident that they have a government that is facing up to the challenge of the highest inflation rate in 16 years, left to this country by those opposite. So the Reserve Bank have indicated that they agree with the budgetary outcome. Let those opposite, at their peril, decide that they want to blow holes in the budget surplus, because they will then once again be responsible.
—Mr President, on a point of order: the question that Senator Conroy was asked, which he has not addressed at all, was about the impact of price increases on inflation. He has not come to that yet and, given the length of time that has elapsed since the question, his answer is so far not material. Could you direct him to the question.
—I will follow the traditional ruling in this chamber. It is not possible for the President to instruct a minister to answer a question in a specific way, and I will adhere to that. I draw the question to the attention of Senator Conroy. There is no point of order at this stage. Senator Conroy, continue to answer the question.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—It is not online. I know you continue to think this. It is actually just a document holder. I am saying that just because you seem to be confused by this, Senator McGauran. It is actually not online—never has been.
—Senator Conroy, address your comments through the chair.
—I return to the issue of inflationary pressures, which is at the heart of the question. This is an opposition that has abandoned any pretence of economic responsibility. It is adopting any cheap, populist line it thinks might harvest votes out there in the broader community. The Australian public will not be fooled by those seeking to make short-term political gains at the expense of the longer term interests of all of Australia and Australians. They recognise and support a government that made some hard choices in the last budget, that put forward to this country a responsible budget which has assisted to take the pressure— (Time expired)
—Senator Coonan, before I ask you for the supplementary question that I believe will come, I say to those on my left that it will assist the chamber immeasurably if they will be quiet during the answers that are being given.

Honourable senators interjecting—
—Senator Conroy, resume your seat. I know people get a little bit excited on the first day back, but I would like a bit of quiet time when Senator Conroy is answering this question.
—As I was saying, for those opposite to try to suggest that the ready-to-drink tax, the luxury car tax, the crude oil excise on condensate and the Medicare levy surcharge threshold can be wantonly opposed in the Senate without having an inflationary impact just shows the level of economic illiteracy of the rabble that is in opposition.

Leave granted.

The document read as follows—

Question asked by Senator Lightfoot of Senator Faulkner, 26 June 2008, regarding travel advisories for Kurdistan:
The current level and content of the travel advice for Iraq is based on the best assessments of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT).
DFAT’s travel advisories are designed to provide information to all Australians—including those who do not have the benefit of special security arrangements provided by their hosts or by private security firms.
There is still a significant threat from terrorist groups across Iraq, including in the Kurdistan Region. Terrorist attacks are indiscriminate, occurring without warning anywhere and at any time in Iraq. There is also still a significant threat on major roads in Iraq from improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and there are ongoing threats to civilian contractors.
The travel advice for Iraq also notes that due to the difficult security environment, the Australian Embassy’s ability to provide consular and passport services is limited, particularly outside Baghdad.
The information on Avian Influenza is standard language in all travel advisories where the WHO has confirmed human cases or deaths. We consult closely with the Department of Health and Ageing (DOHA) on all Avian Influenza matters.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Kurdistan</title>,Questions Without Notice: Additional Answers,7,1,speech

That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy (Senator Conroy) to questions without notice asked by Senators Coonan, Fifield and Sterle today relating to inflation.
I wish to take note of the answers—or should I say ‘non-answers’—given by Senator Conroy today. I am very pleased to see that Senator Conroy has gone scuttling out of the chamber because today we have seen the most pitiful display by the senator purporting to represent the Treasurer. He was incapable of answering straightforward economic questions; namely, he could not explain how his government’s higher taxes will not put up prices. He totally avoided the question. Even though he represents the Treasurer in the Senate, he did not even know the projected surplus over the forward estimates. You can always tell a senator on the other side of the chamber is having trouble answering a question when the best they can do is resort to false and tired rhetoric about the coalition.
We are here looking at what the government is doing. The key test the government set itself in the budget was whether it would strengthen the economy and whether it would put maximum downward pressure on inflation and interest rates. Regrettably, it has failed miserably on both accounts. The Treasurer, Mr Swan, and Senator Conroy have comprehensively failed to explain how increasing taxes on alcopops, gas and cars will somehow reduce inflation. The Treasurer is directly increasing the taxes on cars, alcohol and gas, and by increasing taxes on those goods the prices will go up.
The budget papers also very clearly show that the government expects people to drop out of private health insurance, which will put upward pressure on premiums. Families want to know how increasing the price of these goods and services reduces inflation. Families must be scratching their heads at this. Labor have not lifted a single finger since they have come into government to help those battling with the rising costs of living—with petrol, with groceries, with private health insurance and with home interest rates. Instead, we have these nonsensical policies of watching things go up: watching petrol prices go up, watching grocery prices, watching people leave private health insurance and watching people battle with increased interest rates.
It is a matter of record and it is indisputable—no matter how much those on the other side would like to have it differently—that the former coalition government left the economy in the best shape it has ever been in with real wages increasing by more than 20 per cent, real GDP per capita growing by 32 per cent, unemployment halved, inflation kept at 2.5 per cent on average over the cycle and Labor’s infamous $96 billion debt eliminated so that there was no net debt. Since Labor came to office, increasingly and worryingly there have been signs that they have no plan to strengthen the economy and put downward pressure on inflation. This is affecting business confidence and consumer confidence, which are at the lowest levels we have seen in something like 30 years. Business confidence has plummeted because there is no certainty about Labor’s direction for this economy, apart from the fact that it is slowing. The economy is starting to flag under the Labor government and the signs are they simply have no idea how to handle it and what they are going to do. Labor are wedded to the old ways of managing the economy. We have seen writ large higher spending, higher taxes and higher unemployment, which will all contribute to lower economic growth.
The coalition believes there should be no increase in taxes in a flagging economy where there is a bulging surplus. Labor on the other hand are poor economic managers. It is Australian families who will be paying for Labor’s mismanagement. What hope is there for families struggling with higher prices when the government’s only strategy is to increase taxes? We will continue to hold Labor accountable. We will not be a party to the passage of tax increases that hurt Australian families, put up prices and increase inflation. During the election campaign Labor never mentioned that they would increase taxes. Labor never mentioned that they would raise taxes to build a large slush fund to be used by them before the next election. They offer us nothing but policies like Fuelwatch, a policy so bad their own departments condemned it. (Time expired)

"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2008-08-26,"—It is almost painful to see the opposition desperately seeking a way to justify their irresponsible decisions to oppose the government’s budget measures. Who knows why they are doing this. Obviously, there are leadership tensions, faction tensions within the party and tensions between the Liberal and the National parties within the coalition. Nobody wants to say no to anyone else. Nobody in the Liberal Party is prepared to take leadership and say that the government should be permitted to pass its budget—a budget that is designed to put downward pressure on inflation.
This is sheer short-term opportunistic behaviour and the kind of knee-jerk reaction that we saw over and over again from the coalition parties in government. It is that same old pattern of behaviour when dealing with crises. They go around them and do not deal with them head-on and with long-term responsible economic management. What did we inherit from that kind of behaviour by the Liberal Party when they were in power? The highest inflation in 16 years, 10 interest rate rises in five years and decreased productivity. That is the kind of short-term, opportunistic government that left this government in the situation where we have to have a tight, tough budget to have a surplus that will put downward pressure on inflation.
Now we have the situation where, because they cannot deal with the pressures within their party, because they cannot compete with competing factions, competing Treasurers and competing leaders, they have agreed to oppose budget measures that will put additional taxes on luxury cars and on alcopops. I am amazed—

Senator Cormann interjecting—


Senator Bushby interjecting—

—Stop and listen to yourselves: the battlers who cannot afford to pay increased taxes on luxury cars. Surely even the opposition can see the problem in that. The battlers, the working families in Australia, who cannot afford to pay increased taxes on luxury cars, the battlers in Australia who have to do without ready-to-drink drinks and who cannot afford an increase in tax on them—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order on my left!
—This is the platform upon which you as an opposition are going to go forward into the future, opposing taxes that are reasonable. Senator Coonan kept referring to a tax on gas. It is a tax on condensate, which is not a gas at all. It is the condensate; it is the liquid by-product.
—What is it used for?
—It is used for fuel but it is not gas. This is how the opposition is ducking and twisting and turning and trying to create a story for itself where there is none. This is simply a totally irresponsible—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! There is far too much noise in the chamber.
—It is a totally irresponsible reaction to test out your numbers in the Senate and it does not benefit the Australian public, who are struggling under the inflation and higher interest rates that were caused by the Liberal government. It is the current government that is trying in a tough but fair budget to sort out the problems that were left behind, to put downward pressure on inflation so that people are not dealing with rising prices and so that only those who can afford it are going to be paying the extra tax on luxury cars and on alcopops. It is the gas companies that will have the incentive for gas exploration and development removed. I think the opposition had better have a look at their own policy positions; otherwise they are going to find the polls are not going to improve for them at all.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Budget</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,8,1,speech
"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2008-08-26,"—I should not admit this but I am actually becoming a little misty-eyed today. I am feeling a little bit wistful because I have been reminiscing during question time about a time in our recent history when banks respected and maybe even feared the Treasurer, when the Treasurer of the day did more than watch and when the Treasurer used to speak about economic fundamentals rather than genies and bottles. It was a time when Australia was called the ‘miracle economy’ and the ‘wonder down under’ and a time when a series like The Hollowmen would have been considered satire rather than a documentary. I think fondly back to those days.
In the nine months that this government has been in power things have changed. This government has transformed the Australian economy into one which is slowing and where unemployment is forecast to increase, according to the government’s own budget forecast, by 150-odd thousand. The Reserve Bank of Australia have also predicted a further 100,000 on top of that. Inflation is rising, confidence is at record lows and the economy is on the verge of a swan dive.
Senator Conroy must have been watching too many episodes of The Hollowmen because he tried a bit of satire today. He spoke about punching holes in budget surpluses and black holes. I have to say that the concept of a black hole has certainly changed from my recent experience. Black holes certainly are not what they used to be. I well remember that in 1996 the Labor government left the nation a $10 billion budget deficit. A deficit is a black hole. I well remember Labor leaving us, the nation, $96 billion in Commonwealth government debt. Debt is a black hole. How much help did we get from the Labor Party? None. If you listen to Labor’s view of what a responsible opposition should do, what a responsible Senate should do, you could be forgiven for thinking that Labor in opposition created some sort of Senate nirvana for the coalition government. It was anything but. Labor opposed each and every savings measure we presented to this parliament to repair the budget and to pay down Labor’s debt. But we balanced the budget. We repaid every cent of Labor debt despite that opposition and, at the election, we passed to Labor a government with an asset position, a government that was debt free, a government that was in surplus. Also, we left Labor with record low unemployment and a strongly growing economy.
Clearly that is not a crisis—you would be grateful to inherit that sort of economy—so Labor had to manufacture a crisis. Labor turned an inflation challenge into a crisis. Wayne Swan talked down the economy, talked up inflation and egged on the Reserve Bank to increase interest rates, which is exactly what they did. Having created this sense of crisis, Labor hold out their budget as the only economic hope for the nation. There are a few points to bear about Labor’s budget. On a no-policy-change basis from the previous government, the budget would be in surplus in the order of magnitude of about what Labor have.
Labor’s budget is not built on savings; it is built on new taxes. And Labor have done something that we have not seen before. They are counting revenue—tax—as a saving. This budget is not based on savings; it is based on new taxes. And these taxes were not flagged before the election. Labor cannot claim any sort of mandate theory here. Worse than that, these taxes are inflationary. They are not needed because we left the budget in a strong position in surplus. They were not flagged, they are not needed and they are inflationary.
We have a pretty simple approach to budget matters. Once you have provided for schools, hospitals, defence and security and paid down debt, if you have money left over you should return it because, if you have money left over after providing for services and paying down debt, it means that you are taxing too much. Rather than doing that, this government is increasing taxes. They should be condemned. These taxes were not flagged and they should be opposed.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Budget</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,8,1,speech
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2008-08-26,"—I congratulate you, Mr Deputy President, on your election. In the six years that I have been here it has always been Senator Hogg in that position, so I am pleased to see you in it instead. After having heard Senator Fifield, I see an opposition that while in government must have simply believed its own spin. It got so caught up in spinning itself as an economic manager that it forgot to manage the economy. Now that they are in opposition they want to simply continue that spin with a whole range of nonsense about a slowing economy.
I want to address a couple of issues to do with the economy. Senator Fifield blatantly misled the Senate about the state of the economy. I want to get back to the tax cuts that were just delivered by this government. I want to get back to the state that you left the economy in for this government. You did not mention the many interest rate rises that you had. You did not mention the record inflation rate that we had when you left government. Your spin and the couple of issues that you want to rely on do not paint the full picture.
—Senator Marshall, I think that you should address the chair.
—I am sorry, Mr Deputy President. I note that Senator Hogg would not have let me get away with that either. Let us look at some of the examples. Let us look at the figures for people employed. If we are going to talk about an economy which they say is slowing, let us look at some of the statistics. In December 2007 there were 10,607,100 people employed. The latest figures that we have available from the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that in July 2008 10,721,500 were employed—a substantial increase in employed persons. That is not the sign of a slowing economy.
The average weekly time earnings in the December quarter 2007 was $1,111. In the June quarter of 2008 it was $1,131.40. Those figures are taken from the ABS statistics. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for November 2007, when we were elected to government, was 4.5 per cent. In July 2008 it was 4.3 per cent. The long-term unemployment rate in November 2007 was 14.1 per cent. In July 2008 it was 13.7 per cent. The number of long-term unemployed persons in November 2007 was 70,300. In July 2008 it was 68,200—tracking down.
Senator Fifield wants to get up and mislead the Senate with this general spin that they learnt when in government, when they did not have to do anything of substance but just spun the line that they were great economic managers. What they did was take their foot off the accelerator; they took their eye off the ball—and we can use a million sporting analogies as we have just been through the Olympics; they could be endless. What they did was forget to manage the economy. They started to believe their own rhetoric and spin. Even though they had been warned by the Reserve Bank, they left us with record high inflation. We have to address that, and so it was a tough budget.
But let us not forget that that budget also delivered $46.7 billion in tax cuts to working families. Senator Fifield comes in here and says that we give nothing back and it is just about some tax grabs—which are in a number of very small areas and are really about tax equalisation and some adjustments, and if I have time I will get into some of the detail of that—but there were $46.7 billion in tax cuts to working Australians. Do not come in here and tell us that it is all about a tax grab. Nothing could be further from the truth.
This government has built a strong budget surplus of $22 billion to help put downward pressure on interest rates. And what is happening? It has been flagged by the RBA that interest rates should start to drop. We cannot wait for the day that we will reap the benefits of our tough budget and our $22 billion surplus. We are responsible economic managers and are starting to put that downward pressure on interest rates. (Time expired)

"Bushby, Sen David",LP,2008-08-26,"—It has been interesting listening to the government senators today.
—I am going to stay for your speech.
—I am glad you are, because there are some things that I have to say that might help Senator Marshall understand a little bit better what has been going on in the Australian economy over the last nine months. I was very interested to hear some comments that were made by Senator Hurley. She is a senator whom I have a lot of respect for. I am with her on the economics committee, and she is a very sensible and capable woman. However, over the last six or seven weeks I have been travelling with her and hearing evidence from all over the country about many of the budget measures that we are discussing today. I could see her constantly cringing as the overwhelming evidence that was presented quite clearly proved that the government’s budget measures were not the way to be going. I almost felt sorry for her as she tried to defend the government’s position on condensate, Fuelwatch, the luxury car tax, the Medicare levy and so on. But despite that, she came in here today and tried once again to valiantly defend the government’s position.
Senator Marshall tried to talk the economy up, and I will have more to say on that in a minute. But even Treasury, in their government budget papers, noted a prediction that 185,000 job losses would result from the budget measures. The reality is that big companies are already shedding jobs. You just have to look at the major announcements that have been made in the last couple of months by Ford, and by Cadbury which is in my own state. The list goes on.
By any measure, the Rudd Labor government inherited a strong, resilient and flexible economy. The Australian economy remains robust and resilient but it is showing clear signs of weakening since Mr Rudd took office. I heard an analogy which I think was quite appropriate. You think of a very well-maintained, modern plane which is flying along and then you hit a rough patch in the air. In the past, when we have had the rough patches in this well-maintained plane, we have had some very experienced pilots up the front who actually took us through and you had a sense of confidence as you went forward. But now we have the inexperienced pilots straight out of flight school up the front and although we have a nice, solid, resilient plane we have these inexperienced people at the front as we go through this rough patch. It worries me where we are heading. You just have to have a look at what has happened already in nine months to see that we really are facing some problems.
The S&P 200 index for the Australian stock market has fallen from 6,330.2 to 4,981.1, a fall of 21.3 per cent compared with a fall of only 12.6 per cent on the US S&P 500. So we are doing worse than they are in the US, contrary to what most people would think. The Reserve Bank has increased official interest rates by 0.5 percentage points since the Rudd government came in. Under the Rudd government mortgage interest rates have risen to levels not seen since Labor was last in office. Small business overdraft rates, now at around 12 per cent, are at levels not seen since 1992. They have increased 1.15 percentage points since the election. Inflation has increased to 4.5 per cent, a rate not seen since the last Labor government, if your exclude the one-off GST effect.
The Melbourne Institute’s most recent survey results show that consumer inflationary expectations are high with the median expected inflation rate at 4.9 per cent. They are expecting it to go up even further. The proportion of survey respondents expecting annual inflation to fall within the Reserve Bank’s target band of two to three per cent is only 8.8 per cent, which is lower than the average over the last year of 12 per cent. During the coalition’s term in office median inflationary expectations averaged 3.1 per cent, which was the best average performance of any government since the survey began. In contrast, since the Rudd government has taken office, median inflationary expectations have averaged 4.9 per cent. That is the highest nine-month average since 1991 when Labor was last in office.
The Reserve Bank also conducts a survey of inflationary expectations and publishes the results in its Statement on Monetary Policy. The RBA’s data shows that, between August and November 2007, expectations among market economists of 2008-09 inflation actually fell. Market economists expected inflation to be going down late last year yet union officials expected inflation to remain steady. Since Mr Swan started talking up inflation back at the beginning of February, expectations of inflation among market economists have increased in every RBA survey. (Time expired)

"Evans, Sen Chris (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",ALP,2008-08-26,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate records its deep regret at the death of Signaller Sean Patrick McCarthy on 8 July 2008 while on combat operations in Afghanistan and places on record its appreciation of his service to his country and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.
On behalf of all government senators, and I am sure on behalf of all senators, I wish to express my heartfelt condolences to Signaller McCarthy’s mother and father, Mary and David, and to his sisters, Leigh and Clare, and to express our sympathy to his whole extended family and friends including, of course, his fellow service men and women.
Signaller McCarthy was a patriotic Australian, an outstanding soldier and a valued member of the Special Air Service Regiment and the Royal Australian Corps of Signals. The Special Air Service Regiment, as we all know, has a long tradition of exceptional service to the defence of Australia, and Signaller McCarthy was the embodiment of the courage, professionalism and endurance that are hallmarks of this elite unit. He displayed great strength, determination and courage while serving in the challenging environments of East Timor and Afghanistan.
Unfortunately Signaller McCarthy lost his life serving his country and is owed a special debt of gratitude that can never be fully repaid. Members of parliament, and I think members of both the previous government and this government, understand the huge responsibility of asking our service personnel to serve their country in war zones, and we all feel very deeply the cost that our service men and women sometimes pay in carrying out those duties. I think it always a useful reminder to us all of the responsibilities we have in terms of trying to ensure that they are not put in harms way but that when they are we provide them with the best support we can.
Signaller McCarthy served his country admirably in a number of zones. His work with his comrades in spreading security in Oruzgan province is noble and enduring. Through his work the Taliban were weakened, the reach of the Afghan government was extended and the environment in which our troops undertake vital reconstruction work was made secure. His comrades continue that vital work. They continue to honour his memory and to honour his commitment to the task.
Signaller McCarthy’s sacrifice will not be forgotten. On behalf of the Australian government, we offer our prayers and our support to Signaller McCarthy’s family and friends and thank them for his sacrifice and service to his nation.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Signaller Sean Patrick McCarthy</title>,Condolences,9,1,speech

He was someone who was on his second tour of duty in Afghanistan, and of course all our best wishes and thoughts are with his family and friends.
It does remind us of the extreme danger which Australian personnel face in Afghanistan, but it is also a reminder of the importance of that struggle, and I think his family and friends should take comfort from the fact that there is in this country bipartisan support for our engagement in Afghanistan and that Sean McCarthy died for a noble cause—the cause of containing terrorism and of trying to bring peace and stability to the nation of Afghanistan to enable the people of Afghanistan to live in peace and security. It is an important cause, and we should all renew our commitment to that cause.

We all have to aspire to a future when the world will be rid of violence, war and destruction. It is no way for human affairs to be handled. But, in the meantime, it is still part of the way in which the world does malfunction.
On behalf of this nation, Signaller Sean McCarthy was in Afghanistan and died in Afghanistan. His body has now been brought home to this nation, which he served bravely and courageously. He was honoured by Australia’s Chief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, with the words:
On his previous tour in Afghanistan he was recognised by the Special Operations Commander for his courage and mission focus, including a specific commendation for maintaining his presence of mind and excellent soldier skills while in contact with the enemy.

That the Senate take note of the report.
I will try not to speak too long on this. I understand some other senators may wish to speak on this matter as well. I am pleased to note the tabling of the report of the inquiry into an opposition private member’s bill entitled Save Our Solar (Solar Rebate Protection) Bill 2008 [No. 2], which was considered by the Senate Standing Committee on the Environment, Communications and the Arts. The bill requires new rebate guidelines to be determined via a legislative instrument subject to parliamentary scrutiny and potential disallowance by either house of parliament but effectively by the Senate.
The opposition hoped that the inquiry from this bill would uncover some kind of approaching Armageddon in the PV solar panel industry in Australia. However, the inquiry found that the industry, while changing, is in fact very robust because Australian consumers and domestic households in particular are taking up rebates offered under the government’s rebate program at higher rates than before the budget announcement about the means test.
The committee received 150 submissions from witnesses in this inquiry and we heard evidence in Canberra, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth and Brisbane and telephone evidence from other states and territories. The majority report is supportive of the government’s handling of the rebate program and it recommends that the opposition bill does not proceed.
The report’s main findings include the increased uptake of the Solar Homes and Communities Plan since the budget. A recommendation addresses the fact that households are installing systems of around one kilowatt that are largely affordable within the maximum rebate allowable of $8,000, while perhaps larger sized systems would be preferable. The committee also found that the industry itself would much prefer the introduction of a feed-in tariff scheme that offers more certainty over a longer period of time than rebate schemes which can be vulnerable to government policy or, as this bill anticipated, vulnerable to the whim of the Senate.
I note in that context that several states and territories are putting in place, have considered or are considering feed-in tariff schemes to further support the use of solar PV systems and possibly other forms of microrenewable energy. The government recognises that fact and agrees that adopting an approach that is as consistent as possible across the country can go a long way in helping reduce the regulatory burden and costs on the electricity market as well as on consumers. I am pleased to note that COAG will consider options for a harmonised approach to feed-in tariffs at its October meeting this year. The committee that inquired into this bill will also be examining such a scheme during our coming inquiry into the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment (Feed-in-Tariff) Bill 2008.
The opposition has put in a fairly predictable dissenting report which projects gloom and doom in the industry, an industry that is actually showing signs of moving from being a cottage industry to being a very mature industry. Yes, there are some adjustments. But we are also seeing potential investment in the industry from companies operating in the global market.
The opposition, throughout this inquiry, did nothing to address the repeated calls of the industry in Australia for certainty about what was going to happen in the future, and instead we had the opposition, throughout this inquiry, whipping up fear and uncertainty in the PV industry by alleging—like Chicken Little—that the world was going to end, the sun was going to stop shining and that everything was going to be disastrous when, in fact, there was no good evidence to support that at all.
It was intriguing that earlier on today in this chamber we heard, on a number of occasions, other senators on this side noting that the opposition could have different opinions on the same topic on different days, depending on which different members of the opposition were speaking. We heard that certainly in the context of the River Murray during question time. It is not unusual for this opposition to support something one day and then reject it the next, and perhaps that is why they were rejecting a policy that, with regard to the means test on the rebate scheme, is in fact a policy very similar to their own. I wonder whether they have forgotten about the $100,000 means test on solar hot water rebates that was implemented by the then Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, Mr Malcolm Turnbull, when that program was introduced in July 2007. It is probably worth reiterating that on the 17 July 2007, Mr Turnbull issued a press release stating:
The rebate is available to eligible applicants who are replacing existing electric storage hot water systems with eligible solar or heat pump systems purchased and installed after today and verified by a registered agent. The home must be a principal place of residence and the applicant’s taxable family income must be less than $100,000.
That sounds very familiar. Never let the facts and history get in the way of a good story when it comes to the opposition!
Our change to the Solar Homes and Communities Plan rebate brings it into line with the Solar Hot Water Rebate Program. That program, as I said, was introduced by the previous government. So we have brought those two programs into line but, more importantly, we have greatly increased the funding available for the program per year. Whereas the previous government’s plan was to budget $150 million over five years for 15,000 rebates, I am proud to say my government dedicated $150 million over three years for 15,000 rebates in the recent budget and we doubled the number of rebates available from 3,000 to 6,000, doubling our election commitment and doubling what the previous government had budgeted for this year.
With the ongoing success of this program, we have now said that we will continue to meet demand for the program—a fact that the opposition chooses not to throw into the mix of scaremongering when it is whipping up the industry to be afraid of the future of government support for renewable energy sources in this country. It is clear that the driving force behind the opposition bill was that it hoped for—it actually wanted—a decrease in the number of solar rebate applications following the introduction of the means test. That is what it wanted, and it was very disappointed when the numbers did not stack up and the number of rebates increased.
As of a couple of weeks ago, an average of 522 applications per week had been lodged since the budget for the rebate available under this excellent program. That is 150 more applications per week than were made prior to the budget and way beyond the 30 weekly applications at the time of the last coalition budget. In one week alone we noted that there were 794 applications for the rebate, post the budget change which included a means test so that this program could be targeted at low-income Australian families who most need assistance to install alternative energy sources in their homes.
Of course, I could go on about other excellent measures that the government has taken to improve the uptake of renewable energy sources, not just in people’s homes but in our communities and schools, but perhaps I will leave that for another day, given the time. The committee did note, as I said, the trend to smaller systems as people use the maximum amount of rebate to buy what they can afford, and the committee realise that that trend is not new. In fact, it started when the previous government increased the rebate to $8,000, and that information was verified by the federal Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts. The department alerted us to that fact.
The fact that solar systems are becoming more affordable for low-income families is an excellent thing, a great thing for our nation. Actually, that is exactly what a former environment minister, Ian Campbell—they have had a few former environment ministers over there—called for in 2006 when he said that the solar rebate scheme should be targeted at low-income families. But, of course, that was another day and another position from the opposition on this very important issue.
In closing, I would like to thank the other members of the committee, who participated in this inquiry with goodwill and cooperation.

I am amazed to have heard Senator McEwen wanting to talk about certainty for the industry in regard to this inquiry. I am quite amazed because Senator McEwen knows all too well that this is an industry desperate for certainty, desperate for clarity, and it is finding absolutely none of it from the current government.
What was very clear through this inquiry was that the introduction of means testing came with absolutely no consultation with the industry beforehand. They had every belief, every high hope going into the budget this year, that the new Rudd government would, if anything, expand support for their industry. They believed quite strongly that the new Rudd government would actually deliver for the solar industry, because they had seen all the hype. They had heard all the noise. They had seen the now Prime Minister go and stand alongside solar operators just outside Canberra. They saw him actually stand beside Phil May at his business, Solartec, praise the industry and talk about the potential of the solar industry.
They had every reason to believe that the new government was going to be a friend of the industry, and yet instead what happened on 13 May this year with absolutely no hint, no consultation, nothing at all, was of course that the government—the government that had with much fanfare signed Kyoto, the government that had spent the entire election campaign talking about climate change at every opportunity—just suddenly introduced a means test on the solar panels rebate. It did so at a time when the industry itself was just starting to gain some confidence, was just really taking off. It did so at a time when the industry was looking forward to the future, having built strong capacity in that sector.
Having seen the rebate increase from $4 per watt to $8 per watt up to a maximum of $8,000 early in 2007, the industry had confidence in its future. It had confidence that the rebate was there to stay to meet demand, and it had that confidence because the coalition government had given a five-year commitment and appropriation to the rebate. It had confidence that the funds would be there because the then Prime Minister himself gave a public and personal commitment that, if demand outstripped the funds that had been allocated, more funds would be made available. That was the type of certainty the industry had enjoyed. It enjoyed the clear certainty of a five-year program, an $8,000 rebate with funding committed by the then Prime Minister.
Instead, we get the change of government. Despite all their rhetoric around climate change, they come in and pull the rug of certainty out from underneath the solar industry. They pull that rug of certainty out and leave the industry with a program radically diminished. It is radically diminished because they cut the length of the program from five years down to three years. It is radically diminished because they cut off at the knees the types of installations happening in this sector that were going to give it the capacity and strength it needed for the long term. By that I particularly mean the size of the installations that were occurring.
The most damning evidence we received during this inquiry came quite clearly from those who said that the size of solar systems being installed was now much smaller than had been the case previously. In fact, when the government officials finally appeared at this inquiry—and I will come back to the government’s approach to the inquiry in a moment—we saw evidence given that the size of the systems had reduced by more than 20 per cent. It is not that the government is actually giving smaller rebates—the government is still giving the maximum $8,000 rebate for each of these systems—but it is doing so and getting 20 per cent less renewable energy as a result. I would love to hear Mr Garrett try to tell us how it is a good policy outcome to spend $8,000 a pop to generate 20 per cent less renewable energy thanks to his policy of means testing. What he has done by introducing the means test is he has cut out all of those households who could actually afford to put in larger systems—households that were looking at putting in three-kilowatt or four-kilowatt systems, households that would have put in systems that would have met their own energy consumption and fed into the national grid. They have been cut out of the system as a result of this means testing.
Instead, we hear the government wanting to crow about the fact that applications have continued to increase. Yes, applications have continued to increase. They have increased for a number of reasons. One of those reasons is the surge in bulk purchase schemes of the smallest possible system. The Queensland government themselves introduced a bulk purchase scheme for 1,000 systems of one kilowatt in size—so the smallest system to get $8,000. We saw them introduce that scheme in a manner that has artificially propped up the number of applications for the smallest possible system. They are one-kilowatt systems that will not meet the energy demands of most of the households, certainly will not feed into the grid, and are a long way short of actually delivering the type of growth in renewable energy, the type of growth in capacity in the industry, that is needed. So one reason we see the surge in numbers is certainly this surge in bulk purchase schemes.
Another reason we see this surge in numbers is actually the very lack of that certainty that Senator McEwen was speaking of before, because the industry and consumers are concerned that, having seen a means test implemented, having cut off a large swathe of the population—all households with a gross income over $100,000—from being eligible for this rebate, people are understandably concerned that maybe the whole rebate will go sometime soon. Of course, as speculation mounts that that whole rebate could be cut off, people are getting in while they still can. They are getting the applications in. They are scared at the lack of certainty given by this government and so they are getting in and boosting those short-term applications.
There are also concerns because you are now dealing with a much smaller marketplace. We did not have one industry operator come to us and tell us that this was good policy—far from it; every industry operator who came to us came and said they thought this was a bad policy decision. They came and told us that they had lost sales as a result. Most told us that in fact they had not managed to sell a single photovoltaic system to a household which was over the means test threshold. So that entire section of the community has been cut off from purchasing systems because there is no incentive.
Many people came to us and said to us that they were happy to spend a little bit more on a system—that, indeed, if they had to dip into their pockets a little deeper, they would have done so. But for households who were looking at contributing between $5,000 and $15,000 of their own hard-earned towards buying a system, suddenly discovering that it was going to cost them an extra $8,000 on top of that was just too big a burden to bear. So it is little wonder that that sector of the population now are not purchasing systems.
There is a concern, with a rush in households under the threshold but no market in households over the threshold, about what is going to happen. Slowly but surely there is concern in the industry that that rush in the marketplace will dry up. Many people put it to us that the government had messed up its priorities on this—that it had confused what is an environmental objective with social policy objectives. As one witness put it to us quite clearly, ‘Carbon emissions are not means tested.’ Far from it. In fact, of course, a lot of those larger households with larger household incomes are emitting more—they are using more energy. So, far from it being that their emissions are means tested, it is quite the reverse. Yet the government for some reason wants to means test an environmental policy—and they did so in the crudest and bluntest of possible ways: a $100,000 household means test. (Time expired)

"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2008-08-26,"—I rise to comment on the Save Our Solar (Solar Rebate Protection) Bill 2008 [No. 2] report. One of the problems with a government-dominated committee system is that the report does not actually reflect the evidence that came before the committee. The overwhelming majority of submissions came out saying strongly that the means test was a bad idea, that it had not worked, and that, quite apart from how many were taking it up, what it did do was reinforce the stop-start-stop nature of government support, or lack of support, for solar. As a result, accountants were saying to businesses: ‘We are not prepared to have a five-year business plan or a 10-year business plan because we have no certainty. This could be cut off again next year.’ What they overwhelmingly said was that, whilst they want the rebate reinstated in the way it was and to get rid of the means test, what they really wanted was a gross feed-in tariff to give certainty into the long term for industry. Overwhelmingly, businesses came before us and said that they had been planning on putting on more staff, expanding the business and so on and have not been able to do it because they now have no certainty.
The really interesting thing with this is that the government is facing an embarrassing situation. My understanding is that, since the budget, they have had around 6,000 applications and all the money that was budgeted is effectively gone—in four months what was effectively a year’s allocation is gone. What is the government going to do now? Is it going to say, ‘Our intention at the start was that it is overheating—that is, we are spending too much money on this’? It is actually the planet that is overheating, not anything else. So the upshot here is that the government have a situation where they have so many applications they have run out of 12 month’s budget in four months. What next? When are we going to have the announcement from the government saying that the rebate is over for this year? Or are we going to see an announcement from the government saying, ‘Next year’s budget allocation is going to be brought forward,’ which is clearly one thing they could do and should do in order to make sure that there is no stop-start again, because you will have a stop in a minute if you have spent all the money allocated in the first four months since the budget. What are we going to do? Wait eight months before the rebate starts again? What is the government going to do?
I put to the government, and particularly Minister Garrett: what are you going to do now? The solar rebate was overheating and now it has boiled over completely. They have spent the money and they have run out of their allocation for this year. Bring forward next year’s allocation at the very least so that things do not stop. More particularly, there has to be a huge amount of effort going into getting a national gross feed-in tariff because it is very clear the community wants to be enabled to take up photovoltaics. The community also wants to be enabled to go beyond rooftop solar and to have, for example, utility size solar thermal facilities.
I welcome Premier Carpenter’s announcement yesterday in Western Australia that he is bringing in a gross feed-in tariff, but again it is only at residential scale. We need it to be for utility scale as well. We need this to be rolled out on a large scale because the lie has been put absolutely to the claims that have gone on around this place for years that renewable energy is only a fringe dweller and cannot produce the kinds of loads we need. It not only can but would, if it were enabled to do so.
I respect the fact that the government have at least acknowledged that the submissions have overwhelmingly said a gross feed-in tariff is where people want to go. I am glad the government have acknowledged that the changes have simply meant that there are smaller systems and so we are not getting the maximum uptake of renewable energy that we could from the rebate that is being paid. But the big question hanging in the air for every solar business is: what is going to happen now that the rebate is fully taken up?
Could the government and Minister Garrett tell us: has the full amount been expended—applied for and effectively allocated? If so, what are you going to do about it? Is next year’s allocation going to be brought forward? Please announce it soon, because every one of the small businesses whom we have spoken to and who have put in submissions wants to know. If you have this massive application load now and they are refused on the basis that the allocation has run out, then that will dry up and these small businesses will be stuck for the next eight months—going out of business, having to put people off. It will just be reinforced that, as long as the solar industry is dependent on the whims of government ministers deciding on the basis of budget allocations whether they want to stoke or choke renewable energy, we are just going to have a situation where investors, venture capitalists in particular, are going to back away.
I think it is unfortunate that this report does not reflect the evidence that came before the committee more accurately. Nonetheless, I look forward to a gross feed-in tariff. I have a bill in front of the Senate and I am looking forward to the inquiry into it. But what we need right now is not only an acknowledgement from the government that there have been a lot of applications but the acknowledgement that the money has been expended. The question we want the answer to is: what is going to happen for the next eight months?",SENATE,<title>SAVE OUR SOLAR (SOLAR REBATE PROTECTION) BILL 2008 [NO. 2]</title>,"<title>Report of Environment, Communication and the Arts Committee</title>",Bills,19,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2008-08-26,"—I start my contribution with a quotation:
The Rudd Government does not appear to be serious about tackling global warming. Rudd’s claim that ‘climate change is the great moral challenge of our age’ has clearly been forgotten or blatantly disregarded.
That quote comes not from a Liberal Party fancier but from none other than Mr Dean Mighell, the State Secretary of the Electrical Trades Union, Southern States Branch, in his submission to the inquiry. This act by the Rudd Labor government at budget time, without any warning, without any mandate, without any consultation—simply introducing a means test for the subsidy—clearly shows how hypocritical the Rudd government is in relation to climate change and alternative energy.
Unfortunately, I was only able to attend one day of the hearings. Somewhere along the line it got difficult for the participating members to find out when the committee was sitting. The day of hearings that I sat through in Melbourne clearly showed that the industry, environment groups, community groups, councils and individuals from the general public were absolutely aghast at a government that many of them conceded they had voted for because, amongst other things, they liked Mr Rudd’s ideas about Kyoto and saving the planet’s environment. They went with him in the election in 2007, and they more than others felt absolutely betrayed by the action in relation to the means test on this rebate. We heard witness after witness in Melbourne and we read submission after submission of those that came in—small businesses, industry people and tradesmen whose lifelong ambition to have a successful small business was shattered by Mr Rudd overnight on budget night.
The submissions we got mirrored the response I got the day after the budget in Townsville in North Queensland, where I have my office—a city that boasts 300 days of sunshine every year and, because of that, a city that is very keen on the use of solar energy. Two small business men in Townsville came to me almost in tears. One of them admitted that for the first time ever he had voted Labor because he had liked Mr Rudd’s approach to the environment and to alternative energies in particular. They were almost in tears because the businesses they had been building up over the last two to three years were shattered overnight. They gave facts of people ringing up the day after the budget saying: ‘I’m sorry. I know I have a contract with you, but I simply cannot afford to go through with it.’ I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2008-08-26,"—I seek leave to return to a prior item on the agenda—namely, the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade report on Australia’s involvement in peace-keeping operations.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I want to talk to the tabling of a rather important report into Australia’s more recent involvement in peace-keeping operations. It is an important report because, over time, the nature of our peace-keeping missions has changed quite dramatically. In the early years, Australia served in small contingents, primarily as military observers monitoring truce lines with the consent of the host countries, particularly in the Middle East, Syria and Egypt. In recent times, though, Australia has engaged in peace-keeping missions that have been both complex and broad in scope. Most of these operations now involve intrastate conflict, internal conflict, and have been difficult and at times quite dangerous undertakings. Australians deployed to these complex missions have included more recently not only military personnel but also active representatives from agencies such as DFAT, AusAID, the Australian Electoral Commission and Treasury, to name a few, as well as large numbers of police and, increasingly, scientific experts.
Regional engagement is a major element in Australia’s current involvement in peacekeeping. Indeed, Australia’s significant commitment and lead role in operations in the region is one of the more recent notable developments. For example, as we all know, Australia commands the International Force for East Timor and leads the regional mission to the Solomon Islands. These operations indicate the growing importance of Australia engaging in peacekeeping and leading peace-keeping missions in this part of the world. They also show that the scope of today’s peace-keeping operations has expanded and continues to expand to focus on helping to create long-term stability in what is properly described as a set of fragile states.
The committee’s inquiry centred on Australia’s whole-of-government, whole-of-nation approach to peace-keeping operations—that is, from the earliest decision making and planning stages to the final reporting and evaluation stages that occur. The committee’s two key recommendations were directed at developing and improving whole-of-government policy on Australia’s engagement in peacekeeping. The committee found a most compelling argument for a white paper on Australia’s involvement in peacekeeping. Despite dramatic changes to peace-keeping operations, particularly over the last 10 or 12 years, and Australia’s increased and broadening engagement in such missions, there is, to date, no policy document that presents a whole-of-government approach to peacekeeping. The committee believes it is time for such a document to be put together and published by government. The production of a white paper would provide government and its agencies with the opportunity to review their policies and practices and would enable a better understanding of how each group’s activities contribute to the whole-of-government effort.
The committee welcomed the government’s decision to establish an Asia-Pacific centre for civil-military cooperation. Based on the evidence, however, the committee could see advantages in expanding the scope of the institution’s mandate. It was concerned that important decisions were being made about the role, the function and structure of the centre without a proper scoping study. There are now a number of highly regarded overseas institutions in this field. The committee recommended that a specially selected task force conduct such a scoping study. The team would visit existing peace-keeping institutes to help them formulate recommendations on the centre’s design to ensure that it becomes the hub of a national network of institutions, a national repository of information and learning on peacekeeping, a regional centre of excellence and a vital part of the international web of similar institutes throughout the world.
The committee made recommendations about the fundamental elements that should be articulated in a mission’s mandate. In this regard, the committee emphasised the importance of having an exit strategy. The committee argued that an exit strategy would provide a road map—that is, a structured plan for achieving the stated purpose—and contain benchmarks against which progress toward those objectives can be measured. It recommended that, when considering a proposed peace-keeping operation, the government examine in detail the mission’s exit strategy to ensure Australia’s contribution is part of a well-planned and structured approach to achieving clearly stated objectives.
A number of recommendations were made to ensure peacekeepers are better prepared to meet the challenge of today’s mission. In particular, the committee emphasised the importance of interoperability at all levels and between all elements of an operation. It found the ADF and the AFP have not always been able to operate smoothly together in the field. This is due in some measure to a lack of familiarity and important differences in work culture. It also found current peace-keeping training programs for Australian public servants could be better structured in keeping with the whole-of-government approach. Australian NGOs could also improve their standard of training for their people who are sometimes involved in peace-keeping operations. The committee recommended that defence review its CIMIC doctrine and consider ways to strengthen its CIMIC capability. The committee also noted that NGOs could facilitate better coordination with the military through better organisation and liaison amongst themselves. DFAT and AusAID could also assist cooperation and coordination between government and NGO sectors by extending activities beyond briefings to joint training and collaborative planning.
The committee recognised that the relationship with the host country and other partners in a peace-keeping operation is critical to the success of a mission. However, building a constructive coalition sometimes presents quite large challenges. The committee found that to produce effective peacekeepers Australia must prepare its personnel to be part of an Australian force, a partner of the host country and a member of a coalition of participating countries.
The committee stressed the importance of predeployment language and cultural awareness training. It also recommended that exchange programs and joint exercises with personnel from countries in the region continue as a high priority. It suggested that such activities form part of a broader coherent whole-of-government strategy to build a greater peacekeeping capacity in this part of the world.
In considering the health, safety and wellbeing of Australian peacekeepers, the committee identified a number of concerns. They related to the accessibility of data on the health of Australian peacekeepers. There are inadequacies in the ADF’s health records management and postdeployment care of peacekeepers with respect to mental health problems. The report made a number of recommendations to rectify these identified deficiencies.
I have referred to the committee’s recommendations for a white paper and for an expanded and more ambitious Asia-Pacific centre for civil-military cooperation. They are the means to inculcate a culture of continuous learning and continuous improvement in Australia’s peacekeepers. The committee noted that if government agencies are to learn from and build upon their experiences in peacekeeping then they need to strengthen their evaluation and lessons-learnt processes.
Last year marked the 60th anniversary of Australia’s commitment to peacekeeping. I take this opportunity to acknowledge all who have contributed to a series of peace-keeping missions over the years. Finally, I wish to place on the public record my thanks for the invaluable assistance provided by Dr Dermody and her staff on the relevant Senate committee. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

That the following matters be referred to the Community Affairs Committee for inquiry and report by 26 November 2008:
exemptions for the Exclusive Brethren and its members from Australian laws or administrative decisions;
public funding, tax or other arrangements which do or may advantage the Exclusive Brethren over other community organisations;
the activities of the Exclusive Brethren or its members which threaten or harm families, in particular, the best interests of children;
the covert, as against overt, activities of the Exclusive Brethren or its members in the political process in Australia; and
any related matters.
There has been a great deal of public disquiet about the Exclusive Brethren sect, which now Prime Minister Rudd as shadow foreign affairs minister commented upon back in September 2006 when he called for a review of federal funding of Exclusive Brethren schools. He said:
On their role in politics ... they are such a secret society and secret sect ... But my broader concern goes to the extent that the Exclusive Brethren-run schools. The Exclusive Brethren, based on my advice, actively discourages children from using information technology, from learning how to use computers properly because they will provide avenues of contact with the outside world.
As opposition leader in August last year, when stating that he had refused to meet with Exclusive Brethren members and calling on then Prime Minister John Howard to come clean on his links with the Exclusive Brethren, Mr Rudd said:
I believe this is an extremist cult and sect. I also believe that it breaks up families, I also believe that there are real problems with the provision of modern education to kids under their system where they, for example, are not given full range of access to the full range of information technology ...
I can add to that the fact that some thousands of Australian children who happen to have grown up within the Exclusive Brethren sect are denied their proper and free opportunity to tertiary education in this country. I cannot imagine any religious—or other sect, for that matter—getting away without a thorough inquiry into their denying thousands of Australian children their basic and fundamental right to tertiary education. It simply would not happen.
The Exclusive Brethren, who are prodigious lobbyists right across the political spectrum and in all parliaments in Australia, state and territory as well as federal, manage to deny these kids—thousands of them—their right to a tertiary education. It is as if they have some other right as part of the Australian community and are able to withdraw, quite arbitrarily, this fundamental right of those children who happen to have been brought up within the sect.
The inquiry I am proposing would look at such matters. It perhaps would also look at the $10 million paid to five Exclusive Brethren schools around Australia in January this year. Those schools have a combined population of just 2,000 students. Over the next four years, these same schools will collect almost $50 million in taxpayer subsidies. An additional $502,000 in funds under the federal Investing in Our Schools Program will go to them, and that program allows smaller grants for the construction of projects costing less than $75,000.
The Prime Minister is quite right about the way in which the Exclusive Brethren orders its education program. He has referred in particular to the difficultly in the past of children in those schools getting access to computers and technology. They were banned for a long time. That has changed more recently under an arrangement whereby the Elect Vessel of the Exclusive Brethren, who is a multimillionaire, has set up a company to specifically give or sell computers within the Exclusive Brethren sect that are particularly dealt with to prevent the essential outside contact that computers give to children generally in this nation.
The Australian Federal Police are still investigating the Exclusive Brethren’s $370,000 donation to then Prime Minister Howard’s coalition in the 2004 federal election. I think the Senate has every right to ask why, four years after a large donation was made to a political party in this parliament, the Australian Federal Police have not completed that inquiry and reported publicly. What is it that has taken so long about that inquiry, which was initiated after concerns were expressed by the Australian Electoral Commission? Then in April this year, after 33 ex-brethren members called on Prime Minister Kevin Rudd to support this inquiry that we are now dealing with in the Senate, a letter came from Mr Rudd’s chief of staff, David Epstein, to Mr Peter Flinn, who had sent that letter on behalf of the 33 ex-brethren members. In that letter Mr Epstein said:
The Prime Minister has asked me to acknowledge and respond to your letter dated 25 February written for and on behalf of 33 ex-members of the Exclusive Brethren.
I acknowledge, in particular, the moving personal accounts contained in the thirteen ‘life stories’ appended to that letter.
I am not able to provide the Senate with those life stories, for two reasons. Firstly, they are very harrowing and personal. However, I invite any senator who wants to, to see those stories. Secondly, and more importantly and of greater concern, the people who wrote those stories fear punitive action from the Exclusive Brethren hierarchy against them or their loved ones, particularly those who are still in the brethren, were their identities to be revealed. The letter from Mr Epstein went on to say:
The Prime Minister does not resile from the views he expressed last year about the Exclusive Brethren. In particular, the Prime Minister remains concerned about the reported imposition of doctrines that weaken family bonds. He also remains concerned about reported doctrines that prevent children accessing online learning tools.
The letter goes on:
I note your observations on the role played by Exclusive Brethren members in recent Australian electoral campaigns. The Government is committed to enhancing transparency in our electoral system and has recently announced reforms related to the disclosure and sources of donations. A Green Paper on electoral reform will be released for comment later this year.
While appreciating your deeply held concerns, the Prime Minister cannot agree to your request for a wide-ranging inquiry into the Exclusive Brethren. The Government believes that such an inquiry could unreasonably interfere with the capacity of members of the Exclusive Brethren to practise their faith freely and openly.
Religious observance should not be regarded as a shield behind which breaches of the law can be hidden.
It then goes on to say:
Any alleged breaches ... should be brought to the attention of the appropriate agency for investigation.
Beyond that, the fact is that the Prime Minister knows very well, and has expressed it in the matters I have just brought before the Senate, the alarming opinion that so many people have formed about the way in which people within this sect are deprived of their liberties, are threatened, are harassed and are denied the opportunities that other Australians have. It is very much proper that there should be a Senate inquiry into this matter.
I have circulated to party leaders a copy of the letter that was sent to Prime Minister Rudd which evinced Mr Epstein’s response. I am hoping that overnight the parties will look at that letter and provide any amendments or deletions they wish to make, because I wish to incorporate it into Hansard. I will do that, hopefully, when the debate continues. This is a very important inquiry. It is one about the lost rights of some thousands of Australians who deserve to have their plight opened to the light of day. I put it to honourable senators that this inquiry should proceed. It is the bailiwick of this Senate to look at just matters like this when there are citizens suffering and being manipulated and deprived of their rights.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs Committee</title>,Committees,28,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2008-08-26,"—I rise today to support this motion to refer this matter to a committee. There have been many debates in this chamber relating to this matter and it is very disappointing to me that the government has backed away from an inquiry. The matter I would particularly like to speak on this evening is education. I think it is a terrible thing that we have got Commonwealth funding going to schools where there is an active prohibition on young people going on to further education. Exclusive Brethren young people are not allowed to attend university. Girls are not allowed to do manual arts subjects. They know that there will be an arranged marriage for them within the Exclusive Brethren community, and that is their fate whether they like it or not.
When I taught at Devonport High School back in the early 1980s, at that stage there were no Exclusive Brethren schools as such and some of the students came to Devonport High. I had a particularly bright young woman in my class, and I urged her to go on to the Don College and I talked to her about the opportunities in higher education and so on. Her parents complained to the principal of the school that I was filling her head with ideas that were contrary to their aspirations for her, that she would not to be going on to further education, that she would be married and that when she got married she would not be working again because married women in the sect are precluded from working.
So I had a situation where this young girl with her life ahead of her, with huge potential, was being shut down in terms of any aspirations other than an arranged marriage within the sect and, once the arranged marriage took place, no working life thereafter.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2008-08-26,"—I move:
That the following matters be referred to the Community Affairs Committee for inquiry and report by 26 November 2008:
exemptions for the Exclusive Brethren and its members from Australian laws or administrative decisions;
public funding, tax or other arrangements which do or may advantage the Exclusive Brethren over other community organisations;
the activities of the Exclusive Brethren or its members which threaten or harm families, in particular, the best interests of children;
the covert, as against overt, activities of the Exclusive Brethren or its members in the political process in Australia; and
any related matters.
There has been a great deal of public disquiet about the Exclusive Brethren sect, which now Prime Minister Rudd as shadow foreign affairs minister commented upon back in September 2006 when he called for a review of federal funding of Exclusive Brethren schools. He said:
On their role in politics ... they are such a secret society and secret sect ... But my broader concern goes to the extent that the Exclusive Brethren-run schools. The Exclusive Brethren, based on my advice, actively discourages children from using information technology, from learning how to use computers properly because they will provide avenues of contact with the outside world.
As opposition leader in August last year, when stating that he had refused to meet with Exclusive Brethren members and calling on then Prime Minister John Howard to come clean on his links with the Exclusive Brethren, Mr Rudd said:
I believe this is an extremist cult and sect. I also believe that it breaks up families, I also believe that there are real problems with the provision of modern education to kids under their system where they, for example, are not given full range of access to the full range of information technology ...
I can add to that the fact that some thousands of Australian children who happen to have grown up within the Exclusive Brethren sect are denied their proper and free opportunity to tertiary education in this country. I cannot imagine any religious—or other sect, for that matter—getting away without a thorough inquiry into their denying thousands of Australian children their basic and fundamental right to tertiary education.
