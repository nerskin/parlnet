Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (09:33):  I rise to speak in support of this amendment but also in the context of the ending of this committee debate—I anticipate, because the government has made clear that it intends to gag and guillotine this debate if it is not concluded shortly. It is very clear that the deals have been done and the government is likely, finally, to have the numbers in this chamber to end an effective response to climate change.


I was in this chamber when the CPRS, the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme—something which would have introduced a market mechanism, a floating price for carbon—was voted down by this Senate. The reason it was voted down on that day, the fundamental reason, is the same reason this legislation is likely to be voted down today—that is, a man called Mr Tony Abbott. He decided that it was in his political interest not to look to what was responsible, not to look to what was right, not to look to an effective, credible response to climate change, but to stake his political career, his political ambitions, on fearmongering and scaremongering. That is what this debate has been about for years. It has been about Mr Tony Abbott wanting the leadership of the Liberal Party, wanting to be Prime Minister and staking his political campaign on fearmongering. The man who told us that Whyalla would be wiped off the map now cannot even guarantee to Australians that they will get the sorts of price reductions that he campaigned on for years.


If these bills pass today, it will be a day in history where this parliament failed the test of leadership, failed the test of rising above opportunistic politics and short-term sectional interest to act in the national interest. If these bills pass, this nation will have walked away from a credible and effective response to climate change, it will walk away from reducing our greenhouse gas emissions and it will walk away from the task of transforming the Australian economy into the clean energy economy that we have to be in the 21st century. If these bills pass, this nation will be the only nation in the world going backwards when it comes to tackling climate change.


Putting a price on pollution is the most environmentally effective and economically responsible way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. And I remind those opposite of the journey to populism and fearmongering that they have undertaken—a sorry tale indeed. Let us not forget there was once a bipartisan commitment in this country, half a decade ago, to act on climate change. There was a bipartisan commitment half a decade ago to do the right thing, to do the responsible thing. Those opposite talk about intergenerational responsibility. Senator Cormann talks about not giving a credit card to the next generation. That is precisely what you are doing. You are passing a credit card for all of our inaction on this serious threat of climate change to our children and our grandchildren. It is an absolute abrogation of the responsibility that we have in this place. 


Let me remind those opposite of what Mr Howard said in 2007. There is a great YouTube clip that people can go back to. I am quoting:


I will also be announcing a 'cap and trade' emissions trading system that will help Australia substantially lower our domestic greenhouse gas emissions at the lowest cost.


Stabilising atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases will be difficult, but not impossible. We do not have to sacrifice our economic prosperity to tackle the problem.


Australia will more than play its part to address climate change, but we will do it in a practical and balanced way, in full knowledge of the economic consequences for our nation.


So John Howard in 2007 backed in an emissions trading system, the same as the Labor Party is currently moving in this place—the same principle, the same approach, that Labor is putting to this chamber: an emissions trading scheme to give the most effective response to climate change, a cap on pollution, a price set by the market, firms able to find the cheapest and lowest cost way of reducing the pollution we put into our atmosphere.


The fundamental problem is this: as long as something is free our economy will continue to do it. As long as polluting is free, we will see more and more pollution. We understand that intuitively. We understand that in so many other areas of policy, but on this the government has chosen to go down a path which is opportunistic, which is all about fearmongering. I think future generations will look back on these bills and they will be appalled at the short-sighted, opportunistic, selfish politics of those opposite. Mr Abbott will go down as one of the most short-sighted, opportunistic, selfish and small people ever to occupy the office of Prime Minister.


What we will see and what we are seeing from those opposite are short-sighted politics to dismantle a policy which has been supported by them, by the overwhelming majority of scientists and the overwhelming majority of economists. It is easy to run a campaign against a price on carbon, because you are saying to people: 'What we are doing is polluting the atmosphere and we now have to stop doing that. We have to change how our economy works.' But it could have been done if those in the Liberal Party—Mr Turnbull and other moderates—turned their backs on a man who describes climate change as 'absolute crap' and did the right thing by the nation.


There is a lot of talk in politics today about the need to have the reform imperative—about the need to have the courage to reform. If you look back to the great economic reforms governments have implemented—and I particularly want to talk about the opening up of our economy, the liberalisation of trade, the floating of the dollar under the Hawke and Keating governments—it would have been easy to run scare campaigns on those policies. But there was a modicum of bipartisanship for the betterment of the nation—responsibility being taken at that time for future generations. Where is that now? The man who killed it is the man who occupies the Lodge—or, not the Lodge, Kirribilli. The man who killed it is the man who occupies the office of Prime Minister—a short-sighted, opportunistic scaremonger. That is this Prime Minister.


These bills dismantle a policy which has been in place for two years which is working exactly as it was intended, reducing emissions, reducing pollution while supporting the households of Australia and the competitiveness of our economy. I think future generations will look back at the people who claim the carbon price was a wrecking ball and identify the real wrecker—a Prime Minister who has practised hypocrisy, deception and destructive politics when it comes to the challenge of climate change. We on this side of the chamber accept the science. We on this side of the chamber accept the responsibility to do something in this time for the next generation and we in this chamber will never walk away from a serious and credible response to climate change.

Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (09:42):  Yesterday I asked the minister a question that I did not get the answer to. I will repeat that question and then I will ask it again after I have read out a couple of letters I have received. My question was: Minister, can you guarantee that average Tasmanian household costs will drop by $550 each and every year, as guaranteed by the Prime Minister? This is a question that not only myself but many Tasmanians are interested in. I received a letter via email from a small-business owner in Tasmania and I want to read it out:


Hi Senator,


Can you advise me how much I can expect to save this financial year by the abolition of the carbon tax.


I have heard that the Government has stated it should be on average $550 however Aurora Energy today advised me that their power charges will not reduce as a result of the carbon tax being taken away. I do recall this being a reason used by them for the increase in the market wholesale price of electricity.


The small-business owner also then sent me a letter that he had received from Aurora Energy, the suppliers in Tasmania: 


Dear Customer


YOUR AURORA ENERGY CONTRACT PRICES FROM 1 JULY 2014


We write to you with regard to the prices in your Aurora Energy electricity supply contract that will apply from 1 July 2014, in light of the likely repeal by the Australian Government of the carbon pricing scheme.


As of 1 July 2014, there will be no change in the price of your supply contract, as the wholesale energy purchasing arrangements which underpin the provision of electricity to you have not changed. There will also be no change to prices in the event of the carbon tax being repealed, as the costs of providing energy to you will remain unchanged with the wholesale energy market having already factored in the probability of the carbon tax being repealed.


When the time comes to sign a new supply contract with Aurora Energy, the cost of carbon, if there is any, will be captured in the energy pricing that we quote you in your next contract. There will be no separate rate for carbon.


Should you have any questions relating to your contract and the impact of carbon, please do not hesitate to call our Business Sales Team … and we will be able to answer any questions you may have.


So, again, my question is: Minister, can you guarantee that average Tasmanian household costs will drop by $550 each and every year as guaranteed by the Prime Minister?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (09:45):  Firstly, in relation to the last question in terms of electricity price reductions in Tasmania: as I said yesterday, the Office of the Tasmanian Economic Regulator released a statement on 19 June 2014 that electricity prices would fall in real terms by 7.8 per cent with the removal of the carbon tax. In relation to the $550 reduction in cost of living for the average household, that assessment is based on the exact same methodology as used by the previous government when they claimed a reduction in costs of $380 on the basis of replacing the carbon tax with an emissions trading scheme. We are basing our advice to you in relation to this on the exact same methodology that the previous government did.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2014-07-17,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (09:46):  I wanted to ask the minister some questions. I might ask whether he has the figures for the Queensland regulator and what prices would fall in Queensland. I also seek from the minister confirmation that I am not—and I am asking the minister this—living in another world. I heard the Leader of the Opposition filibuster for about 12 minutes at the beginning of this committee session this morning. She did not even pretend to ask a question of the minister. The debates in the Senate, particularly in the committee stage, are intended to allow senators to ask precise questions about the bill and the amendments before the chair. 


We heard from the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate—one of the leadership group of the party which went to the 2010 election promising there would be 'no carbon tax under a government I lead' and then, when it got into government, immediately introduced a carbon tax—not a question but just a 12-minute rant to waste the time of this committee and to prevent other senators from asking questions. We got that from that senator who is supposedly the leader of a party in this chamber. You would expect that a leader might, at least, show some responsibility. That is my recollection. 


After hearing the Leader of the Opposition, I have to ask the minister whether my recollection is correct in that the Australian people at the last election voted overwhelmingly against the Labor Party and the Greens political party. Is it also true—and is my recollection correct—that it was made very clear for about 2½ years before the last election that the last election would be a referendum on the carbon tax? That is my recollection. But, after hearing the Leader of the Opposition, I must have been on a different planet! Clearly, Australians went to the last election accepting this was a vote on the carbon tax or otherwise. The Australian public answered that question, giving Mr Abbott and his team an overwhelming response—an overwhelming answer—in the election held last year.


Similarly, those senators in this chamber supporting the lied-about carbon tax lost one-fifth of their number. Parties in this chamber which indicated they also opposed the carbon tax—which included the coalition, Palmer United Party, Senator Xenophon, as I recall, and I think Family First, Democratic Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats—did very, very well. And yet, if you heard the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate today, you would think that the Australian public said something else. So my question to the minister is: am I right that the last election was said to be a referendum on the carbon tax? And was the result such that the Australian public spoke?


Senator Wong gets up here and says that she and her colleagues in the Labor Party know everything and know what is best for Australia. She says there are a lot of scientists and economists who also think that this should be abandoned. In the minute I have left to me, I just want to ask again: did the Australian public clearly say at the last election they wanted to get rid of the carbon tax? For all of the economists, for all of the so-called scientists that Senator Wong quotes and for all of those people in the Labor Party who say differently, wasn't it a fact that the Australian people, voting at the last election on what was clearly a referendum on the carbon tax, gave their answer and gave it overwhelmingly?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (09:51):  I thank Senator Macdonald for those questions. He is of course right—the last election was a referendum on the carbon tax. The verdict of the Australian people was very clear: they want the carbon tax gone. That is why the government is determined to deliver on our commitment to the Australian people.


In relation to electricity price determinations by the Queensland regulatory authority, I can indeed confirm that the Queensland Competition Authority has stated that electricity prices would fall by 8.5 per cent in a typical household as result of scrapping the carbon tax.



The CHAIRMAN:  The question is that amendment (3) on sheet 7527 moved by Senator Singh be agreed to.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (09:59):  by leave—I move amendments (1) and (2) on sheet 7531 together:


(1) Schedule 2, item 3, page 75 (line 33), omit ""electricity; or"", substitute ""electricity."".


(2) Schedule 2, item 3, page 75 (line 34), omit paragraph (f) of the definition of electricity retailer in section 60A.


Yesterday, I made it fairly clear that the way that the bill is written captures households with solar panels on their roofs and the Royal Children's Hospital, which has a co-generation plant, because the definitions are that an 'entity' includes an individual, the 'energy retailer' definition captures people who produce energy, and 'customer' captures those people who buy energy. I note in today's media:


Martijn Wilder, a partner at Baker & McKenzie, said that “on a plain reading, the law does apply to power sold from solar roof panels” and the letter of the law did not reflect the assurances the minister had given. “At best, it is legally ambiguous,” he said.


At the same time, the ACCC has said that they would be guided by what the minister had said in his second reading speech, but the point here is that the High Court, on several occasions recently, has shown that what parliament intended by legislation means nothing if the statute gives rise to a clear explanation, which, in this case, it does. So the courts will take notice of the law, not what the minister cobbles together in a second reading speech 


On that basis, my amendment removes any ambiguity about whether this captures people who are producing electricity from their solar panels, or a hospital that is producing electricity with co-generation, or any other. Since that clearly is not the intention of the legislation we ought to remove the ambiguity from the legislation. That is why I am moving to remove from section 60A, this amendment, section (f), that was put in House, which says:


(f)  any other entity who produces electricity in Australia.


By removing that you would remove any ambiguity so that people with solar panels and people who are into co-generation—in hospitals and the like—would not be captured by this piece of legislation. It would leave the ACCC without the burden of having to have on the statute books something that it will not enforce, even though it is the law that it does enforce it.


Our job is to make laws that are clear to people, and not to leave the law ambiguous, which will mean that it will land up somewhere in the courts. So I ask the government, the opposition and other crossbench members to support this amendment to give clarity to the law and to give comfort to people who have solar panels, people who are into co-generation and other people who were never intended to be caught up in this legislation in the first place. I recommend the amendment to the Senate.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (10:03):  The government does not agree to this amendment, which waters down the protection to consumers. The government has made it clear already that the interpretation of 'electricity retailer' is limited to electricity retailers and electricity producers selling electricity, in a wholesale electricity market, to a retailer. This means that small-scale electricity producers such as families and businesses with solar PV on their rooftops are not covered. 


The government considers that protections for electricity consumers are an important part of ensuring customers receive the full benefit of the removal of the carbon tax. That is why we have added various new protections to these bills, which will apply to electricity retailers.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2014-07-17,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (10:04):  The minister is wrong because all the minister is doing is referring to Minister Hunt's second reading speech by saying that that is how they have made it clear that this applies with regard to selling into the wholesale market, but that is not what is in the legislation. So the government is refusing an amendment which clarifies the situation. I think that is a very sad thing.


Before we vote on this amendment I would also like to have the minister clarify what he said yesterday. In here he said yesterday that airlines and supermarkets would be legally required to remove the carbon price. In fact, that is not the case. I note in the ACCC's brief to the big polluters—the Australian Industry Greenhouse Network—that despite the ambiguity in the final form of the repeal bills the ACCC would only enforce price reductions for electricity and gas retailers and bulk importers of synthetic gases used in refrigeration and air-conditioning. They would not be enforcing price reductions anywhere else.


So the minister needs to clarify that. The ACCC is telling people that they would only be doing that. I think this really puts the lie to the government's claim that they will be forcing price reductions on everything. They cannot and they will not. The ACCC went on to say that, under the false and misleading conduct powers, they will be looking at the public statements made by companies in relation to what they have done. But that is a vastly different thing from the enforcement of price reductions. 


It is very clear on the record, from the ACCC now, that the only enforceable price reductions will be electricity, gas and synthetic greenhouse gases. For everything else there will be no requirement, and therefore the $550 claims about the community being better off are simply hot air. I would like the minister to clarify: is the government's understanding and intent the same as what the ACCC said yesterday? Isn't that the case?

 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (10:06):  I thank Senator Milne. Firstly, Senator Milne did not accurately quote what I said to the chamber yesterday. She is right, though: we did go through this in some detail. As I pointed out yesterday, as a result of this bill, the ACCC will have price-monitoring powers under section 60G. The ACCC will be provided with new powers to monitor the prices offered, displayed or advertised of electricity, natural gas, synthetic greenhouse gas, synthetic greenhouse gas equipment and any other goods designated by regulation in relation to the carbon tax repeal.


False or misleading representations are obviously also prohibited, consistent with section 60K, so all corporations—and that includes airlines and others—will be prohibited from making carbon specific false or misleading representations during the effect of the carbon tax repeal on prices. This prohibition covers all goods and services and carries a penalty of up to $1.1 million for a corporation and $220,000 for an individual.

What is described in an Orwellian fashion as the 'Steel Transformation Plan' was in fact nothing other than a last minute bit of compensation at the behest of various union representatives to repair the injury that the carbon tax was putting into the steel industry. Of course, by getting rid of the carbon tax we remove the injury but we make sure that Australian business can be more competitive again internationally and is able to compete on more of a level playing field. As such, there is absolutely no reason to keep the compensation for an injury that this government is about to remove.

I am moving the same amendment, because it is critically important that we keep the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. For the benefit of people thinking about this, we set up the Australian Renewable Energy Agency as part of the deliberations of the Clean Energy Package. At the time, renewable energy projects, grants, the Solar Flagships and so on were all across the government. It was a complete mess, and so we pulled together all of the renewable energy programs and we set up a new statutory authority, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, and it was linked to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation so that you had the whole spectrum from early research and development, pilot stage to the commercialisation of these projects. 


It was a very good piece of architecture in terms of legislation. It meant that, as the Clean Energy Finance Corporation project started to make money, the profits would be cycled back through to ARENA to fund early research and development so it would become a self-sustaining system of money going back in. The government has a schedule to abolish the clean energy bills and to take a vast amount of money out of ARENA. As the government has proposed, over the next three years, if the government's schedule stands, ARENA's funding would drop from just over a billion dollars down to $341 million. In other words, if you vote for the bill as it stands, you are voting to take $717 million out of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. What does that mean? It means ARENA will not be able to fund new projects. Effectively, what they do need is $150 million a year to keep the high-quality research and development moving. If you end up with only $89 million in 2014-15 and $59 million the following year, you end up with no new projects. ARENA has 152 projects in their pipeline worth $5.6 billion in investment that will just disappear. This is our reality. 


We already have companies out today—for example, GE, a US multinational and one of Australia's largest foreign investors, saying its $3.5 billion pipeline of investment in green energy in this country is at risk because of possible changes to the RET. That is a separate issue, I agree. But it demonstrates how much interest there is in rolling out these technologies across the country. So it is a very bad mistake for the government to be taking $717 million out. I have heard some crossbench senators say that they want to save ARENA. You do not save a renewable energy agency by taking $717 million out of it over the next three years and leaving it with no ability to fund new projects. 


Secondly, the ARENA board have all now had their positions ceased because their contracts have all run out and as of the 17th, I think it is, there are none of them with an ongoing contract. Yesterday in the Senate, as a result of the motion that I moved, the Senate asked the government to reappoint people to the ARENA board. If this motion is unsuccessful and they lose $717 million, and they have no board anymore—the secretary of the department is effectively heading ARENA, overseeing their existing projects—frankly, by the time the bill comes in later this year to save ARENA, it will be a shell of its former self. You either vote to keep ARENA as it is with the ability to fund the projects in its pipeline and you get people reappointed to the board, because it is an independent statutory authority, or you accept that if you are going to wrench this money out of it and let it lapse with no board, then effectively you are killing ARENA through the back door. That is what is going on here.


I urge the Senate: if you are serious about saving the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, and if you like the kinds of programs that it is supporting, then support my amendment. ARENA is supporting programs right around the country; there are fantastic projects. Out in communities people are excited by this investment in renewable energy and by the innovation and jobs that are coming with it. The point that I just make very seriously is that there is a funding schedule here to take the money out of ARENA. The Greens are standing firm saying do not take that $717 million out of it and please reappoint people to the board, as the Senate asked yesterday, so we are not left with a shell of a former organisation with the departmental secretary overseeing the projects for which the money has already been allocated and that is virtually it. So I urge the Senate: if you are serious about supporting and saving ARENA, it is not enough to leave it to three months down the track to vote against the abolition bill. The fact is that you will be voting for its abolition if you take this money out and the board is gone—it is just a shell. I really urge people to support my amendment.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (10:34):  Senator Singh's comments just now, that this schedule would cripple ARENA, are really quite unbelievable, because what this schedule does is give effect to a Labor savings measure out of their last budget. That is all it does. We are giving effect to a savings measure that you put in your last budget, that you initiated, that you banked in your last budget and that you failed to legislate. Now you come in here and say that somehow we are crippling ARENA. That is just unbelievable. Of course, the government that initiated that savings measure and banked it in the last budget—the Labor government—when I last looked, was supported by the Greens political party in government. 


The Greens were standing behind the budgets of the previous government. The Greens have said that they were part of guaranteeing supply to the previous government. They have got a member in the House of Representatives who was a part of guaranteeing supply to the previous government. The previous government delivered a budget which reprofiled $370 million in funding over the forward estimates into later years—2019-20 to 2021-22—and reduced funding for ARENA by $435 million over the forward estimates. The changes in this schedule give effect to the Labor Party's last budget. So for Senator Singh to come in here and say that we are somehow crippling ARENA by giving effect to their last budget's savings measures is really quite hypocritical, I would suggest to the Senate. 


As Senator Milne and Senator Singh would well know, the future of ARENA, structurally, is going to be the subject of different legislation. It is not the subject of the package of bills that is in front of us here today. The government will not be supporting these amendments. We will be voting for the schedules to stand as printed and that is what we would recommend every senator to do in this Senate—in particular given the absolute mess that the budget is in after six years of Labor waste and mismanagement.

Senator Wong:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order. I appreciate those on the other side may not agree with the contribution, but Senator Macdonald could at least desist from interjecting for perhaps 10 or 15 seconds while another senator is making a contribution on the third reading.



The PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Wong. I remind all senators in the chamber that interjections are disorderly and Senator Milne has the right to be heard on this third reading debate.




Senator MILNE:
  A vote for the abolition of the clean energy package is a vote for failure because it is a recognition that this parliament does not want to face up to the four to six degrees of warming, which is the trajectory we are on as a planet. They do not want to face up to what is intergenerational theft, because a planet facing the warming that we are now being subjected to, and will be subjected to, is a planet experiencing the sixth extinction crisis. It will be a planet suffering rising sea levels. It will be a planet suffering food security crises and it will be a nation, Australia, failing to play our role in global negotiations. We will be a global pariah as the rest of the world moves to try to secure a treaty in 2015 to give people on this planet a chance of survival in the face of a climate emergency. Australia will be relegated to a pariah and a backwater. But it is also a failure to understand that the future is going to be powered by renewable energy, by innovation, by excitement and by new manufacturing.


If this parliament votes to abandon the clean energy package, you are voting against the best interests of the nation. It is a huge opportunity cost to Australia. We will be sidelined in global capital markets. We will be sidelined in innovation. Already GE is out today saying that the pipeline of investment in renewable energy is in jeopardy because of what Australia is doing. This is an appalling day for Australia when a government, rather than lead in the face of what the world is facing up to and rather than lead and be ahead in the race to the future, is determined to stick with the past. So the Greens say, absolutely: this will be a short-lived victory for the Abbott government and those who vote with it today, because Australia will not stand for it. People want this country to lead. People want innovation. People want the clean energy future and people will understand very quickly that the supposed benefits will not be realised. But what people will face is another summer of extreme weather events and more summers after that, as our Pacific neighbours will 


And so, I am here to say that the Greens will join with everyone across the country in bringing back to this parliament a more rigorous framework of legislation that will get Australia onto the track we need to be on; that is a 40 to 60 percent emissions reduction target on 2000 levels by 2030 and net carbon zero by 2050. That is the kind of ambition that we will be out talking to the community about and making sure that we get back to this parliament. We will give hope to future generations. That is what we are going to do: go out and provide hope and a focus on the future while the government and those who support it today are going out to the community focussing on the past and giving people nothing but despair. The future demands people who face the challenges posed now. The Greens are up and ready for that task.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (11:00):  As one who, at the very beginning of this debate, crossed the floor against my own party, I would like to say a couple of words in the final debate on this long-running issue.


First of all, we have heard from the Greens political party the ultimate in hypocrisy. The Australian people, clearly, voted at the last election on what everyone knew was a referendum on the carbon tax, to get rid of the carbon tax. I want to congratulate those political parties who went to the election promising the repeal of the carbon tax and who have actually voted on the basis upon which they were elected. I mention the Democratic Labour Party, Senator Xenophon, the Palmer United Party, the Liberal Democrat Party and the Family First Party, all of whom made it quite clear when they went to election, like the coalition, that if Australians voted for us we would get rid the carbon tax. It is the ultimate in hypocrisy for the Greens political party then to say that they know better than the Australian public, that they know better than our fellow Australians voting at an election. It is typical that the Greens think that they know better than everyone.



Opposition senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order on my left.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Let them go, Mr President, I enjoy it! They will not understand the will of the Australian people and yet they claim to be part of a democracy. Can I conclude on a matter that I mentioned in my very first speech in this place. If there is a problem with global warming—notwithstanding that in Brisbane on Saturday morning we had the coldest day in 113 years, but I leave that behind. I have always indicated that I have an open mind on this. But what I do say is that Australia emits less than 1.4 per cent of global emissions. Without serious work by the United States, China, Russia and the European Union, a five per cent reduction in Australia will make not one iota of difference to all of the things which the leader of the Australian Greens political party would have us believe will occur as a consequence of today's vote. I congratulate the Australian public for their decision, and I congratulate all the parliamentarians who have followed the dictates of the Australian public in having this bill passed today.

It is an outrageous moment in Australia's history when the coalition are sending this nation backwards. We know that there are so many of them who do not believe the science. Senator Macdonald's contribution just now makes it clear—the hypocrisy—that in fact he does not have an open mind. He has never had an open mind on this issue. Labor stands by the science.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (09:33):  I rise to speak in support of this amendment but also in the context of the ending of this committee debate—I anticipate, because the government has made clear that it intends to gag and guillotine this debate if it is not concluded shortly. It is very clear that the deals have been done and the government is likely, finally, to have the numbers in this chamber to end an effective response to climate change.


I was in this chamber when the CPRS, the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme—something which would have introduced a market mechanism, a floating price for carbon—was voted down by this Senate. The reason it was voted down on that day, the fundamental reason, is the same reason this legislation is likely to be voted down today—that is, a man called Mr Tony Abbott. He decided that it was in his political interest not to look to what was responsible, not to look to what was right, not to look to an effective, credible response to climate change, but to stake his political career, his political ambitions, on fearmongering and scaremongering. That is what this debate has been about for years. It has been about Mr Tony Abbott wanting the leadership of the Liberal Party, wanting to be Prime Minister and staking his political campaign on fearmongering. The man who told us that Whyalla would be wiped off the map now cannot even guarantee to Australians that they will get the sorts of price reductions that he campaigned on for years.


If these bills pass today, it will be a day in history where this parliament failed the test of leadership, failed the test of rising above opportunistic politics and short-term sectional interest to act in the national interest. If these bills pass, this nation will have walked away from a credible and effective response to climate change, it will walk away from reducing our greenhouse gas emissions and it will walk away from the task of transforming the Australian economy into the clean energy economy that we have to be in the 21st century. If these bills pass, this nation will be the only nation in the world going backwards when it comes to tackling climate change.


Putting a price on pollution is the most environmentally effective and economically responsible way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. And I remind those opposite of the journey to populism and fearmongering that they have undertaken—a sorry tale indeed. Let us not forget there was once a bipartisan commitment in this country, half a decade ago, to act on climate change. There was a bipartisan commitment half a decade ago to do the right thing, to do the responsible thing. Those opposite talk about intergenerational responsibility. Senator Cormann talks about not giving a credit card to the next generation. That is precisely what you are doing. You are passing a credit card for all of our inaction on this serious threat of climate change to our children and our grandchildren. It is an absolute abrogation of the responsibility that we have in this place. 


Let me remind those opposite of what Mr Howard said in 2007. There is a great YouTube clip that people can go back to. I am quoting:


I will also be announcing a 'cap and trade' emissions trading system that will help Australia substantially lower our domestic greenhouse gas emissions at the lowest cost.


Stabilising atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases will be difficult, but not impossible. We do not have to sacrifice our economic prosperity to tackle the problem.


Australia will more than play its part to address climate change, but we will do it in a practical and balanced way, in full knowledge of the economic consequences for our nation.


So John Howard in 2007 backed in an emissions trading system, the same as the Labor Party is currently moving in this place—the same principle, the same approach, that Labor is putting to this chamber: an emissions trading scheme to give the most effective response to climate change, a cap on pollution, a price set by the market, firms able to find the cheapest and lowest cost way of reducing the pollution we put into our atmosphere.


The fundamental problem is this: as long as something is free our economy will continue to do it. As long as polluting is free, we will see more and more pollution. We understand that intuitively. We understand that in so many other areas of policy, but on this the government has chosen to go down a path which is opportunistic, which is all about fearmongering. I think future generations will look back on these bills and they will be appalled at the short-sighted, opportunistic, selfish politics of those opposite. Mr Abbott will go down as one of the most short-sighted, opportunistic, selfish and small people ever to occupy the office of Prime Minister.


What we will see and what we are seeing from those opposite are short-sighted politics to dismantle a policy which has been supported by them, by the overwhelming majority of scientists and the overwhelming majority of economists. It is easy to run a campaign against a price on carbon, because you are saying to people: 'What we are doing is polluting the atmosphere and we now have to stop doing that. We have to change how our economy works.' But it could have been done if those in the Liberal Party—Mr Turnbull and other moderates—turned their backs on a man who describes climate change as 'absolute crap' and did the right thing by the nation.


There is a lot of talk in politics today about the need to have the reform imperative—about the need to have the courage to reform. If you look back to the great economic reforms governments have implemented—and I particularly want to talk about the opening up of our economy, the liberalisation of trade, the floating of the dollar under the Hawke and Keating governments—it would have been easy to run scare campaigns on those policies. But there was a modicum of bipartisanship for the betterment of the nation—responsibility being taken at that time for future generations. Where is that now? The man who killed it is the man who occupies the Lodge—or, not the Lodge, Kirribilli. The man who killed it is the man who occupies the office of Prime Minister—a short-sighted, opportunistic scaremonger. That is this Prime Minister.


These bills dismantle a policy which has been in place for two years which is working exactly as it was intended, reducing emissions, reducing pollution while supporting the households of Australia and the competitiveness of our economy. I think future generations will look back at the people who claim the carbon price was a wrecking ball and identify the real wrecker—a Prime Minister who has practised hypocrisy, deception and destructive politics when it comes to the challenge of climate change. We on this side of the chamber accept the science. We on this side of the chamber accept the responsibility to do something in this time for the next generation and we in this chamber will never walk away from a serious and credible response to climate change.

Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (09:42):  Yesterday I asked the minister a question that I did not get the answer to. I will repeat that question and then I will ask it again after I have read out a couple of letters I have received. My question was: Minister, can you guarantee that average Tasmanian household costs will drop by $550 each and every year, as guaranteed by the Prime Minister? This is a question that not only myself but many Tasmanians are interested in. I received a letter via email from a small-business owner in Tasmania and I want to read it out:


Hi Senator,


Can you advise me how much I can expect to save this financial year by the abolition of the carbon tax.


I have heard that the Government has stated it should be on average $550 however Aurora Energy today advised me that their power charges will not reduce as a result of the carbon tax being taken away. I do recall this being a reason used by them for the increase in the market wholesale price of electricity.


The small-business owner also then sent me a letter that he had received from Aurora Energy, the suppliers in Tasmania: 


Dear Customer


YOUR AURORA ENERGY CONTRACT PRICES FROM 1 JULY 2014


We write to you with regard to the prices in your Aurora Energy electricity supply contract that will apply from 1 July 2014, in light of the likely repeal by the Australian Government of the carbon pricing scheme.


As of 1 July 2014, there will be no change in the price of your supply contract, as the wholesale energy purchasing arrangements which underpin the provision of electricity to you have not changed. There will also be no change to prices in the event of the carbon tax being repealed, as the costs of providing energy to you will remain unchanged with the wholesale energy market having already factored in the probability of the carbon tax being repealed.


When the time comes to sign a new supply contract with Aurora Energy, the cost of carbon, if there is any, will be captured in the energy pricing that we quote you in your next contract. There will be no separate rate for carbon.


Should you have any questions relating to your contract and the impact of carbon, please do not hesitate to call our Business Sales Team … and we will be able to answer any questions you may have.


So, again, my question is: Minister, can you guarantee that average Tasmanian household costs will drop by $550 each and every year as guaranteed by the Prime Minister?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (09:45):  Firstly, in relation to the last question in terms of electricity price reductions in Tasmania: as I said yesterday, the Office of the Tasmanian Economic Regulator released a statement on 19 June 2014 that electricity prices would fall in real terms by 7.8 per cent with the removal of the carbon tax. In relation to the $550 reduction in cost of living for the average household, that assessment is based on the exact same methodology as used by the previous government when they claimed a reduction in costs of $380 on the basis of replacing the carbon tax with an emissions trading scheme. We are basing our advice to you in relation to this on the exact same methodology that the previous government did.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2014-07-17,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (09:46):  I wanted to ask the minister some questions. I might ask whether he has the figures for the Queensland regulator and what prices would fall in Queensland. I also seek from the minister confirmation that I am not—and I am asking the minister this—living in another world. I heard the Leader of the Opposition filibuster for about 12 minutes at the beginning of this committee session this morning. She did not even pretend to ask a question of the minister. The debates in the Senate, particularly in the committee stage, are intended to allow senators to ask precise questions about the bill and the amendments before the chair. 


We heard from the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate—one of the leadership group of the party which went to the 2010 election promising there would be 'no carbon tax under a government I lead' and then, when it got into government, immediately introduced a carbon tax—not a question but just a 12-minute rant to waste the time of this committee and to prevent other senators from asking questions. We got that from that senator who is supposedly the leader of a party in this chamber. You would expect that a leader might, at least, show some responsibility. That is my recollection. 


After hearing the Leader of the Opposition, I have to ask the minister whether my recollection is correct in that the Australian people at the last election voted overwhelmingly against the Labor Party and the Greens political party. Is it also true—and is my recollection correct—that it was made very clear for about 2½ years before the last election that the last election would be a referendum on the carbon tax? That is my recollection. But, after hearing the Leader of the Opposition, I must have been on a different planet! Clearly, Australians went to the last election accepting this was a vote on the carbon tax or otherwise. The Australian public answered that question, giving Mr Abbott and his team an overwhelming response—an overwhelming answer—in the election held last year.


Similarly, those senators in this chamber supporting the lied-about carbon tax lost one-fifth of their number. Parties in this chamber which indicated they also opposed the carbon tax—which included the coalition, Palmer United Party, Senator Xenophon, as I recall, and I think Family First, Democratic Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats—did very, very well. And yet, if you heard the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate today, you would think that the Australian public said something else. So my question to the minister is: am I right that the last election was said to be a referendum on the carbon tax? And was the result such that the Australian public spoke?


Senator Wong gets up here and says that she and her colleagues in the Labor Party know everything and know what is best for Australia. She says there are a lot of scientists and economists who also think that this should be abandoned. In the minute I have left to me, I just want to ask again: did the Australian public clearly say at the last election they wanted to get rid of the carbon tax? For all of the economists, for all of the so-called scientists that Senator Wong quotes and for all of those people in the Labor Party who say differently, wasn't it a fact that the Australian people, voting at the last election on what was clearly a referendum on the carbon tax, gave their answer and gave it overwhelmingly?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (09:51):  I thank Senator Macdonald for those questions. He is of course right—the last election was a referendum on the carbon tax. The verdict of the Australian people was very clear: they want the carbon tax gone. That is why the government is determined to deliver on our commitment to the Australian people.


In relation to electricity price determinations by the Queensland regulatory authority, I can indeed confirm that the Queensland Competition Authority has stated that electricity prices would fall by 8.5 per cent in a typical household as result of scrapping the carbon tax.



The CHAIRMAN:  The question is that amendment (3) on sheet 7527 moved by Senator Singh be agreed to.


 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,2,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2014-07-17,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (09:59):  by leave—I move amendments (1) and (2) on sheet 7531 together:


(1) Schedule 2, item 3, page 75 (line 33), omit ""electricity; or"", substitute ""electricity."".


(2) Schedule 2, item 3, page 75 (line 34), omit paragraph (f) of the definition of electricity retailer in section 60A.


Yesterday, I made it fairly clear that the way that the bill is written captures households with solar panels on their roofs and the Royal Children's Hospital, which has a co-generation plant, because the definitions are that an 'entity' includes an individual, the 'energy retailer' definition captures people who produce energy, and 'customer' captures those people who buy energy. I note in today's media:


Martijn Wilder, a partner at Baker & McKenzie, said that “on a plain reading, the law does apply to power sold from solar roof panels” and the letter of the law did not reflect the assurances the minister had given. “At best, it is legally ambiguous,” he said.


At the same time, the ACCC has said that they would be guided by what the minister had said in his second reading speech, but the point here is that the High Court, on several occasions recently, has shown that what parliament intended by legislation means nothing if the statute gives rise to a clear explanation, which, in this case, it does. So the courts will take notice of the law, not what the minister cobbles together in a second reading speech 


On that basis, my amendment removes any ambiguity about whether this captures people who are producing electricity from their solar panels, or a hospital that is producing electricity with co-generation, or any other. Since that clearly is not the intention of the legislation we ought to remove the ambiguity from the legislation. That is why I am moving to remove from section 60A, this amendment, section (f), that was put in House, which says:


(f)  any other entity who produces electricity in Australia.


By removing that you would remove any ambiguity so that people with solar panels and people who are into co-generation—in hospitals and the like—would not be captured by this piece of legislation. It would leave the ACCC without the burden of having to have on the statute books something that it will not enforce, even though it is the law that it does enforce it.


Our job is to make laws that are clear to people, and not to leave the law ambiguous, which will mean that it will land up somewhere in the courts. So I ask the government, the opposition and other crossbench members to support this amendment to give clarity to the law and to give comfort to people who have solar panels, people who are into co-generation and other people who were never intended to be caught up in this legislation in the first place. I recommend the amendment to the Senate.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2014-07-17,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (10:03):  The government does not agree to this amendment, which waters down the protection to consumers. The government has made it clear already that the interpretation of 'electricity retailer' is limited to electricity retailers and electricity producers selling electricity, in a wholesale electricity market, to a retailer. This means that small-scale electricity producers such as families and businesses with solar PV on their rooftops are not covered. 


The government considers that protections for electricity consumers are an important part of ensuring customers receive the full benefit of the removal of the carbon tax. That is why we have added various new protections to these bills, which will apply to electricity retailers.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,2,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2014-07-17,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (10:04):  The minister is wrong because all the minister is doing is referring to Minister Hunt's second reading speech by saying that that is how they have made it clear that this applies with regard to selling into the wholesale market, but that is not what is in the legislation. So the government is refusing an amendment which clarifies the situation. I think that is a very sad thing.


Before we vote on this amendment I would also like to have the minister clarify what he said yesterday. In here he said yesterday that airlines and supermarkets would be legally required to remove the carbon price. In fact, that is not the case. I note in the ACCC's brief to the big polluters—the Australian Industry Greenhouse Network—that despite the ambiguity in the final form of the repeal bills the ACCC would only enforce price reductions for electricity and gas retailers and bulk importers of synthetic gases used in refrigeration and air-conditioning. They would not be enforcing price reductions anywhere else.


So the minister needs to clarify that. The ACCC is telling people that they would only be doing that. I think this really puts the lie to the government's claim that they will be forcing price reductions on everything. They cannot and they will not. The ACCC went on to say that, under the false and misleading conduct powers, they will be looking at the public statements made by companies in relation to what they have done. But that is a vastly different thing from the enforcement of price reductions. 


It is very clear on the record, from the ACCC now, that the only enforceable price reductions will be electricity, gas and synthetic greenhouse gases. For everything else there will be no requirement, and therefore the $550 claims about the community being better off are simply hot air. I would like the minister to clarify: is the government's understanding and intent the same as what the ACCC said yesterday? Isn't that the case?

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2014-07-17,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (10:06):  I thank Senator Milne. Firstly, Senator Milne did not accurately quote what I said to the chamber yesterday. She is right, though: we did go through this in some detail. As I pointed out yesterday, as a result of this bill, the ACCC will have price-monitoring powers under section 60G. The ACCC will be provided with new powers to monitor the prices offered, displayed or advertised of electricity, natural gas, synthetic greenhouse gas, synthetic greenhouse gas equipment and any other goods designated by regulation in relation to the carbon tax repeal.


False or misleading representations are obviously also prohibited, consistent with section 60K, so all corporations—and that includes airlines and others—will be prohibited from making carbon specific false or misleading representations during the effect of the carbon tax repeal on prices. This prohibition covers all goods and services and carries a penalty of up to $1.1 million for a corporation and $220,000 for an individual.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (10:18):  I thank Senator Singh. What is described in an Orwellian fashion as the 'Steel Transformation Plan' was in fact nothing other than a last minute bit of compensation at the behest of various union representatives to repair the injury that the carbon tax was putting into the steel industry. Of course, by getting rid of the carbon tax we remove the injury but we make sure that Australian business can be more competitive again internationally and is able to compete on more of a level playing field. As such, there is absolutely no reason to keep the compensation for an injury that this government is about to remove.

 (Tasmania) (10:27):  The opposition opposes schedule 5 in the following terms:


(7) Schedule 5, page 104 (line 1) to page 105 (line 4), to be opposed.


Schedule 5 absolutely cripples ARENA. It drops the amount of money available for this very valuable organisation to enable and encourage development in critical renewable energy projects. That value of projects funded to date, we know, has been unquestionable. Australia has all the raw ingredients and talent required to be a world leader in renewable energy development and commercialisation and yet this government is trying to rip the heart out of ARENA, cripple its funding, take Australia backwards, take a whole new investment in renewable energy backwards, which surely is an economic driver of innovation and prosperity for our nation. We do not support the government's schedule.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,2,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2014-07-17,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (10:28):  The Greens oppose schedule 5 in the following terms:


(7) Schedule 5, page 104 (line 1) to page 105 (line 4), to be opposed.


I am moving the same amendment, because it is critically important that we keep the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. For the benefit of people thinking about this, we set up the Australian Renewable Energy Agency as part of the deliberations of the Clean Energy Package. At the time, renewable energy projects, grants, the Solar Flagships and so on were all across the government. It was a complete mess, and so we pulled together all of the renewable energy programs and we set up a new statutory authority, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, and it was linked to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation so that you had the whole spectrum from early research and development, pilot stage to the commercialisation of these projects. 


It was a very good piece of architecture in terms of legislation. It meant that, as the Clean Energy Finance Corporation project started to make money, the profits would be cycled back through to ARENA to fund early research and development so it would become a self-sustaining system of money going back in. The government has a schedule to abolish the clean energy bills and to take a vast amount of money out of ARENA. As the government has proposed, over the next three years, if the government's schedule stands, ARENA's funding would drop from just over a billion dollars down to $341 million. In other words, if you vote for the bill as it stands, you are voting to take $717 million out of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. What does that mean? It means ARENA will not be able to fund new projects. Effectively, what they do need is $150 million a year to keep the high-quality research and development moving. If you end up with only $89 million in 2014-15 and $59 million the following year, you end up with no new projects. ARENA has 152 projects in their pipeline worth $5.6 billion in investment that will just disappear. This is our reality. 


We already have companies out today—for example, GE, a US multinational and one of Australia's largest foreign investors, saying its $3.5 billion pipeline of investment in green energy in this country is at risk because of possible changes to the RET. That is a separate issue, I agree. But it demonstrates how much interest there is in rolling out these technologies across the country. So it is a very bad mistake for the government to be taking $717 million out. I have heard some crossbench senators say that they want to save ARENA. You do not save a renewable energy agency by taking $717 million out of it over the next three years and leaving it with no ability to fund new projects. 


Secondly, the ARENA board have all now had their positions ceased because their contracts have all run out and as of the 17th, I think it is, there are none of them with an ongoing contract. Yesterday in the Senate, as a result of the motion that I moved, the Senate asked the government to reappoint people to the ARENA board. If this motion is unsuccessful and they lose $717 million, and they have no board anymore—the secretary of the department is effectively heading ARENA, overseeing their existing projects—frankly, by the time the bill comes in later this year to save ARENA, it will be a shell of its former self. You either vote to keep ARENA as it is with the ability to fund the projects in its pipeline and you get people reappointed to the board, because it is an independent statutory authority, or you accept that if you are going to wrench this money out of it and let it lapse with no board, then effectively you are killing ARENA through the back door. That is what is going on here.


I urge the Senate: if you are serious about saving the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, and if you like the kinds of programs that it is supporting, then support my amendment. ARENA is supporting programs right around the country; there are fantastic projects. Out in communities people are excited by this investment in renewable energy and by the innovation and jobs that are coming with it. The point that I just make very seriously is that there is a funding schedule here to take the money out of ARENA. The Greens are standing firm saying do not take that $717 million out of it and please reappoint people to the board, as the Senate asked yesterday, so we are not left with a shell of a former organisation with the departmental secretary overseeing the projects for which the money has already been allocated and that is virtually it. So I urge the Senate: if you are serious about supporting and saving ARENA, it is not enough to leave it to three months down the track to vote against the abolition bill. The fact is that you will be voting for its abolition if you take this money out and the board is gone—it is just a shell. I really urge people to support my amendment.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (10:34):  Senator Singh's comments just now, that this schedule would cripple ARENA, are really quite unbelievable, because what this schedule does is give effect to a Labor savings measure out of their last budget. That is all it does. We are giving effect to a savings measure that you put in your last budget, that you initiated, that you banked in your last budget and that you failed to legislate. Now you come in here and say that somehow we are crippling ARENA. That is just unbelievable. Of course, the government that initiated that savings measure and banked it in the last budget—the Labor government—when I last looked, was supported by the Greens political party in government. 


The Greens were standing behind the budgets of the previous government. The Greens have said that they were part of guaranteeing supply to the previous government. They have got a member in the House of Representatives who was a part of guaranteeing supply to the previous government. The previous government delivered a budget which reprofiled $370 million in funding over the forward estimates into later years—2019-20 to 2021-22—and reduced funding for ARENA by $435 million over the forward estimates. The changes in this schedule give effect to the Labor Party's last budget. So for Senator Singh to come in here and say that we are somehow crippling ARENA by giving effect to their last budget's savings measures is really quite hypocritical, I would suggest to the Senate. 


As Senator Milne and Senator Singh would well know, the future of ARENA, structurally, is going to be the subject of different legislation. It is not the subject of the package of bills that is in front of us here today. The government will not be supporting these amendments. We will be voting for the schedules to stand as printed and that is what we would recommend every senator to do in this Senate—in particular given the absolute mess that the budget is in after six years of Labor waste and mismanagement.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (11:54):  I seek leave to make a short statement. I understand it will be possible to debate this motion. I want to put very clearly on the record why I am proposing an amendment, as it is a rather unusual thing to do to a Selection of Bills report.


Leave granted.




Senator LUDLAM:
  I thank the chamber. It is unusual for a senator to come forward and bring a disagreement to the chamber with a Selection of Bills Committee report.


Senator Brandis has brought forward a bill, the annual expansion of ASIO's powers—sometimes it is more than annual but I think it has been about a year since we were last here—and effectively cherry picking a set of recommendations from a Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security report from last year. 


Without any disrespect at all to the PJCIS, I think it is utterly inappropriate to take a batch of recommendations that came from that joint committee, embed them into a bill and then send that bill back to the same committee that proposed the measures for review. What do we think they might say? Do we think they might give it impartial scrutiny and critique, call witnesses and go through it carefully; or will they say, 'This looks very familiar to what we said should happen 12 months ago'? It is entirely inappropriate that the committee that proposed the measures should now be the one to scrutinise them. 


I hope that I will have Labor and crossbench support to allow the Senate to do its job. We have Senate standing committees to assess and analyse bills, to take evidence for, against, neutral, and to improve bills like this, particularly a bill as sensitive as this one. The proposal to expand ASIO's sweeping powers is so controversial—and I don't quite understand where the Labor Party's heads are at, because we hear different things from different spokespeople—but, the very least that should happen is that the Senate should be permitted to do its job, and that is why I have brought this motion forward. 


In order not to take up too much of the chamber's time, I will also foreshadow a motion that I am bringing forward before too much longer to require the National Security Legislation Monitor to also investigate these bills. The reason for that is very simple: the parliamentary joint committee that provided this report last year that Senator Brandis is now cherry picking from said—and this is a recommendation that Senator Brandis will have signed off on and that the Labor Party will have signed off on; there are no crossbench voices any more than that committee because those positions were wiped out after the election. Presumably, the government doesn't care to hear from independent voices, but Senator Brandis signed off and the Labor Party shadow Attorney-General signed off on a recommendation that said that the National Security Legislation Monitor and the Inspector-general of Intelligence and Security—two small but very important offices, in fact, who hold, on one hand, the policy recommendations and the operational recommendations of our covert and clandestine intelligence gathering and police agencies—should be required to review the bills.


So the first thing that happened in response to that recommendation was that Senator Brandis proposed as a part of red tape removal that the National Security Legislation Monitor be abolished. So way to go with the transparency. I understand he may have changed his mind, although I would appreciate confirmation that that is the case.


I will shortly be moving a motion that ensures that the legislation monitor provides a report and that the IGIS provides a report. The only thing that distinguishes Australia from a police state is this so-called red tape: accountability and offices like the IGIS and analysts like the National Security Legislation Monitor. That is the thin line that stands between us and unregulated secret police and surveillance powers, and that is not overdoing it. 


In Australia we have royal commissions into police corruption every couple of years around the states and territories. These are people—they are not immune to the pressures of the offices. They do dangerous and demanding work. They are not immune to corruption, and I don't think any of us should be surprised that a secret police or a secret intelligence-gathering agency should come to the parliament every few months asking for more intelligence-gathering powers. We should not write them a blank cheque. At the very least, I implore you, colleagues, to let the Senate do its job.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The amendment that Senator Ludlam was speaking about has already been dealt with. The question is that the report be adopted.


Question agreed to.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2014-07-17,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (11:54):  I seek leave to make a short statement. I understand it will be possible to debate this motion. I want to put very clearly on the record why I am proposing an amendment, as it is a rather unusual thing to do to a Selection of Bills report.


Leave granted.




Senator LUDLAM:
  I thank the chamber. It is unusual for a senator to come forward and bring a disagreement to the chamber with a Selection of Bills Committee report.


Senator Brandis has brought forward a bill, the annual expansion of ASIO's powers—sometimes it is more than annual but I think it has been about a year since we were last here—and effectively cherry picking a set of recommendations from a Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security report from last year. 


Without any disrespect at all to the PJCIS, I think it is utterly inappropriate to take a batch of recommendations that came from that joint committee, embed them into a bill and then send that bill back to the same committee that proposed the measures for review. What do we think they might say? Do we think they might give it impartial scrutiny and critique, call witnesses and go through it carefully; or will they say, 'This looks very familiar to what we said should happen 12 months ago'? It is entirely inappropriate that the committee that proposed the measures should now be the one to scrutinise them. 


I hope that I will have Labor and crossbench support to allow the Senate to do its job. We have Senate standing committees to assess and analyse bills, to take evidence for, against, neutral, and to improve bills like this, particularly a bill as sensitive as this one. The proposal to expand ASIO's sweeping powers is so controversial—and I don't quite understand where the Labor Party's heads are at, because we hear different things from different spokespeople—but, the very least that should happen is that the Senate should be permitted to do its job, and that is why I have brought this motion forward. 


In order not to take up too much of the chamber's time, I will also foreshadow a motion that I am bringing forward before too much longer to require the National Security Legislation Monitor to also investigate these bills. The reason for that is very simple: the parliamentary joint committee that provided this report last year that Senator Brandis is now cherry picking from said—and this is a recommendation that Senator Brandis will have signed off on and that the Labor Party will have signed off on; there are no crossbench voices any more than that committee because those positions were wiped out after the election. Presumably, the government doesn't care to hear from independent voices, but Senator Brandis signed off and the Labor Party shadow Attorney-General signed off on a recommendation that said that the National Security Legislation Monitor and the Inspector-general of Intelligence and Security—two small but very important offices, in fact, who hold, on one hand, the policy recommendations and the operational recommendations of our covert and clandestine intelligence gathering and police agencies—should be required to review the bills.


So the first thing that happened in response to that recommendation was that Senator Brandis proposed as a part of red tape removal that the National Security Legislation Monitor be abolished. So way to go with the transparency. I understand he may have changed his mind, although I would appreciate confirmation that that is the case.


I will shortly be moving a motion that ensures that the legislation monitor provides a report and that the IGIS provides a report. The only thing that distinguishes Australia from a police state is this so-called red tape: accountability and offices like the IGIS and analysts like the National Security Legislation Monitor. That is the thin line that stands between us and unregulated secret police and surveillance powers, and that is not overdoing it. 


In Australia we have royal commissions into police corruption every couple of years around the states and territories. These are people—they are not immune to the pressures of the offices. They do dangerous and demanding work. They are not immune to corruption, and I don't think any of us should be surprised that a secret police or a secret intelligence-gathering agency should come to the parliament every few months asking for more intelligence-gathering powers. We should not write them a blank cheque. At the very least, I implore you, colleagues, to let the Senate do its job.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The amendment that Senator Ludlam was speaking about has already been dealt with. The question is that the report be adopted.

The speech read as follows—



DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PARLIAMENTARY APPROVAL OF OVERSEAS SERVICE) BILL 2014


Australia is one of the few remaining democracies that can legally deploy its defence forces into conflict zones without recourse to the Parliament: the decision is reserved to the executive alone. As kindred democracies around the world have enacted reforms to vest the so-called 'War Power' in elected Parliaments, Australia has remained anchored to a pre-democratic tradition founded in hereditary monarchies and feudal states.


If this anachronism had served Australia well, it might be possible to mount an argument that ""if it isn't broken, it doesn't need fixing.""


If the horror unfolding in Iraq does not comprehensively put this view to rest, it is difficult to imagine what would. On the basis of fabricated and wilfully misinterpreted intelligence, Prime Minister John Howard followed the United States and the United Kingdom into an illegal and open-ended war in Iraq. Our Parliament, and by extension the voting public of Australia, were cut out of the decision, despite the fact that hundreds of millions of people around the world organised and campaigned against the decision to go to war. 


There are few credible analysts left anywhere who do not regard the decision by hardliners within the Bush Administration to invade Iraq as one of the most grievous strategic disasters in modern history. The vast majority of Australians were right, and the executive authorities in the US, the UK and Australia, were wrong. No inquiry into the decision to go to war has ever been held in Australia, only a handful of piecemeal attempts to pin the blame on intelligence services and shift focus away from the actions of the Howard Government.


At the time, Iraq was not threatening war. There was no connection or allegiance between the secular Baathist regime that ruled Iraq and the fundamentalist Al Qaeda networks responsible for the 9/11 attacks. There were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and hadn't been since 1991. Intelligence agencies within the US, the UK and Australia understood these facts, but inflexible groupthink prevailed within the White House, Downing Street and the Prime Minister's office here in Australia. It was rumoured at the time that Australian Special Forces units were among the very first on the ground inside Iraq, even before President Bush went on live television to announce that Operation Iraqi Freedom had commenced. 


Australia is entirely complicit in the violent, decade-long occupation that shattered Iraq's social and economic structures, and ignited long-dormant sectarian tensions that now threaten to plunge the crippled country into full-blown civil war. 


At the time of speaking, Sunni fundamentalists considered too extreme to remain part of Al Qaeda have established a new Caliphate in territory carved out of Syria and Iraq. The brittle institutions of Iraqi governance, bombed into existence by the United States, now threaten to collapse entirely.


If there is a strategic policy failure more complete than the catastrophic invasion of Iraq, it is difficult to recall it. This dismal outcome was predicted at the time by many of those who opposed the war, but the executive's lock on the process means that the normal Parliamentary processes of critique and accountability were bypassed. Somewhere between 100,000 and one million Iraqis have paid for this obscene oversight with their lives.


Should Prime Minister Abbott decide to compound the strategic incompetence of 2003 with a further deployment as the security environment in Iraq deteriorates, the Australian Parliament, and the Australian people, would be cut out of the decision again. 


Concurrently with the Iraq deployment, Australia has also fought a long, costly, and ultimately futile war in Afghanistan. The heaviest cost was carried by the Afghan people: tens of thousands of civilians killed, maimed and traumatised as the US Government's saturation bombing campaign transitioned into a long, untenable occupation. Forty one Australian soldiers have lost their lives in Afghanistan. Out of respect to them and their families, Parliament pauses to acknowledge their sacrifice when news breaks of another death. No such respects are paid to those Afghans who also paid the ultimate price; no-one even appears to be keeping count. 


It is no longer tenable that the decision to deploy into conflict zones should be left to the executive alone. Our current Defence Act does not allow for any level of transparent decision making, scrutiny and debate, but this is an artefact of legislation, not the natural order of things. 


The Defence Legislation Amendment (Parliamentary Approval of Overseas Service) Bill 2014 inserts a new section 50C into the Defence Act to require that decisions to deploy members of the Australian Defence Force beyond the territorial limits be made not by the executive alone but by Parliament as a whole. This means debate in both houses, followed by a vote. 


This Bill was initiated by the Australian Democrats and supported by the Australian Greens, who took carriage of the Bill after 2007. It is the latest iteration of a Bill introduced into the Senate in 1985. In 2015 it will mark its 30th year of languishing in plain sight while Liberal and Labor Prime Ministers alike reserve this power to themselves, plunging Australia into a tragic series of overseas expeditionary wars that have had little or nothing to do with the defence of Australia or collective security. 


In August 2009, I referred the Bill to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. The majority of the committee resolved to refuse to take evidence in a hearing. Nonetheless, the Committee made a useful critique of the Bill without undermining its essential purpose, in its report of February 2010. 


My dissenting report into the Bill provided the transcript of an informal hearing that we held, after the majority committee's short-sighted decision not to take evidence directly from witnesses.


This Bill would bring Australia into conformity with principles and practices utilised in other democracies including Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Slovakia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey, where troop deployment is set down in constitutional or legislative provisions. Some form of parliamentary approval or consultation is also routinely undertaken in Austria, the Czech Republic, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Norway. Our ally the United States has a similar provision that subjects the decision to go to war to a broader forum—section 8 of Article I of the US Constitution quite clearly says, ""Congress shall have power to declare war"". In the wake of the disaster in Iraq, the Westminster Parliament now holds the de-facto war power, a new convention that prevented a rushed deployment into Syria earlier in 2014.


Arguments against vesting the power over troop deployment to Parliament include that it would be impractical, restrictive and inefficient. Such arguments ignore the fact that parliaments can and do make complex and nuanced decisions, rapidly when necessary. As we have seen, decisions about war and peace made in undue haste that do not enjoy the mandate of the population – expressed through the Parliament, if nowhere else – have no legitimacy.


There are appropriate exemptions made in this Bill to avoid interfering with the non-warlike overseas service with which Australian troops are engaged – referring in particular to new subsection 50C(11). There are also appropriate exemptions in the Bill to provide for the practicalities of situations where Parliament cannot immediately meet – referring to subsections 50(3) and (7), which provide for the Governor-General to be able to make a proclamation regarding the declaration of war, provided that Parliament is then recalled within a period of two days.


It is time that Australia joined its closest allies and like-minded democratic states by involving the Parliament in the decision to deploy the ADF. The entwined tragedies of our recent military misadventures, and the threat that history may soon repeat, make passage of this Bill more urgent than ever.


Once again, I commend the Bill to the Senate.

Senator LUNDY
 (Australian Capital Territory) (12:38):  Pursuant to order, I present the report of the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee on Commonwealth procurement procedures, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator LUNDY:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


This important inquiry has explored the operation and effectiveness or, indeed, otherwise of the Commonwealth procurement rules. These rules set out the processes and rules for government purchasing. We also explored in some depth procurement related policies, which, interestingly, are not overseen by the Department of Finance but a range of other departments to which those procurement related policies belong.


The inquiry explored the impact of Australia's international obligations arising from bilateral free trade agreements on procurement policies. The committee formed the view that government procurement policies, as part of the value-for-money assessment, should take into account the effect of those procurement decisions on communities and the broader economy.


Throughout this inquiry, witnesses made clear to the committee that the value-for-money proposition is not merely a matter of comparing prices; it ought to be a matter of assessing the broader benefit, as well as the costs of the available options. For example, the committee received evidence suggesting that the procurement of locally produced stationery had definite economic benefits for government, including greater government tax revenues from individuals and companies, the benefit of supporting Australian jobs and, indeed, the development of Australian workers' skills in this area.


Mr Travis Wacey from the CFMEU reflected on the estimate of job losses in the paper and forestry industries as a result of Australian Paper not being awarded the envelopes contract in 2013 by DHS. He said:


We are not just talking about one or two jobs; we think that 15 to 20 direct production jobs were triggered by the loss of this contract, and it is a situation representing literally hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions of dollars in lost taxpayer revenue in the short, medium and longer term just for the $8,000 benefit.


That was the difference in the bottom line price in that particular tender. It was noted:


Australian Paper also provides significant revenue to all levels of Government; equivalent to $1.81 for each and every A4 ream of copy paper that we make and totalling $432 Million in 2012.


These are just some of the considerations that brought the committee to the conclusion that there is an urgent need for a stronger methodology to assess whole-of-life costs within the value-for-money assessment component of procurement decision-making. It is quite a mouthful, but this issue goes to the heart of how Australian industry has opportunities to compete on a level playing field.


The committee formed the view that, with consideration of the broad economic benefits of procurement as part of a comprehensive value-for-money assessment and the effective application of the range of procurement related policies, combined with the scrutiny and accountability measures contained in our recommendations, procurement outcomes for Australian companies would be considerably improved without impacting on our international bilateral trade obligations and without necessarily needing to change the procurement rules dramatically. In fact, one of the issues was that, if all of the procurement related policies and rules were applied with a genuine whole-of life, value-for-money assessment, the policy would not need to change much at all. It is about the application, effectiveness, oversight, transparency and genuineness of the objectives contained within procurement policies.


There was quite a deal of concern from a number of industries, including the IT industry. We heard evidence from Michelle Melbourne and Suzanne Campbell, representing the Business Council of the ACT and the Australian Information Industry Association. They spoke specifically about a company called Intelledox. Michelle Melbourne, through her own experience, reflected on this and said:


… it is not an even playing field … over there; it just isn't … So we—


that is, Australia—


follow the rules with the free trade agreement, but the US do not do that. They are fiercely parochial. Each state and procurement body that you deal with over there asks you: 'Who is your local partner?


The committee asked for details on how our international free trade agreements apply. The evidence we got is that we seem to not utilise the range of exemptions that are available for small to medium sized Australian businesses to the extent that our partners in these free trade agreements do. Therefore, our recommendations point to an exploration of the scope to work within those obligations—no-one is suggesting stepping out of those obligations—to fully garner the benefit that other nations have through those bilaterals and support our small to medium sized enterprises.


I am very conscious of time and I will, at the conclusion, seek leave to continue my remarks. However, can I thank the committee secretariat, in particular, Lyn Beverleyand Ann Palmer, and a particular thank you to my Senate colleagues, who worked constructively. A minority report came in from government senators, who, interestingly, agree with some, certainly not all, of our recommendations.


I would particularly like to acknowledge Senators Madigan and Xenophon, who have supported the recommendations of the majority committee and added strength and detail in their own words as they continue to promote these issues relating to Australian companies' access to Commonwealth contracts. The key issue is in the capacity of companies to grow and expand and support the local community. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

Senator LUNDY
 (Australian Capital Territory) (12:38):  Pursuant to order, I present the report of the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee on Commonwealth procurement procedures, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator LUNDY:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


This important inquiry has explored the operation and effectiveness or, indeed, otherwise of the Commonwealth procurement rules. These rules set out the processes and rules for government purchasing. We also explored in some depth procurement related policies, which, interestingly, are not overseen by the Department of Finance but a range of other departments to which those procurement related policies belong.


The inquiry explored the impact of Australia's international obligations arising from bilateral free trade agreements on procurement policies. The committee formed the view that government procurement policies, as part of the value-for-money assessment, should take into account the effect of those procurement decisions on communities and the broader economy.


Throughout this inquiry, witnesses made clear to the committee that the value-for-money proposition is not merely a matter of comparing prices; it ought to be a matter of assessing the broader benefit, as well as the costs of the available options.

"Peris, Sen Nova",ALP,2014-07-17,"



Senator PERIS
 (Northern Territory) (12:45):  I continue to talk to the Asset Recycling Fund Bill 2014 and related bill. If I can go back to where I was before the debate was interrupted. The people of the Northern Territory know that selling Power and Water will guarantee two things; higher prices and longer, more frequent blackouts. So I am very concerned that Power and Water will be sold off under the scheme if this bill is passed.


I am also concerned that the people of the Northern Territory will get no say. It will just be announced one day and that is the way the Northern Territory government currently operates. We will wake up one morning and there will be an article on the front page of the Northern Territory News telling us that Power and Water will be sold. A deal has been done with the Abbott government and it will be sold. The Territory Insurance Office, TIO, is the only remaining government-owned insurance and banking institution in the country. There has been much talk about the potential sale of Power and Water over many years. As the only remaining financial institution in government ownership, it can be seen by some as an obvious candidate for sale. But let me tell you that people in the Northern Territory do not want it sold.


 Living in a cyclone-prone area we have an extra interest in home and contents insurance. It is already expensive and people simply do not want TIO sold. Again, from their public comments, the Northern Territory government are clearly looking at selling TIO. They refuse to rule it out.


The next candidate is the Port of Darwin. The port is less visible in the day-to-day lives of people in the Northern Territory than Power and Water, and TIO. But it is still extremely important to Territorians. Private investment in the port and its operations should be encouraged but, in an underdeveloped economy, we should not be selling off the assets that are so crucial to our plans to develop the north. Again, it would be outrageous if funds for our roads, to get cattle and minerals to the port, depended on the sale of our port. Those are my concerns about what the Northern Territory government would do with this fund.


That is why I support Labor's position on any potential sale that it be subject to a disallowable instrument. If the CLP government sell off any of our assets without proper consultation process or against the public interest, then we can block it from being eligible for sale under this scheme.


 If a state or territory government go through the proper processes of selling an asset, if they undertake a full cost-benefit analysis and take their plans to an election and receive the endorsement of the community and the people of the Northern Territory, then and only then a contribution from the Commonwealth under this scheme will be warranted.


However if a government—and the CLP government in the Northern Territory are probably the most unlikely to do this—just suddenly announce a sale without any analysis and in complete opposition to community sentiment, then it is not appropriate that the Commonwealth support the sale through this scheme.


Finally, these are my main points. Our infrastructure spending should not be dependent on selling our infrastructure. In order to get our fair share of infrastructure funding, we should not be required to sell off our vital public assets. I am concerned that the Commonwealth government will use this fund to encourage the Northern Territory government to sell off our assets. I am also concerned that the Northern Territory government will use this fund to do what they want to do and that is to sell off our assets. 


We are only getting less than one per cent of the Abbott government's infrastructure budget over the next seven years. Selling everything is not the solution. The Commonwealth parliament should be allowed to block a sale through a disallowable instrument.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2014-07-17,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (12:49):  The Asset Recycling Fund Bill 2014 and the Asset Recycling Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2014 are a desperate and belated attempt by the Abbott government to gain some credentials as an 'infrastructure government'. It is though infrastructure is an afterthought to them, not something they care a great deal about. The government do not even go close to matching the former Labor government's record investment in infrastructure.


After all, it was Labor that invested $16.2 billion during the height of the global financial crisis, through the BER program, Building the Education Revolution, to build the school infrastructure of the 21st century. This was investment which helped stimulate the economy. We saved hundreds of thousands of jobs during the GFC, opposed by those opposite who, had they got their way, would have seen Australia plunged into recession.


Our economic stimulus plan, including the BER program, was praised by Nobel prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz as being well designed. In fact, Professor Stiglitz said that, had it not been for the economic stimulus package designed by Labor and opposed by the economic neophytes opposite, Australia's national debt would have been considerably larger. 


It was a Labor government which initiated Australia's largest ever national infrastructure project. I am talking, of course, about the National Broadband Network. I cannot emphasise enough how people from my home state of Tasmania, who are now connected to the network, are describing to me the transformative effect it is having on their lives and businesses.


Infrastructure spending overall under Labor went up by 42 per cent since the last full year of the Howard government—a government which paid very little attention to building Australia's infrastructure. Labor lifted annual infrastructure spending in Australia, from $132 per person to $225. We upgraded 7,500 kilometres of Australia's road network and upgraded 4,000 kilometres of Australia's rail network. Road spending doubled under Labor and we invested $13.6 billion in urban rail—more than had been invested by all of our predecessors combined since Federation. We also invested a further $3.4 billion in rail freight, which has been of great benefit to my home state of Tasmania, which relies heavily on rail for the transportation of freight across the state.


When Labor took office, Australia ranked 20th in the OECD in infrastructure spending; because of Labor's record investment in infrastructure, Australia now ranks first. In my home state of Tasmania, we saw significant investment going into the south of the state for the first time in over a decade. While the Howard government had focused on projects in the marginal electorates of Bass and Braddon, Labor delivered hundreds of millions of dollars in funding to projects such as the Blundstone Arena upgrade; the Brighton bypass and transport hub; the Kingston bypass upgrades to the Brooker Highway; trade training centres and GP superclinics; the Huon Valley and south-east Tasmania water schemes; and several of the first rollout sites of Labor's National Broadband Network—that is, the real NBN, not the coalition's second-rate alternative. Under a Labor government, the annual infrastructure spending to Tasmania almost doubled—from $157 per Tasmanian to $264 per Tasmanian. Not only did Labor in government dramatically boost Australia's infrastructure investment, we implemented important reforms to make sure that we got the best value out of all our infrastructure spending.


Infrastructure Australia was established as an independent expert authority to advise the government—and, more importantly, the public—on Australia's infrastructure needs. One of Infrastructure Australia's roles is to evaluate the contribution of proposed infrastructure projects and rank them in order of their contribution to Australia's productivity. An important part of this reform was that Infrastructure Australia's advice be provided to the public. Part of the reason Infrastructure Australia was established with this function was to give the Australian government an incentive to invest in the infrastructure projects that provided the best outcomes for Australians, not the best outcomes for the government's political fortunes.


Unfortunately though, pork-barrelling to marginal electorates has been a longstanding practice of coalition governments—and one of the reasons why we need a national body to provide independent advice on infrastructure. Our reforms to infrastructure funding were implemented after the Australian National Audit Office released a damning report on the Howard government's Regional Partnerships program. The report said that the program had 'fallen short of an acceptable standard of public administration'. Grants had been provided for projects that had not been properly assessed, that government departments had advised against, and—listen to this—to groups that had not even applied for funding. You did not even have to apply for funding and you got some!


I am pleased that the government has not proceeded with its previous plans to gag Infrastructure Australia and take away its independence and has agreed to the Senate's amendments to its bill. It was completely bizarre that the government guillotined debate on that bill in the House back in December but did not bring it to the Senate until as late as June this year. Perhaps they finally succumbed to pressure from the business community, who supported Labor's call that infrastructure policy actually be made on the basis of what is in the national interest. The attacks by the Abbott government on the independence of Infrastructure Australia were just one part of the story of this government's poor record on infrastructure. The coalition has made various attempts to trumpet its achievements as 'an infrastructure government'—and all of them have fallen flat. After all, this is the government which has scrapped both the Regional Infrastructure Fund and the Regional Development Australia Fund. The government's decision to gut funding for regional Australia has been supported by, strangely, the Nationals, who continue their bizarre charade of pretending to stand up for regional Australia.


The Abbott government has claimed credit for various road and rail projects, worth more than $12 billion, despite these projects already being announced and funded by Labor. A great example of one of the road projects funded by Labor and then re-announced by the coalition is the Huon Highway-Summerleas Road intersection. This particular intersection is in the electorate of Franklin and just a stone's throw from my electorate office in Kingston. I stood at that intersection, with the federal member for Franklin, Julie Collins, in August when Labor announced a $17.5 million commitment to the intersection which had been funded in the 2013-14 federal budget. So I was quite amused to see a contribution from Senator Bushby in the local newspaper, the Kingborough Chronicle, in which he announced that the government was funding this project where Labor had 'failed to deliver on it'. Senator Bushby referred to years of inaction by state and federal Labor governments and said that the dangerous intersection was of great concern to him. It is interesting, therefore, that Senator Bushby was strangely silent on the intersection during the federal election. Maybe that is because the coalition failed to match Labor's $17.5 million commitment until February the following year, a full five months after the election, even though the upgrade had already been funded in the previous year's budget.


After failing to commit to this and several other funded infrastructure projects in the south of Tasmania, the Abbott government has now set about re-announcing them as if they were its own. These projects include the Huon Highway-Summerleas Road intersection; upgrades to the Brooker Highway between Elwick Road and Howard Road; and Tasman Highway on and off ramps at the East Derwent Highway intersection. The Abbott Government has still failed to make up the $100 million shortfall in Labor's funding for the Midland Highway. While Labor had provided $500 million funding for upgrades to the highway, the Abbott government announced that it would provide $400 million for the full duplication of the highway to four lanes. Good luck with that! In reality, this project would cost about $2 billion, whereas $400 million would probably provide duplication as far as Bridgewater to Bagdad. Unfortunately, it took until after the election for the Prime Minister to belatedly admit that $400 million would not provide for full duplication.


As if they have not embarrassed themselves enough in Tasmania, in the last budget the Abbott government triumphantly announced infrastructure spending of more than $40 billion over the next six years. But many of those projects were also recycled Labor commitments. Prior to this budget, Labor had already approved projects worth $35 billion over the next six years, and several of the coalition's new road projects—$5 billion worth—have been funded by ripping money out of rail projects. In fact, by refusing to fund any new rail or other public transport projects, this government is creating a perverse incentive for state and territory governments to divert funding to road projects even if roads do not provide the greatest productivity gain.


This is a double whammy for commuters, who will be faced with fewer public transport options and slugged another $2 billion to $3 billion with the government's reintroduction of the petrol excise. The budget also rips funding out of public transport concessions. Perhaps the government has a secret agenda of trying to get more transport users on the roads so that they can collect more revenue from the fuel tax hike. If that is not the reason, then I fail to see the logic in determining, as this government has, that roads are the responsibility of the Commonwealth but rail infrastructure is not. I would be willing to bet that most Australians are with me on that one too.


Of course roads are an important part of our transport infrastructure, but so is public transport. In fact, investment in public transport helps reduce traffic congestion, provides a cost-effective alternative for many commuters, and is better for the environment than car transport. But, unfortunately, the Abbott government seem unable to see the bigger picture when it comes to transport infrastructure funding. Unfortunately, they have also gone back to their old practice of pork-barrelling—the old practice that the Howard government engaged in.


According to Fairfax Media analysis, as reported in the Sydney Morning Herald last month, the infrastructure projects that have received new funding favour coalition electorates by a ratio of three to one. The Herald also pointed out that the majority of projects the Abbott government had withdrawn Commonwealth funding from were in non-coalition electorates. The Herald article quotes Monash University Professor of Transport, Graham Currie, who said:


The question is whether they want to be a professional government or they want to pork-barrel, and whether we'll forge the idea of trying to be professional about how we manage resources or just do it on a political basis.


I don't think that's how a country should be run.


So that, in a nutshell, is the Abbott government's record on infrastructure investment so far—pork-barrelling, recycling old projects, attempting to deny proper public assessments of projects and having a bizarre bias against rail projects in favour of roads for no explicable reason. The two bills that are now before the Senate, regrettably, do not improve on this record.


The two bills we are currently debating form part of the Abbott government's infrastructure package announced in the 2014-15 federal budget. The key element of the bills is the Asset Recycling Initiative, which will be used to incentivise the states and territories to invest in new productive infrastructure by privatising existing assets. The Commonwealth will provide a contribution of 15 per cent of the reinvested sale proceeds to the cost of the project. This initiative is still subject to a national partnership agreement.


With these bills, the government are up to their old tricks again—trumpeting the investment they are making in infrastructure when they are actually just redirecting money that is already committed to other things. In the case of the Asset Recycling Fund, the government are doing some recycling of their own—taking $2.4 billion of uncommitted funds from the Building Australia Fund and $3.5 billion of uncommitted funds from the Education Infrastructure Fund—for an initial contribution of $5.9 billion. Like the EIF and the BAF, the Asset Recycling Fund will be managed as part of the Future Fund. Unlike the EIF and the BAF, projects to be funded by the portfolio ministers will not be subject to recommendations by an advisory board as to the merit of the projects. It begs the question: how does the government know that a project is going to be 'productivity enhancing' when it is put forward for a grant or payment? Is it just another case of the government picking winners, like they will with their Emissions Reduction Fund? The more important question is: how does the public know? How can the public have confidence that this fund is actually investing in projects that produce an economic gain for Australia? They have provided no independent mechanism for ensuring the project will actually have productivity gains or for comparing the productivity gains of different proposals.


Labor achieved record investment in infrastructure, and we did so during the largest global economic crisis since the Depression. We also achieved this by funding projects on a 50-50 basis and without the need for state and territory governments to sell public assets. Given Labor's record investments in infrastructure in partnership with the states and territories, we believe that replacing this support with a 15 per cent incentive payment is a backward step. This government is handballing its responsibility for real investment in infrastructure to the states and territories. Wouldn't it be better if the government would help the states to fund their infrastructure priorities regardless of where the funds come from? Why does the government see it as necessary to provide the states with an incentive—or a 'bribe' as it was described by Chris Aulich, Professor of Public Administration at the University of Canberra—to privatise their assets? 


We on this side believe that the concept of asset recycling can have merit in some circumstances. For example, in 2007 in my home state of Tasmania, there was a very sensible instance of asset recycling when the Labor government sold the Hobart Airport site and invested the proceeds in the Brighton transport hub, the Royal Hobart Hospital and irrigation projects. However, we want to ensure that the money that is invested in new projects is invested wisely—that Australians get maximum bang for their buck. After all, when state and territory governments privatise their assets they can only sell them once.


Labor will be moving amendments to this bill. The amendments will require, as a precondition for spending Commonwealth funds on the Asset Recycling Initiative: an assessment by Infrastructure Australia of the new infrastructure as 'productivity enhancing', including a published cost-benefit analysis; and tabling of a disallowable instrument for each privatisation and reinvestment transaction. I hope that the government senators and the crossbenchers will support our amendments to this bill. I am disappointed that the government did not support our amendments in the other place, as it was a good opportunity for them to demonstrate that they support transparency and due diligence. These amendments are about increasing the accountability and transparency of the Asset Recycling Initiative, to ensure that the projects funded through this initiative will genuinely enhance productivity.


Labor believes that Infrastructure Australia, an independent and expert body, is best placed to assess the contribution of new infrastructure projects to Australia's productivity. Strengthening the role of independent expert bodies to ensure good policy outcomes is a core belief of Labor, as distinct from a government that is working to dismantle independent advisory bodies such as the Climate Change Authority, the Immigration Health Advisory Group and others working on positive ageing, social inclusion, animal welfare, Indigenous leadership and a variety of other policy areas. It is vital that infrastructure decisions are made by this government with the national interest in mind, not their own political interests. We do not intend to allow the Asset Recycling Initiative to become a slush fund to allow state and territory governments to pork-barrel to marginal electorates.


These amendments are about taking an evidence based approach to decisions on infrastructure funding. Before the infrastructure minister makes a grant or payment to a state or territory, they must first receive an independent evaluation of the project which confirms that the project will actually have productivity gains. The requirement for the minister to approve grants via a disallowable instrument is to ensure that not only are quality decisions made on infrastructure investments but quality decisions are also made on privatisation of the assets sold to fund them.


Unlike those opposite, Labor is not of the view that all privatisation is necessarily good. These bills are providing the states and territories with an incentive to privatise assets, and the Commonwealth should not be rewarding them for engaging in a fire sale of assets or for selling assets without appropriate regulatory protections. The idea that privatisation is good in all circumstances is Tea Party thinking—the kind of attitude that the ideologues who have taken over the Liberal Party seem to be engaging in more and more. This is a flawed bill, but it can be improved with Labor's amendments, which I hope that the other side will agree to and which I commend to the Senate.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland) (13:08):  I rise to speak on the Asset Recycling Fund Bill 2014. Australia's infrastructure is too important to be left to pork-barrelling and the whims of the political cycle, especially the whims of this government. In the committee stage, Labor will seek to pass two amendments. We will look for crossbench support, because it is about ensuring that there is transparency and openness of the process for approving infrastructure projects. All Australians would want that, to ensure that there is scrutiny of those infrastructure projects. The coalition's plan for asset recycling has three major flaws. Firstly, it does not allow for independent scrutiny of the infrastructure projects. Secondly, it distorts the state government's decisions on asset sales, promoting the ill-thought-through selling of assets for short-term gains. Thirdly, it does not guarantee any new money for investment in infrastructure. 


Infrastructure spending under Labor rose to record levels. We went from being 20th in the OECD, in terms of spending on infrastructure as a proportion of GDP, to first, under Labor's watch. Labor lifted funding for infrastructure from about $130 for each Australian to about $220. Labor doubled the roads budget, to $46.6 billion, and upgraded 7,500 kilometres of road. But we also recognise that it is not enough just to increase funding. The money has to be spent on worthwhile infrastructure that will create not only returns for Australians but productivity increases into the future. Labor created Infrastructure Australia to research and rank proposed infrastructure projects based on their potential to add economic productivity. Infrastructure Australia introduced independent advice and the opportunity to add transparency and openness into the process for planning for infrastructure in Australia. Labor also planned for the future. The National Ports Strategy and National Land Freight Strategy meant that informed decisions could be made about infrastructure investment in the context of a broader plan for ports and freight. Infrastructure, without this sort of strategic plan, is just a recipe for expensive white elephants. This government wants to throw up plenty of those. 


We on this side of the chamber are proud of Labor's achievement in infrastructure. Indeed, this government seems proud of Labor's achievements too. Almost all of the coalition's announced infrastructure projects are re-announcements of Labor funded projects. Take one example. Take the Bruce Highway. During Senate estimates, we learnt there was no new money. Mr Truss uses the terms 'locked in', 'confirmed', 'affirmed', 'reconfirmed' or 'recommitted', but what he really should say is simply 're-announced'. Labor invested $5.7 billion in the Bruce Highway, dwarfing the $1.3 billion spent by the previous Howard government. For all their rhetoric, under the Howard regime they did not spend on infrastructure. Labor delivered four times the funding in half the time. Labor remains committed to improving the Bruce Highway, fixing up the area that the Howard government failed to act in and this government is also ignoring.


The coalition has failed to follow Labor's lead in investing in important Queensland infrastructure. The Cross River Rail project is a good example of a coalition failure. Infrastructure Australia said the Cross River Rail project was a strategic priority for Australia's infrastructure, and it judged the project as passing the cost-benefit test and ready to proceed. The Liberals have pulled $700 million out of the project. It defies good decision making and shows that this government is focused on pet projects and not projects which can drive productivity or develop infrastructure from the best business case. The federal government already provided the bulk of funding for large infrastructure projects, so this needs to be protected and not raided by this government to pay for the Asset Recycling Fund. This Asset Recycling Fund must provide funds in addition to existing federal commitments. There must be new nation-building projects in road, rail and other nationally significant infrastructure, otherwise it is just recycling in truth.


We know we cannot trust the government on this. We have seen already the twisted priorities of the coalition government—the way they try to hide their cruel cuts to pensioners and ordinary Australians, pretending that taxes are not taxes really and that cuts to education and health are not truly cuts. They use miserable words to describe their short-sightedness, but the country cannot afford those cuts and cannot afford cuts to infrastructure. As a start, they are taking $2.4 billion from the Building Australia Fund and $3.5 billion from the Education Investment Fund for the Asset Recycling Fund. What they effectively are doing is shuffling the money out of one area into another, claiming that it is new money. It is not new money from infrastructure; it is already there. 


On top of that, they are also taking cuts from local government which are going to hurt local infrastructure. I know in Queensland lots of local councils are going to be affected. Recently, I visited Councillor Jim Madden of Somerset Regional Council to highlight this fact because they face a stark choice: either they have to raise rates or they have to cut their budget, cut roads spending and cut infrastructure spending. What sort of choice is that? It is not only blame shifting; it is also show cost shifting coming out of a hard budget. The Abbott government has broken its promise to regional Australia. Mr Warren Truss said before the budget:


To ignore regional Australia’s need for investment and growth is to turn our backs on the opportunities for the future. 


In just two weeks, the Abbott government have savaged local government by ripping a billion in funding from local government, cutting into the financial assistance grants. Local governments rely on those grants to fund local roads and infrastructure. The government have created an Asset Recycling Fund. They want to gold plate highways but they will end up with broken roads because councils will be starved of funds to meet their obligations in investing in a road network. It is about a road network not about a gold plated highway. If it fails at the last mile, at the shopfront, at the small business or at the home, it is not a road network. These cuts will disproportionately affect rural communities, pushing some of them to the brink. These cruel cuts will mean more roads that go nowhere and bridges to nowhere as real communities suffer. These are contradictory forces at play and it is not surprising when you look at the twisted priorities the government have. 


The decision to sell assets needs to be made by the state government after sober analysis. Liberal state governments have been seduced by the short-term incentives of the political cycle to sell assets. The additional 15 per cent proposed by the federal government does skew the incentives of the state governments and encourage sales of assets. It pushes the sale of assets in the short-term interest without looking at the longer term national interest. The federal government needs to play—and it has been absent from the field—a leading role with states the territories to encourage decisions to be made in the national interest. Although asset recycling is not without its merits, in some cases it is not always the answer. The answer for many state-owned assets is better and more transparent management. The erosion of freedom of information under this government and cuts to information-gathering organisations which make proper decision-making possible are working against these outcomes of openness and transparency. 


This government hugs the dark. It prefers the shadows. It does not like transparency. Why? Because it does not like the truth about its decisions to be exposed. They are bad decisions by a government which wants to take cruel cuts. It takes cruel cuts to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. These are also quite concerning. This government does not want to know about that state of its books. It does not suit its ideological views. ABS cuts hurt private businesses just as much, especially small business which does not have the resources to forecast or run surveys and the lack of information means that when you remove information from the availability of the pool, where do get decision making? You end up with poor decision making without the charter and all you get is it—cash created by the federal government for the states. The government seems to be wilfully blind to this prospect. That is the kindest I could say about it. I could say it is deliberately doing it but I think ultimately it is literally blind to the consequences.


We have seen the forecasts and estimates for asset sales and infrastructure projects. Again, they seem to be very overly optimistic. We will get an opportunity in the Senate to hold this government to account on their forecasts. Let us not hear from those on the other side that, 'We didn't quite get that right. Our methodology was flawed. We missed some opportunity.' In this instance they own these figures. An article in the Oxford Review of Economic Policy found that 50 per cent of traffic forecasts in infrastructure projects were wrong by at least 20 per cent. If we further reduce the quality of data and research, those estimates are going to get more and more difficult. We need to consider the facts of asset sales and not some ideological driven crusade by those opposite—although they do seem to like Don Quixote. 


The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is warning the government that it needs to be wary of asset sales. Speaking to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia conference, Rod Sims, the chair of the ACCC, warns about privatisation and the perverse incentives present for the state governments. He said:


Short-term gains of maximising the up-front price received by the government is short-term gain increased and encouraged by the federal government and will have long-term costs in reduced competition and higher costs to consumers and damage to Australian businesses. 


I think the quote from Mr Sims says it all:


The ACCC is becoming aware of an increasing level of concern among businesses that are most directly affected by the sale of upstream monopoly assets to downstream competitors. The trade-off here is short-sighted and the costs in terms of productivity and investment are likely to be significant


He also said:


Privatising in ways that limit competition in order to maximise the sale proceeds is the wrong way.


The government's rush to sell off assets without examining the long-term consequences means that we pay a high price for this asset fire sale, and businesses and ordinary consumers footing the bill will suffer. Instead of investing in infrastructure with a strong business case, the states and federal government are investing in public relations. You do not have to look far to find a good example: the Queensland government has spent $6 million on an advertising campaign instead of investing in the analysis necessary for the business case for asset recycling. Instead of showing the business case for asset sales, they are being offered websites, TV ads and glib one-liners to support why they should sell assets. This shows utter contempt for Queenslanders. If there is a business case, which includes the long-term impacts of asset sales, show it to the people, be transparent about it, demonstrate why it is necessary rather than a one-word slogan. 


Labor is seeking, as I indicated earlier, two amendments to improve this bill and increase the transparency and openness of the process of approving infrastructure projects. The first of our amendments allows for the tabling of a disallowable instrument for each privatisation reinvestment transaction so that, if the government is not going to cast light on their projects, then the Senate can have a look at the projects. They can be properly scrutinised by parliament. 


Second, our amendments would require projects to be assessed by Infrastructure Australia and be deemed productivity enhancing. That is what infrastructure, building for the future, is all about: making sure we have got assets that will increase our productivity now and into the future. Projects, including an estimate of the productivity gain from the project, should also be published. 


This cost-benefit analysis must include the true cost of these sales. What are the lost revenues to government? What is the effect on competition? What is the effect on consumers? What is the effect on jobs? What is the effect for rural communities? Is the sale just short-term political expediency or is it in the nation's interest? 


You have to ask: why is the federal government afraid of these questions? They want to hide scrutiny. They don't want these questions answered, and it leaves a huge question mark about the motives of this government when it turns to asset sales. 


The threat to assets is most grave in Queensland. The debt and deficit falsehood set by Canberra has spread to governments like the Newman government but sometimes it gets lost in translation. The Newman government has been witless enough to take up the Abbott government's debt rhetoric at face value. They have promised that asset sales will be used to reduce debts and not to recycle assets. The combined ineptness of the Abbott and Newman governments means Queenslanders will suffer twice. Queenslanders will be paying their taxes to provide a bounty, effectively, to the ideologically driven sale of other state assets while Queensland stock of infrastructure will deteriorate and not be replaced. 


The Toowoomba Second Range Crossing Project I have taken a very special interest in—there are many in Queensland, who live on the other side of the range, who also follow this with a passion. I hope that some of the light I have attempted to shine on this project will mean an end to the waste and prevarication from the Abbott government on this project. I am concerned that this three-year project as detailed in their own documents has been pushed out to five years. Every year's delay costs $100 million, but don't take my word for it; take Mr Truss's own figures. These accounting tricks, costs pushed out beyond the budget forward estimates, have real costs for ordinary Australians. 


This is infrastructure on the never-never by a government that is using all the tricks in the book to try to achieve a smoke and mirrors on infrastructure.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (13:28):  The incorporated speech read as follows—


I take this opportunity to express my serious concerns about the impact and long-term consequences of the privatisation of state assets. 


I acknowledge the intent of this bill is to encourage states to invest in infrastructure projects by way of incentive payments from the Commonwealth upon the sale of state assets. I question whether this plan is short sighted and not in the interests of Australia's competition policy.


In June this year Mr Rod Sims, Chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission expressed concerns that competition has taken a back seat in the recent wave of state-owned asset sales. 


He pointed to the ACCC's recent rejection of AGL's application to acquire Macquarie Generation, Australia's largest electricity generator, as an example. In a media release dated 4 March 2014, Mr Sims said:


The proposed acquisition would result in the largest source of generation capacity in NSW being owned by one of the three largest retailers in NSW. Indeed, with this acquisition, the three largest retailers in NSW would own a combined share of 70 to 80 per cent of electricity generation capacity or output. This is likely to raise barriers to entry and expansion for other electricity retailers in NSW and therefore reduce competition compared to the situation if the proposed acquisition does not proceed.


The Australian Competition Tribunal approved AGL's application to acquire Macquarie Generation's assets, despite the ACCC's warnings that 'the proposed acquisition is likely to mean that consumers will ultimately pay more for electricity, receive lower quality service and be offered less choice.'


Time will tell whether the ACCC's warnings should have been heeded. Unfortunately it will be consumers who will be the first to feel the pain if the ACCC's predictions about electricity price rises are correct.


Mr Sims has also stressed that it is vital state governments must be 'vigilant in setting up competitive structures when they privatise their assets.' The recent sales of some ports have seen the ACCC receive complaints that these ports have been privatised without appropriate open access regimes. 


As a member of the South Australian parliament in the late 1990s, I vehemently opposed the privatisation of the then Electricity Trust of South Australia (ETSA). Not only because it was a broken promise of the then Olsen government but because it was also a bad deal for consumers.


I believe the privatisation of ETSA was structured in such a way as to maximise value of the state's assets, thereby reducing a greater amount of state debt (a legacy of the former Labor State Government), but by doing so it shifted the burden onto households and businesses with dramatically higher power prices post-privatisation. I received very sound advice back in the late 1990s from Danny Price, then at London Economics, who is now Managing Director of Frontier Economics. He was vilified by the state Liberal government at the time for his modelling and predictions of power price rises with the privatisation model adopted, and sadly his predictions were uncannily accurate. I should add, the accuracy of his modelling and predictions has not changed over the years given his concerns over the carbon tax and the CPRS legislation introduced by the former government.


If all the privatisation is doing is shifting public debt onto households and businesses then it seems to be a foolish and counterproductive exercise. 


However, in the event that this bill does pass, I would like to see it passed with material improvements and for that reason I put on notice I support the amendments proposed by the opposition in this regard.


If taxpayer money is being used to encourage the privatisation of state assets, we have a duty to ensure the public—especially, families and small businesses—do not end up footing the bill by way of higher prices.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (13:28):  I thank all senators who have contributed to this debate, in particular, Senator Conroy, for his very constructive contribution. The Asset Recycling Fund Bill 2014 and consequential amendments establish a new fund as a vehicle for providing financial assistance and incentives to states and territories to invest in infrastructure. A new fund is necessary to support the government's asset recycling initiative, a key initiative, that will encourage the states and territories to sell existing assets and reinvest in new infrastructure that contributes to a more prosperous economy. 


Payments from the Asset Recycling Fund will also be used to fund nation-building infrastructure and other National Partnership agreements payments to other bodies will be administered by the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development and will support important local initiatives such as the Roads to Recovery program in the usual way. 


Establishing a new fund to support the government's infrastructure package is sound economic policy. It allows funds being committed now to be invested so that more is available when payments become due. Entrusting the Asset Recycling Fund to the Future Fund Board of Guardians will maximise the growth of assets. The board has a proven track record in managing assets on behalf of the taxpayer. It has grown the Future Fund from around $64 billion in 2006, when the previous government invested budget surpluses into the Future Fund, to over $97 billion by the end of March—in fact, at last count, it had exceeded $100 billion.


The government is committed to the new fund, which will be established with $5.9 billion funded by an amount of uncommitted funds from the Education Investment Fund and the Building Australia Fund that have not been allocated to approved projects. The government will make further contributions following the successful privatisation of Medibank Private; it has also said that it is open to committing proceeds from other future asset sales. Finally, the Asset Recycling Fund is an essential element of the government's infrastructure package announced in the 2014-15 budget to support economic growth. I recommend that it be supported by the Senate.


Question agreed to.

We also appose clause 47 in the following terms:


(21) Clause 47, page 36 (lines 26 to 28), to be opposed.


The Asset Recycling Fund Bill 2014 and the Asset Recycling Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2014 establish a new fund as a vehicle for providing financial assistance and incentives to states and territories to invest in infrastructure. The new fund is necessary, as I have just said in my summing up speech, to support the government's asset recycling initiatives. The amendments being introduced by the government are primarily a necessary consequence of delays to the passage of the bill through parliament. Amendment (1) revises the commencement date from 1 July 2014 to the day after the bill receives royal assent. This will ensure that the parliament does not pass legislation that has retrospective effect.


Amendments (2), (3), (6), (7), (10), (11), (13) to (15), (20) and (21) are minor amendments taking into account that the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 took effect on 1 July. Amendments (4) and (5) clarify the Commonwealth can only make payments where it is permissible to do so under its executive power. These amendments provide clarity on what the government has the power to do under the Constitution. They ensure that this government and future governments cannot do anything under the bill that is inconsistent with this power. Amendments (8), (9), (18) and (19) ensure the Future Fund board of guardians has sufficient time to transfer $5.9 billion of uncommitted balances from the Education Investment Fund and the Building Australia Fund to the Asset Recycling Fund. Amendments (12), (16) and (17) ensure that the recipients of incentives and contributions towards large-scale infrastructure, including states and territories, are bound by the terms and conditions of the agreements under which funding is provided. The amendments strengthen accountability requirements that provide taxpayers with further confidence that funding is used for purposes allowed under the proposed legislation.

The focus of my remarks is around the issue of the somewhat ill-advised proposal to abolish the Education Investment Fund. I find it an extraordinary proposition that the government is seeking to do this, given the claims about the Prime Minister's obsession with infrastructure. We would all surely agree that infrastructure is critical to securing the future of the nation, but I would have thought that infrastructure would also include investments in our science and research and at our teaching facilities at our universities, at the CSIRO and TAFE colleges. 


This proposition goes to the very heart of that. These institutions, of course, are where we find the new technologies that we need to ensure that we are able to generate the economic and social benefits not just now but well into the future. That depends upon the capacity of the Commonwealth to invest. The abolition of this fund would prevent that. I am very surprised that the government should try to slip this through as being part of the arrangements for this bill. Upon reflection, I can nonetheless understand, given the government's deep antipathy to higher education. It is in that context, I suppose, that it fits with the government's mentality when it comes to the removal of the Education Investment Fund. It is another broken promise. This is exactly the opposite to what the Liberal Party said during the last election. Senator Mason was quoted in The Australian newspaper before the election as saying:


We would seek to reinvest and rebuild EIF back to its former state wants the budget is back in surplus. This is a nation-building fund and the coalition intends to restore it as such.


Of course, this could be nothing further from the truth in terms of what has actually happened with the proposal contained in this bill. I would have thought that we would have heard more from the Liberal Party itself about this act of blatant vandalism towards the higher education system in this country. I have enormous regard for Senator Mason. I think it is a great tragedy that he is not engaged in the higher education sector in this government. Of course, the obvious point that is so often made in political comedy or farce is that as soon as you actually know something about a particular field it is not surprising that governments seek to move politicians out of that field. Senator Mason certainly fits that category.


The opposition amendments provide the opportunity for this chamber to reconsider this very, very rash decision. The amendments would save the Education Investment Fund. Our amendments do so because the Education Investment Fund provides the funding for the very projects that we need to develop the infrastructure in higher education research and vocational education. If the government succeeds in abolishing the fund, serious questions must be raised about its long-term commitment to investment in these areas. It is clear that the Asset Recycling Fund will not be available for investments in those areas. Is a perverse outcome, because 59 per cent of the funding for the Asset Recycling Fund comes from education. What an extraordinary proposition: research infrastructure which is so vital to the future economic and social health of this nation is being used to fund privatisation of assets.


I note the Australian Technology Network, the group that involves a number of very respected institutions—QUT; RMIT University, in my home state of Victoria; the University of Technology, Sydney; the University of South Australia; Curtin University—has raised concerns. In their submission to the Senate inquiry into the bills they state:


The ATN is concerned about the continuation of research infrastructure funding from 2015 and the lack of guidance in the Bill as to how future research related infrastructure projects will be prioritised for funding via the ARF.


The Australian Technology Network of universities went on to say that the coalition election policy stated that the coalition was in the business of:


… building a world-class Education and Research sector


This bill could be nothing further from that. It notes the statement in which the coalition government pledged that it would:


… encourage modernisation and the development of world-class Education and Research capabilities and support the use of new technologies, particularly digital and IT.


This bill could be nothing further from that. This government attacking the agencies that could deliver on such an election commitment, such as Australian universities, CSIRO, and NICTA. This is exactly the sort of thing I suppose we could relate back to what the Prime Minister said when he said that we 'should judge him on his performance'. His performance in this matter is abysmal. The ATN also noted:


The provision of modern research capabilities comes at a cost. To date 71 infrastructure projects have been funded by EIF to the sum of $2.4 billion. This included $643m in funding for pure research infrastructure … 


The ATN submission also raise concerns about the removal of the remaining research funding mechanisms:


Therefore following the removal of EIF the remaining research funding mechanisms, including research block grant funding, are not sufficient to create world class research infrastructure.


It strikes me that this is a pretty fair point. You take this money away and what are we going to use to fund the necessary research infrastructure in this country? How are we going to be able to fund the work that CSIRO does in terms of research infrastructure, the work of the universities, the work of the other science agencies?


I might emphasise that I have got a bit of an interest in this matter, because when I was the minister the fund operation placed particular importance on proper administration by an independent board. It was not a pork-barrelling exercise, as we have seen with this government in its attempt to use Australian Research Council funding. It was not done in any way other than on a competitive basis—on the basis of an evaluation of projects under very rigorous criteria. There were over four funding rounds and 71 projects were supported. They were projects on university campuses, TAFE campuses—projects supporting major scientific infrastructure. They were projects like these: the Science and Engineering Precinct in Ballarat, now at the Federation University; the Science Place for northern Queensland at James Cook University; the Indian Ocean Marine Research Centre at the University of Western Australia; the University of Tasmania Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies; the University of Adelaide's Institute for Photonics and Advanced Sensing; the Latrobe Rural Health School in Bendigo; the University of Western Sydney Centre for Climate Change and Energy Research.


I note that on Tuesday—and this is a particular irony—the Minister for Industry was at Mount Stromlo launching another project that was funded through this fund. The project is, of course, the Advanced Instrumentation and Technology Centre. And I will seek leave to table the minister's press statement from Tuesday because it will highlight the sorts of infrastructure projects that are funded by this government which, of course—I must say that the minister was at least gracious enough to acknowledge that the funding had actually been provided by a Labor government.




Senator Conroy:
  By you.




Senator KIM CARR:
  I won't be so crass, Senator!




Senator Conroy:
  That is a first!




Senator KIM CARR:
  But I will suggest that it is quite unusual for this government to acknowledge the work that we did in regard to the provision of basic infrastructure and, particularly, in regard to the importance of the universities and scientific agencies. I quote from the media release:


Australian scientists have snared two world-leading contracts to make astronomical instruments which will further consolidate Australia’s reputation for global innovation, Minister for Industry Ian Macfarlane said today. The Australian National University’s Advanced Instrumentation and Technology Centre at Mount Stromlo has been contracted to design one of the first instruments for the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT), a super-giant earth-based telescope being built in Chile that is set to revolutionise our view and understanding of the universe.


I understand the minister is happy for me to table that press release.




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Smith
):  Is leave granted for Senator Carr?


Leave granted.




Senator KIM CARR:
  I do that because it might help the minister understand the importance of these issues of which his colleagues obviously do appreciate. But it has not sunk in. This very principle of the importance of universities in Australia winning major contracts and providing the central thrust for our science and research effort in this country has just not registered. At the same time, of course, this is a government that the very next day seeks to debate in this chamber a proposal to abolish the fund that actually ensures that these sorts of projects go ahead.


Of course, it is not just the universities that will suffer. The Education Investment Fund has been a great benefit to the CSIRO. That may well be a problem for this government given the hostility this government has shown to the CSIRO. It may well be that this is yet another one of its cunning plans to do great damage to our scientific infrastructure. It was the fund that we used to actually provide the new deep-sea research vessel, the Southern Surveyor. Without EIF, this nation would be left without the capacity to carry out our marine and ocean research—our blue-water research capacity. 


The minister has appointed a working party to look at this. There have simply been no answers to the way in which we can ensure future funding arrangements, unless there is provision made—you actually have to do something and not just have good intentions or just make an assertion that you are interested when all of the evidence and all of the facts point to exactly the opposite. 


The last budget that this government brought down highlighted its intentions. It was where it put its actions on the line rather than its statements. We saw during the election campaign that commitments were being made which are clearly being breached. This is yet another example of the way in which commitments that this country so desperately needs—to ensure that our universities are able to sustain their capabilities and to ensure that our universities are not placed in the position that they cannot provide the capabilities that we need to ensure the prosperity for this country—are being breached.


I know that the real opportunity for the government here is to allow this bill to go through in its full, which will in turn lead to the universities having to undertake even more drastic actions in regard to the privatisation of their efforts. The consequences are simple: this is a country that will be poorer as a result of this government's policy positions. That is why it is so critical for us in this Senate to weigh up carefully what is being said to us by this government, to reject the proposals that the government is making and to support the amendments. Because, without systematic and sustained funding in our research infrastructure, this nation will not be able to prosper and Australia will not be able to attract the very best and very brightest in the world. That is what we are doing with the investments that we are making in terms of our long-term commitment to research into commercialisation of research. 


The abolition of the Education Investment Fund is an ill-considered decision by a government that does not understand the consequences of treating the research community in this way. You simply cannot treat the research community in a way of just turning on and off the tap of government support. That is why these amendments are being moved. This government's proposal is a demonstration of a wilful neglect to the fundamental principle of being able to provide this country with the necessity of ensuring that our universities, our scientific agencies and our TAFE colleges have the funding support they need to be able to provide the basic infrastructure they need to be able to ensure that this country is able to maintain its prosperity. I urge all senators to support these amendments.

I do want it recorded that the intention of items (1) to (6) and (14) to (17) on sheet 7486 is to prevent the government from transferring $3.5 billion from the Education Investment Fund into the Asset Recycling Fund. I believe that this should be opposed. I intend to oppose it. The purpose of the amendments is essentially to restrict the amount of funds available to promote privatisation and to place limits on the types of infrastructure that the Commonwealth is promoting. I intend to vote against this. I will, however, vote in favour of another section of Senator Conroy's amendments, subject to it being amended by my amendment.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (13:52):  I will provide some comments on behalf of the Australian Greens. We support the Labor amendments that Senator Conroy foreshadowed and Senator Carr has just spoken to. The idea that the Australian government would effectively sneak through the abolition of a $3½ billion education and research fund for university and research infrastructure projects beggars belief. To bring it forward under the rubric of 'privatise everything' and at the stroke of the pen knock over $3½ billion worth of university and research infrastructure work is extraordinary.


The EIF is one of three nation-building funds, along with the Building Australia Fund and the Health and Hospitals Fund. It was established to build a modern, productive and internationally competitive Australian economy by supporting world-leading, strategically focused, infrastructure investments that will transform Australian tertiary education and research. What part of that statement is offensive to the Liberals and the Nationals? How could you conceivably come in here and gut funding for something that had that as its intention? How can you then front press conferences day after day talking about innovation, economic growth and strength and staying at the forefront? What century is it that you are try to keep us in?


As a result of the Commission of Audit on the future use of nation-building funds—and I guess without too much surprise: you commission these reports and they will give you what you expect in large part—the government announced that the EIF would be axed, that no further funding rounds would be held and existing projects would continue to be funded, but basically it turned off the funding tap for such an important fund.


One of the reasons that the Greens are strongly in support of the amendments and strongly defend the EIF is the kinds of projects and work it has been funding. When you look at those you realise exactly why it is that the coalition loathes it so much. The EIF supports clean energy research infrastructure. It provided $4 million to the University of Queensland to build research infrastructure to support the AGL Energy Photovoltaic Solar Flagship. There we go! That starts to give us a bit of an idea of why the coalition might hate it. It has the words 'energy efficiency' in it, it has the word 'solar' in it, therefore wipe it out. The EIF regional priorities round funded 10 projects, including Creative Futures Tasmania and advanced design and engineering training in Victoria. Round 3 included the EIF sustainability around. Oh, another word that the coalition cannot abide! Anything with the word 'sustainability' in it is being abolished as well. Nineteen projects were approved for funding across tertiary education and research sectors, including the advanced manufacturing centre at Swinburne University and the Indian Ocean Marine research Centre at the University of Western Australia. Why would we need people to be researching oceanography? Get rid of that. Central Tech Green Skills Training Centre at Central TAFE in WA? Yes, absolutely—the word 'green' is in that one. The University of Wollongong's Retrofitting for Resilient and Sustainable Buildings? Obviously that is the kind of thing that the Liberal and National parties hate. The Greens strongly support these Labor amendments and commend them to the chamber.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (13:55):  On behalf of the government I indicate to the chamber that we will not be supporting these amendments. These amendments seek to prevent the government from transferring, as Senator Leyonhjelm indicated, $3.5 billion in uncommitted funds from the Education Investment Fund to the Asset Recycling Fund. Without the proposed transfer from the Education Investment Fund, the Asset Recycling Fund will not be viable for the purposes for which it is being established. The proposed transfer, as I have indicated, relates only to uncommitted funds in the Education Investment Fund—that is, amounts for which no projects have been either approved or identified. The government will meet commitments to projects already previously approved for funding from the Education Investment Fund, including those approved by the previous government. These projects will not be affected by the transfer of uncommitted amounts to the Asset Recycling Fund.

Senator PERIS
 (Northern Territory) (12:45):  I continue to talk to the Asset Recycling Fund Bill 2014 and related bill. If I can go back to where I was before the debate was interrupted. The people of the Northern Territory know that selling Power and Water will guarantee two things; higher prices and longer, more frequent blackouts. So I am very concerned that Power and Water will be sold off under the scheme if this bill is passed.


I am also concerned that the people of the Northern Territory will get no say. It will just be announced one day and that is the way the Northern Territory government currently operates. We will wake up one morning and there will be an article on the front page of the Northern Territory News telling us that Power and Water will be sold. A deal has been done with the Abbott government and it will be sold. The Territory Insurance Office, TIO, is the only remaining government-owned insurance and banking institution in the country. There has been much talk about the potential sale of Power and Water over many years. As the only remaining financial institution in government ownership, it can be seen by some as an obvious candidate for sale. But let me tell you that people in the Northern Territory do not want it sold.


 Living in a cyclone-prone area we have an extra interest in home and contents insurance. It is already expensive and people simply do not want TIO sold. Again, from their public comments, the Northern Territory government are clearly looking at selling TIO. They refuse to rule it out.


The next candidate is the Port of Darwin. The port is less visible in the day-to-day lives of people in the Northern Territory than Power and Water, and TIO. But it is still extremely important to Territorians. Private investment in the port and its operations should be encouraged but, in an underdeveloped economy, we should not be selling off the assets that are so crucial to our plans to develop the north. Again, it would be outrageous if funds for our roads, to get cattle and minerals to the port, depended on the sale of our port. Those are my concerns about what the Northern Territory government would do with this fund.


That is why I support Labor's position on any potential sale that it be subject to a disallowable instrument. If the CLP government sell off any of our assets without proper consultation process or against the public interest, then we can block it from being eligible for sale under this scheme.


 If a state or territory government go through the proper processes of selling an asset, if they undertake a full cost-benefit analysis and take their plans to an election and receive the endorsement of the community and the people of the Northern Territory, then and only then a contribution from the Commonwealth under this scheme will be warranted.


However if a government—and the CLP government in the Northern Territory are probably the most unlikely to do this—just suddenly announce a sale without any analysis and in complete opposition to community sentiment, then it is not appropriate that the Commonwealth support the sale through this scheme.


Finally, these are my main points. Our infrastructure spending should not be dependent on selling our infrastructure. In order to get our fair share of infrastructure funding, we should not be required to sell off our vital public assets. I am concerned that the Commonwealth government will use this fund to encourage the Northern Territory government to sell off our assets. I am also concerned that the Northern Territory government will use this fund to do what they want to do and that is to sell off our assets. 


We are only getting less than one per cent of the Abbott government's infrastructure budget over the next seven years. Selling everything is not the solution. The Commonwealth parliament should be allowed to block a sale through a disallowable instrument.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2014-07-17,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (12:49):  The Asset Recycling Fund Bill 2014 and the Asset Recycling Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2014 are a desperate and belated attempt by the Abbott government to gain some credentials as an 'infrastructure government'. It is though infrastructure is an afterthought to them, not something they care a great deal about. The government do not even go close to matching the former Labor government's record investment in infrastructure.


After all, it was Labor that invested $16.2 billion during the height of the global financial crisis, through the BER program, Building the Education Revolution, to build the school infrastructure of the 21st century. This was investment which helped stimulate the economy. We saved hundreds of thousands of jobs during the GFC, opposed by those opposite who, had they got their way, would have seen Australia plunged into recession.


Our economic stimulus plan, including the BER program, was praised by Nobel prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz as being well designed. In fact, Professor Stiglitz said that, had it not been for the economic stimulus package designed by Labor and opposed by the economic neophytes opposite, Australia's national debt would have been considerably larger. 


It was a Labor government which initiated Australia's largest ever national infrastructure project. I am talking, of course, about the National Broadband Network. I cannot emphasise enough how people from my home state of Tasmania, who are now connected to the network, are describing to me the transformative effect it is having on their lives and businesses.


Infrastructure spending overall under Labor went up by 42 per cent since the last full year of the Howard government—a government which paid very little attention to building Australia's infrastructure. Labor lifted annual infrastructure spending in Australia, from $132 per person to $225. We upgraded 7,500 kilometres of Australia's road network and upgraded 4,000 kilometres of Australia's rail network. Road spending doubled under Labor and we invested $13.6 billion in urban rail—more than had been invested by all of our predecessors combined since Federation. We also invested a further $3.4 billion in rail freight, which has been of great benefit to my home state of Tasmania, which relies heavily on rail for the transportation of freight across the state.


When Labor took office, Australia ranked 20th in the OECD in infrastructure spending; because of Labor's record investment in infrastructure, Australia now ranks first. In my home state of Tasmania, we saw significant investment going into the south of the state for the first time in over a decade. While the Howard government had focused on projects in the marginal electorates of Bass and Braddon, Labor delivered hundreds of millions of dollars in funding to projects such as the Blundstone Arena upgrade; the Brighton bypass and transport hub; the Kingston bypass upgrades to the Brooker Highway; trade training centres and GP superclinics; the Huon Valley and south-east Tasmania water schemes; and several of the first rollout sites of Labor's National Broadband Network—that is, the real NBN, not the coalition's second-rate alternative. Under a Labor government, the annual infrastructure spending to Tasmania almost doubled—from $157 per Tasmanian to $264 per Tasmanian. Not only did Labor in government dramatically boost Australia's infrastructure investment, we implemented important reforms to make sure that we got the best value out of all our infrastructure spending.


Infrastructure Australia was established as an independent expert authority to advise the government—and, more importantly, the public—on Australia's infrastructure needs. One of Infrastructure Australia's roles is to evaluate the contribution of proposed infrastructure projects and rank them in order of their contribution to Australia's productivity. An important part of this reform was that Infrastructure Australia's advice be provided to the public. Part of the reason Infrastructure Australia was established with this function was to give the Australian government an incentive to invest in the infrastructure projects that provided the best outcomes for Australians, not the best outcomes for the government's political fortunes.


Unfortunately though, pork-barrelling to marginal electorates has been a longstanding practice of coalition governments—and one of the reasons why we need a national body to provide independent advice on infrastructure. Our reforms to infrastructure funding were implemented after the Australian National Audit Office released a damning report on the Howard government's Regional Partnerships program. The report said that the program had 'fallen short of an acceptable standard of public administration'. Grants had been provided for projects that had not been properly assessed, that government departments had advised against, and—listen to this—to groups that had not even applied for funding. You did not even have to apply for funding and you got some!


I am pleased that the government has not proceeded with its previous plans to gag Infrastructure Australia and take away its independence and has agreed to the Senate's amendments to its bill. It was completely bizarre that the government guillotined debate on that bill in the House back in December but did not bring it to the Senate until as late as June this year. Perhaps they finally succumbed to pressure from the business community, who supported Labor's call that infrastructure policy actually be made on the basis of what is in the national interest. The attacks by the Abbott government on the independence of Infrastructure Australia were just one part of the story of this government's poor record on infrastructure. The coalition has made various attempts to trumpet its achievements as 'an infrastructure government'—and all of them have fallen flat. After all, this is the government which has scrapped both the Regional Infrastructure Fund and the Regional Development Australia Fund. The government's decision to gut funding for regional Australia has been supported by, strangely, the Nationals, who continue their bizarre charade of pretending to stand up for regional Australia.


The Abbott government has claimed credit for various road and rail projects, worth more than $12 billion, despite these projects already being announced and funded by Labor. A great example of one of the road projects funded by Labor and then re-announced by the coalition is the Huon Highway-Summerleas Road intersection. This particular intersection is in the electorate of Franklin and just a stone's throw from my electorate office in Kingston. I stood at that intersection, with the federal member for Franklin, Julie Collins, in August when Labor announced a $17.5 million commitment to the intersection which had been funded in the 2013-14 federal budget. So I was quite amused to see a contribution from Senator Bushby in the local newspaper, the Kingborough Chronicle, in which he announced that the government was funding this project where Labor had 'failed to deliver on it'. Senator Bushby referred to years of inaction by state and federal Labor governments and said that the dangerous intersection was of great concern to him. It is interesting, therefore, that Senator Bushby was strangely silent on the intersection during the federal election. Maybe that is because the coalition failed to match Labor's $17.5 million commitment until February the following year, a full five months after the election, even though the upgrade had already been funded in the previous year's budget.


After failing to commit to this and several other funded infrastructure projects in the south of Tasmania, the Abbott government has now set about re-announcing them as if they were its own. These projects include the Huon Highway-Summerleas Road intersection; upgrades to the Brooker Highway between Elwick Road and Howard Road; and Tasman Highway on and off ramps at the East Derwent Highway intersection. The Abbott Government has still failed to make up the $100 million shortfall in Labor's funding for the Midland Highway. While Labor had provided $500 million funding for upgrades to the highway, the Abbott government announced that it would provide $400 million for the full duplication of the highway to four lanes. Good luck with that! In reality, this project would cost about $2 billion, whereas $400 million would probably provide duplication as far as Bridgewater to Bagdad. Unfortunately, it took until after the election for the Prime Minister to belatedly admit that $400 million would not provide for full duplication.


As if they have not embarrassed themselves enough in Tasmania, in the last budget the Abbott government triumphantly announced infrastructure spending of more than $40 billion over the next six years. But many of those projects were also recycled Labor commitments. Prior to this budget, Labor had already approved projects worth $35 billion over the next six years, and several of the coalition's new road projects—$5 billion worth—have been funded by ripping money out of rail projects. In fact, by refusing to fund any new rail or other public transport projects, this government is creating a perverse incentive for state and territory governments to divert funding to road projects even if roads do not provide the greatest productivity gain.


This is a double whammy for commuters, who will be faced with fewer public transport options and slugged another $2 billion to $3 billion with the government's reintroduction of the petrol excise. The budget also rips funding out of public transport concessions. Perhaps the government has a secret agenda of trying to get more transport users on the roads so that they can collect more revenue from the fuel tax hike. If that is not the reason, then I fail to see the logic in determining, as this government has, that roads are the responsibility of the Commonwealth but rail infrastructure is not. I would be willing to bet that most Australians are with me on that one too.


Of course roads are an important part of our transport infrastructure, but so is public transport. In fact, investment in public transport helps reduce traffic congestion, provides a cost-effective alternative for many commuters, and is better for the environment than car transport. But, unfortunately, the Abbott government seem unable to see the bigger picture when it comes to transport infrastructure funding. Unfortunately, they have also gone back to their old practice of pork-barrelling—the old practice that the Howard government engaged in.


According to Fairfax Media analysis, as reported in the Sydney Morning Herald last month, the infrastructure projects that have received new funding favour coalition electorates by a ratio of three to one. The Herald also pointed out that the majority of projects the Abbott government had withdrawn Commonwealth funding from were in non-coalition electorates. The Herald article quotes Monash University Professor of Transport, Graham Currie, who said:


The question is whether they want to be a professional government or they want to pork-barrel, and whether we'll forge the idea of trying to be professional about how we manage resources or just do it on a political basis.


I don't think that's how a country should be run.


So that, in a nutshell, is the Abbott government's record on infrastructure investment so far—pork-barrelling, recycling old projects, attempting to deny proper public assessments of projects and having a bizarre bias against rail projects in favour of roads for no explicable reason. The two bills that are now before the Senate, regrettably, do not improve on this record.


The two bills we are currently debating form part of the Abbott government's infrastructure package announced in the 2014-15 federal budget. The key element of the bills is the Asset Recycling Initiative, which will be used to incentivise the states and territories to invest in new productive infrastructure by privatising existing assets. The Commonwealth will provide a contribution of 15 per cent of the reinvested sale proceeds to the cost of the project. This initiative is still subject to a national partnership agreement.


With these bills, the government are up to their old tricks again—trumpeting the investment they are making in infrastructure when they are actually just redirecting money that is already committed to other things. In the case of the Asset Recycling Fund, the government are doing some recycling of their own—taking $2.4 billion of uncommitted funds from the Building Australia Fund and $3.5 billion of uncommitted funds from the Education Infrastructure Fund—for an initial contribution of $5.9 billion. Like the EIF and the BAF, the Asset Recycling Fund will be managed as part of the Future Fund. Unlike the EIF and the BAF, projects to be funded by the portfolio ministers will not be subject to recommendations by an advisory board as to the merit of the projects. It begs the question: how does the government know that a project is going to be 'productivity enhancing' when it is put forward for a grant or payment? Is it just another case of the government picking winners, like they will with their Emissions Reduction Fund? The more important question is: how does the public know? How can the public have confidence that this fund is actually investing in projects that produce an economic gain for Australia? They have provided no independent mechanism for ensuring the project will actually have productivity gains or for comparing the productivity gains of different proposals.


Labor achieved record investment in infrastructure, and we did so during the largest global economic crisis since the Depression. We also achieved this by funding projects on a 50-50 basis and without the need for state and territory governments to sell public assets. Given Labor's record investments in infrastructure in partnership with the states and territories, we believe that replacing this support with a 15 per cent incentive payment is a backward step. This government is handballing its responsibility for real investment in infrastructure to the states and territories. Wouldn't it be better if the government would help the states to fund their infrastructure priorities regardless of where the funds come from? Why does the government see it as necessary to provide the states with an incentive—or a 'bribe' as it was described by Chris Aulich, Professor of Public Administration at the University of Canberra—to privatise their assets? 


We on this side believe that the concept of asset recycling can have merit in some circumstances. For example, in 2007 in my home state of Tasmania, there was a very sensible instance of asset recycling when the Labor government sold the Hobart Airport site and invested the proceeds in the Brighton transport hub, the Royal Hobart Hospital and irrigation projects. However, we want to ensure that the money that is invested in new projects is invested wisely—that Australians get maximum bang for their buck. After all, when state and territory governments privatise their assets they can only sell them once.


Labor will be moving amendments to this bill. The amendments will require, as a precondition for spending Commonwealth funds on the Asset Recycling Initiative: an assessment by Infrastructure Australia of the new infrastructure as 'productivity enhancing', including a published cost-benefit analysis; and tabling of a disallowable instrument for each privatisation and reinvestment transaction. I hope that the government senators and the crossbenchers will support our amendments to this bill. I am disappointed that the government did not support our amendments in the other place, as it was a good opportunity for them to demonstrate that they support transparency and due diligence. These amendments are about increasing the accountability and transparency of the Asset Recycling Initiative, to ensure that the projects funded through this initiative will genuinely enhance productivity.


Labor believes that Infrastructure Australia, an independent and expert body, is best placed to assess the contribution of new infrastructure projects to Australia's productivity. Strengthening the role of independent expert bodies to ensure good policy outcomes is a core belief of Labor, as distinct from a government that is working to dismantle independent advisory bodies such as the Climate Change Authority, the Immigration Health Advisory Group and others working on positive ageing, social inclusion, animal welfare, Indigenous leadership and a variety of other policy areas. It is vital that infrastructure decisions are made by this government with the national interest in mind, not their own political interests. We do not intend to allow the Asset Recycling Initiative to become a slush fund to allow state and territory governments to pork-barrel to marginal electorates.


These amendments are about taking an evidence based approach to decisions on infrastructure funding. Before the infrastructure minister makes a grant or payment to a state or territory, they must first receive an independent evaluation of the project which confirms that the project will actually have productivity gains. The requirement for the minister to approve grants via a disallowable instrument is to ensure that not only are quality decisions made on infrastructure investments but quality decisions are also made on privatisation of the assets sold to fund them.


Unlike those opposite, Labor is not of the view that all privatisation is necessarily good. These bills are providing the states and territories with an incentive to privatise assets, and the Commonwealth should not be rewarding them for engaging in a fire sale of assets or for selling assets without appropriate regulatory protections. The idea that privatisation is good in all circumstances is Tea Party thinking—the kind of attitude that the ideologues who have taken over the Liberal Party seem to be engaging in more and more. This is a flawed bill, but it can be improved with Labor's amendments, which I hope that the other side will agree to and which I commend to the Senate.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2014-07-17,"



Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland) (13:08):  I rise to speak on the Asset Recycling Fund Bill 2014. Australia's infrastructure is too important to be left to pork-barrelling and the whims of the political cycle, especially the whims of this government. In the committee stage, Labor will seek to pass two amendments. We will look for crossbench support, because it is about ensuring that there is transparency and openness of the process for approving infrastructure projects. All Australians would want that, to ensure that there is scrutiny of those infrastructure projects. The coalition's plan for asset recycling has three major flaws. Firstly, it does not allow for independent scrutiny of the infrastructure projects. Secondly, it distorts the state government's decisions on asset sales, promoting the ill-thought-through selling of assets for short-term gains. Thirdly, it does not guarantee any new money for investment in infrastructure. 


Infrastructure spending under Labor rose to record levels. We went from being 20th in the OECD, in terms of spending on infrastructure as a proportion of GDP, to first, under Labor's watch. Labor lifted funding for infrastructure from about $130 for each Australian to about $220. Labor doubled the roads budget, to $46.6 billion, and upgraded 7,500 kilometres of road. But we also recognise that it is not enough just to increase funding. The money has to be spent on worthwhile infrastructure that will create not only returns for Australians but productivity increases into the future. Labor created Infrastructure Australia to research and rank proposed infrastructure projects based on their potential to add economic productivity. Infrastructure Australia introduced independent advice and the opportunity to add transparency and openness into the process for planning for infrastructure in Australia. Labor also planned for the future. The National Ports Strategy and National Land Freight Strategy meant that informed decisions could be made about infrastructure investment in the context of a broader plan for ports and freight. Infrastructure, without this sort of strategic plan, is just a recipe for expensive white elephants. This government wants to throw up plenty of those. 


We on this side of the chamber are proud of Labor's achievement in infrastructure. Indeed, this government seems proud of Labor's achievements too. Almost all of the coalition's announced infrastructure projects are re-announcements of Labor funded projects. Take one example. Take the Bruce Highway. During Senate estimates, we learnt there was no new money. Mr Truss uses the terms 'locked in', 'confirmed', 'affirmed', 'reconfirmed' or 'recommitted', but what he really should say is simply 're-announced'. Labor invested $5.7 billion in the Bruce Highway, dwarfing the $1.3 billion spent by the previous Howard government. For all their rhetoric, under the Howard regime they did not spend on infrastructure. Labor delivered four times the funding in half the time. Labor remains committed to improving the Bruce Highway, fixing up the area that the Howard government failed to act in and this government is also ignoring.


The coalition has failed to follow Labor's lead in investing in important Queensland infrastructure. The Cross River Rail project is a good example of a coalition failure. Infrastructure Australia said the Cross River Rail project was a strategic priority for Australia's infrastructure, and it judged the project as passing the cost-benefit test and ready to proceed. The Liberals have pulled $700 million out of the project. It defies good decision making and shows that this government is focused on pet projects and not projects which can drive productivity or develop infrastructure from the best business case. The federal government already provided the bulk of funding for large infrastructure projects, so this needs to be protected and not raided by this government to pay for the Asset Recycling Fund. This Asset Recycling Fund must provide funds in addition to existing federal commitments. There must be new nation-building projects in road, rail and other nationally significant infrastructure, otherwise it is just recycling in truth.


We know we cannot trust the government on this. We have seen already the twisted priorities of the coalition government—the way they try to hide their cruel cuts to pensioners and ordinary Australians, pretending that taxes are not taxes really and that cuts to education and health are not truly cuts. They use miserable words to describe their short-sightedness, but the country cannot afford those cuts and cannot afford cuts to infrastructure. As a start, they are taking $2.4 billion from the Building Australia Fund and $3.5 billion from the Education Investment Fund for the Asset Recycling Fund. What they effectively are doing is shuffling the money out of one area into another, claiming that it is new money. It is not new money from infrastructure; it is already there. 


On top of that, they are also taking cuts from local government which are going to hurt local infrastructure. I know in Queensland lots of local councils are going to be affected. Recently, I visited Councillor Jim Madden of Somerset Regional Council to highlight this fact because they face a stark choice: either they have to raise rates or they have to cut their budget, cut roads spending and cut infrastructure spending. What sort of choice is that? It is not only blame shifting; it is also show cost shifting coming out of a hard budget. The Abbott government has broken its promise to regional Australia. Mr Warren Truss said before the budget:


To ignore regional Australia’s need for investment and growth is to turn our backs on the opportunities for the future. 


In just two weeks, the Abbott government have savaged local government by ripping a billion in funding from local government, cutting into the financial assistance grants. Local governments rely on those grants to fund local roads and infrastructure. The government have created an Asset Recycling Fund. They want to gold plate highways but they will end up with broken roads because councils will be starved of funds to meet their obligations in investing in a road network. It is about a road network not about a gold plated highway. If it fails at the last mile, at the shopfront, at the small business or at the home, it is not a road network. These cuts will disproportionately affect rural communities, pushing some of them to the brink. These cruel cuts will mean more roads that go nowhere and bridges to nowhere as real communities suffer. These are contradictory forces at play and it is not surprising when you look at the twisted priorities the government have. 


The decision to sell assets needs to be made by the state government after sober analysis. Liberal state governments have been seduced by the short-term incentives of the political cycle to sell assets. The additional 15 per cent proposed by the federal government does skew the incentives of the state governments and encourage sales of assets. It pushes the sale of assets in the short-term interest without looking at the longer term national interest. The federal government needs to play—and it has been absent from the field—a leading role with states the territories to encourage decisions to be made in the national interest. Although asset recycling is not without its merits, in some cases it is not always the answer. The answer for many state-owned assets is better and more transparent management. The erosion of freedom of information under this government and cuts to information-gathering organisations which make proper decision-making possible are working against these outcomes of openness and transparency. 


This government hugs the dark. It prefers the shadows. It does not like transparency. Why? Because it does not like the truth about its decisions to be exposed. They are bad decisions by a government which wants to take cruel cuts. It takes cruel cuts to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. These are also quite concerning. This government does not want to know about that state of its books. It does not suit its ideological views. ABS cuts hurt private businesses just as much, especially small business which does not have the resources to forecast or run surveys and the lack of information means that when you remove information from the availability of the pool, where do get decision making? You end up with poor decision making without the charter and all you get is it—cash created by the federal government for the states. The government seems to be wilfully blind to this prospect. That is the kindest I could say about it. I could say it is deliberately doing it but I think ultimately it is literally blind to the consequences.


We have seen the forecasts and estimates for asset sales and infrastructure projects. Again, they seem to be very overly optimistic. We will get an opportunity in the Senate to hold this government to account on their forecasts. Let us not hear from those on the other side that, 'We didn't quite get that right. Our methodology was flawed. We missed some opportunity.' In this instance they own these figures. An article in the Oxford Review of Economic Policy found that 50 per cent of traffic forecasts in infrastructure projects were wrong by at least 20 per cent. If we further reduce the quality of data and research, those estimates are going to get more and more difficult. We need to consider the facts of asset sales and not some ideological driven crusade by those opposite—although they do seem to like Don Quixote. 


The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is warning the government that it needs to be wary of asset sales. Speaking to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia conference, Rod Sims, the chair of the ACCC, warns about privatisation and the perverse incentives present for the state governments. He said:


Short-term gains of maximising the up-front price received by the government is short-term gain increased and encouraged by the federal government and will have long-term costs in reduced competition and higher costs to consumers and damage to Australian businesses. 


I think the quote from Mr Sims says it all:


The ACCC is becoming aware of an increasing level of concern among businesses that are most directly affected by the sale of upstream monopoly assets to downstream competitors. The trade-off here is short-sighted and the costs in terms of productivity and investment are likely to be significant


He also said:


Privatising in ways that limit competition in order to maximise the sale proceeds is the wrong way.


The government's rush to sell off assets without examining the long-term consequences means that we pay a high price for this asset fire sale, and businesses and ordinary consumers footing the bill will suffer. Instead of investing in infrastructure with a strong business case, the states and federal government are investing in public relations. You do not have to look far to find a good example: the Queensland government has spent $6 million on an advertising campaign instead of investing in the analysis necessary for the business case for asset recycling. Instead of showing the business case for asset sales, they are being offered websites, TV ads and glib one-liners to support why they should sell assets. This shows utter contempt for Queenslanders. If there is a business case, which includes the long-term impacts of asset sales, show it to the people, be transparent about it, demonstrate why it is necessary rather than a one-word slogan. 


Labor is seeking, as I indicated earlier, two amendments to improve this bill and increase the transparency and openness of the process of approving infrastructure projects. The first of our amendments allows for the tabling of a disallowable instrument for each privatisation reinvestment transaction so that, if the government is not going to cast light on their projects, then the Senate can have a look at the projects. They can be properly scrutinised by parliament. 


Second, our amendments would require projects to be assessed by Infrastructure Australia and be deemed productivity enhancing. That is what infrastructure, building for the future, is all about: making sure we have got assets that will increase our productivity now and into the future. Projects, including an estimate of the productivity gain from the project, should also be published. 


This cost-benefit analysis must include the true cost of these sales. What are the lost revenues to government? What is the effect on competition? What is the effect on consumers? What is the effect on jobs? What is the effect for rural communities? Is the sale just short-term political expediency or is it in the nation's interest? 


You have to ask: why is the federal government afraid of these questions? They want to hide scrutiny. They don't want these questions answered, and it leaves a huge question mark about the motives of this government when it turns to asset sales. 


The threat to assets is most grave in Queensland. The debt and deficit falsehood set by Canberra has spread to governments like the Newman government but sometimes it gets lost in translation. The Newman government has been witless enough to take up the Abbott government's debt rhetoric at face value. They have promised that asset sales will be used to reduce debts and not to recycle assets. The combined ineptness of the Abbott and Newman governments means Queenslanders will suffer twice. Queenslanders will be paying their taxes to provide a bounty, effectively, to the ideologically driven sale of other state assets while Queensland stock of infrastructure will deteriorate and not be replaced. 


The Toowoomba Second Range Crossing Project I have taken a very special interest in—there are many in Queensland, who live on the other side of the range, who also follow this with a passion. I hope that some of the light I have attempted to shine on this project will mean an end to the waste and prevarication from the Abbott government on this project. I am concerned that this three-year project as detailed in their own documents has been pushed out to five years. Every year's delay costs $100 million, but don't take my word for it; take Mr Truss's own figures. These accounting tricks, costs pushed out beyond the budget forward estimates, have real costs for ordinary Australians. 


This is infrastructure on the never-never by a government that is using all the tricks in the book to try to achieve a smoke and mirrors on infrastructure.

Leave granted.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2014-07-17,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (13:28):  The incorporated speech read as follows—


I take this opportunity to express my serious concerns about the impact and long-term consequences of the privatisation of state assets. 


I acknowledge the intent of this bill is to encourage states to invest in infrastructure projects by way of incentive payments from the Commonwealth upon the sale of state assets. I question whether this plan is short sighted and not in the interests of Australia's competition policy.


In June this year Mr Rod Sims, Chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission expressed concerns that competition has taken a back seat in the recent wave of state-owned asset sales. 


He pointed to the ACCC's recent rejection of AGL's application to acquire Macquarie Generation, Australia's largest electricity generator, as an example. In a media release dated 4 March 2014, Mr Sims said:


The proposed acquisition would result in the largest source of generation capacity in NSW being owned by one of the three largest retailers in NSW. Indeed, with this acquisition, the three largest retailers in NSW would own a combined share of 70 to 80 per cent of electricity generation capacity or output. This is likely to raise barriers to entry and expansion for other electricity retailers in NSW and therefore reduce competition compared to the situation if the proposed acquisition does not proceed.


The Australian Competition Tribunal approved AGL's application to acquire Macquarie Generation's assets, despite the ACCC's warnings that 'the proposed acquisition is likely to mean that consumers will ultimately pay more for electricity, receive lower quality service and be offered less choice.'


Time will tell whether the ACCC's warnings should have been heeded. Unfortunately it will be consumers who will be the first to feel the pain if the ACCC's predictions about electricity price rises are correct.


Mr Sims has also stressed that it is vital state governments must be 'vigilant in setting up competitive structures when they privatise their assets.' The recent sales of some ports have seen the ACCC receive complaints that these ports have been privatised without appropriate open access regimes. 


As a member of the South Australian parliament in the late 1990s, I vehemently opposed the privatisation of the then Electricity Trust of South Australia (ETSA). Not only because it was a broken promise of the then Olsen government but because it was also a bad deal for consumers.


I believe the privatisation of ETSA was structured in such a way as to maximise value of the state's assets, thereby reducing a greater amount of state debt (a legacy of the former Labor State Government), but by doing so it shifted the burden onto households and businesses with dramatically higher power prices post-privatisation. I received very sound advice back in the late 1990s from Danny Price, then at London Economics, who is now Managing Director of Frontier Economics. He was vilified by the state Liberal government at the time for his modelling and predictions of power price rises with the privatisation model adopted, and sadly his predictions were uncannily accurate. I should add, the accuracy of his modelling and predictions has not changed over the years given his concerns over the carbon tax and the CPRS legislation introduced by the former government.


If all the privatisation is doing is shifting public debt onto households and businesses then it seems to be a foolish and counterproductive exercise. 


However, in the event that this bill does pass, I would like to see it passed with material improvements and for that reason I put on notice I support the amendments proposed by the opposition in this regard.


If taxpayer money is being used to encourage the privatisation of state assets, we have a duty to ensure the public—especially, families and small businesses—do not end up footing the bill by way of higher prices.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (13:28):  I thank all senators who have contributed to this debate, in particular, Senator Conroy, for his very constructive contribution. The Asset Recycling Fund Bill 2014 and consequential amendments establish a new fund as a vehicle for providing financial assistance and incentives to states and territories to invest in infrastructure. A new fund is necessary to support the government's asset recycling initiative, a key initiative, that will encourage the states and territories to sell existing assets and reinvest in new infrastructure that contributes to a more prosperous economy. 


Payments from the Asset Recycling Fund will also be used to fund nation-building infrastructure and other National Partnership agreements payments to other bodies will be administered by the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development and will support important local initiatives such as the Roads to Recovery program in the usual way. 


Establishing a new fund to support the government's infrastructure package is sound economic policy. It allows funds being committed now to be invested so that more is available when payments become due. Entrusting the Asset Recycling Fund to the Future Fund Board of Guardians will maximise the growth of assets. The board has a proven track record in managing assets on behalf of the taxpayer. It has grown the Future Fund from around $64 billion in 2006, when the previous government invested budget surpluses into the Future Fund, to over $97 billion by the end of March—in fact, at last count, it had exceeded $100 billion.


The government is committed to the new fund, which will be established with $5.9 billion funded by an amount of uncommitted funds from the Education Investment Fund and the Building Australia Fund that have not been allocated to approved projects. The government will make further contributions following the successful privatisation of Medibank Private; it has also said that it is open to committing proceeds from other future asset sales. Finally, the Asset Recycling Fund is an essential element of the government's infrastructure package announced in the 2014-15 budget to support economic growth. I recommend that it be supported by the Senate.


Question agreed to.

This government has been very clear in making sure that the Australian people know exactly why the changes to the budget took place. The changes to the budget took place because of the previous government's economic mismanagement. The budget mess that they left us meant that we had to make some tough decisions in the budget. It was under the previous finance minister that we saw net debt treble from $42 billion to $153 billion. Perhaps if the previous finance—



The PRESIDENT:  Pause the clock. Senator Moore, a point of order.




Senator Moore:
  Thank you, Mr President. My point of order, surprisingly, is on direct relevance. The specific question is about the cost of the additional $7 GP tax to pathology laboratories and the requirement to send additional $7 accounts to patients. I would ask you to draw that to the attention of the minister.



The PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Moore. The minister has just over one minute left to answer the question. I draw the minister's attention to the question.




Senator NASH:
  Thank you very much, Mr President. I answered it directly. I said I could not confirm it. We did not know what the processes would be; therefore, we would not know what the costs would be to the pathology labs. I was very clear. I was also very clear in stating to the chamber exactly why the budget contained tough decisions. It was because—

  Mr President, there were two parts to the question. The second part is about the additional $7 accounts being sent to patients. The minister has not addressed that part of the question at all.



The PRESIDENT:  The minister can address the question, and she has indicated in her previous response to a point of order that she did address the question. The minister can get to the second part of the question in her own time.




Senator NASH:
  Thank you, Mr President. And, indeed, I answered it. We will not be able to determine what costs will be passed on until we determine whether or not a co-payment will be charged. It is very clear. I was indicating to the chamber that if it had not been for things like, under the previous finance minister, spending $34 million buying water from Tandou Station, which was supplementary water that actually does not exist except in a flood—it was the previous government's mismanagement that led to a tough budget.

There has been a requirement for a co-payment—indeed, supported by the shadow Assistant Treasurer and initially supported by the previous leader of the Labor Party and previous Prime Minister Bob Hawke. So we have been very clear. We have made these decisions because it is this government that is going to ensure a sustainable health system.

Senator ABETZ:
  Let us just cut to the chase. Labor is in deficit and debt denial. They know there is a budget problem. Do you know why they know there is a budget problem? It is because they created it. When they came to office in 2007, the budget was $20 billion in surplus and Australia had $50,000 million in the bank. In just six years Labor destroyed that golden legacy. They did it by spending more than they earned, wasting billions on pink batts and overpriced school halls. The Labor Party seems to have no appreciation of how much $1 billion is. Let me put it this way: a million seconds is about 11 days; a billion seconds is more than 31 years. A billion is a very big number indeed. Labor left behind projected deficits of $123 billion and projected debts of $667 billion. Let me tell you, if you converted that into seconds, it would be more than 21,000 years. The Labor Party might laugh about this but it is no joke. Government debt means higher pressure on the cost of living. Government debt means fewer jobs. Government debt means less money for services that the Australian people need. Debt means every single Australian suffers and that is why we as a government are seeking to reverse the position to ensure that there is a secure and sustainable future for our fellow Australians.

Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:12):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Employment (Senator Abetz) to questions without notice asked by Senators Urquhart and Singh today relating to employment in Tasmania and to the Renewable Energy Target.


My question, I thought, was quite straightforward, but obviously the Minister for Employment was not able to answer it. The closure of the Henty mine was announced on 7 July, with the loss of 150 jobs, sometime around 2015. The immediate closure of Mount Lyell mine was announced on 9 July. The minister said that Mr Whiteley had done a lot more than say to the workers, 'Go to Centrelink'—and I would be very interested to know what that was. In a press release that Mr Whiteley put out on 9 July, he said he would expect that the Premier will request that challenges confronting the west coast be put on the agenda for the next Tasmanian Economic Council meeting, to be held in the next few weeks. So there did not seem to be a lot of urgency from the member for Braddon to get on and look at what help they could provide to the people on the west coast given the announcement of the closure of the mine.


My question was going to whether the government had thought about maintaining the local employment officer—that position will be axed from 30 July. In May, Central Coast Mayor Jan Bonde put out a press release and there was a story in TheAdvocate. Responding to a question about the position of the local employment officer, James McCormack, being axed, she said:


James, along with Sarah Jones from Enterprise Connect, has been a catalyst for change in the region. In my experience, they are the two best operators in terms of helping to transform our regional economies. He has been able to build relationships with all tiers of government and the key employers and industry groups.


I would have thought that that role would have been extremely helpful to people on the west coast of Tasmania Mayor Bonde went on to say:


Jobs Services agencies operate under a competitive model and it is impossible for councils to work collaboratively to help improved employment outcomes without someone likes James acting as the point of contact.


He has the ability and relationships to cut across the silos and other boundaries to help create a more co-ordinated approach to identifying and addressing challenges.


So the local mayor talks about how important someone in that role is. But Mr Whiteley does not think that that is important. Without somebody in the local area to help pull all that together it is a very difficult and tough time.


The regional coordinator put together a regional employment plan, and in that regional employment plan there are five goals. Within those five goals there are 19 strategies. The report, Regional Employment Plan: North West/Northern Tasmania Priority Employment Area, talks about things like supporting employment, workforce participation and skills development, including through maximising government investment; helping retrenched workers transition into new employment and/or training; facilitating employment and training opportunities for job seekers, including disadvantaged groups, with a focus on industries experiencing skills shortages; facilitating opportunities for employment in new, emerging and growth industries; and developing industry and community partnerships to increase participation in employment and training. I would have thought that those key areas contained in that priority employment area plan were all things with which the west coast could dearly use the assistance of someone like a regional employment coordinator. But, no, the government does not seem to think that it is important.


But I am heartened because, after a lot of calls, today, at around 9.30 am or 9.40 am, Mr Whiteley gave a speech in the other place in which he said:


At the request of the state government, I have committed to working closely with my good friend Adam Brooks MP, who is leading the group to an outcome that results in this region restored as the economic powerhouse of Tasmania as it once was.


So we had the announcement two weeks ago that the mines were closing and the member for Braddon has now got up and said that he is actually going to be part of that. (Time expired)

James McCormack, the local employment coordinator to whom she refers, did a great job for Tasmanians in that particular area. But there was something that Senator Urquhart forgot to tell the Senate. Chances are she did not forget and she deliberately withheld, but I am willing to give her the benefit of the doubt. Do you know how long Mr McCormack—who did all this wonderful work—was contracted for by the previous Labor government? It was until 30 June 2014. So the very last budget for which Labor senators, including Senator Urquhart, voted for would have seen the stopping of his contract as of 30 June 2014. We implemented the Labor Party's approach in this area. So please, Senator Urquhart and other Labor senators, do not come into this chamber crying crocodile tears when you had no intention in any way, shape or form of continuing that position, as you did not make any money available for it beyond 30 June 2014.



Senator Polley interjecting—




Senator ABETZ:
  I will take Senator Polley's interjection, 'Well, why don't you make more money available?' I indicate to Senator Polley and the Labor Party the financial difficulties we face today is courtesy of Labor mismanagement. As we speak, we are borrowing $1,000 million per month just to pay the interest bill on the existing borrowings. Today we heard in question after question from the Australian Labor Party that their answer to all the world's problems is 'just borrow more'. If you were to follow the Greens as well, you would borrow more from overseas so we could pay it overseas. That is why this nation is in the financial difficulties that she is in. It is the Labor-Green legacy. And we have now been given the task by the Australian people to repair the damage. Regrettably, when you waste your money on pink batts, school halls and cash splashes, the day comes when you have to repay that money with interest. As a result, good people like James McCormack, the local employment coordinator, cannot continue to be funded. But, please, do not blame us for that decision; it was a Labor decision—and when we looked for money, regrettably, there was none there because of Labor's legacy.


The member for Braddon, Mr Whiteley—who is doing a fantastic job for the people of Braddon—from the west coast and right through the north-west coast of my home state of Tasmania—saw the state government acting very  proactively with a task force to assist with what is a devastating blow to the west coast with the closure of two mines. Given that it was a state government task force, it is appropriate to make the appropriate inquiries to ascertain one's capacity to make a contribution to it. That is what Mr Whiteley has done, and Mr Whiteley is now going to make a positive contribution to that task force. That is the way sound, sensible government conducts itself.


If you listened to all the questions from the Labor Party today you would get the impression that the Labor way is 'see a problem, borrow money from overseas, throw a bucket of money over it and then walk away because you have somehow satisfied your moral obligation'. We say that that is the Labor way but it is not a responsible way. It is not the honourable way. The honourable way is to take a step back, take a deep breath and ask, 'How do you handle this situation the best for the long-term benefit of not only the west coast but also all the individuals impacted?' and then hear from those people what is needed and how we can assist—and that is exactly the approach that we as a government here in Canberra and the new Premier, Will Hodgman, are taking to this devastating situation in Tasmania.

Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (15:22):  What we have heard here in the response to Senator Urquhart's questions by Senator Abetz, a Tasmanian senator himself, is: 'Don't blame us when it comes to workers and their families losing their jobs on the west coast of Tasmania. Don't blame us. We're just the government. We can't do anything.' Senator Abetz wants to keep going back in time and holding onto this thing of 10 months ago when Labor was in power, trying to blame every single lack of government policymaking that they currently have on Labor. Well, this is the government that is in power and this is the government that can do something right now to support those workers on the west coast of Tasmania.


Senator Urquhart asked a very specific question of Senator Abetz. He failed to answer it. She asked specifically about the employment coordinator position that no longer exists on the west coast of Tasmania. We know that these positions do not exist in fact anywhere in the country—the whole 21 of them have gone—except for in the electorate of Corangamite, in Sarah Henderson's electorate. I have got a press release here from Sarah Henderson, which she only put out on 2 July—I think it was following her appearance on a Q&A program. Senator Abetz came to her rescue. In relation to the Alcoa workers, Senator Abetz decided to come up with the $500,000 to reinstate the employment coordinator for the Geelong region. It is all right for Geelong. It is good enough Geelong, but it is not good enough for his own state of Tasmania. He is turning his back on the workers in his own state. He gets up here in the Senate and tells those workers, tells the Tasmanian community, that it is not the government's problem, that they are not going to do anything about it. It was okay for Geelong, but it is not okay for the west coast of Tasmania.


In relation to the member for Braddon, Brett Whiteley, we know all about him. We know he is all about bluff and blunder. He is not about action. He has got the mouth. He goes out there spreading the words, but they are not followed up with any action. Having said that, Senator Urquhart has informed the Senate that, after two weeks, he is finally going to do something and get involved with the working group, unlike what he has said in the past, which was: 'You're losing your job. Go to Centrelink. Don't come to me. I'm just the local member. I'm just the government. I can't help you.' That is what we get to hear from Senator Abetz and from Mr Whiteley.


We know very well the importance of Enterprise Connect. We know very well how important that coordinator position was in Tasmania and the work that was done by the former employment coordinator, James McCormack. That is why we are calling on the government to provide, right now, a regional employment coordinator for the west coast and the north-west coast of Tasmania, just as Geelong has been provided with, just as Sarah Henderson informed us, in her press release of 2 July, that she was provided with for her electorate of Corangamite. She knows the importance of the regional employment coordinator in the face of Alcoa workers losing their jobs. She says:


The funding will ensure there is a person on the ground in the Geelong region who can look at opportunities across our region to promote employment growth and better link job seekers and employers.


She knows very well that this job seeker initiative was a good policy that Labor started. That is why she urged Senator Abetz come forward with the $500,000. The only regional employment coordinator in the country is in the electorate of Corangamite. The rest of the country? Too bad. In Tasmania, Senator Abetz's own state, he says, 'Too bad.' Here are workers and their families whose livelihoods are on the line. They have been living on half-pay now for some time. They know that their future is bleak in that regional part of the state. There need to be those opportunities provided to them through the support of an employment coordinator. That is why Senator Urquhart and I, followed by the other Tasmanian Labor senators, are urging Senator Abetz to stand up for Tasmanians for once and actually come forward with this very small amount of money that will make such a difference to their lives.

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture) (15:27):  Mr Deputy President, congratulations on your ascension to the role. I have not had the opportunity to formally congratulate you before.


The circumstances on the west coast of Tasmania are indeed unfortunate. It is a very difficult time for people on the west coast of Tasmania. If Labor members and senators think that the only thing that can be offered to that community is a local or regional employment coordinator, if that is all they are asking for, it shows how shallow their approach to this very, very difficult circumstance is.


I might reflect on some other difficulties that have occurred in my region over the last few years. It is good that Senator Carr is in the chamber, because he was part of the process under which we lost two paper mills and a carpet factory. What was the Labor government's response to that? The Labor government's response to the circumstance where the paper industry decided they were going to review—



Senator Polley interjecting—




Senator COLBECK:
  Just wait and see what the response was, Senator Polley. The Labor Party's response was to call a meeting of interested parties.




Senator Kim Carr:
  Rubbish! Complete rubbish!




Senator COLBECK:
  Let me finish, Senator. Not only did they call a meeting; Senator Carr would not even come to Tasmania. He called the locals to go to him in Victoria. They had to travel to Victoria to meet with him. He did not have time to come to Tasmania. Then he put into place a committee to consider the future of the pulp and paper industry, alongside the decision-making process of the company. And guess what?


The committee he put into place did not report until after months and months, after the company had made the  decision to close. He said at the outset that this committee would consider the industry in conjunction with the company itself, so that the company could be informed by the process of the committee, but the committee did not report until well and truly later.


We are consulting with the community. The member for Braddon has already spoken to the Prime Minister in the Prime Minister's office. He has also spoken to the office of the Minister for Industry—who will be in Tasmania next week. With the former minister, they had to go to him.




Senator Kim Carr:
  Where's the money?




Senator COLBECK:
  As Senator Carr says, just throw a bucket of money at it and it will all go away. We are talking to the community. Interestingly, in Victoria, where the decisions have been known for some time, the community has had a chance to develop a plan. That process is only just starting in Tasmania. The Tasmanian Premier acted very quickly. He was quickly in Queenstown and quickly set up a task force to work with community members. The Labor Party think they can just impose themselves on the community. That is what they did with the carbon tax and that is one of the reasons industry in Tasmania has been doing it so tough. Simplot, for example, is a business which will be saved $4 million a year by today's action in this chamber. The previous government offered them money. They threw money at them. We can save them more money in four years than the previous government offered them just by throwing money at the problem. That is their only answer. They think throwing some money at the problem will sort it all out.


We are making regulatory reform which will reduce the cost to industry and business and allow them to flourish. It will give them the opportunity to grow. It is a very, very unfortunate circumstance on the west coast of Tasmania and we all feel very much for the people. The  Labor Party are playing base politics with this issue, in stark contrast to what we did when Caterpillar workers were being put off, when we worked alongside the then local member for Braddon, Mr Sid Sidebottom. We did not criticise the government because there were difficult decisions being made in the industry; yet, as soon as the tables are turned, the Labor Party return to base politics. They are not prepared to listen to what the community want. They just want to play dirty base politics with a very unfortunate circumstance. They are not interested in listening to the local community and are not prepared to chip in and play a sensible and responsible part in what is a very difficult situation. (Time expired)

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2014-07-17,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (15:32):  It is extraordinary when an issue is affecting our home state of Tasmania that we have the so-called 'power senators' from Tasmania, who have all the senior positions in this government but they cannot get up to defend their decision to stand by and do nothing. They do absolutely nothing. To have people in this chamber today blaming the mining resource tax or the carbon tax for the closure of those mines is absolutely outrageous. When it comes to what Senator Colbeck has just said in relation to Labor's view of saving jobs, that it is about throwing money at it, that is unbelievable. We want an immediate injection of funds into that community and we want a long-term strategy to ensure that we can invest in the future and can invest in jobs.


Today in the House of Representatives we have Mr Brett Whiteley as the member for Braddon. We also have what are known as—they gave themselves the name—'the Three Amigos'. We have been waiting for the Three Amigos to ride into town in Tasmania and they have never arrived. What they should really be known as is 'the Three Stooges'. The problem is, they are not funny. The situation on the west coast is not funny. On this side we have seen the action of Senator Urquhart and the shadow minister Julie Collins going on the front foot with this issue. Our representatives have been there talking to the community. We have been in contact with the unions. 


I have regular contact with the Australian Workers Union, who are down there at the coal face listening to those workers. They have had to survive. They are not living on six months of half pay; they are trying to survive. We know and I would have expected that those opposite as Tasmanians would know their community and know how hard it is there in terms of unemployment. We have—




Senator Colbeck:
  So what did you do for the pulp mill workers and the carpet mill workers?




Senator POLLEY:
  We were there and investing in Tasmania.




Senator Colbeck:
  They've gone.




Senator POLLEY:
  They have gone. You had the opportunity, Senator Colbeck—through  you, Mr Deputy President. Show us the way. Why are you not doing something? Why are you prepared, because one of your members goes on Q&A, to throw money into Geelong and have a coordinator there? Why is it that one of your members has to go on Q&A? I very much doubt that that is the way the Tasmanian community are going to have any respect for this government because we are not interested in invasion, which has been demonstrated here today. We are not interested in posturing, we are not interested in vague media releases where the local member says to the people who have lost their jobs, 'Go and see Centrelink,' when they know full well that they would not be entitled to the sort of support that they need now.


When we debate this, we have inaction from those opposite, but we want action. We want action now for an immediate intervention to help these people and then we need a long-term plan and strategy to assist that community. We do not want Queenstown to become a ghost. Those on the opposite side come into this chamber every week talking about small businesses. What are you doing to ensure those businesses in that region are able to succeed? What are you going to do to assist families trying to pay their mortgage? Today after questions in relation to the GST, Senator Abetz said, 'No, it is not government policy to support an increase in GST to 15 per cent,' but he did not say anything about not broadening that tax.


We have seen from this government through their budget that they are callous and heartless, and the Tasmanian Liberal senators and the Liberal members of the House of Representatives have proven once again that they are out of touch. They don't listen, and Senator Colbeck says, 'We go down there and we talk to the people.' That is right: you only do the talking. You never listen to the community. You never listen to the experts and you have not even been there.




Senator Colbeck:
  Tell us what they want!




Senator POLLEY:
  You should be there. They want action. They want some leadership. They want some vision, but we know that this government is incapable of showing leadership. We know they are incapable of having any vision and we know they are incapable of having a strategy and supporting the Tasmanian community. (Time expired)

Senator BUSHBY
 (Tasmania—Government Whip in the Senate) (15:43):  I present the government’s response to the 130th report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties and seek leave to incorporate the document in Hansard. 


Leave granted.




The document read as follows—



Australian Government response to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties' report: Report 130




Malaysia
—
Australia Free Trade Agreement done at Kuala Lumpur on 22 May 2012



June 2014




Recommendation 1: That prior to commencing negotiations for a new agreement, the Government table in Parliament a document setting out its priorities and objectives including independent analysis of the anticipated costs and benefits of the agreement. Such analysis should be reflected in the National Interest Analysis accompanying the treaty text.



The Government does not accept this recommendation.


The powers to negotiate and enter into treaties are executive powers within section 61 of the Australian Constitution. Accordingly, formal responsibility for treaty making and negotiation lies with the Executive. The Government nevertheless considers that the Parliament has a significant role in scrutinising treaties prior to binding treaty action being taken and in passing legislation to give effect to them where necessary. The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties (JSCOT) plays an important part in fulfilling Parliament's role in this respect. The Government remains of the view that its capacity to effectively pursue the national interest while allowing for appropriate public consultation is best met by current parliamentary and consultation processes.


The Government currently provides information about treaties under consideration or negotiation in a variety of ways. The nature and extent of public consultation is determined by the scope and importance of the proposed treaty and can include statements to the Parliament, press releases, information published on agency websites, calls for public submissions and face-to-face consultations with industry and civil society representatives. The purpose of such consultations is to inform the public about the Government's priorities and objectives and to afford an opportunity for comment. In addition, regular consultations are conducted with the States and Territories through the Standing Committee on Treaties.


Notwithstanding its commitment to stakeholder consultation, the Government is constrained in what it can disclose about prospective and ongoing treaty negotiations. Making detailed information about Australia's negotiating position publicly available prior to the commencement of negotiations would limit Australia's room for manoeuvre in the negotiations. Adopting the Committee's recommendation could circumscribe the capacity of Australia's negotiators to secure the best possible outcomes for Australia in the treaty negotiations.


Any statement of negotiating priorities and objectives made at the outset of treaty negotiations would be of limited value in assessing the eventual treaty outcomes. Negotiating priorities commonly develop over the course of negotiations, and eventual treaty outcomes reflect compromises acceptable to all Parties. While negotiators operate within defined parameters, it is generally not possible to predict accurately the full range of commitments which will be incorporated into the final agreement until negotiations are concluded. Similarly, any advance assessment of costs and benefits would necessarily be based on a range of assumptions which may or may not prove correct. The Government considers the current practice of tabling treaties after they are concluded enables the Parliament to make a more meaningful assessment of their impact on the national interest, based on the actual rights and obligations they contain.


Treaties do not become legally binding on Australia until the Government formally undertakes to perform the obligations set out in the treaty by taking binding treaty action (ratification, acceptance, approval or other formal mechanism provided for in the treaty). Until binding treaty action is taken, Australia is only obliged to refrain from acts which would defeat the object and purpose of the treaty1. Other than in exceptional circumstances, the Government does not take binding treaty action, or introduce legislation to give legal effect to treaty provisions in Australia, until after JSCOT has reviewed and reported on the treaty and its advice has been taken into account. Existing treaty tabling arrangements therefore afford ample opportunity for the Parliament to express its views on treaties well before a final decision is made on whether they become binding on Australia.


The Government notes Recommendation 1 does not state what would constitute 'independent analysis' of the anticipated costs and benefits of the agreement. If it is intended that the Government commission econometric or other modelling on proposed treaty negotiations prior to their commencement, this could delay the start of negotiations and further impinge on the Government's negotiating flexibility. The Government further notes the recommendation does not make any allowance for urgent or sensitive treaties. Finally, adding another step to the treaty process would have resource implications for the responsible agencies, which the Government does not consider to be justified.




Recommendation 2: That after 24 months of the treaty coming into effect, an independent review of MAFTA be conducted to assess actual outcomes of the treaty against the claimed benefits and potential negative consequences noted in this report. The review should consider the economic, regional, social, cultural, regulatory, labour and environmental impacts. Such a review should serve as a model for future free trade agreements.



A period of 24 months after the entry into force of MAFTA is brief in the context of the implementation of such a treaty. Any conclusions drawn from such a review would necessarily be limited in terms of the overall assessment envisaged by this recommendation. A longer period following MAFTA's entry into force would allow for a more insightful review of the agreement. It would also be important for any review to take into account the fact that MAFTA was concluded in the context of the Agreement Establishing the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Area (AANZFTA), and that MAFTA complements and builds on the commitments applying to trade and investment between Australia and Malaysia in AANZFTA.


In addition, the Government considers that it is important that a review of the type proposed in the recommendation is used to provide input into the general review of the Agreement mandated by MAFTA within five years of entry into force and at least every five years thereafter unless otherwise agreed by the parties (Chapter 21—Final Provisions). This general review provides an avenue to identify and address any problems experienced by business in taking advantage of the Agreement and to seek to enhance MAFTA's contribution to increased economic integration of our two economies.


The Government will, therefore, undertake a review through the general review process provided for in the Agreement. The first general review of MAFTA will provide a basis for an initial assessment of the Agreement's implementation, which could be followed up at the subsequent five‑yearly reviews. The Government will seek the views and input of stakeholders independent of the Government ahead of those reviews on the extent to which MAFTA is delivering expected outcomes, and seek input on areas where the Agreement's provisions could be enhanced. The nature of the review undertaken at each of these periods will be subject to discussion with Malaysia.


In addition to the general review, MAFTA contains other review mechanisms. For instance, MAFTA incorporates a requirement to establish an FTA Joint Commission. The FTA Joint Commission will meet annually, or as otherwise determined by the Parties, to review implementation and operation of MAFTA and, inter alia, to explore measures to improve MAFTA and to expand trade and investment between the two parties (Chapter 19—Institutional Provisions). Certain chapters in the Agreement also contain their own specific review provisions. For example, the Rules of Origin Chapter provides for review of the provisions of that Chapter within three years of the entry into force of the Agreement. The Services Chapter provides for a review of commitments on trade in services to be undertaken within three years of entry into force and thereafter every five years.


Additional review provisions are contained in side letters to the Agreement that provide for reviews on the inclusion of labour and environment provisions and on customs duties and other charges applied to certain alcoholic beverages no later than two years after the entry into force of the Agreement.




Recommendation 3: The Committee supports the Malaysia-Australia Free Trade Agreement done at Kuala Lumpur on 22 May 2012 and recommends that binding treaty action be taken.



This recommendation was implemented by the former Government and MAFTA entered into force on 1 January 2013.

The speeches read as follows—



CORPORATIONS AMENDMENTS (SIMPLE CORPORATE BONDS AND OTHER MEASURES) 2013


The establishment of a deep and liquid retail corporate bond market in Australia is a key priority for the Gillard Government. A well performing and efficient retail corporate bond market will provide an alternative funding source for Australian companies and increase competitive pressure on lending rates to businesses.


The bond market is a significant source of funds for many Australian financial and non-financial corporations. Correspondingly, this financing activity provides investment opportunities for both Australians and non-residents. 


The Johnson Report, Australia as a Financial Centre: building on our strengths, examined the lack of liquidity and diversity in Australia's corporate bond market. It also discussed why this lack of liquidity was a significant weakness in the overall assessment of Australia's financial system. At the retail level, it was considered that one action the Government could take to overcome this weakness was to introduce regulatory changes that could assist with developing the market. 


The Bill that is before the House today seeks to reduce the regulatory burden on issuers of corporate bonds, while at the same time ensuring that appropriate standards of consumer protection are maintained.


The introduction of Schedule 1 of the Bill follows the passage of the Government's legislation to facilitate retail trading in Commonwealth Securities (CGS) late last year. Having an active retail CGS is an important step in establishing a wider retail corporate bonds market by providing a visible pricing benchmark for retail investors in corporate bonds. 


Schedule 1 to the Bill, delivers on the Government's commitment to reduce regulatory burdens and barriers for offers of corporate bonds to retail investors.


The measures in Schedule 1 enable companies to offer simple corporate bonds by releasing a shorter offer-specific prospectus as long as they have lodged a base prospectus with ASIC for the purpose of making an offer under the new 2-part simple corporate bond prospectus regime. 


Schedule 1 of the Bill removes the civil liability that applies to directors and proposed directors for the offer of simple corporate bonds and provides clarification around the due diligence defence in respect to directors' criminal liability in offering corporate bonds. 


Schedule 1 to the Bill also contains amendments to the Corporations Act to enable parallel trading of simple corporate bonds in the wholesale and retail markets. 


The measures in Schedule 1 are another major initiative that the Government has delivered on in its long term commitment to encourage the development of a deep and liquid bond market in Australia. The measures provide companies with another source of fundraising and signal that it is their time to contribute to the development of Australia's corporate bond market.


The other measures in the Bill, contained in Schedule 2, amend the Corporations Act 2001 to define in the law terms 'financial planner' and 'financial adviser'. These amendments make it an offence for anyone to call themselves a financial planner or financial adviser, unless they are appropriately authorised under the Australian financial services licensing regime.


The amendments contained in Schedule 2 follow the passage of the Future of Financial Advice (FOFA) legislation last year. Key elements of the FOFA reforms include the imposition of a statutory best interests duty on financial advisers, two-yearly opt-in arrangements and annual fee disclosure statements, and a ban on the receipt of conflicted remuneration arrangements, including commissions. 


The Government is committed to increasing investor protection and improving consumer confidence in the financial advice industry. This will provide the financial advice industry with a strong foundation for growth, as well as empowering Australians to obtain good quality advice about managing their wealth. The Government has delivered on its commitment through the FOFA reforms, and continues to deliver on its commitment with the Bill before the House today. 


On 22 March 2012, I announced to Parliament that the Government intended to introduce legislation enshrining the terms 'financial adviser' and 'financial planner' in law by 1 July 2013. These amendments deliver on my earlier commitment. Schedule 2 to the Bill will commence on 1 July 2013 (or after the Royal Assent, if that occurs later), concurrently with the FOFA reforms.


By legislatively defining the terms 'financial planner' and 'financial adviser', the amendments enable consumers to be able to easily identify genuine financial product advice providers. By preventing anyone who is not a qualified financial planner or financial adviser from telling consumers that they are, the amendments make it easier for consumers to know who to trust with their financial affairs. The measures contained in Schedule 2 of the Bill strengthen protections for consumers. 


Importantly, the amendments will help protect consumers from unlicensed persons such as 'property spruikers' who hold themselves out to be genuine providers of financial advice when they are not. 


The amendments will ensure that the regulation of financial advisers and planners is consistent with other professions such as stockbrokers, where similar restrictions already exist.


Schedule 2 to the Bill makes it an offence for a person to hold themselves out to be a financial planner or a financial adviser unless they are authorised to provide financial product advice under the Australian financial services licence (AFSL) regime. Schedule 2 also makes it an offence to use terms of similar importance, so that unlicensed persons will not be able to get around the legislation by using similar terms.


Schedule 2 also allows the Government to make regulations prescribing other terms that a person must have an AFSL to use. This means that if individuals or companies start using particular terms to mislead consumers, the Government will be able to respond quickly by restricting the use of these terms.


People acting in breach of these requirements face penalties of up to 10 penalty units for individuals for every day the contravention occurs, and 50 penalty units per day for corporations. 


I note that the measures in Schedule 2 have been developed in consultation with the financial services industry. Key industry bodies are supportive of the amendments. For example, the Financial Planning Association of Australia is of the view that the amendments ""will provide greater consumer certainty and protection and further enable the transition of financial planning into a universally respected profession"". The Association of Financial Advisers has said that they believe that this legislation ""is good for financial advisers and also for the consumers who rely on financial advice"", because ""consumers deserve to have clarity with respect to who they are seeking advice from"".


I note that there are separate, though related, amendments that are being made to the Tax Agent Services Act 2009.


In summary, the amendments contained in Schedule 2 will improve consumer trust and confidence in the financial advice industry. Australian consumers are entitled to be able to easily distinguish between genuine, authorised providers of financial product advice and unlicensed persons such as 'property spruikers' who do not have their clients' best interests at heart. The measures contained in Schedule 2 of the Bill empower consumers to make that distinction.


I commend the Bill to the Senate.


FAIR WORK (REGISTERED ORGANISATIONS) AMENDMENT BILL 2014


The Government remains staunchly committed to improving protections for members of registered organisations by implementing the comprehensive plan to enhance the governance and accountability of registered organisations. To be very clear, this Bill enacts a Coalition policy that was first released in April 2012—more than two years ago.


This is why we are reintroducing the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill that was voted down by Labor Party and the Greens in the Senate a month ago. By voting against the legislation, they have demonstrated a refusal to support greater accountability and transparency for registered organisations. They have voted against improved protection for union members and have thereby given the green light to more exploitation of honest union members by dishonest union officials. They have also voted against a clearer and simpler reporting framework that would assist both unions and employer associations to comply with the framework.


The absolute need for this legislation almost goes without saying—the rorts, the rackets and the rip-offs have been in the media on an almost daily basis and the wider community is strongly in favour of these reforms.


Until this Parliament acts, Australia won't have a sufficiently robust system to ensure that the sort of corruption that was revealed during the numerous scandals can be uncovered and eradicated before it becomes systemic as it did in the infamous HSU case. It is simply no longer tenable to argue that the present system is adequate to deal with or discourage this kind of behaviour.


Unions and employer associations play a critical role in the workplace relations system and the economy more broadly, and their members invest a great deal of trust in them. The community expectation is that these registered organisations will operate to the highest of standards. These organisations are given special legislated rights. With rights come responsibilities.


The government believes that the majority of registered organisations do the right thing and in many cases maintain higher standards than those that are currently required. However, the investigations into the Health Services Union and the allegations that are coming to light through the Royal Commission illustrate that, unfortunately, financial impropriety can and does occur under the current governance regime and indeed that there is a rotten underbelly in some of these organisations. Let's be clear—loopholes have been identified and they need to be closed.


The Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill will provide the certainty and high standards of operation that members of registered organisations and the broader community rightfully expect.


The Bill introduces a suite of legislative measures designed to see governance of registered organisations lifted to a consistently high standard across the board. A more robust compliance regime will deter wrongdoing and promote first-class governance of registered organisations.


Members of unions and the community not only want a strong regulatory regime but also want swift action taken when standards are breached. In order to do this, it is necessary to have a robust regulator in place with appropriate powers and resources, together with meaningful sanctions that can be applied when wrongdoing is revealed.


To improve oversight of registered organisations, the Bill will establish the Registered Organisations Commission, a dedicated independent watchdog with enhanced investigation and information-gathering powers to monitor and regulate registered organisations. The new commission will have the necessary independence and the powers it needs to regulate registered organisations effectively, efficiently and transparently.


The Commission will have stronger investigation and information-gathering powers than those that currently apply. These will be modelled on those available to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. The Commission will have the power to commence legal proceedings and refer possible criminal offences to the Director of Public Prosecutions or law enforcement agencies.


The Commission will also educate, assist and advise registered organisations and their members in relation


to the new obligations and ensure members are aware of their rights.


The Commission will be established within the Office of the Fair Work Ombudsman. While located within this Office, the Commissioner will have independence in the exercise of the relevant functions and powers under the law, and the authority to direct staff in relation to the performance of those functions. A special financial account will also be established for the Commission to ensure financial independence, and the Commissioner will have responsibility for day-to-day management of the account. The special account cannot be used, as has been suggested by some parties, to raise revenue through collection of monies related to penalties applied to registered organisations and their officers.


The Commission will be required to report to the Minister for Employment annually on its activities, and that report will be tabled in Parliament. The Commissioner will appear at Senate estimates. The activities of the Commission will also be subject to the same oversight by the Commonwealth Ombudsman as Commonwealth agencies. This will ensure the appropriate level of transparency and public accountability.


The bill also provides for information sharing between the Fair Work Commission and the Registered


Organisations Commission to the extent that is required for both organisations to do their job effectively and efficiently. This is required, as several administrative tasks relating to registered organisations will continue to be the responsibility of the General Manager of the Fair Work Commission.


Transitional arrangements have been included in the Bill to ensure any ongoing matters being dealt with by the Fair Work Commission relating to registered organisations can be transferred to the Registered Organisations Commission.


This Bill will also strengthen existing financial transparency obligations for registered organisations and officers. It is entirely appropriate to expect a high standard of financial reporting from our registered organisations, given the trust members place in their unions and employer associations to operate honestly and to use the funds derived from their membership fees to represent their interests rather than for ulterior purposes. Registered organisations have substantial economic, legal and political influence. It is clearly inconsistent with community expectations for such organisations to operate to lower standards than those that apply to corporations or other comparable bodies.


Mr Thomson, Mr Williamson and the unfolding allegations arising out of the Royal Commission have shown us that the existing regulation does not sufficiently protect members' interests. Unfortunately, there will always be less scrupulous individuals who will seek to take advantage of their positions when standards of accountability and the risk of getting caught are too low. In the face of this kind of behaviour, a strong message needs to be sent to discourage wrongdoing by officers and to rebuild the confidence of members and the community. These measures, however, will have little impact if the penalties for wrongdoing are not high enough to act as a deterrent.


Currently, registered organisations and officers do not face the same consequences as companies and directors for wrongdoing. That is why the government is introducing higher civil penalties and a range of criminal penalties for organisations and officials who are found by courts of law to have done the wrong thing. These penalties are consistent with those faced by companies and directors who break the law. In relation to civil penalty breaches, the maximum penalty for serious contraventions will be $204,000 for an individual or $1,020,000 for a body corporate. This will apply to serious contraventions. What will constitute a serious contravention is defined in the Bill. Other breaches will face a maximum civil penalty of $17,000 for an individual or $85,000 for a body corporate. By way of comparison, the current maximum penalties for even the worst misbehaviour are only $10,200 for individuals.


Let me be very clear, it is the Government's expectation that the highest of penalties will be rarely be handed out but it is important that the Courts have the ability to hand down strong penalties should the crime deserve it. We know that the Courts have had an issue with the current framework with Federal Court Judge Anthony North making almost unprecedented comments last year, saying:




""
The penalties [under the current Act] are rather beneficially low…beneficial to wrongdoers.
""



This Bill will also give the Federal Court the power to disqualify an officer from holding office where a civil penalty provision has been contravened and the court is satisfied that disqualification is justified.


Criminal penalties are being introduced for serious breaches of officers' duties as well as offences in relation to the conduct of investigations under the Registered Organisations Act. The maximum penalties in these areas are $340,000 or five years imprisonment or both and again will be handed down by a court which will use its discretion.


Broadly, these offences relate to officers and employees of registered organisations who fail to exercise their powers or discharge duties in good faith and for a proper purpose. They also apply where an officer uses their position to gain advantage for themselves or someone else or uses information gained while an officer or employee to gain an advantage for themselves or someone else.


Some registered organisations have indicated concern that the new penalties will mean that they will have difficulty persuading people to take on official responsibilities. The government does not agree. The only people who have anything to fear are those who do the wrong thing. Officers who are operating within the law, which is the overwhelming majority of them, will have no reason to fear taking on official responsibilities. The overwhelming number of officers who are already doing the right thing should be comforted in knowing that the unlawful behaviour will be dealt with, thus ensuring ongoing member confidence in registered organisations as a whole. There should be no difference between the penalties levied against a company director who misuses shareholders' funds and a registered organisations boss who misuses members' money.


I recognise the broad community consensus for the government's amendments, including from one of Australia's most prominent union bosses, Mr Paul Howes, the outgoing head of the Australian Workers Union, who told the ABC on 26 November 2012:




I actually believe there is a higher responsibility for us as guardians of workers
'
 money to protect that money and to act diligently and honestly. The reality is I do not have any issue with increasing the level of requirements and penalties on trade unions for breaching basic ethics like misappropriation of funds.



Anyone in this place who has regard for the best interests of members of registered organisations and the protection of their hard-earned contributions will support this Bill. The refusal of the Labor Party and Greens to support the Bill as introduced in November 2013 is delaying the government's attempts to protect honest union members.


The government believes the Bill sets an appropriately high standard for the governance and regulation of registered organisations. It responds to the legitimate concerns of members of registered organisations and the community as a result of the shocking behaviour of certain Health Services Union officials and allegations arising out of the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption. Only those officers who do the wrong thing have anything to lose from these changes. Members of registered organisations and the community have everything to gain.


METEOROLOGY AMENDMENT (ONLINE ADVERTISING) BILL 2014


The Meteorology Amendment (Online Advertising) Bill 2014 (the Bill) amends the Meteorology Act 1955 (Cth) to provide certainty in relation to the Director of Meteorology's powers to include advertising in connection with the Bureau of Meteorology's services and determine the types of advertising that the Bureau displays.


The Bureau of Meteorology is relied upon everyday by the Australian community to deliver accurate and timely information, particularly during events where life and property are at risk. The introduction of online advertising followed the 2011 Munro Review of the Bureau's capacity to respond to future extreme weather and natural disaster events and to provide seasonal forecasting services. The Review recommended that options be explored to obtain revenue from advertising on the Bureau's highly popular website.


Advertising on the Bureau's website was trialled for 12-months in 2012-13, and became a permanent measure from 1 July 2013, after being announced in the 2013-14 Budget.


This amendment to the Meteorology Act will remove any doubt to make it explicitly clear that the Bureau of Meteorology can accept paid advertising, allowing the Bureau to further diversify its sources of funding.


It will also require the Director of Meteorology to develop and publish guidelines on the types of advertising that the Bureau will display. This will allow the Director to prohibit advertising that is considered to not be in the Commonwealth's or the Bureau's interests. It is expected that the Director's guidelines will be based on the Bureau's existing Online Advertising Policy, which was developed and published during the advertising trial and is founded on existing industry advertising laws, regulations and codes of conduct.


NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS) BILL 2014


The National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Bill 2014 implements the decision announced in the 2014-15 Budget to increase patient co payments and safety net thresholds for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) and the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (RPBS).


It is another example of this Government protecting the best interests of Australians and making the decisions necessary to improve Australia's budget position into the future.


The PBS and RPBS are key components of our health services and are a major investment in the health of Australians. In the ten years to 2012 13, the cost of the PBS has increased by 80 per cent. At a current cost of around $9 billion per year, and with annual growth over the longer term expected to be between four and five per cent, these Schemes won't be sustainable without responsible management.




Why the changes are need
ed—PBS costs and new listings



Australia's health system is demand driven. The pressure to provide access to more services, more medicines and more expensive technologies is always increasing.


There is a continual pipeline of complex and expensive new medicines delivering more targeted and more personalised treatments. Since coming to Government, the Coalition has listed or expanded the listings of 181 medicines on the PBS. Medicines are being listed twice as fast as under the former Labor government. 


The additional cost of advances in treatment, together with the ongoing cost of medicines for chronic conditions, means expenditure for our health system is growing faster than Government and tax-payers can sustain.


If the PBS is to grow in a sustainable way, we need a whole-of-community approach and we all need to contribute—something successive governments have recognised since co-payments for the PBS were first introduced in 1960.


Earlier this year, this Government approved new listings for medicines with an expected cost to the PBS of $436 million. These listings include treatments for breast cancer, melanoma and multiple sclerosis, some of which cost tens of thousands of dollars per patient.


At its March 2014 meeting, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) recommended a further $550 million in new listings. In July this year, the PBAC will consider applications for new PBS listings worth up to a further $3.6 billion. Funding for new listings is not factored into the forward estimates. It is new money that this Government must find every four months to provide access to those medicines, something we have committed to do.


But we cannot do that and contain spending without more help, a greater contribution from all Australians who benefit from the PBS.


The changes proposed in the Bill are expected to contribute savings to the Government for the PBS and RPBS of around $1.3 billion over four years. They will provide a check on the rate of growth in PBS expenditure. They do not cut funding for the PBS.


We still expect that the PBS will grow, but more sustainably, from $9.2 billion in 2013 14 to $10.2 billion in 2017 18.




Changes to
 co-payments—general patients



Under the changes commencing 1 January 2015, there will be a one-off increase in patient co payment amounts for pharmaceutical benefits prescriptions. This increase will apply in addition to the usual annual Consumer Price Index (CPI) adjustment which occurs on 1 January each year.


The co-payment for general patients, which is currently $36.90, will increase by $5 in addition to CPI. On average, general patients use two PBS-subsidised prescriptions per year. So, for an average user, the additional cost from 2015 would be $10 per year.




Under co-paymen
t general patient prescriptions



The increase in the general co payment will not affect the cost to consumers for many commonly used medicines. Because the co payment amount is the maximum that a person needs to pay under the PBS, when the price of a prescription is less than the co payment, the consumer pays the lesser amount.


Medicines priced at less than the general co-payment already account for more than 40 per cent of PBS listings, and over 70 per cent of general patient PBS prescriptions. By the time the co-payment changes come into effect, more than 55 per cent of listings are expected to be below the general co payment amount. These listings include medicines used to treat high blood pressure, high cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, gastric ulceration, and skin conditions. As competition in the market continues to bring prices down, those reductions are reflected in the prices paid by consumers, as well as by Government.




Changes to co-payments—
concessional



For individuals and families who access pharmaceutical benefits at the concessional level, including veterans and their dependents under the RPBS, the co payment, which is currently $6, will increase by 80 cents in addition to CPI.


People with concessional benefits use, on average, 17 prescriptions each year. So under these new arrangements, they will pay an extra $13.60 per year for their subsidised medicines. 


The Government is asking concessional patients to contribute an extra 80 cents for prescriptions which cost on average $43.50. It will also be only an extra 80 cents for medicines such as the cancer treatments, everolimus and dabrafenib, that cost over $5,500, and $8,700 per prescription respectively. 




PBS and RPBS safety nets



Along with the co payment changes, there will be parallel changes in PBS safety nets. 


Safety net arrangements help to protect people who require a lot of medicines from high out-of-pocket costs. For all users of the PBS and RPBS, once the safety net threshold is reached, the co payment amount is reduced for prescriptions required for the rest of the calendar year. For general patients, the co-payment reduces to the concessional amount, and for concessional patients, the co payment is reduced to zero.




Changes to safety nets—
general



Under the proposed changes, the general safety net, which is currently $1,421.20, will increase by ten per cent of the safety net plus annual CPI indexation, on 1 January each year from 2015 until 2018. From 1 January 2019, only annual CPI indexation will apply.


General patients who are high medicine users will pay around $145.30 more in 2015 before reaching the new safety net threshold—and thereafter will only pay the concessional co-payment to access subsidised medicines for the remainder of the calendar year. 




Changes to safety nets—
concessional



The concessional safety net, which is currently equivalent to co payments for 60 prescriptions ($360), will increase by two prescriptions on 1 January each year from 2015 to 2018. The resulting concessional safety net thresholds will be 62 prescriptions in 2015; 64 in 2016; 66 in 2017; and 68 in 2018.


Concessional patients who are high medicine users will pay around $61.80 more in 2015 before reaching the new safety net threshold—and thereafter will receive all their PBS and RPBS subsidised medicines for free for the remainder of the calendar year. 




Operation of safety nets—
and family example



Importantly, the same general or concessional safety net applies to individuals, couples and families. The safety net can be tallied separately for an individual or combined where the cost of medicines for couples or family members needs to be met from the same household budget.


For example, in 2015, a low income family of two adults and two children, who hold a concession card and obtain 72 prescriptions per year between them, will pay $61.80 more than in 2014 before they reach the safety net threshold. But once they reach the safety net, they will get the rest of their PBS prescriptions for that calendar year for free—that's 10 scripts for free—whether it be the $43.50 medicine or the $5,500 medicine or the $8,700 medicine, it will be provided to them at no cost. 




Changes to concessional co
ntributions for Closing the Gap



The changes in the Bill will also apply for patient contributions charged at the concessional rate for the Closing the Gap PBS Co payment Measure. Under the Closing the Gap arrangements, eligible Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander consumers who would otherwise pay the general co-payment for PBS prescriptions, pay at the concessional rate. Eligible concessional patients receive their PBS medicines for free.




Patient contributions as one elem
ent of effective PBS management



The Government has inherited an enormous debt from the former Labor Government and is determined to ensure that health services are sustainable, are used efficiently, and are available for future generations.


The PBS model requires that medicines undergo evidence-based assessment of clinical and cost effectiveness, be listed only on the recommendation of our expert advisory committee, and be subject to comparative and competitive pricing.


Good management of the Scheme also relies on the innovative products supplied by a strong medicines industry, and the quality care provided by Australia's wide network of community pharmacies.


And since 1960, successive governments have continued to recognise that patient contributions are part of responsible management of the PBS. Indeed it was a Labor Government that introduced a $2.50 patient contribution for pensioners in 1991 and a Labor Government that increased the co-payment for general payments by 100%, from $5 to $10 in 1985.


It has been fair in the past, and it is fair now, to slightly increase the cost for consumers, given the increase in the cost of the PBS over the last 10 to 15 years and the number of very expensive drugs which will be listed in the future.




Conclusion—Savings for new listings and t
he medical research future fund



Demand for the PBS will continue to grow, and we want to list medicines quickly. The expense of the latest treatments is a major cost driver for the PBS. Recent PBS listings include medicines with a cost per patient per year of up to $110,000 for the treatment of melanoma; around $38,000 for advanced breast cancer; $27,000 for prostate cancer; and up to $17,000 for macular degeneration. As more high cost medicines are listed, and more patients require access to these treatments, the cost to taxpayers will increase. 


By asking consumers to share in that cost, we can build a sustainable PBS that can continue to make otherwise prohibitively expensive treatments affordable for all Australians. 


Importantly, this measure will also help to support future development of the types of innovative medicines people are seeking today. We will always be looking to prevent and treat illness and manage conditions that challenge us now. 


And our medical researchers have led the way, from Howard Florey to Sir Gustav Nossal and from Fiona Stanley to Ian Frazer. Australians have, through research and innovation, saved millions of lives, not just here but around the world.


Savings will contribute to the $20 billion capital protected Medical Research Future Fund. When fully mature, it will add $1 billion to the resources available for medical research every year and for generations to come. The fund will provide more opportunities for world class Australian researchers to undertake basic and applied research and to test their results in clinical trials in this country. This investment is a huge step forward for Australia and will bring considerable health and economic benefits to our nation.


The changes in this Bill will strengthen the PBS while preserving all the features that make it such a valued part of Australia's health system. 


SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (STRONGER PENALTIES FOR SERIOUS FAILURES) BILL 2014


Today I introduce the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Stronger Penalties for Serious Failures) Bill 2014 to strengthen the job seeker compliance framework.


It has long been a feature of our welfare system that job seekers in receipt of income support are asked to do certain activities in return for that taxpayer-funded benefit.


This includes actively looking for work, undertaking activities to improve their job prospects and taking up a suitable job offer.


The Coalition Government firmly believes in the importance of this mutual obligation.


Our recent Budget contained a number of measures to strengthen the mutual obligation and job seeker compliance frameworks.


The Bill I present today gives effect to the Budget measure to tighten the rules for job seekers who refuse a job, or persistently fail to meet their requirements.


This Bill will help to restore the integrity of our welfare system and ensure that available resources are used efficiently and effectively.


The Coalition understands that most job seekers in receipt of income support do the right thing by the taxpayer.


Most job seekers want to work and make the effort to find and keep a job.


However, there are some job seekers who do not meet their mutual obligation requirements and are abusing the system.


The former Labor Government encouraged this poor behaviour by weakening the rules regarding the application of penalties for serious failures.


Serious failures include refusing a job or persistent non-compliance in meeting participation requirements.


Currently, a non-payment period of eight weeks may be applied in cases of a serious failure.


However, the changes introduced by Labor allowed people to waive the penalties for a serious failure simply by doing additional activities, such as more intensive job search.


In 2012-13, there were 1,718 serious failures for refusing a job and of these, the penalty was waived in 68 per cent of cases.


In that same year, there were 25,286 serious failures for repeated non-compliance and of these, the penalty was waived in 73 per cent of cases.


And of those waived, nearly one-third were for a job seeker's second or third episode of non-compliance.


These penalties were waived not because the job seekers were vulnerable or the jobs were unsuitable, but simply because the job seeker elected to do an intensive activity instead.


The Coalition believes that the changes introduced by Labor have undermined the integrity of the job seeker compliance system.


The ability to continually waive the penalty means that job seekers who commit a serious failure can avoid the financial consequences of their actions, and continue to receive income support, despite their poor behaviour.


This is not right. 


It is important there are stronger deterrents in our system for those job seekers who abuse the system.


As I said, most job seekers do the right thing but some job seekers deliberately choose to avoid their responsibilities.


This Bill will ensure that the existing financial penalties for more serious failures are applied more rigorously and in keeping with community expectations.


The Government does not believe it is appropriate for a job seeker to refuse a suitable job and remain on welfare.


Anyone in receipt of a taxpayer-funded income support payment should be prepared to accept any legitimate, suitable work that they are capable of doing. 


This Bill will ensure that all job seekers who refuse an offer of suitable work - or fail to accept a suitable job - are required to serve their eight week non-payment period. 


Job seekers in these cases will not be permitted to have their penalty waived through participation in intensive activities. 


It will remain the case that job seekers will not be forced to take work that is clearly beyond their work capacity and that individual circumstances, such homelessness, will still be taken into account.


Some job seekers also fail to meet expectations with regard to participating in activities designed to improve their job prospects, such as meeting with their employment service providers or participating in activities.


Where a person is persistently and wilfully non-compliant in meeting these requirements then a non-payment penalty of eight weeks may be applied.


Unfortunately, the changes introduced by Labor also allowed this penalty to be waived through participation in intensive activities.


This means that there is now no meaningful consequence for people who are repeatedly non-compliant.


The absence of a real financial penalty for this group of 


job seekers means that people have no real incentive to change their behaviour for the better.


This Bill limits the number of times a job seeker may have the penalty for persistent non-compliance waived.


In the future, job seekers will only be allowed to have this penalty waived once through participation in an intensive activity.


This is consistent with the original intent of the waiver provisions which was to encourage job seekers to re-engage with their employment services provider and resume their participation activities. 


By limiting this waiver to one occasion only, job seekers will be provided with a clearer incentive to fully meet their participation requirements into the future.




Conclusion



The Government knows that there is little tolerance in the broader community for job seekers who repeatedly flout the rules.


Stakeholders, including social welfare groups, have been clear in their dealings with me that resources must be directed to those job seekers who do the right thing.


There are simply not enough resources to allow money to be provided to those job seekers who are not prepared to help themselves.


The changes I have outlined today will save $20.5 million over five years.


This is money that is better spent on repairing Labor's Budget mess and meeting other priorities.


The changes in this Bill are only targeted at that cohort of job seekers who refuse a suitable job without reasonable grounds and those who are wilfully and persistently non-compliant.


Those job seekers who do the right thing have nothing to worry about.


I trust that that those opposite will support this Bill.



After all, it was the Member for Adelaide, as Minister for Employment Participation, who said: 


""A strengthening of the compliance system will mean that more job seekers are actively engaging in work experience activities, in training and in participation programs, so that they can find and keep a decent job…""


This is exactly what our Bill seeks to achieve: more job seekers meeting their mutual obligation requirements and moving from welfare to work.


This Bill will assist the Government to ensure the integrity of our income support system by ensuring that the penalties for serious failures are applied more rigorously.


The Bill underscores this Government's commitment to reinvigorating mutual obligation, consistent with taxpayer expectations.


Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of these bills be adjourned to the first sitting day of the next period of sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.

The PRESIDENT
 (23:01):  Order! Earlier this evening, during debate on the second reading of the Minerals Resource Rent Tax Repeal and Other Measures Bill 2013 [No. 2], Senator Bernardi, who was in the chair, undertook to refer to me a point of order raised about a garment being worn by Senator Ian Macdonald. The garment was bright orange in colour and had a small slogan above the left-hand breast area which read 'Australians for Coal'.


It is very well established by rulings of past presidents, including President Calvert in 2003, that it is not in order to wear in the chamber T-shirts or other clothing bearing slogans. I understand from senators speaking to the point of order that the garments had been distributed to senators by the Minerals Council of Australia, which is behind the Australians for Coal campaign. I understand that the garments bear senators' names on the right-hand breast area.


The basis of these rulings is that the wearing of such garments would allow senators to participate in debate in a non-verbal way, other than by receiving the call from the chair and participating in accordance with the normal rules of the Senate. It would be highly undesirable to have debate in the Senate reduced to the level of displaying such material and I confirm that the wearing of such garments in the Senate is disorderly, regardless of the size of the slogan on the garment.


In a related incident, I understand that Senator Ludlam was called to order by the chair for sitting near Senator Macdonald—so as to be in range of photographers taking shots of the senator with the call—and displaying a sign on a piece of paper. This is disorderly on the same basis. Holding up newspapers or placards or displaying items such as badges with slogans is also disorderly and has been ruled as such by presidents Sibraa and Reid on numerous occasions. Such practices are disruptive of orderly debate by allowing senators to intervene in ways other than by receiving the call from the chair.


I understand that senators have strong views on many issues, but debate in the Senate is subject to simple and reasonable rules to maintain order. I support all rulings by past presidents and I inform senators that they will be called to order in accordance with these rules in the future.

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment) (09:01):  I seek leave to make a short statement regarding the tragic news this morning concerning Malaysia Airlines flight 17.


Leave granted.




Senator ABETZ:
  Honourable senators will have woken to the news that Malaysia Airlines flight 17, on a flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, has been lost in Ukrainian airspace. The aircraft had 280 passengers and 15 crew. The information we have is that there are no survivors. Dutch authorities have advised that, according to their records, some 27 Australians were on board this aircraft, but final figures are yet to be provided.


There is not much more for me to say at this stage about this very sad news except to express, on behalf of the government and, I am sure, all senators, our sincere condolences to the families of the Australian citizens and all others on the aircraft. 


I use this opportunity as well to advise people listening that, if you have concerns for family or friends, you should attempt to contact them directly. If you are unable to contact them and still hold concerns for their welfare, the 24-hour consular emergency contact number of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is 1300555135. I thank the Senate.

 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (09:02):  by leave—On behalf of opposition senators, I express shock and grief at the fate of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, and our thoughts are with the families and friends of those who have lost their lives. The loss of Australian lives and the lives of so many others is heart-wrenching. 


For those who have lost loved ones today, words cannot suffice. This is a terrible tragedy and it reminds us of what really matters. It reminds us of the preciousness of life, the importance of family, friendship and love. 


On behalf of the opposition, I join with the government in offering whatever support we can to those dealing with this dreadful news this morning.

 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (09:03):  by leave—On behalf of the Australian Greens, I join with the remarks made by Senator Abetz and Senator Wong and express our absolute condolence to everyone affected. Our hearts go out to all those families and friends. 


These tragedies have ramifications that go through the whole of society. I understand from the most recent reports that it is understood that at least one expert, and maybe more, coming to Australia for the International AIDS Conference were on board the flight. That means the ramifications go to all the people who are at that conference this weekend. No doubt, as more details emerge, this tragedy will touch many, many Australians. 


We join with everyone in the Senate and in the Australian parliament in sending our love and support to everybody who is affected.



The PRESIDENT:  I ask honourable senators to join with me in standing in silence as a mark of respect to those who have died in this tragedy.

That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



This Bill will implement the Government's election commitment to index income thresholds for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card.


The seniors health card is available to people who are of age pension age but who do not qualify for the age pension – typically, self-funded retirees.


Qualification for the seniors health card depends partly on a person satisfying the seniors health card taxable income test.  Under that test, the person's adjusted taxable income must not exceed the taxable income limit that applies to the person's family situation.


Those income limits are currently set at $50,000 for singles and $80,000 for couples.


The taxable income limits are not currently indexed, and have not increased since 2001.


Introducing indexation means more people will satisfy the seniors health card taxable income test and therefore qualify for the seniors health card.


The Government recognises that self-funded retirees, after a lifetime of hard work, have made a significant contribution to our nation's success.  They are entitled to a safe and secure retirement.


We also recognise that, by looking after their own retirement needs, self-funded retirees save the Commonwealth Budget considerable pension costs.


However, we know that many self-funded retirees are not wealthy and face financial pressures.  Those who meet the current income test and therefore hold a seniors health card are rightly concerned about modest changes in retirement income potentially causing them to lose their entitlement to the card.


Unexpected medical bills can be a significant worry for many seniors in that position.


Indexing the current income thresholds so they do not erode in real terms will allow more self-funded retirees to qualify for a seniors health card – or to keep their card despite small increases in their income beyond the current limits.


This means more seniors will be able to access the concessions that come with the card – including medicines listed in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme at the concessional rate.


Indexation of the income thresholds will occur annually, starting on 20 September 2014, and will be based on movements in the Consumer Price Index.


This measure applies to the seniors health card under either the Social Security Act 1991 or the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986.


The Bill will also make minor and technical amendments to portfolio Acts, including reflecting changed public service administrative arrangements.


Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned to the first sitting day of the next period of sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.

 (Tasmania—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment) (12:38):  I move:


That the committee does not insist on its amendments to which the House of Representatives has disagreed.


These two bills are an essential part of the government's plank of building the infrastructure of the 21st century. This is a plank which will allow us to develop literally tens of thousands of jobs over the next few years. This is the payment by the Commonwealth, in rough terms, of about $5,000 million, from which we ought to be able to leverage, courtesy of the states, about $33,000 million to develop the infrastructure to get the productivity enhancement projects that this country so desperately needs.


Can I remind honourable senators that this bill in fact also allows the states to lease their assets, as opposed to a direct sale. We believe that it is important to have a fund such as this that can operate without the sorts of impediments that were imposed by the Senate's amendments. We believe that genuine productivity-enhancing investments are what this country needs, as opposed to the sorts of pink batts and school halls that we had in the past.


In summing up, can I also indicate to the Senate that we would invite, especially senators opposite, to heed the words of their shadow spokesman Mr Marles, on 18 June 2014, when asked about this particular legislation:


How could Labor stand in the way of billions, tens of billions, being spent on productive infrastructure?


Mr Marles's answer was:


… if the amendments don't get up, we've said we're not going to stand in the way of this bill.


We would invite Labor to consider those wise words of Mr Marles. I am aware of the time constraints on the Senate. I will therefore leave my remarks at that, other than to say this is a vital part of the government's plan to get the country's economy back on track. I would urge honourable senators to reconsider their position in relation to the amendments which the Househas not agreed to.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (12:41):  Labor will be insisting on all of our amendments. This goes to the proposition that the coalition argued consistently throughout their period in opposition that there has to be a proper cost-benefit analysis undertaken if we are spending billions of dollars of public money. They argued that position in opposition and we are accepting that proposition now. That proposition cannot be achieved with the proposal that has come back from the other place. There have to be checks and balances on what state governments are doing. There has to be proper analysis of and accountability for federal government money that is spent on any of these projects. 


I would just go back to the WestConnex project in New South Wales—the road to nowhere, the road that will create more problems, the road that was simply a political promise by the coalition, and a political promise by the state government, without any cost-benefit analysis, without any analysis of what is happening in relation to roads elsewhere. I will just finish of this. I will not say a lot, because we have had this debate. The Senate takes the view that there has to be accountability on these issues, accountability on state governments and accountability on the money we spend. There has to be a cost-benefit analysis so that the projects are in the national interest, not in the political interests of a particular party. The national interest is what is important here. So I take the view and I would hope that my friends the Greens, my friends in PUP and the crossbench senators take the view that accountability is the key issue, that projects in the national interest are the key issue and that we should stand by the position that we adopted, because our position is in the national interest, not in the interests of any individual political party.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2014-07-17,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (13:32):  I move:


That the Migration Amendment (2014 Measures No. 1) Regulation 2014, as contained in Select Legislative Instrument 2014 No. 32 and made under the Migration Act 1958, be disallowed.


The Migration Amendment (2014 Measures No. 1) Regulation 2014 includes a number of elements. It is primarily about punishing vulnerable children who have arrived in Australia on their own, some orphaned, without families, and others who have had to leave their family in escaping war, torture and persecution. Those children who are now already in Australia—who have been found to be genuine refugees, who we have acknowledged, after proper assessment, need and deserve Australia's protection—are being punished through this regulation by the government in removing the special criterion which applied to them in being able to be reunited with their families. The regulation applies to children who, as I have said, are already here. 


The government will argue that this is about a deterrence measure. It would only be a deterrence measure if indeed we were talking about children who had not already arrived; whereas we know that, under this government's policy, anybody who arrives here in Australia will be shipped off to Manus Island or Nauru, never to be resettled in Australia 


This regulation applies only to people who are already in Australia, have already been found to be genuine refugees and are now members of the Australian community. This is a spiteful and punitive move by the government to simply be cruel for cruelty's sake. It does not act as a deterrent—all it does is strip away any avenue for refugee children to be reunited with any family who may remain.


At this point I want to explain to the chamber the consequences if this regulation were not to be disallowed and were able to continue. There is a young unaccompanied boy named Hatif who lives in Melbourne. I met him a couple of years ago. Hatif—an incredibly bright, incredibly intelligent young guy—is a Hazara from Afghanistan. His father was an interpreter for the Australian armed forces in Afghanistan. Hatif's father was enlisted because of his interpreting skills and abilities, and he worked alongside Australian armed forces officers and other members of the coalition forces. Hatif's father's contribution to the coalition forces in Afghanistan made him a target of the Taliban regime. A number of years ago, when Hatif's father returned from Kabul to their village, the Taliban tracked him down and killed him, as a consequence of the support he was giving to the Australian armed forces. The Taliban left a note on his chest when they killed him—it said that the young boy was next. And that young boy, of course, was Hatif.


The reason Hatif was targeted is that he used to travel with his father from the village to Kabul and around Afghanistan. His English, too, was very good—his dad had obviously taught him how to speak English, and he was very fluent. The Taliban was sending a very clear message to Hatif and his family: 'We have killed the husband and father, and if this young boy enlists in helping the coalition forces, he will be next.' Hatif's mother did what any mother would do in that circumstance, and got her son away from that situation. After having to deal with the murder and death of his father, Hatif left Afghanistan. He fled across the border and lived in Pakistan for a little while. But it is not safe for Hazaras on the Afghan-Pakistan border, as the Taliban make regular attacks on the Hazara community there. Hatif managed to find a way out of Pakistan, and then found himself on a leaky boat to Australia. He was 14 years old—all on his own. His father had died at the hands of the Taliban because of the contribution he had made to the war in Afghanistan and in working alongside Australian defence men and women. Hatif is now in Australia. He has been given his refugee status—he has been found to be in genuine need of protection. He is a smart kid who is studying specialist maths and wants to be an engineering student when he gets to university. And he wants to be able to call Australia home.


Hatif's mother is still hiding in Afghanistan, along with his two younger siblings. Under this regulation, Hatif will never be reunited with his mother and sisters. He will never be given the opportunity to live safely with them here in Australia, despite the fact that we know that he is a refugee, and despite the fact that we know that his father died at the hands of the Taliban—that he sacrificed his life because of the contribution he made working alongside and supporting Australian defence officers. This regulation makes it near impossible for Hatif ever to be reunited with his mother and siblings, and that is why this regulation is wrong. It is spiteful. It is cruel. It does not act as a deterrent. What it does do is condemn young people like Hatif, who are here without their families—

The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(

Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  Hatif will never be reunited with his mother and his siblings if this regulation is to continue. And there are many stories like this out there. Those children who have come to Australia, who are already here and have been found to be genuine refugees, are, of course, already incredibly vulnerable, and this government is so callous that it wants a regulation to never allow these children to be reunited with their families.

The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Bernardi, on a point of order?




Senator Bernardi:
  I do accept that I was talking—I was talking about the children who drowned at sea, thanks to Sarah Hanson-Young's policies and those of the former government.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Bernardi, that is not a point of order, and I would ask that you respect when senators are on their feet and listen quietly.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  I find it incredible that this government is so obsessed with the idea of punishing already-vulnerable, desperate people even further—to the point where we have members of the coalition wanting to make frivolous and insulting comments in this place rather than debate the issue at hand. I will leave it there and I will continue on with the rest of the regulations.




Senator Bernardi:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Hanson-Young has suggested that children drowning at sea due to her policies is somehow frivolous and pointless. This is not an episode of Sea Patrol. You should say that to Senator Hanson-Young. She is a disgrace, and she is accepting no responsibility—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Bernardi: firstly, there is no point of order; it is a debating topic. But I think you should withdraw that, Senator Bernardi. I ask you to withdraw that.




Senator Bernardi:
  The Sea Patrol thing?



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Bernardi, let us not play games at this late hour on a Friday. You know what I am asking you to do.




Senator Bernardi:
  I am not playing games. What would you like me to withdraw?



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  You know: that derogatory comment that you threw at Senator Hanson-Young. I would ask you to withdraw it.




Senator Bernardi:
  That she was a disgrace? I withdraw that Senator Hanson-Young is a disgrace—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you.




Senator Bernardi:
  but the inferences she paid to me—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Bernardi!




Senator Bernardi:
  were terrible.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Bernardi. Senator Hanson-Young, you have the call.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. As I said, this regulation does a number of things. One, of course, is in relation to the unaccompanied children—refugees—who are here, who will be stopped from ever being reunited with their families. I must say: Senator Cory Bernardi spends an awful lot of time talking about 'family values', but you would have to wonder what kind of family values the senator is considering in order to support a regulation that permanently keeps families separated and split. Hatif is a child who is here as a refugee, who has had to flee from torture and persecution at the hands of the Taliban, because of the work that his father did in working alongside Australian defence personnel. You have got to wonder what kind of family values Cory Bernardi really aspires to.


There are, of course, other elements in relation to this regulation, and one which I think is worth mentioning is—




Senator Bushby:
  I rise on a point of order. I ask that senators be referred to by their correct title in this place.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Sterle
):  Senator Hanson-Young, I remind you of the title that you will use when addressing other senators.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  I will take that on board, Mr Acting Deputy President. One of the other elements of this regulation is reducing the English language criterion for those coming to work in Australia on 457 visas. It is extremely concerning to see this government wanting to make it easier for big companies to exploit workers on 457 visas by not even requiring them to have a high enough English proficiency. We know what happens when temporary skilled workers come into this country in big groups. If you cannot speak English and you do not know what the rules are when you are asked to sign particular work contracts, then you are open to discrimination and exploitation. While it is a very separate matter to the issue of unaccompanied minors, it is one that is important for this chamber to consider. We do not want to see workers coming to Australia on 457 visas only to be exploited because they cannot understand what it is that they are being asked to do by their employers. We do not want to see these workers used and exploited at the expense not just of their own dignity and their own rights as employees but also at the expense of other workers who may have been able to fill those positions and stand up for their rights at work and their entitlement to be treated properly within the workplace.


I know people are keen to get out of this place so I am not intending to drag this debate out anymore, but I just want to reflect on this government's general attitude in this place if they cannot get something through in legislation. We have seen it today. We saw the government's mining tax repeal voted down in this place today. They will not get it through. They cannot have their triumphant first two weeks of the new parliament. I am sure those champagne bottles that were put on ice are now going to have to stay there until the Prime Minister can work out what he is going to do next. What the government will do next is bring regulation after regulation into this place. This is becoming a theme of this government. They cannot get something through in legislation, they cannot convince the chamber that their laws are good enough and they do not want to negotiate on amendments, so they are putting whatever they can through in regulation. I suspect that here in this place we will have many more debates about disallowances because it is the only way the Senate can then discuss a number of these issues and consider them in any type of detail.


If there are things in this regulation that the government believes are necessary, I would urge it to put them into proper legislative form and let us have a proper debate. Let us have a proper discussion and discuss amendments, send them to a committee and have them inquired into. The government has put all these things in the one regulation and it expects the Senate just to tick it on through. We are not interested in that. We are interested in looking at laws properly and in detail and in making sure that what passes this place is going to put Australia in a better place and on track for a better future than would be the case if we simply turned a blind eye to the nasty pieces of regulation that this government wants to sneak through.


I am grateful that we have been able to discuss the disallowance motion here today precisely because there are some important things in this regulation that should not be done in Australia's name. We should not be punishing children who have come here as refugees by preventing them from ever being reunited with their families. It is callous. It is wrong. To suggest and argue that this is about deterrence is just false. It is a lie. This is not about deterrence, because these people are already here. These are children who are already here. They have visas. They are refugees, and they are children who are on their own.


The crazy thing about all of this is that the person who is currently their legal guardian is the immigration minister himself and he is now stopping those children from being able to be reunited with family, if they have any living family left. It is an appalling abuse of his role as the minister and their legal guardian. It should not be being done in Australia's name. We should be looking after these children. They deserve our protection. If they are lucky enough not to be orphans, if they still have a mother, sister or aunt who can help care for them, we should be doing what we can to ensure that those family members do not have to engage a people smuggler and get on a boat to get here.


The crazy thing about this regulation is that it is going to force more families, if they want to be reunited, to come through irregular means. The whole idea of having a proper family reunion process is to give people a safe way to get here. You have to wonder if the people smugglers are rubbing their hands together at the idea of this regulation not being disallowed, because it actually creates a reason why you would have to come on a boat in the first place. How else will you get here to be reunited with your family? We know that families will do desperate things to be together and look after each other. Let's not put them in that situation. If children who are already here as refugees have a living family member, let's help them be reunited. Let's be humane. Let's show a little compassion. Let's show a little more common sense and concern for basic dignity and humanity. I commend the disallowance motion to the Senate.

",Senate,<title>REGULATIONS AND DETERMINATIONS</title>,<title>Migration Amendment (2014 Measures No. 1) Regulation 2014</title>,REGULATIONS AND DETERMINATIONS,37,1,speech
"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2014-07-17,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women) (13:51):  I, too, rise to contribute to the debate on the disallowance motion. The first thing I would say to the Senate is that it is always very dangerous when a senator comes into this chamber and gives a speech which is based purely on sentiment and not fact and, even more than that, gives a speech which clearly indicates that the particular senator has not read the explanatory statement to the regulation.


I would just make the following points before turning to the actual disallowance motion. Despite the statements made by Senator Hanson-Young, the regulation does not in any way strip away family reunions for unaccompanied minors under the Special Humanitarian Program. It does not do that. It merely ensures that there is consistency in the way that family reunion under the Special Humanitarian Program is looked at. It puts unaccompanied minors under the same rules as other IMAs who may or may not be given access to a family reunion. I just want to make that very clear to the Senate. The statement that has been put forward by Senator Hanson-Young is completely, totally and utterly factually incorrect. As I said, it is very dangerous when you come into this place when you have not bothered to read the explanatory statement and you give a speech to the Senate that is based purely on sentiment and not fact. This government has to deal in facts.


I would also remind the Senate, following Senator Hanson-Young's speech to the chamber, that this government has granted more than 500 permanent protection visas to Afghan locally engaged employees.


In relation to the regulation that the Australian Greens seek to disallow, the Senate needs to understand that there are very serious issues at stake here. Why did the government bring in this regulation? The regulation that is sought to be disallowed today contains a number of measures that are required to strengthen and improve immigration policy in Australia. Let us not forget the record of the previous government: 50,000 illegal maritime arrivals; in excess of 1,200 people who died at sea; and, of course, the cost to the Australian taxpayer of a budget blow-out of almost $12 billion. 


There are five separate schedules that are sought to be disallowed by the disallowance motion. I will take the Senate through each of the schedules and why the government has brought in the regulations. In relation to schedule 1 that is sought to be disallowed, public interest criterion 4020 was introduced in 2011 to strengthen the integrity of Australia's immigration program by detecting and preventing visa fraud. I do not believe that anyone in this chamber supports visa fraud—or at least I would hope they do not. Public interest criterion 4020 provides grounds to refuse the grant of a visa where there is evidence that (a) documents provided by a visa applicant are bogus and (b) statements or claims made by an applicant include false or misleading information that is material to a visa.


The first measure requires all visa applicants for skilled, student, temporary and family visas to satisfy the minister as to their identity or they cannot be granted a visa. Again, I would have thought that was just ensuring the integrity of the program. A person has to satisfy the minister as to their identity before a visa can be granted. This measure is necessary to prevent identity fraud and arises from the government's commitment to strengthen the integrity of Australia's migration program. The accurate identification of noncitizens underpins the integrity of Australia's migration program. All elements of granting a visa, including national security and character checks, rely on accurate identification of a noncitizen who applies for a visa to enter Australia. Failure to correctly identify noncitizens can of course have far-reaching consequences for government. For instance, incorrect identification can be the basis for certain noncitizens receiving other government benefits, such as Medicare or Centrelink, to which they have no entitlement. Disallowing this measure, as Senator Hanson-Young wants to do, would undermine the integrity of Australia's migration program by allowing non-genuine applicants to use fraudulent identities to obtain visas to which they are not entitled.


In relation to schedule 2—the schedule Senator Hanson-Young appears to have alluded to in her speech and, in particular, has given one-off examples and dealt with this on the basis of sentiment as opposed to fact—this measure actually aims to safeguard the lives of young people by removing the previous arrangements of providing a concession to visa applicants proposed by minors. The concession, despite Senator Hanson-Young's arguments, had previously served as an incentive for minors to come to Australia as illegal maritime arrivals. This government does not want to see any more people—men, women, children, unaccompanied minors—dying at sea. So, yes, we will put in place measures that ensure that we do not have pull factors that encourage unaccompanied minors to get on a boat, risk their life and end up being one of the 1,200 who are confirmed to have drowned at sea because of the policies that Senator Hanson-Young supported.


The measure puts the subclass 202 global special humanitarian visa applicants proposed by minors back on an equal footing with applicants proposed by adults. Again, I confirm and I need the Senate to understand that, despite Senator Hanson-Young's statements that we are actually stripping away family reunion for unaccompanied minors, the regulation does not do that. The fact of the matter is all the regulation does is ensure consistency in the way the program itself is implemented. All it does is ensure that the family reunion rights for unaccompanied minors under the special humanitarian program are put on the same footing, the same rules, as applies to all IMAs coming here. Again, it is merely about consistency in the program. But I do stress to the Senate that the measure is part of the government's border protection strategy, which is stopping the boats, preventing deaths at sea and paying a human dividend of an additional 20,000 special humanitarian program places over five years.


In regard to the third measure that is sought to be disallowed, this measure inserts public interest criteria 4020 into four temporary visa subclasses. Two of the affected visa subclasses are part of Australia's Working Holiday Maker visa program, which is a very large and beneficial program for the Australian people, in a range of areas, including of course in its economic and cultural benefits. The good governance and effective management of these visa subclasses is obviously enhanced by public interest criteria 4020, which allows the department to appropriately refuse visa applications in circumstances where the applicant has engaged in fraudulent behaviour, such as providing false or misleading information. I want to stress to the Senate and to those who may be listening to the broadcast that this particular measure allows the department to appropriately refuse visa applications in circumstances where the applicant has engaged in fraudulent behaviour, such as providing false and misleading information.


I would hope that nobody in this place actually believes that the Australian government, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection, should grant a visa on the basis of fraudulent information. It is clearly not in the public interest to allow people who engage in fraudulent behaviour for the purposes of entering Australia to be allowed to do so. Disallowance of this measure, as wanted by Senator Hanson-Young, will affect the department's ability to address inappropriate behaviour of this kind. Decision makers will not be able to refuse visas where it is found that the visa applicants have provided false or misleading information. I will say it again so that everybody in the Senate understands what this disallowance does: it means that decision makers will not be able to refuse visas where it is found that the visa applicant has provided false or misleading information. Again, I say to people, I do not believe it is in the interests of the Australian public to allow the department to enable someone to enter Australia, and then grant them a visa, on the basis of false or misleading information. Disallowance will also limit the ability of the department to maintain or improve the integrity of the overall migration program.


In relation to the fourth measure that Senator Hanson-Young and the Australian Greens seek to disallow, this measure allows the department to share certain personal information about IMAs residing in the community with the Australian Federal Police or the police service of a state and territory government. In relation to this particular regulation, during the 2013 federal election campaign the government indicated its intention to enable the disclosure of information. We took this to the election and the Australian people were completely aware of what we would do if we were elected. Again, we have done exactly what we told the Australian people we would do.


In relation to the disclosure of this type of information, the disclosure supports the compliance activities of the department. I want to confirm to the Senate that those of us on this side of the chamber will ensure under all circumstances that the integrity of the migration program in Australia is maintained. We want to ensure that we put in place strong compliance measures to enable the Department of Immigration and Border Protection to adequately ensure that our borders are protected. In regard to disclosure, the government has become increasingly concerned about people who engage in criminal conduct after being released into the community from being held in immigration detention.


I will just put some facts on the table. Since 8 September 2013, the minister has personally intervened to release over 600 IMAs from held detention arrangements to reside in the community. He has personally intervened to do this. The minister has made these residence determinations under section 197AD of the Migration Act, as it was in the public interest to do so at that time. In doing that, though, the minister needs to ensure that these placements in community detention continue to remain in the public interest. Disclosure of certain personal information will assist the police in identifying whether an individual allegedly involved in criminal activity is an IMA. When this occurs, the department can be informed accordingly and, in the case of a community detainee, the minister is able to consider whether community detention placement or residence determination should be revoked. This measure assists the department in managing the community detention program and it mitigates the risks associated with the exercise of the intervention power—and, as I said, the minister has personally intervened on over 600 occasions to release people from held detention into the community, which is what I thought the Australian Greens wanted. 


But, in doing that, we also have an obligation to the Australian public and we have an obligation to the state and territory governments. All this regulation does is ensure that the information that the state and territory police need to identify those in the community who may be involved in inappropriate behaviour or have committed a crime can be given to them—and to enable the minister to then determine whether or not the determination should be revoked. The measure assists the department in managing the community detention program and, as I said, mitigates the risks associated with the exercise of the intervention power.


In relation to the final schedule that Senator Hanson-Young is seeking to disallow, the fifth measure relates to the English language criteria for the subclass 457 visa program. Despite, again, the statements made by Senator Hanson-Young—which are completely, totally and utterly factually incorrect—I confirm for the chamber that the amendments did not alter the English language requirements that must be demonstrated by a subclass 457 visa applicant. I will just say that again: the amendments did not alter the English language requirements that must be demonstrated by a subclass 457 visa applicant. Rather, what the amendments did do—these are the facts—was move the English language requirements for the subclass 457 visas from the body of the regulations into a legislative instrument made by the minister. Again I confirm that the actual English language requirements to be met by subclass 457 visa applicants were not changed by this measure. The amendments simply moved the English language requirements for the subclass 457 visa applicants from the migration regulations to a legislative instrument made by the minister. If this measure is disallowed, the subclass 457 program will revert to a less adaptable framework for the English language requirements for at least six months. 


As I have stated, there are five separate schedules that Senator Hanson-Young is seeking to disallow through this disallowance motion. In relation to the five schedules, everything that Senator Hanson-Young said to support the disallowance motion is factually incorrect. I make the point again: it is very easy to come into this chamber and give a speech based on sentiment. On this side of the chamber, however, we are the government. We have to deal in fact. We need to ensure that, at all times, we maintain consistency in Australia's migration program and that we maintain the integrity of Australia's migration program 


The only thing that a successful disallowance motion will do today is weaken Australia's immigration policy. We were elected on the basis of restoring integrity and security to Australia's borders, and that is exactly what this government are doing. I would ask the Senate not to support the Greens' disallowance motion.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (14:10):  I appreciate that senators are extremely keen to meet their flight commitments, and that will prevent me from talking at great length about the detail of the assertions that have been made by the minister. I think I should just take this opportunity to inform the Senate that the Labor Party will be supporting this disallowance, and we do so because of our deep concern regarding the potential consequences of schedule 2 regarding the Global Special Humanitarian subclass 202 visas for applicants proposed by minors. We are very concerned that the compelling reasons that are provided within the existing regulations do set out quite stringent conditions. We believe that they are satisfactory to meet the circumstances to the country and that various advice to government has suggested that it is appropriate that those criteria remain in place and that these regulations therefore are not necessary.


I am particularly concerned when the minister, in reference to changes to the English language requirements for 457 visas, talked about the need for adaptability for the 457 visa group. It really does disturb me when the minister speaks in those terms—that is, if this is disallowed then it will not be as adaptable. I think we understand what the code is for that provision. I nonetheless remain very concerned about ensuring that the special humanitarian visa program does have integrity and is able to be used to secure a proper humanitarian approach, particularly when it comes to treatment of minors.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2014-07-17,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (14:12):  As there are no other speakers, I will briefly sum up the debate. I want to place on record that while it may be inconvenient for the government of the day to hear the sentiment—that is, the reality—of what their laws, their regulations mean to real people, that is indeed what we need to be considering in this place. We have a government that want to be as cruel and as mean and as nasty as possible to people just because of how those people arrived. The ridiculous thing, the dangerous thing, the awful thing about this regulation is that this is inflicting pain on people who are already here, children who have already arrived, and yet the government continue to use whatever stick they can find to keep beating up on refugees who are here in the Australian community already as a symbol of their get tough on boats policy.


These children already exist, they are in Australia. They have been given refugee status because we know they are refugees. They have fled war, they have had to run away from torture and brutality, and we are effectively condemning them to be separated from their families for the rest of their lives. I have no shame talking about the sentiment and the real impact on the lives of individuals that this government wants to inflict more pain and suffering on, just because it suits its get tough, get mean approach on refugees. This is from a government that blows not just the dog whistle but the foghorn every time, every single time, things get tough in this place. Today it had its mining tax repeal bill thrown out, and so what does it bring on? It brings on a debate on a disallowance motion on refugees and asylum seekers.


This government continues to hide behind its budget failures and its inability to negotiate and to get proper outcomes in this place. Every time it gets tough, we see Scott Morrison, the minister for immigration, on our TV screens saying, 'Hang on a minute. Remember all those people we're at war with on the seas—the refugees? Remember them? We're stopping them.' It is appalling abuse not just of the intelligence of the Australian people but of the lives of the individuals that this government continues to play with.


There is a boat out on the Indian Ocean holding 153 asylum seekers and the government do not want to talk about it, but they are more than happy to stand up in this place and beat up on asylum seeker children—refugees who are already here. The government continue to use refugees as their whipping boy. When the day is tough, they cannot get their own legislation and their own budget through this place, and they cannot negotiate with the crossbench, they start beating up on refugees to save their own face and their own skin. It is an appalling abuse of people's rights and dignity and the standards by which our parliament should be looking after the most vulnerable—standing up for the rule of law; standing up for basic compassion towards people who have committed no crime.


These are kids—kids who have had to flee war, torture and persecution. Many of them are orphaned already. Many of them only have one sibling left, and, in order to look tough, to play the nasty, fear-mongering, anti-refugee race card and to push everything else off the newspaper headlines, this government uses those children. That is what this regulation is about and that is why it should be disallowed.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the motion moved by Senator Hanson-Young to disallow Migration Amendment (2014 Measures No.1) Regulation be agreed to.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2014-07-17,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (13:32):  I move:


That the Migration Amendment (2014 Measures No. 1) Regulation 2014, as contained in Select Legislative Instrument 2014 No. 32 and made under the Migration Act 1958, be disallowed.


The Migration Amendment (2014 Measures No. 1) Regulation 2014 includes a number of elements. It is primarily about punishing vulnerable children who have arrived in Australia on their own, some orphaned, without families, and others who have had to leave their family in escaping war, torture and persecution. Those children who are now already in Australia—who have been found to be genuine refugees, who we have acknowledged, after proper assessment, need and deserve Australia's protection—are being punished through this regulation by the government in removing the special criterion which applied to them in being able to be reunited with their families. The regulation applies to children who, as I have said, are already here. 


The government will argue that this is about a deterrence measure. It would only be a deterrence measure if indeed we were talking about children who had not already arrived; whereas we know that, under this government's policy, anybody who arrives here in Australia will be shipped off to Manus Island or Nauru, never to be resettled in Australia 


This regulation applies only to people who are already in Australia, have already been found to be genuine refugees and are now members of the Australian community. This is a spiteful and punitive move by the government to simply be cruel for cruelty's sake. It does not act as a deterrent—all it does is strip away any avenue for refugee children to be reunited with any family who may remain.


At this point I want to explain to the chamber the consequences if this regulation were not to be disallowed and were able to continue. There is a young unaccompanied boy named Hatif who lives in Melbourne. I met him a couple of years ago. Hatif—an incredibly bright, incredibly intelligent young guy—is a Hazara from Afghanistan. His father was an interpreter for the Australian armed forces in Afghanistan. Hatif's father was enlisted because of his interpreting skills and abilities, and he worked alongside Australian armed forces officers and other members of the coalition forces. Hatif's father's contribution to the coalition forces in Afghanistan made him a target of the Taliban regime. A number of years ago, when Hatif's father returned from Kabul to their village, the Taliban tracked him down and killed him, as a consequence of the support he was giving to the Australian armed forces. The Taliban left a note on his chest when they killed him—it said that the young boy was next. And that young boy, of course, was Hatif.


The reason Hatif was targeted is that he used to travel with his father from the village to Kabul and around Afghanistan. His English, too, was very good—his dad had obviously taught him how to speak English, and he was very fluent. The Taliban was sending a very clear message to Hatif and his family: 'We have killed the husband and father, and if this young boy enlists in helping the coalition forces, he will be next.' Hatif's mother did what any mother would do in that circumstance, and got her son away from that situation. After having to deal with the murder and death of his father, Hatif left Afghanistan. He fled across the border and lived in Pakistan for a little while. But it is not safe for Hazaras on the Afghan-Pakistan border, as the Taliban make regular attacks on the Hazara community there. Hatif managed to find a way out of Pakistan, and then found himself on a leaky boat to Australia. He was 14 years old—all on his own. His father had died at the hands of the Taliban because of the contribution he had made to the war in Afghanistan and in working alongside Australian defence men and women. Hatif is now in Australia. He has been given his refugee status—he has been found to be in genuine need of protection. He is a smart kid who is studying specialist maths and wants to be an engineering student when he gets to university. And he wants to be able to call Australia home.


Hatif's mother is still hiding in Afghanistan, along with his two younger siblings. Under this regulation, Hatif will never be reunited with his mother and sisters. He will never be given the opportunity to live safely with them here in Australia, despite the fact that we know that he is a refugee, and despite the fact that we know that his father died at the hands of the Taliban—that he sacrificed his life because of the contribution he made working alongside and supporting Australian defence officers. This regulation makes it near impossible for Hatif ever to be reunited with his mother and siblings, and that is why this regulation is wrong. It is spiteful. It is cruel. It does not act as a deterrent. What it does do is condemn young people like Hatif, who are here without their families—



Senator Bernardi interjecting—



Senator Cash interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Sterle
):  Order!




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  Hatif will never be reunited with his mother and his siblings if this regulation is to continue. And there are many stories like this out there. Those children who have come to Australia, who are already here and have been found to be genuine refugees, are, of course, already incredibly vulnerable, and this government is so callous that it wants a regulation to never allow these children to be reunited with their families.



Senator Bernardi interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Bernardi! Order!




Senator Siewert:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Bernardi is talking at a level which you, Chair, probably cannot hear, but which we at this end of the chamber certainly can, and he knows what he is doing. Could you please ask him to remain quiet while Senator Hanson-Young makes her contribution.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Bernardi, on a point of order?




Senator Bernardi:
  I do accept that I was talking—I was talking about the children who drowned at sea, thanks to Sarah Hanson-Young's policies and those of the former government.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Bernardi, that is not a point of order, and I would ask that you respect when senators are on their feet and listen quietly.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  I find it incredible that this government is so obsessed with the idea of punishing already-vulnerable, desperate people even further—to the point where we have members of the coalition wanting to make frivolous and insulting comments in this place rather than debate the issue at hand. I will leave it there and I will continue on with the rest of the regulations.




Senator Bernardi:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Hanson-Young has suggested that children drowning at sea due to her policies is somehow frivolous and pointless. This is not an episode of Sea Patrol. You should say that to Senator Hanson-Young. She is a disgrace, and she is accepting no responsibility—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Bernardi: firstly, there is no point of order; it is a debating topic. But I think you should withdraw that, Senator Bernardi. I ask you to withdraw that.




Senator Bernardi:
  The Sea Patrol thing?



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Bernardi, let us not play games at this late hour on a Friday. You know what I am asking you to do.




Senator Bernardi:
  I am not playing games. What would you like me to withdraw?



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  You know: that derogatory comment that you threw at Senator Hanson-Young. I would ask you to withdraw it.




Senator Bernardi:
  That she was a disgrace? I withdraw that Senator Hanson-Young is a disgrace—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you.




Senator Bernardi:
  but the inferences she paid to me—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Bernardi!




Senator Bernardi:
  were terrible.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Bernardi. Senator Hanson-Young, you have the call.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. As I said, this regulation does a number of things. One, of course, is in relation to the unaccompanied children—refugees—who are here, who will be stopped from ever being reunited with their families. I must say: Senator Cory Bernardi spends an awful lot of time talking about 'family values', but you would have to wonder what kind of family values the senator is considering in order to support a regulation that permanently keeps families separated and split. Hatif is a child who is here as a refugee, who has had to flee from torture and persecution at the hands of the Taliban, because of the work that his father did in working alongside Australian defence personnel. You have got to wonder what kind of family values Cory Bernardi really aspires to.


There are, of course, other elements in relation to this regulation, and one which I think is worth mentioning is—




Senator Bushby:
  I rise on a point of order. I ask that senators be referred to by their correct title in this place.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Sterle
):  Senator Hanson-Young, I remind you of the title that you will use when addressing other senators.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  I will take that on board, Mr Acting Deputy President. One of the other elements of this regulation is reducing the English language criterion for those coming to work in Australia on 457 visas. It is extremely concerning to see this government wanting to make it easier for big companies to exploit workers on 457 visas by not even requiring them to have a high enough English proficiency. We know what happens when temporary skilled workers come into this country in big groups. If you cannot speak English and you do not know what the rules are when you are asked to sign particular work contracts, then you are open to discrimination and exploitation. While it is a very separate matter to the issue of unaccompanied minors, it is one that is important for this chamber to consider. We do not want to see workers coming to Australia on 457 visas only to be exploited because they cannot understand what it is that they are being asked to do by their employers. We do not want to see these workers used and exploited at the expense not just of their own dignity and their own rights as employees but also at the expense of other workers who may have been able to fill those positions and stand up for their rights at work and their entitlement to be treated properly within the workplace.


I know people are keen to get out of this place so I am not intending to drag this debate out anymore, but I just want to reflect on this government's general attitude in this place if they cannot get something through in legislation. We have seen it today. We saw the government's mining tax repeal voted down in this place today. They will not get it through. They cannot have their triumphant first two weeks of the new parliament. I am sure those champagne bottles that were put on ice are now going to have to stay there until the Prime Minister can work out what he is going to do next. What the government will do next is bring regulation after regulation into this place. This is becoming a theme of this government. They cannot get something through in legislation, they cannot convince the chamber that their laws are good enough and they do not want to negotiate on amendments, so they are putting whatever they can through in regulation. I suspect that here in this place we will have many more debates about disallowances because it is the only way the Senate can then discuss a number of these issues and consider them in any type of detail.


If there are things in this regulation that the government believes are necessary, I would urge it to put them into proper legislative form and let us have a proper debate. Let us have a proper discussion and discuss amendments, send them to a committee and have them inquired into. The government has put all these things in the one regulation and it expects the Senate just to tick it on through. We are not interested in that. We are interested in looking at laws properly and in detail and in making sure that what passes this place is going to put Australia in a better place and on track for a better future than would be the case if we simply turned a blind eye to the nasty pieces of regulation that this government wants to sneak through.


I am grateful that we have been able to discuss the disallowance motion here today precisely because there are some important things in this regulation that should not be done in Australia's name. We should not be punishing children who have come here as refugees by preventing them from ever being reunited with their families. It is callous. It is wrong. To suggest and argue that this is about deterrence is just false. It is a lie. This is not about deterrence, because these people are already here. These are children who are already here. They have visas. They are refugees, and they are children who are on their own.


The crazy thing about all of this is that the person who is currently their legal guardian is the immigration minister himself and he is now stopping those children from being able to be reunited with family, if they have any living family left. It is an appalling abuse of his role as the minister and their legal guardian. It should not be being done in Australia's name. We should be looking after these children. They deserve our protection. If they are lucky enough not to be orphans, if they still have a mother, sister or aunt who can help care for them, we should be doing what we can to ensure that those family members do not have to engage a people smuggler and get on a boat to get here.


The crazy thing about this regulation is that it is going to force more families, if they want to be reunited, to come through irregular means. The whole idea of having a proper family reunion process is to give people a safe way to get here. You have to wonder if the people smugglers are rubbing their hands together at the idea of this regulation not being disallowed, because it actually creates a reason why you would have to come on a boat in the first place. How else will you get here to be reunited with your family? We know that families will do desperate things to be together and look after each other. Let's not put them in that situation. If children who are already here as refugees have a living family member, let's help them be reunited. Let's be humane. Let's show a little compassion. Let's show a little more common sense and concern for basic dignity and humanity. I commend the disallowance motion to the Senate.

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2014-07-17,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women) (13:51):  I, too, rise to contribute to the debate on the disallowance motion. The first thing I would say to the Senate is that it is always very dangerous when a senator comes into this chamber and gives a speech which is based purely on sentiment and not fact and, even more than that, gives a speech which clearly indicates that the particular senator has not read the explanatory statement to the regulation.


I would just make the following points before turning to the actual disallowance motion. Despite the statements made by Senator Hanson-Young, the regulation does not in any way strip away family reunions for unaccompanied minors under the Special Humanitarian Program. It does not do that. It merely ensures that there is consistency in the way that family reunion under the Special Humanitarian Program is looked at. It puts unaccompanied minors under the same rules as other IMAs who may or may not be given access to a family reunion. I just want to make that very clear to the Senate. The statement that has been put forward by Senator Hanson-Young is completely, totally and utterly factually incorrect. As I said, it is very dangerous when you come into this place when you have not bothered to read the explanatory statement and you give a speech to the Senate that is based purely on sentiment and not fact. This government has to deal in facts.


I would also remind the Senate, following Senator Hanson-Young's speech to the chamber, that this government has granted more than 500 permanent protection visas to Afghan locally engaged employees.


In relation to the regulation that the Australian Greens seek to disallow, the Senate needs to understand that there are very serious issues at stake here. Why did the government bring in this regulation? The regulation that is sought to be disallowed today contains a number of measures that are required to strengthen and improve immigration policy in Australia. Let us not forget the record of the previous government: 50,000 illegal maritime arrivals; in excess of 1,200 people who died at sea; and, of course, the cost to the Australian taxpayer of a budget blow-out of almost $12 billion. 


There are five separate schedules that are sought to be disallowed by the disallowance motion. I will take the Senate through each of the schedules and why the government has brought in the regulations. In relation to schedule 1 that is sought to be disallowed, public interest criterion 4020 was introduced in 2011 to strengthen the integrity of Australia's immigration program by detecting and preventing visa fraud. I do not believe that anyone in this chamber supports visa fraud—or at least I would hope they do not. Public interest criterion 4020 provides grounds to refuse the grant of a visa where there is evidence that (a) documents provided by a visa applicant are bogus and (b) statements or claims made by an applicant include false or misleading information that is material to a visa.


The first measure requires all visa applicants for skilled, student, temporary and family visas to satisfy the minister as to their identity or they cannot be granted a visa. Again, I would have thought that was just ensuring the integrity of the program. A person has to satisfy the minister as to their identity before a visa can be granted. This measure is necessary to prevent identity fraud and arises from the government's commitment to strengthen the integrity of Australia's migration program. The accurate identification of noncitizens underpins the integrity of Australia's migration program. All elements of granting a visa, including national security and character checks, rely on accurate identification of a noncitizen who applies for a visa to enter Australia. Failure to correctly identify noncitizens can of course have far-reaching consequences for government. For instance, incorrect identification can be the basis for certain noncitizens receiving other government benefits, such as Medicare or Centrelink, to which they have no entitlement. Disallowing this measure, as Senator Hanson-Young wants to do, would undermine the integrity of Australia's migration program by allowing non-genuine applicants to use fraudulent identities to obtain visas to which they are not entitled.


In relation to schedule 2—the schedule Senator Hanson-Young appears to have alluded to in her speech and, in particular, has given one-off examples and dealt with this on the basis of sentiment as opposed to fact—this measure actually aims to safeguard the lives of young people by removing the previous arrangements of providing a concession to visa applicants proposed by minors. The concession, despite Senator Hanson-Young's arguments, had previously served as an incentive for minors to come to Australia as illegal maritime arrivals. This government does not want to see any more people—men, women, children, unaccompanied minors—dying at sea. So, yes, we will put in place measures that ensure that we do not have pull factors that encourage unaccompanied minors to get on a boat, risk their life and end up being one of the 1,200 who are confirmed to have drowned at sea because of the policies that Senator Hanson-Young supported.


The measure puts the subclass 202 global special humanitarian visa applicants proposed by minors back on an equal footing with applicants proposed by adults. Again, I confirm and I need the Senate to understand that, despite Senator Hanson-Young's statements that we are actually stripping away family reunion for unaccompanied minors, the regulation does not do that. The fact of the matter is all the regulation does is ensure consistency in the way the program itself is implemented. All it does is ensure that the family reunion rights for unaccompanied minors under the special humanitarian program are put on the same footing, the same rules, as applies to all IMAs coming here. Again, it is merely about consistency in the program. But I do stress to the Senate that the measure is part of the government's border protection strategy, which is stopping the boats, preventing deaths at sea and paying a human dividend of an additional 20,000 special humanitarian program places over five years.


In regard to the third measure that is sought to be disallowed, this measure inserts public interest criteria 4020 into four temporary visa subclasses. Two of the affected visa subclasses are part of Australia's Working Holiday Maker visa program, which is a very large and beneficial program for the Australian people, in a range of areas, including of course in its economic and cultural benefits. The good governance and effective management of these visa subclasses is obviously enhanced by public interest criteria 4020, which allows the department to appropriately refuse visa applications in circumstances where the applicant has engaged in fraudulent behaviour, such as providing false or misleading information. I want to stress to the Senate and to those who may be listening to the broadcast that this particular measure allows the department to appropriately refuse visa applications in circumstances where the applicant has engaged in fraudulent behaviour, such as providing false and misleading information.


I would hope that nobody in this place actually believes that the Australian government, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection, should grant a visa on the basis of fraudulent information. It is clearly not in the public interest to allow people who engage in fraudulent behaviour for the purposes of entering Australia to be allowed to do so. Disallowance of this measure, as wanted by Senator Hanson-Young, will affect the department's ability to address inappropriate behaviour of this kind. Decision makers will not be able to refuse visas where it is found that the visa applicants have provided false or misleading information. I will say it again so that everybody in the Senate understands what this disallowance does: it means that decision makers will not be able to refuse visas where it is found that the visa applicant has provided false or misleading information. Again, I say to people, I do not believe it is in the interests of the Australian public to allow the department to enable someone to enter Australia, and then grant them a visa, on the basis of false or misleading information. Disallowance will also limit the ability of the department to maintain or improve the integrity of the overall migration program.


In relation to the fourth measure that Senator Hanson-Young and the Australian Greens seek to disallow, this measure allows the department to share certain personal information about IMAs residing in the community with the Australian Federal Police or the police service of a state and territory government. In relation to this particular regulation, during the 2013 federal election campaign the government indicated its intention to enable the disclosure of information. We took this to the election and the Australian people were completely aware of what we would do if we were elected. Again, we have done exactly what we told the Australian people we would do.


In relation to the disclosure of this type of information, the disclosure supports the compliance activities of the department. I want to confirm to the Senate that those of us on this side of the chamber will ensure under all circumstances that the integrity of the migration program in Australia is maintained. We want to ensure that we put in place strong compliance measures to enable the Department of Immigration and Border Protection to adequately ensure that our borders are protected. In regard to disclosure, the government has become increasingly concerned about people who engage in criminal conduct after being released into the community from being held in immigration detention.


I will just put some facts on the table. Since 8 September 2013, the minister has personally intervened to release over 600 IMAs from held detention arrangements to reside in the community. He has personally intervened to do this. The minister has made these residence determinations under section 197AD of the Migration Act, as it was in the public interest to do so at that time. In doing that, though, the minister needs to ensure that these placements in community detention continue to remain in the public interest. Disclosure of certain personal information will assist the police in identifying whether an individual allegedly involved in criminal activity is an IMA. When this occurs, the department can be informed accordingly and, in the case of a community detainee, the minister is able to consider whether community detention placement or residence determination should be revoked. This measure assists the department in managing the community detention program and it mitigates the risks associated with the exercise of the intervention power—and, as I said, the minister has personally intervened on over 600 occasions to release people from held detention into the community, which is what I thought the Australian Greens wanted. 


But, in doing that, we also have an obligation to the Australian public and we have an obligation to the state and territory governments. All this regulation does is ensure that the information that the state and territory police need to identify those in the community who may be involved in inappropriate behaviour or have committed a crime can be given to them—and to enable the minister to then determine whether or not the determination should be revoked. The measure assists the department in managing the community detention program and, as I said, mitigates the risks associated with the exercise of the intervention power.


In relation to the final schedule that Senator Hanson-Young is seeking to disallow, the fifth measure relates to the English language criteria for the subclass 457 visa program. Despite, again, the statements made by Senator Hanson-Young—which are completely, totally and utterly factually incorrect—I confirm for the chamber that the amendments did not alter the English language requirements that must be demonstrated by a subclass 457 visa applicant. I will just say that again: the amendments did not alter the English language requirements that must be demonstrated by a subclass 457 visa applicant. Rather, what the amendments did do—these are the facts—was move the English language requirements for the subclass 457 visas from the body of the regulations into a legislative instrument made by the minister. Again I confirm that the actual English language requirements to be met by subclass 457 visa applicants were not changed by this measure. The amendments simply moved the English language requirements for the subclass 457 visa applicants from the migration regulations to a legislative instrument made by the minister. If this measure is disallowed, the subclass 457 program will revert to a less adaptable framework for the English language requirements for at least six months. 


As I have stated, there are five separate schedules that Senator Hanson-Young is seeking to disallow through this disallowance motion. In relation to the five schedules, everything that Senator Hanson-Young said to support the disallowance motion is factually incorrect. I make the point again: it is very easy to come into this chamber and give a speech based on sentiment. On this side of the chamber, however, we are the government. We have to deal in fact. We need to ensure that, at all times, we maintain consistency in Australia's migration program and that we maintain the integrity of Australia's migration program 


The only thing that a successful disallowance motion will do today is weaken Australia's immigration policy. We were elected on the basis of restoring integrity and security to Australia's borders, and that is exactly what this government are doing. I would ask the Senate not to support the Greens' disallowance motion.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2014-07-17,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (14:10):  I appreciate that senators are extremely keen to meet their flight commitments, and that will prevent me from talking at great length about the detail of the assertions that have been made by the minister. I think I should just take this opportunity to inform the Senate that the Labor Party will be supporting this disallowance, and we do so because of our deep concern regarding the potential consequences of schedule 2 regarding the Global Special Humanitarian subclass 202 visas for applicants proposed by minors. We are very concerned that the compelling reasons that are provided within the existing regulations do set out quite stringent conditions. We believe that they are satisfactory to meet the circumstances to the country and that various advice to government has suggested that it is appropriate that those criteria remain in place and that these regulations therefore are not necessary.


I am particularly concerned when the minister, in reference to changes to the English language requirements for 457 visas, talked about the need for adaptability for the 457 visa group. It really does disturb me when the minister speaks in those terms—that is, if this is disallowed then it will not be as adaptable. I think we understand what the code is for that provision. I nonetheless remain very concerned about ensuring that the special humanitarian visa program does have integrity and is able to be used to secure a proper humanitarian approach, particularly when it comes to treatment of minors.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2014-07-17,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (14:12):  As there are no other speakers, I will briefly sum up the debate. I want to place on record that while it may be inconvenient for the government of the day to hear the sentiment—that is, the reality—of what their laws, their regulations mean to real people, that is indeed what we need to be considering in this place. We have a government that want to be as cruel and as mean and as nasty as possible to people just because of how those people arrived. The ridiculous thing, the dangerous thing, the awful thing about this regulation is that this is inflicting pain on people who are already here, children who have already arrived, and yet the government continue to use whatever stick they can find to keep beating up on refugees who are here in the Australian community already as a symbol of their get tough on boats policy.


These children already exist, they are in Australia. They have been given refugee status because we know they are refugees. They have fled war, they have had to run away from torture and brutality, and we are effectively condemning them to be separated from their families for the rest of their lives. I have no shame talking about the sentiment and the real impact on the lives of individuals that this government wants to inflict more pain and suffering on, just because it suits its get tough, get mean approach on refugees. This is from a government that blows not just the dog whistle but the foghorn every time, every single time, things get tough in this place. Today it had its mining tax repeal bill thrown out, and so what does it bring on? It brings on a debate on a disallowance motion on refugees and asylum seekers.


This government continues to hide behind its budget failures and its inability to negotiate and to get proper outcomes in this place. Every time it gets tough, we see Scott Morrison, the minister for immigration, on our TV screens saying, 'Hang on a minute. Remember all those people we're at war with on the seas—the refugees? Remember them? We're stopping them.' It is appalling abuse not just of the intelligence of the Australian people but of the lives of the individuals that this government continues to play with.


There is a boat out on the Indian Ocean holding 153 asylum seekers and the government do not want to talk about it, but they are more than happy to stand up in this place and beat up on asylum seeker children—refugees who are already here. The government continue to use refugees as their whipping boy. When the day is tough, they cannot get their own legislation and their own budget through this place, and they cannot negotiate with the crossbench, they start beating up on refugees to save their own face and their own skin. It is an appalling abuse of people's rights and dignity and the standards by which our parliament should be looking after the most vulnerable—standing up for the rule of law; standing up for basic compassion towards people who have committed no crime.


These are kids—kids who have had to flee war, torture and persecution. Many of them are orphaned already. Many of them only have one sibling left, and, in order to look tough, to play the nasty, fear-mongering, anti-refugee race card and to push everything else off the newspaper headlines, this government uses those children. That is what this regulation is about and that is why it should be disallowed.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the motion moved by Senator Hanson-Young to disallow Migration Amendment (2014 Measures No.1) Regulation be agreed to.
