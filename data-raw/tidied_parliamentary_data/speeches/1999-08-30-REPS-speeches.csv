"Somlyay, Alex, MP",LP,1999-08-30,"—I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the meeting of the Asia-Pacific Group of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia from 26 to 31 July 1999, and seek leave to make a short statement in connection with the report.
Leave granted.
—Mr Speaker, from 26 to 31 July I attended, on your behalf, the first regional meeting of the Asia-Pacific Group of the Inter-Parliamentary Union held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. The meeting was convened under the auspices of the IPU so that parliamentarians in our region could discuss and debate matters of mutual interest and also, as a geopolitical group, prepare for the conference to be held later in Berlin. Fifteen countries in the region were represented at this meeting. Australia and other delegations presented country reports as part of a general debate on the political, social and economic situation in the Asia-Pacific region. I have included these as an appendix to my report and, as they provide a comprehensive, current and insightful analysis of the Asian financial crisis and other major issues within the region, I commend them to honourable members.
The agenda for the meeting addressed matters of real substance, and I was particularly pleased that much of the discussion centred on the impact and implications of the Asian financial crisis. It was encouraging to hear delegates from the region reporting that the adverse impact of the Asian economic crisis is abating and signs of sustainable recovery are emerging. It was particularly pleasing to detect once again an optimism and a confidence in the Asian economies. However, as one delegate eloquently observed, it 
 is too early for all of us from the Asia-Pacific region to toast with champagne and celebrate our successes. There are reasons for us to temper our optimism. It was also heartening to hear from several parliamentarians in the region who recognise that economies in the region must adopt policies which strengthen financial systems, restore trade finance, accelerate corporate sector restructuring and restore investor confidence and a return of capital flows. This can be achieved by the introduction of sound financial systems, corporate governance and approved accounting, transparency and disclosure standards. It was recognised that the recovery must also be accompanied by initiatives that address the social impacts of the crisis.
The agenda for the meeting also focused on regional security issues, with all delegates expressing considerable concern that the situations in India and Pakistan and on the Korean peninsular remain tense. Following discussions and debate, the meeting constituted a drafting committee to prepare a final communique for ratification by all delegates. I had the honour, Mr Speaker, of being elected to chair that drafting committee and, after considering several important but sometimes contentious and conflicting proposals, agreement was reached on the final draft. This draft, with two amendments, was adopted by the plenary session and was ratified by all delegates at the signing ceremony on the last day of the meeting. The joint communique is also reproduced in full in my report.
I can assure the House that the meeting of the Asia-Pacific Group of the IPU in Ulaanbaatar was highly successful as it stimulated a productive dialogue between delegations from the region and forged important networks within the group that will be reinforced at the IPU conference in Berlin and beyond. The meeting provided a new impetus to further strengthen friendly relations and co-operation between member parliaments. The Asia-Pacific Group is an important forum for Australia within the IPU, and it is one that I personally want to strengthen and develop. Australia's participation at this conference was also very important as it confirmed our interest in and commitment to the Asia-Pacific 
 region to the group and the IPU. I commend this report to the House.",REPS,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,<title>Asia-Pacific Group</title>,Delegation Reports,0,1
"Lieberman, Lou, MP",LP,1999-08-30,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, I present the committee's report entitled, Unlocking the future: the report of the inquiry into the Reeves review of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 , together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—It gives me great pleasure to table this report of the committee's review of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. I hope that our report will assist Australians living in the Northern Territory to work together, as it puts forward practical recommendations which will lead to practical results that address the profound economic and social disadvantages experienced by many indigenous Australians.
When it was enacted in 1976, the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act represented a milestone in the recognition of Aboriginal rights to land. Twenty-five years later the act remains central and relevant to the lives of Aboriginal people. The act has been reviewed several times and minor amendments have been made over the years. Most recently, it was reviewed by John Reeves QC—the recommendations of his report, now known as the Reeves report, are the subject of this committee's report.
The Reeves report was referred to the committee in December last by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Senator the Hon. John Herron, whom I commend for his wisdom and insight in referring to the committee this report before he makes decisions and recommendations to his government. The minister asked the committee to seek the views of people who have an interest in the possible implications of the Reeves report. The Reeves report makes far- 
reaching and, at times, controversial recommendations. For this reason, the committee undertook to visit as many regional and remote communities as it could. In this way, members listened and talked with people, especially those most affected by the act, the Aboriginal people in the Territory.
When reviewing the written and oral evidence before it, the committee focused its deliberations by firstly agreeing to core values and principles. The first of these is that Aboriginal rights to their land granted under the land rights act should be preserved. The second core principle is that Aboriginal people should have the same rights, opportunities and responsibilities as other Australian landowners. They should be given as much autonomy as possible to run their own affairs and be free to associate and organise in ways they see fit. The third principle is that the committee should be attempting to foster constructive partnerships between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people, between the Northern Territory government, land councils, the mining industry and others.
The committee wished to ensure that the land rights act remain as flexible as possible. The act needs to meet changing circumstances as the focus changes from land claims to land management. In short, the act needs to facilitate rather than determine outcomes. Finally, and most importantly, this committee seeks to ensure that Aboriginal people are involved in decisions to amend the act. This principle is reflected in our first core recommendation. The committee also describes a process for its recommendations to be considered by Aboriginal people. It is after all their act, their land and their future.
The involvement of Aboriginal people in a number of project teams to consider the committee's recommendations represents a new dynamic. The committee trusts that it will give Aboriginal people greater ownership of the act and a greater sense that they control their own destinies. The committee's other recommendations cover the issues addressed by the Reeves report. The committee recommends that the structure of the land councils be improved so that appropriate land council powers can be delegated to local regional 
 groups of Aboriginal people. The committee also seeks changes to make it easier for new land councils to be established or even for Aboriginal people to do without the services of a land council altogether, if that is their wish.
Members also considered the structure of the Aboriginals Benefit Reserve and the distribution of royalty money to Aboriginal groups. Members spent considerable time debating whether land council budgets should continue to be guaranteed a fixed percentage of royalty equivalent income. Members also considered the most appropriate ways for royalties to be distributed in areas affected by mining. Government and non-government members came to different conclusions on these important issues. However, all members of the committee agreed that there needs to be greater accountability for the expenditure of royalties and that both sets of proposals should be put to Aboriginal people through a project team. The Commonwealth Grants Commission could also be asked to assist to develop systems to ensure strong independent advice is available to achieve an equitable distribution of royalty equivalents.
The committee also reviewed the mining provisions of the land rights act. The committee heard overwhelming evidence that the act as it stands restricts exploration and mining on Aboriginal land. The committee recommends that the act be amended so that agreements for exploration and mining between Aboriginals and mining companies be free of restrictions. There are two provisos to this recommendation. The first is that the rights of traditional owners to withhold consent for exploration remain as they are in the act today. The second is that any agreements be subject to general commercial law.
The Reeves report recommended that the permit system in operation on Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory be replaced with a strengthened Northern Territory Trespass Act. The committee accepts that Aboriginal people want the permit system to remain. However, the committee makes a number of recommendations to free up the process for granting permits and to encourage the use of specific area access agreements.
The committee also reviewed a number of recommendations in the Reeves report that are strictly beyond the committee's terms of reference, but we commented on the role of the Aboriginal Land Commissioner and made recommendations to ensure that the interests of the broader community are always taken into account when land claims for the beds and banks of rivers are being examined.
I am confident that the committee's recommendations will lead to Aboriginal people managing their own land at a local level and making decisions from the bottom up, targeting the expenditure of mining royalty equivalent money in a transparent and fully accountable way that is subject to performance measures so that Aboriginal people derive the full benefit from their land, and a reduction in welfare dependency, promotion of mutual responsibility, trust and enduring partnerships between all people in the Northern Territory and governments.
It remains for me to thank the people who have helped the committee in the report and inquiry. Firstly, I thank my colleagues on the committee—Deputy Chair Harry Quick, Trish Draper, Barry Haase, Kelly Hoare, Bob Katter, Jim Lloyd, Daryl Melham, Warren Snowdon and Barry Wakelin. I would also like to thank our wonderful secretariat staff including James Catchpole, Sara Cousins, Jennifer Cochran and Claressa Surtees. The committee also relied on Hansard and Sound and Vision for their technical support in very difficult and challenging conditions in the outback—Karin Oldfield, Brian Lindell and Alan Savage, thank you. I would also like to thank my electorate secretary, Sandy Dalton, for her assistance.
Of course, my thanks are extended to the many individuals and organisations, Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal, who forwarded submissions and assisted the committee in the inquiry. I particularly thank the land councils, the Northern Territory government, ATSIC, the Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research and the many hundreds of Northern Territory people, Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal, who treated me with such courtesy and gave so much help to the committee.
The title of this committee's report is Unlocking the future. The title is apt as the committee hopes that its efforts will unlock a better future for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people alike in the Northern Territory.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs Committee</title>,Committees,1,1
"Melham, Daryl, MP",ALP,1999-08-30,"—I speak here today proud to have taken part in this committee report, Unlocking the future: the report of the inquiry into the Reeves review of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 . The task of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs was to go out into the Northern Territory and find out what Aboriginal people, as well as others with an interest in the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, thought about the recommendations of the Reeves report and how it related to the act. The committee has travelled the length and breadth of the Northern Territory to isolated communities over several months. We flew in Caribou aircraft, which I can tell you was a real joy, and in light aircraft from the desert communities in the centre to the Tiwi Islands in the Arafura Sea. This was no easy task.
The committee consists of members from across the continent and whose views vary across the political spectrum. The Aboriginal land rights act is no simple piece of legislation to master. It is complex and it is, and has been, the source of much heated debate and political division. Views held are very passionate. Further, the committee had to quickly come to terms with a world view of a culture with which it had had little experience. The Aboriginal land rights act is not just a piece of white man's law; it is essentially based on Aboriginal people's view of the world, particularly their laws regarding traditional land. For this reason too the committee's task was not a simple one.
During the hearings and during the drafting of the report, members of the committee had differences of opinion. Yet, while we approached the consideration of the report from these different views, we listened to one another, we respected one another's opinions and we were ultimately able to reach a consensus. That is why I am proud to say that 
 this committee has been able to table a unanimous report. This report is testimony to the patience and perseverance of the members of the committee, and I congratulate and thank them for it. Certainly, there are sections in the report that reflect the disparate views, specifically regarding the Aboriginals Benefit Reserve and distribution of royalties, and parts of the report are the result of give and take from both government and Labor members.
I congratulate the chairman in that he has been able to accommodate those disparate views and that we have been able to produce a single, unanimous report. The Reeves review was a result of a political game on the part of the former Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Shane Stone, in cahoots with the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. Shane Stone and his government wanted to smash the land councils and emasculate the land rights act for their own reasons, and the Reeves review was their method of doing it.
However, the vehicle was flawed and, while there is a need for some finetuning to the act, the committee was overwhelmed by the message from the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory that there should be no changes to the act without their consent. The major recommendations of the Reeves review have been rejected. The Reeves review has cost Aboriginal people and the nation more than $1.3 million, and the cost to the taxpayer of this committee has run into hundreds of thousands of dollars more. It has taken up a lot of people's time and emotions have run high.
Once again—and how many times has this happened now—Aboriginal people have been left wondering what us white fellas in Canberra are going to do with the land rights act, an act which, after all, is meant to reflect a permanent state of Aboriginal law. It is a credit to the committee that it has rejected the easy political option and has gone instead for the overwhelming message it has received from the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory.
This report shows that there can be a way forward. The report shows that the committee 
 went out and sought people's views, that it listened and that it honestly attempted to reflect those views in this document. If the committee can do this, then why cannot the Prime Minister sit down and talk constructively over the various issues that have been raised here? I call on the government to respond positively to the recommendations of this groundbreaking report. The government has an obligation to do so. In closing, I would like to thank especially James, Sara, Jenny and Claressa and also the Hansard staff who have done a magnificent job under most difficult circumstances. I commend the report to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs Committee</title>,Committees,1,1
"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,1999-08-30,"—The report before the House of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs is an important and definitive document in the struggle by indigenous Australians for justice and the recognition of their rights to land. The report is fundamental because it recognises and recommends that there should be no changes to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act unless they are negotiated with and agreed to by Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory, particularly traditional Aboriginal owners. They must give their informed consent.
This recommendation is unprecedented and is an acknowledgment that it is inappropriate and improper for non-indigenous Australians, and especially governments, to make decisions about Aboriginal land without the informed consent of the traditional Aboriginal owners of that land. Importantly, there is in the committee a unanimity of view about this first recommendation, which is the foundation and guiding principle of the report. It has precedence over and governs all other recommendations in the report. In making this guiding recommendation, the report rejects all of the central recommendations of the Reeves review.
It is clear from the submissions received and the evidence taken by the committee that there is little support from any quarter for the recommendations of Mr Reeves. On the contrary, the overwhelming fact is that, among Aboriginal people in the Northern 
 Territory, the Reeves report and its recommendations are regarded as having been fatally flawed and based on wrong-headed and naive assumptions. In reaching its conclusions and making its recommendations, the standing committee demonstrated the preparedness to seek out and listen to the views of Aboriginal Australians who have been and are the subjects and beneficiaries of the Aboriginal land rights act, an act which is about their rights and their land.
Submissions and evidence were given by others with an interest in the act and its operation, including the Northern Territory government. The land rights act is unique. It was and remains the benchmark for the Commonwealth in its recognition and acknowledgment of the rights of Aboriginal Australians to their land. It gives statutory recognition and protection to these rights.
The report before the House reinforces the central role that the land rights act has in this regard, as well as the functions and responsibilities that the Territory land councils have under the act to advance and safeguard the rights of Aboriginal traditional owners, the custodians of their people's lands. The report rejects the proposal in Reeves for the breaking up of the territory land councils. The report makes many recommendations and it will be clear to readers of it that there are divergent views within the committee over some important sections of the report dealing with mining royalties and the Aboriginals Benefit Reserve.
The Labor members of the committee are strongly of the view that their options, clearly identified within the report, offer the most desirable and workable way ahead in dealing with these matters. However, regardless of which options are preferred, the report demands that all of its recommendations should be subject to the basic principle of recommendation 1—that of informed consent.
The message to the parliament and government from this report is clear. The way ahead requires dialogue, consultation and negotiation between governments and indigenous Australians. There must be a new attempt at building a partnership between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. This report and its 
 recommendations challenge the government to adopt a new and radically different approach to dealing with indigenous Australians.
It is clear from the report that the recognition of the rights, customs and beliefs of indigenous Australians is fundamental to our maturity as a nation and that they should not be subject to the tyranny of the majority as a matter of fiat without negotiation and without agreement. Nor should they be subjugated by those who seek to satiate their own philosophical, ideological, political or economic interest and desires at the expense of the rights and interests of indigenous people. The report provides a challenge to the Prime Minister and the government that will test their bona fides in relation to their commitment to reconciliation and the need for the nation to come properly to terms with the rights and interests of its indigenous peoples.
In conclusion, I would like to acknowledge and thank those many Territorians who provided submissions and gave evidence with such patience and good grace. I also want to acknowledge the chairman, Lou Lieberman, and our colleagues on the committee for their companionship, good humour and willingness to listen and learn. Finally, I would like to especially thank James, Sara, Jenny and Claressa for their diligence and professionalism and their humour. I also thank the Hansard staff, who did a magnificent job in very trying circumstances. As well, of course, the RAAF crews were great hosts and are very good people. I commend the report to the House.

The report provides a challenge to the Prime Minister and the government that will test their bona fides in relation to their commitment to reconciliation and the need for the nation to come properly to terms with the rights and interests of its indigenous peoples.
In conclusion, I would like to acknowledge and thank those many Territorians who provided submissions and gave evidence with such patience and good grace. I also want to acknowledge the chairman, Lou Lieberman, and our colleagues on the committee for their companionship, good humour and willingness to listen and learn. Finally, I would like to especially thank James, Sara, Jenny and Claressa for their diligence and professionalism and their humour. I also thank the Hansard staff, who did a magnificent job in very trying circumstances. As well, of course, the RAAF crews were great hosts and are very good people. I commend the report to the House.

"Kerr, Duncan, MP",ALP,1999-08-30,"—The objective of the Law Enforcement Committee Bill 1999  is to establish a single parliamentary joint committee on Commonwealth law enforcement. Currently, the parliament has one joint committee on the National Crime Authority and one joint committee on the Australian Security Intelligence Organization. This bill proposes the establishment of a single committee to exercise scrutiny across the whole ambit of Commonwealth law enforcement, including the Australian Federal Police, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Australian Customs Service, the National Crime Authority, the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission and other Commonwealth agen 
 cies having a law enforcement function which exist or may be established.
Serious threats to Australian society now, and increasingly so in the future, include more than threats to our national security from other nation states. They include threats to the stability of our society and its institutions from those who pursue criminal objectives for profit. People smuggling, prostitution, the international drug trade and the illegal use of the intellectual property of others—such as pirate copies of music and film—are becoming the work of increasingly sophisticated and well-organised networks. These networks use our financial system to launder their illegal profits. They are hijacking the means of our economic growth—increased international trade, faster transport and rapid improvement in technology—to serve their purposes and increase their international presence. They profit at the expense of others—at the expense of vulnerable Australians or by duping other nationals with the false promise of a legal passage to our shores.
To respond, Australia needs to more than match the substantial efforts of these organisations. To be effective in combating crime, Australia must have a sophisticated, cooperative, integrated, national and international approach. To be effective, law enforcement needs to know today what will happen tomorrow. This sophisticated, cooperative, integrated, national and international approach needs to be mirrored in our parliamentary process. Currently, it is not. What passes for debate on law and order is often short term, knee jerk, populist and uninformed. The previous Labor government made some progress to address a deficiency in this area. The Office of Strategic Crime Assessment was intended to provide an `over the horizon' annual report on crime threat assessment, but the demise of public annual strategic reporting from OSCA limited that initiative. The proposed parliamentary joint committee will be tasked to oversight all law enforcement agencies. It will inform the national parliament and build an extensive store of knowledge. It will play a vital role in the development of integrated tactical and planning strategies and processes.
I do not want this bill to become just an excuse for another political contest. On issues to protect all Australians from the scourge of organised crime, there ought to be no room for claims for greater patriotism or resort to cheap politics. The parliament and the government must develop a model which allows for national oversight, a model which enables and provides the basis for good strategic planning. We must develop a mechanism to regularly receive and assess `over the horizon' crime threat intelligence to inform the process of decision making, and we need parliamentary scrutiny of all law enforcement agencies, not just the National Crime Authority. When we deal with defence issues we recognise the importance of long-term strategic planning. It is perverse that the parliament has no parliamentary process to oversight law enforcement when it has so many parliamentary committees tasked with significant national responsibilities.
I believe that there is also a shared view of the magnitude and changing nature of the threat to our society from crime. Labor envisages that this committee will demonstrate that the national parliament accepts its responsibility to play a lead and effective role in the fight against crime. A single committee with a good understanding of the totality of our law enforcement needs will ensure that no political party is caught up in just short-term political debate about where funding ought to be directed. It will also strengthen the oversight role of the parliament and help guard against improper use of power by any Commonwealth law enforcement agency. Parliamentarians from all political persuasions know their work on such committees confirms that the things that bind us together are much bigger than our differences. I commend the bill to the House.

"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,1999-08-30,"—I present the Fair Prices and Better Access for All (Petroleum) Bill 1999 . The bill that I am introducing into the parliament today proposes to do what the government promised to do but failed to do—that is, bring petrol prices down and reduce the outrageous gap separating city and country fuel prices. It will do so for the first time by giving service station operators the opportunity to shop around for their fuel. For too long, the major oil company oligopoly has controlled and manipulated petrol prices all the way from the refinery to the bowser. With the arrival of Woolworths and other independents, we have now seen the benefits of new competition at the retail level. It is now time to introduce that same level of competition at the wholesale level.
If adopted by the parliament, the bill that I am introducing today will do just that. It will do so by allowing resellers who are covered by the yet to be finalised Oilcode to secure up to 50 per cent of their fuel supplies from parties other than their principal branded supplier. In other words, if a Caltex franchisee in Cessnock, Longreach or Dubbo is approached by Caltex and offered a price for his fuel, for any given week he will have the ability to go to Shell, Mobil or BP seeking a more profitable arrangement, which in turn can be passed on to consumers.
The bill will deliver this right and protect resellers who choose to exercise it. It will deliver the first point by making all future contracts between those covered by the Oilcode subject to section 47 of the Trade Practices Act. It will protect resellers from retribution from oil majors by providing ACCC enforcement. The recent spate of petrol price rises has confirmed in the minds of motorists what they already knew—that is, that the government's so-called 1998 petroleum industry reforms have been a failure. Rather than seeking to curtail the ability of the major oil companies to manipulate prices, the government now wants to enhance their 
 power by repealing the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act 1980. This act was a Fraser government initiative designed to address the vertical nature of the industry by restricting the number of service stations the oil majors may directly operate. But now the Howard government wants to remove that barrier. It wants to give the oil majors the absolute power to manipulate prices and take their economic rents wherever and whenever they can. That, of course, will be usually in rural and regional Australia.
So at a time when we should be looking to curtail the control that the major oil companies have over retail prices, the Howard government wants to strengthen that power. The bill I am introducing today does the opposite. If supported by the parliament, the bill will put an end to the very cosy arrangements enshrined in contractual agreements which give the oil companies exclusive supply rights to resellers. Despite what Senator Minchin, the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, the minister responsible, says, this is not a new idea. In fact, the then Trade Practices Commission was recommending the course of action that I am following today back in 1988. Indeed, my private member's bill embraces the principles which have been contained within Western Australian and Victorian state law since the early 1980s. Unfortunately, however, service station operators in those states have not been able to take advantage of the ability to shop around for their fuel offered by the state acts because the oil majors have been very quick to challenge such behaviour as constituting passing off.
The Fair Prices and Better Access for All (Petroleum) Bill will deny the major oil companies the ability to entrench anticompetitive practices on those grounds. It builds on the very good work the member for Werriwa commenced in the last parliament when he was shadow minister for competition policy. In a desperate and unashamed attempt to protect the oil majors, Minister Minchin has derided my proposal by comparing my plan to allow petrol franchisees to shop around for their fuel with allowing McDonald's to sell Kentucky Fried Chicken. 
 The things we say when we lack substantive arguments! Unlike the products sold by those fast-food chains, petrol is a homogenous product. The fuel you buy at a Caltex service station is exactly the same as the fuel you buy at a BP or Shell service station. Senator Minchin has also had a bit to say about the spectre of compensation matters arising out of my bill. My bill is prospective, in contrast to the regulations that the minister currently has before the parliament which do indeed offend the Constitution and in themselves could give rise to compensation matters.
I am happy to take a bipartisan approach to petrol issues, particularly in regard to rural Australia, and I invite the government to support the principles of my bill. If the government is not happy to give carriage to my bill, I am happy for it to pick up those principles and embrace them within one of its own bills which we will be happy to support.

"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,1999-08-30,"—I move:
That the House:
(1)	 welcomes the report entitled ""Final report of the Health and Medical Research Strategic Review Committee: The virtuous cycle—Working together for health and medical research"" and its recommendations for implementation;
(2)	 notes the important link between Australia's health and medical research capability and the delivery of a cost-effective and equitable health care system;
(3)	 recognises the excellent work and the high level of commitment among those working in the medical research field; 

(4)	 applauds the Federal Government's specific commitment to increasing annual funding for health and medical research, through the National Health and Medical Research Council, by more than doubling funding of base research with an investment of a further $614m over the next six years; and
(5)	 urges the Federal Government to pursue reforms proposed in the final report.
The destination of the scientific journey of research can have a profound impact on our lives. The individual scientist cares most deeply about the journey itself. The public cares about the answers, the miracles, the cures. But at the heart of it a country's scientific policy of itself can, at least by implication, change the entire understanding of health or disease and the limits of the human life span.
On budget night this year, the Treasurer made the dramatic announcement of a doubling of base funding for the National Health and Medical Research Council over a six-year period so that base research funding would increase from $165 million in 1998-99 to more than $350 million in 2004-05. The total investment in new money for that period will be $614 million, bringing to around $1.6 billion the total invested in NHMRC funded research. This was an unprecedented announcement. No previous Australian government has ever given health and medical research such a high priority.
This announcement of a massive investment in health and medical research sends a clear and positive message not only to the community at large but particularly to our health and medical researchers and scientists. That message is that Australia will be focusing on health and medical research as a priority as we enter the 21st century. It says that we do recognise the proud tradition of health and medical research in this country. It says that we must pay tribute to our researchers and scientists who have received international recognition for their work. It says that we recognise that Australia is facing horrendous health care costs and that we need research to determine the most cost-effective and equitable approaches for prevention and treatment. To the undisguised excitement of many in the health and medical research industry, this 
 announcement says that Australia wants to be at the forefront of health and medical research so that we can establish and capture the benefits of a biotechnology industry in this country. This is the underlying message in the budget announcement.
This significant boost in funding has flowed, in part, from the recommendations of the Wills report. This is the most comprehensive report ever undertaken into medical research, and it is this report that is the subject of this motion before the House. The report of the Health and Medical Research Strategic Review Committee was formally presented to the government last April. The committee was commissioned by the Minister for Health and Aged Care 12 months earlier, in March 1998. Its terms of reference included a review of the future role of health and medical research up to the year 2010. In particular, the review was to identify the future likely developments in health and medical research in Australia, taking into account Australia's need to maintain a broadly based research capacity capable of meeting the evolving needs of the health system and ensuring Australia's capacity to contribute to and draw from international research.	It is worth noting that, with 0.3 per cent of the world's population, Australia produces about 2.5 per cent of the world's health and medical research output.
The committee was chaired by Mr Peter Wills and it produced a concise report which recommended a series of strategies for improving Australia's health and medical research work force and ensuring a continuing research capacity in Australia which is matched to need. The report confirmed yet again the clear link between our health and medical research capability and the delivery of cost-effective and equitable health care.
The recommendations and proposed actions in the Wills report, if implemented, will allow Australians to share in the following benefits: an internationally competitive biotechnology-biomedical-pharmaceutical industry; improved health care and the prospect of disease prevention; a more cost-effective health budget in the future; and increased knowledge based job opportunities—an estimated increase of 
 10,000 to 15,000 jobs in five years in a sector that currently has 12,000. The Minister for Health and Aged Care has demonstrated his enthusiasm for the recommendations of the Wills report and the government has embraced a number of important recommendations. But there are more to be considered. We must not stand still.
The government has allocated an additional $20 million over two years to a new capital grants initiative to bolster the high calibre of existing Australian independent health and medical research institutes. As well, the government has funded the development of an integrated biotechnology strategy to ensure that Australia can create and maximise new opportunities in the emerging field. Funding of around $7.6 million over two years will support the development of the national regulatory system through a gene technology office.
The Wills report has been highly commended in many circles and positively celebrated in many others. We must not lose the momentum that has built up, particularly since the budget announcement. We must continue to review and assess the recommendations and pursue the reforms so that these issues are kept high on the national agenda.
Without wishing to give priority to any one particular recommendation over another, I mention the Wills recommendations relating to the NHMRC, our peak funding and advisory body. Over the years, the organisation has faced significant challenges and its shortcomings have been highlighted over time. Currently the council has no full-time chief executive officer. The chair is notionally a two-day-a-week position, while the chairs of the principal committees are notionally one-day-a-week appointments. It would be impossible for the challenges and recommendations for change outlined in the Wills report to be achieved within the capacity of the current organisational arrangements.
  The Wills report recommends a high profile, eminent person be appointed full-time chief executive officer. It is envisaged that this would not only raise the NHMRC profile within government, the research community and wider community but also drive change 
 in the organisation. Reading the report, it is clear that a great deal of faith is being placed in the appointment of a full-time CEO. I suggest that it is not misplaced in this instance.
It is fair to say in general in public life the appointment of one individual to a particular position does not often make a huge difference. However, the appointment of the right individual to this position at this moment could turn out to be crucial—a historic match of person and opportunity. It may well turn out to be one of the more important legacies of this government.
That has certainly been the experience in the United States, with the appointment of Dr Harold Varmus as Director of the National Institute of Health six years ago. Dr Varmus had neither political nor administrative experience. He had spent the previous 20 years as an increasingly celebrated medical researcher, sharing the 1989 Nobel Prize for his findings on cancer-causing genes. Under the stewardship of Dr Varmus, the NIH has become one of the rare government institutions that politicians of both parties actively praise. Since his appointment as director, the NIH budget has grown more substantially than any other category of federal spending. Last February, when the Clinton administration requested only a token increase for the NIH for the year ahead, members of Congress from both parties criticised the request as short-sighted.
Dr Varmus extols a commitment to basic science, yet knows that scientists who begin this kind of work can never be sure where it will lead or how important their work will turn out to be. Often the results that prove most valuable are not the ones the scientists expected to discover. Dr Varmus is reportedly keenly aware that a governmental commitment to invest ever larger amounts of money in such unplannable, long-term research violates the basic principles of politics. But he has argued relentlessly for its importance in a stream of speeches, appearances at congressional hearings and informal meetings with politicians—and many senators and members now express the concept as if it were their own.  
If our NHMRC is suffering from a lack of identification and a need for rejuvenation, then we must act quickly to appoint a full-time director in order to give the NHMRC the focus, the vision, the optimism and the leadership that will be required for us to fulfil our objectives. If we are to ensure that Australia plays a leading part in the global advances in the research and technology that have the capacity to revolutionise our health care and, in doing so, revolutionise our lives, we must commit to the ongoing implementation of the recommendations contained in this significant report. It is my hope that, in years to come, we will be able to look back on the Wills report and recognise it as one of the stars by which we charted our course.

"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,1999-08-30,"—I speak today largely in support of the motion moved by the member for Curtin. However, I must make some comments in response to the motion and offer some additional thoughts about how research funding could also be employed. The Final Report of the Health and Medical Research Strategic Review Committee: The virtuous cycle—Working together for health and medical research  is a report of major importance for the future health of the Australian community. In an era where approximately $40 billion is spent each year on health and where the costs are rising, the recommendations in the report should be closely noted. This is partially because the outlook of health and medical research lies in greater government investment.
I am particularly pleased to speak on this motion because it provides me with an opportunity to pay tribute to the Australian medical researchers who, over the past 50 years, have done a tremendous job and have made significant breakthroughs in the areas of penicillin, AIDS testing, melanoma, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and many other diseases. Australian researchers have accomplished this under the pressures of low funding, the difficulties of maintaining a skilled and motivated work force given the low levels of salary and job 
 insecurity, and a lack of community understanding of the returns of government investment in health and medical research. Australian researchers have managed to do this despite the extremely low investment that governments have placed in medical research.
The subject report tells us Australia is spending only $28 per head compared with an average of around $66 per head in OECD countries and around $80 per capita in Japan and the USA. Despite the welcomed funding of $614 million over six years for the scientific community, it is obvious there is a severe lack of funding available. Dr Wooldridge counts us among only eight countries capable of a high level of medical research, but we spend the least. This injection of funds is welcome, but it will not close this gap to any great degree.
I remind the members of this House of the Howard government's agenda of budgetary cuts against universities since 1996. These cuts, totalling around $840 million, have cut right to the heart of researchers. The percentage of Australia's gross domestic product spent on research of all kinds has shrunk since the election of this government from 0.75 per cent to 0.63 per cent. This is not good.
Research in teaching hospitals is critical to understand how to treat complex medical conditions. As funding through the NHMRC has increased over time, funds from state governments have dried up for research in public hospitals. When a hospital is privatised, its new owners have no interest in subsidising research, and any activity without a specific Commonwealth grant withers on the vine.
The NHMRC additional grant is good, but not enough. Australia needs money for research other than medicine—important as this may be.
If we do not enhance consumer awareness and value of research in the public mind, and particularly our youth, then where is the new knowledge that will ensure best practice? Australian people do not seem to understand the value of research.
One might ask: how many university courses contain a component of research education at the undergraduate level? For example, my sister, Associate Professor Anne Powell, began her research early in her academic career with the support of a `seed grant' of $2,500 from the University of Western Sydney Nepean that enabled her to engage in a rigorous project in collaboration with two senior academics at Sydney University. This money and support gave her a first chance at research. The outcome of her findings was ultimately distributed to the nursing and education professions. She then built on that experience to a level of research rigour that led to doctoral status. The conclusion that can be drawn from my sister's experience is that, with a relatively small amount of financial support together with the expertise of experienced researchers, a beginning researcher can be given a flying start.
My senior electorate officer, Robert Balzola, is currently completing his Master of Laws in Environmental Law. Next year he embarks on his Doctorate of Philosophy by research. Mr Balzola has been advised that it is essential that he have completed a prescribed course in research methods. Training in research methods is by no means uniform throughout academic pursuits, generally being restricted to the natural sciences.
He offers two solutions: firstly, give students in tertiary institutions, regardless of subject area, the opportunity to undertake first-year course work in research methods, together with fundamental sciences such as logic, reason, philosophy, theology and other core studies that prepare their minds for the capacity to think, reason and research. This essentially is the `freshman' approach to academic research.

"Ellis, Annette, MP",ALP,1999-08-30,"—Today I want to talk about the Village Creek Primary School, Kambah, in my electorate. I was invited in September last year to the official ceremony of Greening Village Creek. It was a project that involved the renewal of part of their playground to create a modified urban forest and an outdoor classroom in the spirit of the Ngunnawal people, aiming for the area to resemble the environment of the days of the original inhabitants of the area, the Ngunnawal, and also, of course, to teach heritage and environment values to the school. The community spirit that day was quite remarkable, with many people, including me, having the honour of planting trees.
The good news is that the school has now won the North Ltd Education Award for this wonderful landcare project. To the principal, Judy Bull, and to the ACT Landcare coordinator, Tony Bray, and to everyone at Village Creek Primary School, I give my warmest congratulations on a truly wonderful project that has brought together the school community at all levels and is particularly teaching the children in an outdoor setting and in an environment that is, both environmentally and heritage-wise, a very good example.

That the House:
(1)	 notes the importance of the referendum on 6 November 1999 that goes to our identity as a nation and our system of government;
(2)	 notes that our stable democracy will continue and be strengthened if this referendum question were to be approved by the people of Australia;
(3)	 urges all Members of this House, whether they be monarchists, republicans or direct election supporters, to participate honestly in the referendum campaign; and
(4)	 deplores misleading and mischievous scare campaigns on such an important national issue, such as:
(a)	 the misrepresentation of the current powers of the Prime Minister to dismiss a Governor-General;
(b)	 suggesting that the new constitutional arrangements would be unworkable or undemocratic;
(c)	 understating the significance of the public nomination process;
(d)	 mischaracterising the non-partisan role of the Commonwealth Parliament in appointing the President; and
(e)	 the use of the preamble issue to distract from the question of whether Australia should have an Australian Head of State.
Everyone in this House is aware of the referendum which is due on 6 November to determine whether we will become a republic and to vote on the preamble for our Constitution. The fairly heated debate over the final questions to be put is now settled. The outcome might not be exactly as we wanted, but it is time now to focus on the substance of the proposal and, particularly, on the conduct of the campaign, which is where this motion is directed.
We are all aware that there is currently not a high level of awareness or interest in the community about our Constitution. It is largely not seen as a living or relevant document. Besides the fact that the Constitution is extremely technical and legalistic, I believe the community's lack of interest in it is partly because it often does not correspond with accepted views of ourselves, such as its current failure to reflect the degree of independence that we as a country all feel. This very issue is the one, of course, to which the referendum is directed.
 The motion that I am moving in the House today notes the importance of this referendum, which goes to our identity as a nation and our system of government. By its nature, this referendum is very significant. It does not go to such important, but narrow, issues as creating rights for a group of citizens or making a particular change to legislative powers; it is something that will affect all of us in our own experience of being Australian. It fundamentally affects what we mean and feel when we tell the world we are Australian. For me, it will be the freedom and pride with which I will swear allegiance to this nation and its people, not to the Queen, upon my re-election to parliament.
—Order! The honourable member will resume her seat. The member for Melbourne Ports should observe standing order 57 and give his colleague the courtesy of not walking between her and the chair.
—For me it will be the freedom and pride with which I say that I am Australian without attracting the bemused queries of overseas visitors about the role of the Queen or our ties with England; it will be the freedom and pride with which I will watch our own head of state meet on equal terms with the Queen of England, both strongly representing their own countries and meeting as true equals and strong friends; it will be talking to school children—maybe even my children—and teaching them that they and their friends are good enough to be our own head of state.
It will, of course, mean for others different things—it may be the focus on the smell of our gum trees or the biting salt of our seas or the heat of the Centre. For others it might be the pride in our institutions of government and the courts, structured mostly on the British model but working well for us in this country. Maybe it will mean the eclectic mix of cultures, tastes, smells and religions that crowd all of our city markets or even a lazy Boxing Day at the cricket. But, whatever being Australian means to each and every one of us, the way we vote on 6 November will have a fundamental impact on what we create for ourselves as a nation.
This motion notes that our stable democracy will continue and be strengthened if this referendum question were to be approved by the Australian people. We will have a workable, stable and secure system. The Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum was able to conclude this. What has given us our stability? Is it the Queen? No, the primary checks and balances in our system come from the Westminster system of responsible government combined with our bicameral system where the Senate is usually not controlled by the government of the day. A Prime Minister's action is always constrained by his dependence in the House on his party, the need for any changes to get through the Senate and, of course, regular elections—not a single one of these factors would be changed by the passing of this referendum.
Our natural inclination when change is proposed might be to assume or fear that the change will upset such stability, and it is easy to play to these fears. This motion urges all members of this House—whether they be monarchists, republicans or direct election supporters—to participate honestly in this referendum campaign and to decline from playing up these fears. As parliamentarians, whatever our view on this matter, our desire should be to have people truly express their views on the matter, not that people should be misled.
Whilst I am a republican and think that voting yes and becoming a republic gives me a chance to say why I believe it would be good for us, I do nevertheless respect the genuine monarchists who have a different view and want the opportunity to say that our ties with England and the Queen bind us in a way which positively defines our history and that they want to retain this link. It is not a view I share, but it is one that should be considered.
Unfortunately, those who genuinely hold such views and want to argue them on their merits seem to be few and far between. Perhaps today on this motion we will have the benefit of some real argument on the issue. Most of those on the opposing benches who campaigned for the monarchy—they have 
 been aptly named by my colleague the Member for Melbourne Ports as the `Queen Team'—refuse to mention the Queen, refuse to admit to their desire to continue with this institution and would rather like to focus on scare campaigns and boxing at shadow issues.
Similarly, I know that there are genuine direct electionists, although I am not one of them. It defies logic for me, however, that anyone truly desiring a republic with a directly elected head of state would argue against this proposal in favour of a hereditary monarch. Any true republican could not in good conscience campaign for the maintenance of an inherited, sexist, religiously discriminatory monarchy—and that of another country, to boot—instead of an Australian head of state.
And if we want to ensure the stability of our current system—as all of us do—we cannot take a further step to direct election without properly defining the powers, role and interaction with the Prime Minister of a new head of state in our political system. A directly elected President would have the moral and political authority of the nation. Our Westminster system and the interplay between the House of Representatives and the Senate would be forced to be fundamentally different. Direct election as a catchcry may seem attractive but, until we can be sure that such stability and protections remain, it should not and cannot be embraced. Our opportunity to take further steps down this path can come only if we vote yes to our republican status to start with.
This motion deplores the misleading and mischievous scare campaigns that can be conducted on this issue, in particular the misrepresentation by many of the current powers of the Prime Minister to dismiss a Governor-General. This proposal, if accepted, does not create a new power for the Prime Minister to dismiss a new President. The Prime Minister has the right to dismiss the Governor-General now. The Queen does not provide a safety check. The Prime Minister is not required to give reasons, nor is he required to give an explanation. The Governor-General himself does not provide a safety check. 
To measure the issue of appointment and dismissal of the President fairly, one must compare the proposal in the bill to the total lack of process and accountability now in appointing a Governor-General. The Prime Minister has that total power. The Queen does not play any role or exercise any independent discretion. She has always acted on advice and, if we were in any doubt, that was made expressly clear after the Australia Acts were introduced. People are largely unaware of this—because the power is not abused and has not been abused by any of our prime ministers—but it is not the Constitution but political reality that stops the abuse of this power.
In addition, the proposed section 62 of the amended Constitution will require even further accountability from the Prime Minister by requiring that a report be given to parliament within 30 days if the President is dismissed. This is not an unreasonable concentration of power in the hands of the Prime Minister, and it does not affect the current balance in our political system. We do live in a country where the Prime Minister and his government determine the priorities, policies and direction. It may be something that when we are in opposition we do not like to admit, but it is something that we should not be afraid of and it is a strength of our democracy.
This motion also notes that the new constitutional changes will not be unworkable or undemocratic and that campaigning on such issues is greatly misleading the public. Senator Minchin has said that the republicans have not made any attempt to explain what was wrong with the current constitutional arrangements or how their republican model would be an improvement on what was a tried and tested system. The true advantage of what is being proposed is the beauty of allowing us to have both. It is not changing what is tried and tested; it is, in fact, a very conservative model.
There is significance, however, in the symbolic change, and it does improve on some areas, in particular the public nomination process. This motion urges the House and the members in it not to understate the signifi 
 cance of the public nomination process. Even a cursory look at the proposal before us shows the strength of a public nomination process, a nominations committee, the appointment of that committee, a short list being provided to the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister choosing from that short list with the support of the Leader of the Opposition and approval being required by a two-thirds majority of a joint sitting of both houses. Compare this to what we have now. We have nothing. We have no system. We have a one-man team where the Prime Minister decides who should be our head of state. These provisions are not just in the presidential nominations bill or an ordinary act of parliament; the key provisions are in the Constitution itself, if the referendum is accepted. This dramatically improves the selection process. We must also look at the non-partisan role that the parliament plays. Requiring a two-thirds majority of a joint sitting of both houses of parliament is an extraordinary provision. We have only one other provision in our Constitution for a joint sitting: following a double dissolution. It is one way of ensuring that we truly will have a non-partisan political figure as our head of state.
The importance of this upcoming referendum is something that this House should note, and the motion urges that. Destruction and negativity are always an easy course for us to take, but it is not edifying, there is no leadership and it provides nothing for us to take pride in. This is a chance for us to take a great step forward, but in a cautious manner. We have an opportunity to make this a great moment for us. I would like to quote Nelson Mandela, who said:
It is what we make out of what we have, not what we are given, that separates one person from another.
This equally applies to our nation. (Time expired)

"Cameron, Ross, MP",LP,1999-08-30,"—I note in the gallery the presence of representatives of the Australian Union of Jewish Students and, as the youngest member of the parliament to vote no on 6 November, 
 I dedicate these remarks to thinking young Australians such as the representatives of the Australian Union of Jewish Students.
In November this year we will be asked to vote not on the idea of a republic in abstract but on the merits of a particular republic endorsed by last year's Constitutional Convention. That model involves the appointment of a President by the Prime Minister, with the consent of the Leader of the Opposition and two-thirds of the parliament, following a public nomination process. The closest approximation to this which I can find is the Golden Logie award in TV Week. Every reliable poll taken over the past five years shows that, of those who want a republic, the overwhelming majority want the right to directly elect their President. In my own poll of the Parramatta electorate, 90 per cent of the 2,500 respondents indicated that if Australia was to have a republic they wanted to elect the President. The only other issue on which the consensus was so clear was a question asking whether taxes were too high.
It is the view of the political elite that the Australian people do not really understand what they are asking for when they ask for direct election. They say it would not involve incremental but radical change, and they are right. Direct election of the executive would involve scrapping our Westminster style of government and rebuilding again from the ground up. The problem is that the Australian people are saying emphatically that they want direct election. This year's referendum cannot deliver that. The Turnbull-ARM republic we are being offered is a sop to our popular instincts. It is a throwing of the scraps of democracy from the table of the elites. This is a `we know better than you' republic. The illegitimacy of the model's conception by a committee of political compromise is reflected in the instability of the outcomes it will deliver.
The republicans argue that Australia's consistently democratic government is based not on the content of the Constitutional document but on the consensus of democratic values that underpin it—a consensus that will presumably survive the changes now proposed. They are only half right. The approach 
 underestimates the particularity of the conventions which attach to the Crown and the Crown alone—conventions which will not survive the changes now proposed. The most important of those are the conventions ensuring the separation of power between the titular head of state and the executive government—in our case, between the monarch and the Prime Minister in parliament. A clear understanding of authority and precedence, whether in a family, in a business or in a government, is a significant achievement and arguably one of the prerequisites for success. As Shakespeare observed:
When two men ride a horse, one must ride in front.
The central operating principle of responsible government is that the policy direction of the nation should be determined by those who have been through the crucible of electoral scrutiny; by those who have sought and received a representative warrant and who are answerable to the electorate for their performance.
We benefit in this country from the 350-year struggle for ascendancy between the English parliament and the monarch. No fewer than nine Speakers of the House of Commons met a violent death on the journey from the divine right of kings to the sovereignty of the people through parliament. The execution of Charles by Cromwell's parliamentary forces marked an irreversible turning in the tide of favour of a sovereign towards a sovereign parliament and people.
With the adoption in 1901 of the Constitution Act, Australians received all the benefit of that law and tradition in one stroke of the legislative pen. The role of our Governor-General and of state governors is purely ceremonial, with the exception of those rare situations, perhaps once or twice a century, when the monarch's representative can exercise reserve powers to avert a crisis. The position is clearly outlined in House of Representatives Practice, beginning with a quote from Quick and Garran:
. . . parliamentary government has well established the principle that the Crown can perform no executive act, except on the advice of some Minister responsible to parliament. Hence the power nominally placed in the hands of the Governor General is really granted to the people through 
 their representatives in the parliament. Whilst therefore, in this Constitution, some executive powers are . . . in accordance with venerable custom, vested in the Governor General, they . . . can only be exercised according to the will of the people.
Former Governor-General Sir Paul Hasluck later observed:
So long as the Crown has the powers which our Constitution now gives it, and so long as the Governor General exercises them, Parliament will work in the way the constitution requires and the executive—
and this is the critical point—
will remain responsible to Parliament.
In general, the system has worked with beautiful predictability and efficiency, even accepting that 1975 involved a questionable exercise of judgment by Sir John Kerr. Importantly, exercise of the reserve powers involves a merely momentary restoration of executive authority to the Governor-General, followed by the calling of an early election in which the will of the people can again be tested and implemented. I am not convinced that the republic on which we will be asked to vote this year can deliver the same settled certainty of roles and precedence.
We have witnessed a recent blurring of the executive conventions, and this republican model will see a rapid acceleration in that trend. Sir William Deane and his predecessor Bill Hayden have significantly increased the scope of vice-regal pronouncements on matters such as euthanasia, gay marriage, indigenous affairs and economic inequality. Some adventurous members of the judiciary—in particular, from the Family Court and, more recently, the High Court—have by their ex-curial pronouncements added momentum to this trend. Their indulgence is buttressed by the security of life tenure but, if we are struggling to constrain the judiciary from policy pronouncements under the weight of 350 years of convention, how do we ever expect to constrain an Australian President?
These excesses are taking place even within the constraints of 350 years. Much of that cultural heritage will be lost under the Turnbull model precisely because, by cutting all links with the monarch, it will cut links with the constraints that bind the monarch. 
 Two empirical factors sharpen my apprehension. The first is that Australians are saying, with unusual clarity, that if we are to have a President we want one clothed with democratic authority. The second is that the moral influence of the Governor-General, or the proposed President, is greatly increased by the absence of a government majority in an upper house. Without reformed Senate electoral processes, hung parliaments look set to become a permanent feature of the landscape in both state and federal parliaments. Successive presidents will find it irresistible to fill the power vacuum which those hung parliaments create.
This would not be a problem if we went the whole hog and directly elected the President as leader of the executive government. Under the half-pregnant model we are being offered, it is a substantial problem. By giving the people some say in the selection of a President—but not all—we create a genetic hybrid which is neither purely symbolic nor an effective executive leader. At each point in the delicate negotiations between the Prime Minister and minority parties in the Senate, we will have President Ita Buttrose offering the benefit of the enlightened conscience of a good astrologer or President Charlie Perkins with the ancestral wisdom of the tribal elders. I do not doubt there is wisdom there—I simply regard it as a recipe for disaster in terms of efficient executive government.
The republicans respond that the common sense of Australians will ensure that the system is workable, and there is some truth in that. If the yes case is successful, the sky will not fall in. The question is: will it deliver an improvement? Our neighbours across the Tasman recently embarked on a constitutional experiment involving multi-member electorates. New Zealand benefits from the same tradition of democratic continuity upon which our republicans are relying so heavily. Presumably, the Kiwis intended to improve their system of government. The experiment has been an abject failure and made New Zealand something of a laughing stock.
I am not a direct electionist nor am I a flag waving monarchist. What I object to is the fiction that you can expunge the Crown 
 without seriously eroding the conventions that bind the Crown. Recent erosion of those conventions of responsible government is an irritation capable of remedy. The Turnbull-ARM model will create a double-headed hydra. Prime Minister and President cannot both hold the reins of government. Therefore, there are only two real choices for coherent government—either you are a hairy-chested, American-style republican, with an executive President, or you stick with a purely symbolic, ceremonial, hereditary figure who has the great virtue of being an executive eunuch. In conclusion, I rely on Churchill, who knew a little of both history and government:

"Danby, Michael, MP",ALP,1999-08-30,"—I second this motion to express the distaste of many Australians for the low road that some opponents of the proposed republic are taking. I do not include the previous speaker, the member for Parramatta. I note, as the member for Gellibrand pointed out in an earlier speech, that those supporters of the current system do not seem—as the character in Fawlty Towers  always inveighs against—to want to mention the war. In this case, they do not want to seem to mention the Queen. I respect the views of many people like him, who are constitutional monarchists.
I agree with the member for Hindmarsh in her earlier claims that those seeking to scare the public that the Australian flag will be removed or changed as a result of the referendum are idiotic. Three days after her comments to the Liberal Party room a press release was put out by a parliamentary secretary in the government. It quoted comments by a Mr Harold Scruby and Natasha Stott Despoja as the evidence that the Australian flag would be changed. In his own press release, Senator Campbell points out that the amendments to the Flag Act 1953 allow the Australian flag to be changed by this parliament and that that has always been the case.
One of the principal arguments of the monarchists opposed to the Australian President and a republic is to claim that under the new system the Prime Minister would have greater powers to dismiss a President. The 
 weight of public testimony by constitutional experts to the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum, which I was on, was that the proposed system replicated the current situation. Former Prime Minister the Rt Hon. Malcolm Fraser undermined opponents of the referendum in public testimony to our committee, and now he and former Deputy Prime Minister, Doug Anthony, have written an open letter in which they seek to disabuse those who exaggerate the powers to dismiss the President under the prospective republic. On the Sunday program, Mr Fraser demolished the arguments of his former adviser, the Minister for Vocational Education and Training, in today's Age. A reporter asked Mr Fraser:
But under the proposed system if the referendum goes through, the Prime Minister could just sack the president like that, couldn't he?
Mr Fraser replied:
Well, he could just sack the president like that. But then there are consequences. There's going to be a formal debate in the parliament, and there probably would, if somebody was sacked anyway. The Opposition would make sure that there was a debate about it. But under the proposal, the Prime Minister can't appoint somebody that he wants to appoint. He's got to secure the
support of the Leader of the Opposition so that he'll get the
two-thirds parliamentary majority. In other words, you know,
having a straight political hack, having a stooge for the Prime Minister, somebody who'll do just what this particular Prime Minister wants, is not going to be possible.
Mr Fraser added in his excellent interview on the Sunday  program in response to this further question from Laurie Oakes:
You're saying that the proposed republic model would be a more stable situation as far as hiring and firing the president, than the current situation we have with the Governor-General?
FRASER:
Yes, I really would. I don't think, in this context, that we really want to rake up old issues and old passions, but one of the problems in 1975 was quite simply that the Governor-General, he believed he could be sacked at the drop of a hat and that's why he did not consult with the Prime Minister in ways that many people believed he should have consulted with the Prime Minister of the day. 

Under our Westminster system of responsible parliamentary government, a Prime Minister had to have the ability to remove the head of state. In the old system, a Prime Minister can remove the Governor-General, as the former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser has explained. Under the new system, the Prime Minister could remove the President. This ability is deliberate and designed in the unlikely event of conflict between the Prime Minister and the President and is designed to remove constitutional impasse.
It enshrines the supremacy of parliament, the elected representatives of the people, over the symbolic head of state. Moreover, the Prime Minister under the new republic will be constrained by having to bring the dismissal back to parliament within 30 days in having to convince the House of his actions. That is not there now.
I want to conclude with one final point—that is, the shameful scare tactics of Mr David Elliott of the Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy comparing Australia to Weimar Germany. My father lived in Weimar Germany, and anyone who compares prosperous, peaceful Australia with Germany of the 1930s is using scare tactics that are not part of the legitimate and thoughtful debate that the Australian public expect us to display in this coming referendum.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Republic: Referendum</title>,Private Members' Business,11,1
"Causley, Ian, MP",NP,1999-08-30,"—Let me make it clear right from the outset that I do not agree with the change to the system we have at the present time, and that does not particularly make me a monarchist. But I asked Malcolm Turnbull at a hearing of the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum in Sydney whether he could name one occasion on which our Constitution had failed us and he said, `Other than that we don't have an Australian as a head of state, no.' I would even question the fact that we do not have an Australian head of state, so I think the most important part here is an old country adage which sometimes the opposition do not like to hear. The country adage is: you do not buy a pig in a poke. To explain that to some of the younger members, `poke' is an old English term for `bag'.
Ms Roxon interjecting—
—I listened to the member for Gellibrand and, if she listens closely, she will hear my argument. One thing that we hear in this debate which seems to be a modern trend in democracy in Australia is that, if you do not agree with the thought police or the loud yellers from the other side, you are wrong, you are an idiot, you are a hypocrite. I thought we had a democracy where everyone is entitled to an opinion. I know the position of the Labor Party because they are not even giving their people a free vote. There are people over there who oppose this but they are not being given a free vote—at least we have a right to have an opinion.
I want to address this situation where the supporters of the republic continue to say that there will be no change in the powers of the Governor-General and the President. There is no doubt that the evidence given to the committee, even from constitutional lawyers, could not explain the reserve powers, especially the royal prerogative, and the other powers that the Governor-General has at the present time. In fact, it was custom and practice in most instances it was raised as to how they might act.
For anyone, even Malcolm Fraser, to say that there would be no change in the powers is only his opinion because it has never been tested. The most important point here is that, if it had been tested, we might have known. It has never been tested and, therefore, we cannot openly say there will be no change in the powers between the Governor-General and the President. If we assume that there has not been any change of the power and in fact we have this model and the President has the same powers as the Governor-General, it is almost like a scene from High Noon because you have the Prime Minister who can dismiss the Governor-General at will and you have a Governor-General with reserve powers who can remove the Prime Minister. It is who can draw the gun first in some constitutional crisis. I do not think that that is a form of government that Australia needs at this particular time.
But, given the fact that former Prime Minister Fraser and even Doug Anthony have come out and said that they believe there 
 would be no change in powers, for goodness sake, what was going on in 1975? Why did the Senate defer the vote on the appropriation bill? Why were they trying to deny supply? This was a grab for power. For former Prime Minister Fraser to say that he thought that the Prime Minister would just have to indicate that he wanted to remove the Governor-General and the Governor-General's powers would be null and void is ridiculous because he was angling to become the Prime Minister of Australia.
So in that situation, if in fact you had a President whom the Prime Minister could sack immediately and you had a budget that had been denied in the Senate, where would you go from there? Would you expect the Prime Minister of the day, Mr Whitlam, to go and negotiate with the Senate? He was never known for humility. You have an absolute impasse, an impossible impasse, in a situation such as that.
I think that we want to think long and hard. People tend to forget that in fact, from memory, the original Constitution took 10 years to negotiate. I am not opposed to change at all, but I want to think very carefully about changing the Constitution of this country. The Constitution of this country has protected the people with a lot of freedoms.
The member for Melbourne Ports talked about the Weimar Republic. If he looks very closely at the Weimar Republic, it is not much different from the proposition we are putting forward at the present time. Do not kid yourself that a hundred years down the track you could not have an economic crisis similar to the crisis that occurred in Germany in the 1930s. Never forget that Hitler was elected as a very popular leader, an extremely popular leader, and he was still popular when he became a dictator. Look at how the world was treated by a dictator such as that. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Republic: Referendum</title>,Private Members' Business,11,1
"McLeay, Leo, MP",ALP,1999-08-30,"—What we have just heard is the thing that concerns a lot of people on both sides of the parliament about what is happening with this debate. It is a shame that the member for Page has made his contribution and then 
 walked out. He obviously does not think too much about what he had to say himself.
What former Prime Minister Fraser and the former Leader of the National Party—and obviously the member for Page would not have had much time for him either because he does not seem to have time for any Leader of the National Party—both said on the weekend were sensible things. They said that there is not the need for the scaremongering that we are starting to see come into this debate. It is an old tory, conservative ploy: if you can't win something or you can't stop it, put it off and spoil it.
We have heard all sorts of things raised. Some spokespersons on the conservative side have said that all of a sudden the flag is going to disappear. You become a republic and you have to haul down the flag. That is rubbish and everyone knows that is rubbish. We all know that is rubbish, but that is still being raised by some people in this debate.
We have had other people all of a sudden over the last week discover that the Queen's photo is no longer on our money notes. We have not had the Queen's head on our money notes for donkey's years, but all of a sudden they have discovered that. It is as if the day we become a republic, the currency will become worthless. It is madness, but that is one of the furphies that is being put around by people.
One of the other furphies being put around by people is that the Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron will no longer be able to call themselves the `royal', or the `Royal Golf Club' will not be the `royal' any more. The Royal Australian Navy will not be the Royal Australian Navy; it will be the Australian Navy. But all those other organisations that want to keep the name `royal' in their title can do that. Nobody is going to stop them from doing that. In fact, the proponents of the conservative cause could change their first names to `Royal' if they wanted and they could all be `Royal' themselves. We are happy for that, but that is the sort of furphy we have got in this. The money is going to be worthless, the flag is going to come down and Royal Peter can't be Royal Peter any more.
—And we're going to have Weimar Germany.
—As my colleague the member for Melbourne Ports just reminded me, we had the member for Page come in here and drag the red herring of the Weimar Republic: that we could have another collapse of Germany and Adolf Hitler would be here in Australia. My God, how could changing Australia to a republic do any of those things? The truth is, as all sensible people know, it will not.
What we have heard in recent weeks is a lot of talk about important national symbols in this country. Symbols are important for a country. Symbols give you a bit of an idea about what you are and symbols tell other people what you think of yourself. I think we should be involved in this very important symbolic change at the beginning of the millennium. We as a country should stand up and say to the world that we Australians know who we are, that we Australians know what we are and that we can be quite comfortable being a republic because we are a mature enough country and a sensible enough people to be able to do that.
So I just say this to all my colleagues on both sides and to all those others involved in this debate: let us have the debate and let us have an honest debate. Let us have an honest debate because the worst thing we could do is sell the Australian people so short that we find the only way one side or the other can win this argument is by telling furphies and lies. I do not think that is what we should be looking at when we are deciding this, and I think the Australian people are too smart by half for the people who come up with these furphies. Let us look at what we are as Australians, let us stand up for ourselves as Australians and let us become a republic. (Time expired)
—I call the honourable member for Wannon. I am sorry, I call the honourable member for Sturt.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Republic: Referendum</title>,Private Members' Business,11,1
"Pyne, Chris, MP",LP,1999-08-30,"—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker—although it would be a proud day to be called the member for Wannon, my good friend Mr Hawker. I welcome today's debate and the member for 
 Gellibrand's motion, most of which I can readily agree with and only a very small part of which I will disagree with. In the short five minutes I have to speak this afternoon, there are only a couple of aspects of the motion I would like to talk about, because it is a very comprehensive motion.
Before I do that, can I correct the member for Page and the member for Melbourne Ports. The member for Melbourne Ports referred to Mark Elliott as the national campaign director for Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy. In fact, his name is David Elliott, so it is a small correction.
However, the member for Page made a strong case in his five-minute speech that, under the proposal, there would be an impossible impasse if the President sacked the Prime Minister or the Prime Minister sacked the President. We would then have to go to the Senate to try to get supply through and we would not be able to guarantee supply as we had in 1975. What the member for Page has conveniently forgotten—and he is a good friend of mine as well—is that, under the proposal that is being put, the moment that a President is sacked by a Prime Minister, he would automatically be replaced without recourse to any house of parliament or document or Constitution by the most senior state Governor in Australia, and therefore we will always have a head of state at all times. So the suggestion that there would be an impossible impasse is, unfortunately, another furphy. I will take the opportunity to talk to the member for Page after this debate to fill him in completely on that aspect of the proposal. The motion states:
That the House:
. . .              . . .             . . .
(4)	 urges all Members of this House, whether they be monarchists, republicans or direct election supporters, to participate honestly in the referendum campaign . . .
We would all like to support that proper intention of the member for Gellibrand. One aspect of that which she raises in her motion involves:
. . . the misrepresentation of the current powers of the Prime Minister
to dismiss a Governor-General . . .  

So delighted I was yesterday to be watching the Sunday  program to see our urbane and sage former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser nailing that misrepresentation on behalf of those who are supporting the yes case. When he responded to a question about whether the Queen would act as a brake in the event that the President was sacked, Mr Fraser said:
It would be a formality. It can't be a brake.
Namely, the Queen supporting the sacking. He continued:
You cannot expect a constitutional monarch living in England to protect Australia. It would be a gross infringement of Australia's own constitutional integrity, and that's the way it would be seen in Buckingham Palace. It's the way it would be seen in Britain. The Queen would accept the advice she was given.
Later in the interview when asked about this proposal—the proposal to be put on 6 November—and whether there were any safeguards in that, he made the case very strongly. He said:
But under the proposal, the Prime Minister can't appoint somebody that he wants to appoint. He's got to secure the support of the Leader of the Opposition so that he'll get the two-thirds parliamentary majority.
Mr Fraser pointed out what we all know in this House: under the proposed model on which we will vote on 6 November, there are strong safeguards put in place to ensure that the Prime Minister cannot sack the President without due recourse to the parliament or indeed appoint a new President without the support of the opposition. As we all know, a two-thirds majority would not be able to be gained in this House without the support of the opposition. In fact, under this model, the powers of the Prime Minister are seriously curtailed as opposed to the current situation. Those people in the Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy who argue that the proposal strengthens the hand of the Prime Minister vis-a-vis the head of state are misrepresenting the current constitutional situation that faces Australia.
In the short time available to me, I should point out that I do not support this referendum in order to be anti the Queen or to replace the royal family. I am a McGarvieite model Liberal. However, this is the proposal 
 that has been put to us. If it fails to be successful, I am fearful that in 10 years time we will have a directly elected President. I am very passionate about supporting the Westminster system. I want to protect it from direct electionists. I will campaign for a yes vote to ensure that we have an appointed President who is answerable to the parliament rather than a directly elected President, which strikes at the very heart of our Westminster system. I believe in giving away 10 per cent of the current system to save 90 per cent; whereas if, as a conservative ACM supporter, you hang on to our current system, you are certain to have a directly elected President in the near future.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Republic: Referendum</title>,Private Members' Business,11,1
"Hoare, Kelly, MP",ALP,1999-08-30,"—I welcome this private member's motion presented by my colleague the member for Gellibrand and I applaud her in defining each of the five points pertinent to this debate. Saturday, 6 November presents all Australians with a unique opportunity to determine our country's future. It is an opportunity to present ourselves to the international community as an independent and mature nation—an independent nation willing and able to unshackle ourselves and cut the apron strings which currently bind us to another country on the other side of the globe. As Richard Butler, a former ambassador to the UN, said on the weekend:
This is what is at issue: to send a signal to the rest of the world that we are no longer in any way, shape or form a British colony, that we are a completely other country, that we have developed in different ways from our origin as six convict territories.
The maturity of our nation will be defined as we present ourselves to the international community as a nation which can take ownership of its destiny through this referendum. Through the Constitutional Convention in February last year, Australians voted for and selected delegates to decide on the referendum question and the model to be put to electors. A major issue of currency in this debate is embodied in points (4) and (5) of this motion—that is, that we all participate honestly in the referendum campaign and that we deplore misleading and mischievous scare 
 campaigns on such an important national issue.
As the campaign has intensified over the past month or so, so have the misleading, ludicrous and sometimes just false claims made by those advocating the no vote. Some monarchists have said that the Australian flag will be replaced if the vote on 6 November is yes. This is an incorrect assumption. Any debate on the national flag is a separate issue, as was the debate in 1977 when the national anthem was changed. The advocates of the no vote are also proclaiming that an Australian President will have far-reaching and sinister powers beyond that of the current Governor-General, which, according to them, will rip out the central planks of our democratic system. The Constitutional Centenary Foundation, the organisation which has been delegated the task of objectively explaining what the referendum means and what the main issues are, states that `the Constitution will give the powers of the Queen and the Governor-General to the President'.
Another sinister proclamation by the no vote advocates is that the President could be sacked by the current Prime Minister at that Prime Minister's whim. The republic model in truth has further checks and balances regarding the removal of the President as opposed to the current system for the removal of the Governor-General. At the moment, the Queen can sack the Governor-General on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. However, in the proposed republic, though the President can be sacked by the Prime Minister in writing, the Prime Minister must seek the approval of the House of Representatives.
Some so-called republicans advocating the no vote would prefer a model of direct election of the President. A presidential campaign in a direct election system would ensure that the President is either supported and endorsed by a political party or has the wealth and resources available to mount an effective campaign. A direct election system could see Prime Minister Kim Beazley trying to maintain our stable democracy while working with President Reith, Costello or Howard.
Many people have put forward William Deane's name as a possible first President. 
 This would only happen under the model proposed. Sir William Deane would not nominate as a presidential candidate endorsed and funded by a political party. Only the community based selection process would ensure the nomination of an apolitical candidate of the calibre of William Deane.
The no vote campaign relies on arguments which centre on the `fear of the unknown' concept: why change something which is tried and tested? Why fix something which isn't broken? Why upset the status quo? In other words, be afraid to make changes, be too scared to move forward, be too cowardly to take charge of our destiny and determine our own identity.
The message from the republican side is clear: vote yes for a truly independent, democratic and mature nation. Vote yes to ensure that one of our children or grandchildren can aspire to becoming an Australian President. Vote yes so that all Australians born overseas can respect our head of state. Vote yes to admit that, although the British monarch has performed admirably over the past hundred years, the British monarch is no longer relevant to Australians as we head into the new millennium. Vote yes to ensure our next head of state is not determined by an accident of birth, by gender and to the exclusion of most religious beliefs. Vote yes on 6 November for an Australian head of state.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Republic: Referendum</title>,Private Members' Business,11,1
"Hawker, David, MP",LP,1999-08-30,"—I rise to join this debate. I would like to start by picking up a point that was made by the honourable member for Watson. I agree with him about the importance of having honest debate, but I was curious about his reference to changing the Australian flag. The reason I bring that up is that I recall very well introducing a private member's bill here on a number of occasions and, on every occasion, the then Labor government refused to let the bill be voted on. The bill was simply to say that, if there was going to be a change to the Australian flag, it would require a simple referendum of all voters to approve of that change. When in government, the Labor Party refused that bill. I make that observation because I thought it was interesting that the 
 member for Sturt came in and said, `Reference to the flag has nothing to do with this.'
I would like to start off by saying that I find the motion put forward by the member for Gellibrand a little bit contradictory. On the one hand, it urges all members—whether monarchists, republicans or direct election supporters—to `participate honestly in the referendum campaign', and I agree with that. But, if we look at point (2) of the motion, it notes that `our stable democracy will continue and be strengthened' if this referendum question is carried. That is one of the fundamental points that is up for debate. We are not sure that that would occur, particularly under the model that is being proposed. Point (3) talks about the campaign. When we go to point (4), we see that all the claims there are one-sided. They are all very much pro the republic model, as indeed was the previous speaker, the member for Charlton. I honestly think that a number of those points could be debated as to whether they are correct and what they mean. On the one hand, this motion is asking for an even-handed approach; on the other hand, it is a very one-sided point of view. I think it is a slightly naive motion.
I would like to reiterate the point that has been made—and no-one seems to have validly argued against it—that the current system works remarkably well. That is a very important point to remember. The central point is that we should not be changing to a different system unless we are very confident that what we are going to change to is as good as, or better than, what we have at the moment. I am not really convinced that the changes proposed in this referendum motion will do that. That is why I have put my name to a dissenting report.
It is important to note that the current proposal did not even have the support of the majority of the Constitutional Convention. That is very significant. If it was that good, you would have thought it at least would have had the support of the majority of the Constitutional Convention. It did not. Therefore, it raises the obvious question: why should the majority of Australians support something when the majority of the Constitutional Convention could not even support it?
The reason why I have signed a dissenting report—and I might add that there are four dissenting reports put in by the select committee on the question of the referendum—is the massive increase of the powers of the Prime Minister. I will list five of those—and I am relying on the Hon. Richard McGarvie, who made a very sensible contribution: (1) it was easier for the Prime Minister to sack the President than for the Prime Minister to sack his driver; (2) the creation of an alternative power base; (3) the question of whether we get the right calibre of person for a President; (4) the likely conflict of bringing the courts in in the case of a conflict; and (5) the process of the referendum. Which comes back to point (2) in the motion: if the referendum question were to be approved it would bring about greater stability. If you had a minority of states—say, two states—opposing the change, you would not be strengthening the Federation; you would be weakening it.
In the short time I have available, I think the important point is, as Mr McGarvie said—and I have great respect for Mr McGarvie; he was an eminent Supreme Court judge and also a Governor of Victoria—(Time expired)",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Republic: Referendum</title>,Private Members' Business,11,1
"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,1999-08-30,"—I want to leave it up to others to discuss the finer points of law and constitutional reform. Instead, I would like to present the emotional argument, the argument from the heart, the argument about where we could be in 2001. The referendum on 6 November is the most significant of our time and the most significant that any country could ever have. For me, this opportunity in my lifetime, and at the point of 100 years of Federation, to vote on the future of our nation cannot be overvalued by any means. It is the most important vote that I will ever cast.
I have three children: a boy and two girls. My youngest daughter, Madeline, is a fantastic little girl. She is full of potential and a whole world is hers for the taking. She can aspire to be anything she wants to be, except Australian head of state. She cannot be Australian head of state because she is not a member of the English royal family, she is not in the Church of England and, worst of all, she was born in Australia. Our Constitu 
 tion tells every little boy and girl growing up in Australia that to be head of state they must belong to a certain family, be born in England, be in the right religion and, to have the best possible chance, preferably be a man. Where else in Australia would we accept these selection criteria as legal or moral? What are we telling our children? Are they not good enough? Are we not good enough to choose one of our own to hold our highest office? Are we not yet ready to stand on our own feet? When will we be our own masters?
It is ironic that some people are always telling immigrants that they should assimilate, that they should somehow forget the past, move on and embrace their new country. The majority have. They have become part of Australia and part of the very fabric that has made this country the bastion of freedom that it is today. While we should never forget our past, we cannot deny our future. Our history proves this. We have had 100 years of great federation. Our forebears had vision, courage and unselfish fortitude of spirit that led them to bring together the states to form a nation that otherwise would not be. If they had not, we would not be having this debate today. Of course, not everyone agreed—no-one ever does—but they got on with the job and thought about their country and the future of their children. On 6 November 1999, we will be in the same position. We have the same opportunity to make history and to be part of the real Australia.
When you wake up on 7 November, do you want to be part of the future or barely clinging onto the past? I am not interested in the monarchists' views, because their campaign is one purely of scaremongering and is totally puerile. The view I want to influence is that of the republicans who are uncertain about the model and could vote no on the day. Let me remind them that this vote is not about rejection; it is about acceptance.
If you truly support an Australian as head of state, then think carefully about your vote. The model may not be your preferred outcome, but it is safe and practical. It will not diminish the value of the position of head of state, nor will it diminish the value of the position of Australia. Make no mistake: the 
 Queen of England is our head of state, not the Governor-General. He is only her representative and, by any measure, the Governor-General is Australian, but does not have to be to hold office. In fact, of the past 22 Governors-General, only eight have been Australian. Our Australian head of state should be Australian. It sounds a little bit silly that we are actually debating that an Australian should be our head of state rather than a foreigner, but that is exactly what we will be deciding on 6 November.
Many people have tried to scare the community into believing that change is all too risky. Change is not about flags and coins; they are only icons of today. You cannot deny our history or change it. What we are today is a result of where we have been and that will never change, nor should it. The result of a yes vote will be enormous in terms of national pride and nationhood but will be minimal in terms of constitution and law.
The comparative changes between the constitutional monarchy and the republic are minimal. In fact, if you have a look at the model closely, the current Governor-General is appointed by the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister. One man decides who our Governor-General is, but on the other hand the President would be decided by a two-thirds absolute majority of a joint sitting of the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia and on a motion by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. On top of all that, it would be in the light of nominations by the public.
Another matter that comes up for debate is the qualifications of a head of state. Currently, the Governor-General can be absolutely anyone. There are no qualifications. But under the new system, under the republic, that person would have to be Australian, and I think that is a pretty good starting point for a qualification. There is also a lot of talk about the removal of a head of state. Currently, the Governor-General can be removed only by the Prime Minister. Under a republic, removal by the parliament will be a much better method.

"St Clair, Stuart, MP",NP,1999-08-30,"—I enjoy listening to people on both 
 sides debating this issue because, when I look at the member for Gellibrand's motion, I tend to agree also with most of the things in that motion, particularly when it comes to the importance of the referendum to the people Australia and the necessity for them to get it right and hear both sides of the debate.
As most people know—and I have said it in this place before—I still believe that a system has not been put forward that is any better than the one we have. That is my view. But, in saying that, it is absolutely vital—and I take particular note of paragraph (1) of the motion—that people have both sides of the story. They have to look at it unemotionally and logically and they have to decide on 6 November what they really want to do.
The beauty of the democracy in which we live is that in fact we can go to a poll and have a referendum on matters that stir most of us up and which are certainly emotional issues. Under our democratic process and in our society we can leave it to the people to have the choice. I, for one, can assure the House that when I wake up on 7 November I will be interested to see what the vote is. In my electorate of New England, as I have said before, there is confusion and to a certain degree stories are being told by both sides of the argument. I know that the people of Australia have the intelligence to be able to make the right decision.
I do not believe that the referendum will necessarily change the identity of the nation. Our identity goes back to our forefathers who created this country, our sporting heroes, all the immigrants who have come into this nation and the working men and women who made this nation great. That is why I sincerely say that paragraph (1) of the motion is so important when it comes to the people getting both sides of this argument.
When it comes to paragraph (2) of the motion—and both I and the member for Wannon raise the issue—paragraph (2) notes that our stable democracy will continue, and I do not have any doubts about that in my mind. The question of whether it is strengthened if the question is approved I do have some difficulty with. I am not sure whether it will actually be strengthened or not. However, 
 I put both sides of that story in my electorate, and the people have to decide what they want to do.
I do not believe that stable democracy will merely be strengthened because of the referendum. We saw that back in 1988 when I would have loved to have seen local government legally recognised in the Constitution. I have been a firm believer—and still am—that that should be the case. Yet it was defeated. Was it the will of the people? I am not sure. Was it scaremongering? I am not sure. But I am sure that it will strengthen the democracy by simply having a referendum. I really do firmly believe that. Paragraph (4) of the motion states:
. . . urges all Members of this House, whether they be monarchists, republicans or direct elections supporters, to participate honestly in the referendum campaign . . . 
That is absolutely essential. I have read some of the profound statements that have been made from both sides of the camp and, quite honestly, I question whether their intent is right or wrong.
It is up to the nation as to whether we become a republic or not. Any campaigning that is done by a member of parliament should be done because that is what they believe in. As a new member to this House I have certainly been pleased by the fact that we do have a free vote. We are able to go back into our electorates and put forward our personal view but, in turn, say to our people that, when they make their decision on 6 November, they must make sure that that is what is in their hearts, and that decision is what it has to reflect.
In the few seconds remaining, I wish to quote from the Melbourne Age. I do not normally do this, but this article by David Kemp sets it up. He states:
Our Constitution strikes a balance between the power of the governor-general to dismiss a prime minister, and the power of a prime minister to dismiss a governor-general.
. . .              . . .             . . .
Many of the world's worst governments are republics. Our Constitution should be changed only if an alteration would improve Australia's system of government. 

Again I ask: is it a better system than the one we have? The key issue is not whether we should become a republic but whether a proposed change will make our Constitution better or worse. (Time expired)

"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,1999-08-30,"—There was temporary elation in the Liberal Party backbenches in the federal parliament and in the Western Australian government this morning with the headline in the West Australian  of this morning `Tuckey calls it a day'. Unfortunately, it referred only to his role in Western Australian horseracing, where his main claim to fame was to denounce a day devoted to the Italian community and racing. That was perhaps not as serious as the previous day's comments in the Sunday Times  about his role in forestry policy. Under the headline `Tuckey loses his way in the forests', the paper noted:
. . . what Mr Tuckey needs to accept is that he is very much part of the problem.
He is stirring up emotions and not playing the role of a minister.
His comments are not doing either the timber workers or the conservationists any good. He is not listening to opinion polls.
Over the last week or so, we have had a debate in the Senate in regard to RFA legislation, and one aspect of that is industry policy.
In 1995, 84,000 Australians were working in the wood and paper products industries. The majority—over 50,000—worked in wood and paper manufacturing, producing paper and paper products and other wood products. A further 20,000 worked in the sawmilling and timber dressing sector and another 11,000 in forestry and logging. A key concern is our substantial trade deficit in wood and paper products. In 1997-98, our imports of wood 
 based forest products exceeded exports by $1.46 billion—a very significant figure in the overall balance. While we had a trade surplus of $645 million in pulpwood or woodchips, we had a much greater deficit of $1.41 billion in paper products.
Our wood and paper trade deficit is a classic example of Australia needing to reposition itself—to move away from being just an exporter of unprocessed wood to focus much more on value adding and downstream processing. We need to achieve this turnaround to both replace imports and capture new export markets. For the wood and paper industry, there are at least three alternative policy approaches on offer. The first approach—demonstrated and embraced by the Democrats and their allies—is to simply view the whole industry as a basket case and an environment headache that we can best do without. Such a view proceeds from an arguable historical concern that the level of harvesting of much of our native timbers has been unsustainable and indirectly subsidised by taxpayers as a result of poor state based pricing and royalty systems. And, of course, we had some fairly embarrassing figures on the Kennett government's efforts on those matters last year.
From this starting point, the Democrats adopt the invalid conclusion that there is no such thing as sustainable harvesting of native forests and that, in the words of their spokesman Senator Greig in a media release last week, `the native forest logging industry is one which ought to be wound down as soon as possible'. While we in the Labor Party envisage a much greater role in future for plantations and farm forestry, and are strongly committed to protecting the conservation and recreational values of wilderness and old-growth forests, we do not subscribe to the lazy, doomsday approach of the Democrats.
The second apparent approach is to simply remove export controls, provide industry with resource security, completely delegate forest management to the states and then let market forces run their course. This is the preferred approach of some sections of the industry and appears, obviously, to have been the strategy adopted by the previous Minister for Industry, 
 Science and Tourism, Mr Moore. Such an approach is equally unacceptable because it downgrades our environmental and world heritage responsibilities and then unrealistically presumes that the least possible government assistance and intervention will produce the healthiest economic and trade outcome. It is an approach based on blind faith rather than actual experience. This approach also ignores that a great deal of our forests are publicly rather than privately owned, that some are harvested on a cut-price basis and the crucial role of innovation, research and development and skills formation in the global trading environment. It also naively assumes that the national interest will always equate with the self-interest of individual firms—even firms that are foreign owned and controlled.
The third possible approach is to move in the direction put forward in the former Labor government's Wood and Paper Industry Strategy. That strategy sought to carry forward the industry development elements of the 1992 National Forest Policy Statement and complement the national regional forest agreements process and structural assistance provided via Labor's Forest Industry Structural Adjustment Package—known as FISAP. The Wood and Paper Industry Strategy provided a policy framework and supporting funding to encourage additional investment, value adding and jobs growth. It identified opportunities for Australia in a variety of areas. These included increased investment in both softwood and hardwood plantations and farm forestry producing replacement and sustainable wood supply; increased recycling of paper products and associated value added processing; import replacement, especially in pulp and paper manufacturing; value added speciality products sourced from native forests, especially from regrowth forests; and improved harvesting and production techniques leading to the manufacture of high value added and appearance-grade wood products such as furnishing components, boards and panels.
All these opportunities were to contribute to a growth in skilled and sustainable jobs and improve productivity and innovation. 
 While the current government remains nominally committed to the Wood and Paper Industry Strategy, it has clearly not been comfortable with its real intent. When it came to government, the coalition signalled its intentions by abolishing Labor's Wood and Paper Industry Council, the high level body that was supposed to drive the whole strategy. The then industry minister, Mr Moore, put in its place a low-key Wood and Paper Industry Forum which, in the course of his whole management of the portfolio, met only twice. Having abolished a committee that was driving the policy, and which had fundamental intentions in regard to investment and technology in the field, the industry committee that he set up—his solution, his replacement—met only twice.
Since the election, the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, Mr Tuckey, has frequently signalled his commitment to the so-called `Action Agenda' for the wood and paper products industry. However, despite originally promising to complete his `Action Agenda' by June this year, the minister now says it will not be ready until next March. This is despite the constant use of our deficit all around Australia. In attacking state Liberal and National and Labor governments and ministers around this country, he constantly refers to the deficit as being a fundamental problem, he sheds crocodile tears for the destruction of rainforests in South-East Asia and South America and he says that he is a person who is interested in trying to counter these problems by developing our own value added industry.
Quite frankly, his sincerity on the matter must be very much doubted because we just have not had action. As I say, the situation is that this minister might privately reassure the AWU and the CFMEU that, if he had his own way, if he had any power in the government, he very much would support an industry position but that really he is somewhat blocked, obscured, restricted by the Prime Minister. `You know how conservative and economic rationalist the Prime Minister is,' he tells the unions, `and I would like to deliver on these matters, but I really can't. But if Labor presses me hard enough then I might 
 be forced to give you some kind of industry committee to do something about the state of the industry.'
Despite the unanimous recommendation of the Senate legislation committee looking into the RFA Bill, the minister has been unwilling or, more likely, unable—and I would say it is more that he is unable—to re-establish the Wood and Paper Industry Council. Instead, on February 25 he issued a media release committing the government to `an appropriate and representative stakeholder consultative body'. There is still no sign of this. In actual fact, if you look at the amendments that the current government has dragged up to try to counter Labor's very broad and well-articulated committee, I think they run to a few phrases and leave it all in the hands of the minister, all in the hands of the never-never, all in the hands of a group of people who have shown historically in their management of this area since coming to government that they are not interested in industry policy.
In the context of the Western Australian RFA, the Prime Minister has made much of his alleged commitment to the industry and to the jobs it provides in regional areas. He could better demonstrate that commitment if he ceased to object to the Wood and Paper Industry Council and guaranteed further funding for the Wood and Paper Industry Strategy.",REPS,<title>GRIEVANCE DEBATE</title>,<title>Wood and Paper Industry</title>,Grievance Debate,12,1
"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,1999-08-30,"—I am pleased to resume my comments on these three social security bills. Before I was interrupted, I was speaking about the difficulties that are occurring with Centrelink. I remind the House in speaking about a specific issue—that is, the attempt by the government to reduce the time limits for notifying changes in circumstances—that this is not the first time the government has attempted to do this. Indeed, the government attempted to introduce a seven-day time limit in December last year in the Payment Processing Legislation Amendment (Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements) Bill 1998. On that occasion, the relevant provisions were withdrawn when it became clear that they would not be accepted by the Senate. For the sake of the many innocent Centrelink clients who will be tripped up by these changes, I hope that these draconian changes meet the same fate on this occasion. To this end, Labor will be seeking to amend these bills in the Senate.
I now wish to address the issue of the changes to the time limits for review. Another significant aspect of these bills is the imposition of time limits for the review of decisions. These bills will bar people from appealing against Centrelink decisions outside the limits of 52 weeks for internal review by an authorised review officer and 28 days for review by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. The government has proceeded with these changes 
 despite the advice of a number of agencies with expertise in this area. I would like to quote from a letter sent to my colleague the shadow minister for family and community services, Wayne Swan, from St Saviour's Neighbourhood Centre in Goulburn. It states:
There are many reasons which justify providing adequate time for social security recipients to appeal decisions including:
Many social security recipients have literacy, numeracy and language barriers resulting from little formal education, having a disability all being from a non-English speaking or Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander background. It takes time to arrange translations into community languages or plain English.
Not surprisingly, many low income people face situations of crisis—for example, homelessness, illness or domestic violence. Under these circumstances it is unreasonable to provide a short period within which to appeal.
There is no clear reason for the changes being proposed yet again by the government in these bills. There are already restrictions on the amount of arrears a person can receive if they do not appeal in time. Currently, if a person appeals later than 13 weeks after the original decision, they can receive arrears only from the date on which they lodged the appeal. In a submission to the Senate Standing Community Affairs References Committee inquiry into these bills, the Secretary to the Department of Family and Community Services argued that these changes were necessary because of the requirement of the Archives Act that records be destroyed 12 months after a person stops receiving payments.
It is important to note, however, that the Archives Act does not require records to be destroyed once they are 12 months old. They need only be destroyed 12 months after the person last receives social security payments. In the overwhelming majority of cases, people who are seeking review of decisions continue receiving social security payments of one kind or another. This means that the department would still have access to the relevant documentation. In situations where the department is recovering a debt from a person who is no longer receiving payments, the Archives Act allows for records to be retained until the debt is repaid. In most cases, debtors ask for decisions to be reviewed before the debt has 
 been fully repaid; so, once again, the Archives Act in no way justifies a reduction in the time limits for review of decisions.
The government would have us believe that time limits of 52 weeks for review by an authorised review officer and 28 days for review by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal are quite reasonable, but this simply shows yet again how out of touch this government is—and this minister is—with ordinary people. There are many cases where these time limits would cause grave injustice. For example, where a person receives a sizeable lump sum compensation payment, they may be precluded from receiving social security payments for some years. At the time a person receives a lump sum compensation payment, they are less likely to challenge a decision about a preclusion period as they have little need for social security in the short term. Several years down the track, however, their circumstances may be very different, and they may need that financial assistance. Even where the preclusion period was incorrectly calculated by the original decision maker and even though the person would have no entitlement to arrears, they would have no right to review of the original decision once the 52-week time limit had expired. Once again, these changes will punish the most disadvantaged—the homeless, those from non-English-speaking backgrounds, indigenous people and people who have had limited access to education.
The Secretary to the Department of Family and Community Services noted that the changes in time limits for review of decisions were in line with the recommendations of the review conducted by Dame Margaret Guilfoyle. This is hardly a persuasive reason for such dramatic changes. It is in no way surprising that an inquiry conducted by a former Liberal Minister for Social Security came up with exactly the recommendations that the government was seeking—yet another example of the shoddy way that this government does business. And let us be very clear about what these changes mean in practice. These changes will mean that people who are entitled to social security payments will not be able to obtain them because of a legal trap 
 set by this government. The opposition cannot in good conscience allow these changes to proceed without challenge and will, therefore, seek to amend these bills in the Senate to remove the time limits for review of decisions. Like the changes to notification periods, this is not the first time the government has attempted to impose time limits for review of decisions. The relevant provisions of the family allowance administration bill were rejected by the Senate, and I suspect that the similar provisions in these bills will meet the same fate.
I also wish to address the way that the Social Security Appeals Tribunal hears appeals, which will be impacted by this bill. Along with seeking to restrict access to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal by imposing a 28-day time limit, the government seeks, through these bills, to make significant changes to the way the SSAT deals with appeals. Firstly, the government wants to allow the SSAT to determine appeals without hearing oral evidence from the parties. This will cause significant inequalities for it favours people who are able to express themselves clearly in writing. Once again, the victims will be the disadvantaged—people from non-English-speaking backgrounds and people with limited literacy. This hypocrisy comes from a government from which you hear a lot about the importance of literacy skills. You also hear acknowledgments by the government that there are many people in our society who unfortunately do not have those skills through no fault of their own.
Allowing the SSAT to determine appeals without hearing oral evidence is an extraordinarily discriminatory provision. Even for those with good literacy skills, the idea of determining appeals on the basis of purely written evidence presumes that Centrelink clearly communicates the reasons for decisions and that people are able to understand the law well enough to respond appropriately. These assumptions once again demonstrate the government's ignorance of the circumstances of many people who require the assistance of Centrelink. The Social Security Appeals Tribunal is designed to operate in an informal manner—that is the whole beauty of 
 it—with expert members from legal, welfare and administrative backgrounds so as to draw out the relevant information without expecting an applicant to present cogent, well-argued legal submissions. Applicants are clearly disadvantaged in any dispute with Centrelink officers who apply the Social Security Act on a daily basis. The only way to correct this disadvantage is to allow applicants to appear before the tribunal and present evidence in an informal setting. Any change to the current system of face-to-face hearings will clearly prevent some applicants from gaining their legal rights. Once again, Labor will seek to amend these provisions of the bills in the Senate.
The second change to the way the SSAT operates is a reduction in the number of members required to hear each appeal. Normally, the tribunal for any given appeal consists of three members—one with legal expertise, one with a welfare background and one with a background in the Department of Family and Community Services. The current act requires that a minimum of three members hear each appeal, except in very limited circumstances. It also provides for a maximum of four members, originally intended to allow a medically qualified member to join the tribunal for appeals involving medical issues. In practice, however, a medical member normally takes the place of either a welfare or a legal member.
The bills before this House propose to remove the requirement for a minimum of three members and a maximum of four and replace it with a limit of three members. There is no provision for the minimum number of tribunal members for appeals. The bill will effectively mean that most appeals will be heard by only one tribunal member. No longer will applicants have the benefit of a mix of legal, welfare and administrative expertise. Instead, they will have to put up with potluck determining what sort of member hears their appeal. We will see tribunal members with a background in social work determining appeals involving complex issues of law. We will also see members with a legal background dealing with issues of psychological trauma. This is just not appropriate be 
 cause it is just not fair. These changes are bound to have a negative effect on the quality of the decisions made by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. Once again, the people most affected by these changes will be directly proportional to their level of disadvantage in society. And many people who are Centrelink clients come from those groups that are the most disadvantaged.
I want to raise a further issue of concern that the Labor Party has with these bills—that is, the requirement of the SSAT to refer back to Centrelink any new evidence presented to the tribunal unless it is satisfied that the applicant had reasonable grounds for not providing the information to Centrelink. It is difficult to understand the rationale for this clause. The then Department of Social Security suggested to the Guilfoyle review that:
. . . this would encourage applicants to disclose all evidence as early as possible in the process.
But it is not clear how applicants are expected to know about this rule. Most applicants are new to the tribunal and therefore have no understanding of the legislation that determines the tribunal's role. Most people will find out about this rule only when they find their appeal being referred back to Centrelink, which is too late in the process. The only thing this change will achieve is more delays in finalising decisions, many of which involve people in dire financial circumstances who are after speedy, efficient and fair decisions. Making the process more complicated, bureaucratic and legalistic will only undermine access to justice and discourage people from exercising their right to appeal to an independent tribunal.
I also wish to speak about the changes in these bills to eligibility for special benefit because they propose restrictions on the eligibility for this benefit. Currently, people who hold temporary visas in subclasses 820 and 826 are eligible to claim special benefit. These subclasses of visas are for partners and spouses of Australian residents who have been allowed entry to Australia and merely need to spend a period living in Australia with their partner before being granted permanent residence. These bills will remove the statutory right of such people to claim special 
 benefit. Instead, only people who hold a visa of a type approved by the minister will be able to claim special benefit. In other words, we are moving from a statutory right to a right determined by the whim of the Minister for Family and Community Services, and there is not much faith out there in the community in the compassion of this minister. The Department of Family and Community Services claimed, in one of its submissions to the Senate Standing Community Affairs References Committee inquiry, that no person who currently receives special benefit would be disadvantaged by these changes. But that requires us to place our trust in the minister. That is more than the Australian Labor Party is prepared to do.
I would remind the House that this is a minister who has doggedly pursued an agenda of preventing newly arrived migrants from having any access to income support. In March 1997, she introduced guidelines for payment of special benefit that sought to make it virtually impossible for any newly arrived permanent resident to receive special benefit in their first two years in Australia. Those guidelines caused enormous hardship to many new Australians. People who had been issued visas and welcomed to Australia on the basis that they had skills we needed suddenly found that there was no government safety net if they had trouble finding work upon arrival. Even if they needed only a few months of support in order to brush up their English skills—made more difficult by the government's cutbacks in areas such as the Australian Migrant English Service—this government's answer was, `Too bad.'
Thankfully, the Senate disallowed the minister's special benefit guidelines in June 1997 and put an end to this inhumane treatment of people who had chosen Australia as their home. But this defeat only spurred the government on to find new ways of attacking assistance for new migrants. The next step was to prevent newly arrived migrants from obtaining health care cards, regardless of any financial difficulties they may be facing. This government has a history of attacking the entitlements of newly arrived migrants at every turn. Now we are being told that we 
 can trust the minister to ensure that the changes in this bill do not restrict access to special benefit. The National Welfare Rights Network did not believe the minister, and I do not either. I hold grave fears for the enormous social and economic problems that will be generated by any further holes in the safety net for new migrants.
In summary, these bills do nothing to simplify the social security system. They will create extra complexity, more confusion and greater injustice. In November 1998, ACOSS released a survey of the community services sector entitled `Living on the edge'. The survey produced startling findings about rising levels of poverty and need amongst low income and disadvantaged Australians. Findings released this month by the Australian Bureau of Statistics demonstrate graphically how the gap between rich and poor in Australia has widened.
That survey was based on statistics for the financial year 1997-98. Its findings revealed that, of all income generated in Australia, the bottom 20 per cent of households account for just 3.8 per cent, the top 20 per cent of households account for 48.3 per cent and the bottom 60 per cent of households account for a measly 27.8 per cent. In real dollar figures, this means that the bottom 20 per cent of households are on gross incomes of less than $204 a week, the bottom 40 per cent are on less than $389 a week and the bottom 60 per cent are on less than $613 a week.
It is definitely true to say that Australia's rich are getting richer and our poor are getting poorer. The ACOSS survey concurs with the ABS and adds that 65 per cent of community welfare agencies experienced an increased demand for their services over the last six months. Services were disturbed by the increasing poverty level of clients and the fact that an escalating number of people were unable to make ends meet on social security. When asked why the system is not coping with these increased levels of poverty and need in our community, 42 per cent of community sector organisations blamed this government's policies. In particular, they blamed the impact of economic rationalism and competitive tendering, especially in 
 relation to home and community care, the new employment services market and child care.
Australia is becoming more and more a nation divided between the haves and the have-nots. More than ever before, Australians need their government to guarantee the delivery of certain basic rights. All Australian families deserve the assurance that, if times are hard, they will never be homeless or hungry; that, as a civilised society, we are able to provide shelter, food, clothing, health care and education to all—and not because those in need must be given the Prime Minister's patronising philanthropy but because access to fundamentals, such as food, clothing and shelter, is a basic and inalienable human right.
That is why it is fundamental for government to get social security legislation right—something these bills fail to do and something that this government has consistently failed to do. These bills will continue the trend, under this government, of targeting the disadvantaged in our society. I hope that one day even my colleagues on the other side of the House will come to realise that persecuting the disadvantaged does not save money or solve problems; it simply increases the financial and societal costs in the long term.",REPS,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY (INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Cameron, Ross, MP",LP,1999-08-30,"—I listened with interest to the remarks of the previous speaker, the member for Grayndler, who is characteristically passionate. I wish only that his passion were matched by his reason.
It gives me pleasure to speak on what essentially is a fairly routine housekeeping, but sensible and necessary, piece of legislation. The  Social Security (Administration) Bill 1999  and associated cognate legislation is a sort of incremental development on the Social Security Act 1991. When you are dealing with a monolith like social security, which involves over 20 individual benefits, many with subclasses, and Commonwealth expenditure of about $43 billion a year which approaches 40 per cent of the total Commonwealth budget, it is inevitable that a level of complexity will be imported into the legislation. 
The bill seeks to remedy a particular defect of the one that preceded it, building on the Social Security Act 1991. In 1991 the legislative philosophy was that each individual benefit should be self-contained and that you ought be able to go to each benefit and see the entirety of the administrative provisions governing it. The consequence was to import into the 20 individual benefits a range of fairly generic boiler plate which was the same for each different benefit but repeated on 20 occasions. The consequence was a very unwieldy document. So it is particularly pleasing to see that this bill will be reduced in size by about 500 pages, and it is seldom that a new piece of legislation can boast such a reduction.
The bill gives effect to recommendations of the Guilfoyle report and makes numerous technical amendments, none of which could be described as revolutionary in character. Most of them are practical, commonsense measures that hardly bear mention in this place. But debating this legislation does provide an opportunity to revisit some of the fundamentals of the way welfare is delivered in this country. I have to tell you, Madam Deputy Speaker, that I am standing here today with a feeling of considerable optimism. There have been certain trends, certain developments in recent times which I think should give all Australians some encouragement in that what this government is beginning to do is not simply to refine the manner in which existing welfare services are delivered but to actually challenge the welfare mentality in such a way that we can reduce the number of Australians who are reliant on welfare.
It is particularly pleasing to see that the sort of policy direction that the government is taking in these areas, which have been broadly summarised under the heading of `reciprocity' or `mutual obligation', is receiving a warm echo from others on the other side of the chamber and from sectors of the community which traditionally have not been supportive of this type of policy change. In that regard, the member for Grayndler is considerably out of step with the more enlightened and progressive thinkers on his side of the parliament.
I want to run through three or four of those areas before moving to the most critical, the most pressing, area of welfare reform in this country which relates to Australia's indigenous community. If we take this concept of mutual obligation and look at how it applies to the Newstart benefit, which is one of the 20 benefits that the bill addresses, we have seen the introduction under the Howard government of what is described as its signature policy—being Work for the Dole. We might debate about the merits of the name itself, but the program has received an overwhelming endorsement from participants and from the community organisations that administer the program.
It is about building a partnership with the community. It is not, as characterised by the member for Grayndler, some kind of an attack on those benefit recipients. On the contrary, the doctrine of mutual obligation is designed to ensure that we do not create pockets of poverty which are fed by a welfare benefit but which never actually result in a change in the person's circumstances. In that regard, the very name `welfare' at times to me has an Orwellian overtone to it. We name a program `welfare' when in fact it can cause a corrosive, destructive impact on a person's life. For those who went under former programs for month after month, for year after year and, in many cases, for generation after generation never breaking the cycle of dependence, mutual obligation is a breath of fresh air. It is the government saying to these people: your life is important to us and welfare must do something more than feed you. Welfare, if it is truly to be true to its name, must actually empower you.
In the area of employment benefits, I was recently in Japan and I met with a representative of the Democratic Socialist Party of Japan, which is the most left-wing party in Japanese politics with the exception of the Japanese Communist Party, and the member of the Japanese Diet asked me the question: `How long can a person remain on unemployment benefits in Australia?' I said, `Well, to date, they can remain indefinitely,' and she was frankly stunned by this revelation. She asked me, wide-eyed, `How do you ever get 
 people off unemployment benefits?' I had to confess to her that we had a whole substratum of Australians across the age bracket who had never worked. She was offended by this policy on the basis that it was not serving the interests of the unemployed. I had to agree with her—with a critique coming from the left of Japanese politics—that we had to introduce a greater level of reciprocity into our unemployment policies.
I was pleased to see the Minister for Employment Services today giving an account of the impact which the Work for the Dole program has had and the extent to which it has been taken up by literally hundreds of thousands of Australians. Reciprocity involves 14 different programs in which a person on a benefit can put something back into the community, can be re-engaged with the local community, rather than simply turning up every two weeks and picking up a cheque.
I would like see us go further. It is my view that there is some wisdom in the approach taken by some states in the United States which say there is a limit on the amount of time that a person can receive an unemployment benefit. That for me is not so much a fiscal measure but, ultimately, poverty largely has to do with a way of thinking. What we must do is challenge that way of thinking.
If you take the question of the sole parent benefit, another one of the 20 addressed by this bill, I am pleased to see this government's initiative in relation to vouchers for marriage counselling to encourage people as they venture out. I do not claim to be an expert on marriage, but the idea of underlining to newly married couples the desirability of staying together and of designing your welfare system around that desirable goal seems to me to have merit. Every time you see a family breakdown, you see a greater likelihood of reliance on the welfare system. And, sadly, once in that net, there are many people who simply never emerge from it.
In some parts of the United States, benefit receipt for a parent is dependent on the child achieving a certain attendance record at school. In this problem of intergenerational welfare, we saw that often the children of welfare beneficiaries, for one reason or 
 another, did not attend school consistently enough to attain basic levels of literacy and numeracy. In that area, I look from the Minister for Employment Services to the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Dr Kemp, and I salute his pioneering efforts in the areas of literacy and numeracy. It is pleasing to see a former Labor minister, Bob Collins, coming to the minister's defence in relation to his indigenous literacy and numeracy policy. An article in the Australian of 24 August 1999 states:
Mr Collins said he had recently told Dr Kemp . . . ""the package was absolutely on the mark"" for indigenous people.
He urged the government to press ahead with its plans to ensure that young indigenous Australians actually acquired a sufficient grasp of literacy and numeracy to take their place in the community.
In relation to the age pension, today the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation gave a glowing account of increased investment by young Australians in the share market. This is characteristic of this growing spirit of self-reliance. Every person who makes adequate provision for themselves and their family today is a person who will not be needing to look to the age pension in a decade's time or a generation's time. It is very pleasing to me to see the level of share ownership in Australia grow from 15 per cent in 1991 to 20 per cent in 1994, to 34 per cent in 1997 and up to 40 per cent today—making us the second highest in the world with the genuine prospect of overhauling the United States as the largest share owning democracy in the world if the sale of the further 16.6 per cent of Telstra takes place as we anticipate. It was especially pleasing to see that people on low to middle incomes—those in the $30,000 to $50,000 income bracket—were the most highly represented among new share owners.
If we go to the area of invalid and disability pension entitlements, again I am not addressing the concern from a fiscal expenditure angle. My principal worry is not the size of the deficit because, under the inspired leadership of Treasurer Costello, we have seen Australia for the first time in some decades return to a position of surplus. My concern is 
 the actual impact of the policy on the life of the beneficiary.
Just this week I visited one of my constituents in his home. He had been a lifetime public servant in the New South Wales government. At about the age of 55 he was subject to a deteriorating relationship with his manager in the government department, which created a stalemate between them. It is true that my constituent suffered from some ailments, but certainly nothing that had prohibited him from working over the previous 35 years. At that point, under the deal under which he left the department, it was simply arranged that he would get a permanent disability pension.
The problem I have—aside from the equation of cost shifting from the state government to the federal government—is that the disability pension tends to validate the fear in the mind of the recipient that they have nothing to contribute. We have seen a worrying rise in the number of disability pensioners to 555,000 in Australia, and that is 2½ times more people on disability benefits now than in 1976—despite an improvement in the nation's health. The cost of supporting them has risen from $3 billion to $7 billion.
—You are just covering up the number of long-term unemployed.
—The opposition has criticised the government in this area for using disability benefits as a mask for unemployment. Frankly, I confess that I feel some apprehension on this question. I am apprehensive that, where a person is struggling to find a place in the labour market, the disability pension is held out as a kind of cure-all, and we see more and more Australians in the situation—again it is like the Hotel California—where once you get on you basically never get off. We have got to work harder to find different options and different alternatives.
I touched on the question of Aboriginal literacy and numeracy in the area of education. I note for the House that I had a discussion recently with my colleague the member for Blair, who has considerable experience in indigenous affairs, particularly in the Northern Territory. The member for Blair spoke to me 
 about a school which was built for the 330 young people who lived in a town. They found that only 30 of the 330 children attended on any individual day, and the great difficulty for the teachers was that it was a different 30 each day.
I recognise there are a whole range of complex cultural issues that impact on an outcome such as that. But clearly, when you have put down the infrastructure to look after 330 students and you find that you are only actually teaching 30 in a day, you have a serious problem. Attendance has got to be a critical focus of our energies in this regard. In my view, we should look at a certain attendance level being a mutual obligation for receipt of particular benefits.
In the area of public housing, I see what is perhaps the greatest abuse. It is not difficult to give the speech on rights and on the fundamental right to shelter. But you see a situation where the number of total outstanding applications has grown from 140,000 in 1985 to 221,000 in 1997. The evil of the program is this. The Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs looking into housing assistance found that over 12 per cent of the applicants were waiting more than five years for public housing. In my electorate, it is routine to wait six or seven years for public housing. The problem is that you have to get under a poverty threshold in order to qualify for public housing. So we are saying to 221,000 people waiting five years to get into public housing, `Stay poor.' We are providing a powerful economic incentive for 221,000 people to stay poor. That is not enlightened social policy.
I stand, as I say, for the first time in my life with a degree of optimism about indigenous affairs in Australia. I feel optimism because of a change in the tenor of the indigenous leadership themselves. We in this place benefited last week from a maiden speech, which will be remembered as one of the great maiden speeches delivered in this place, by Senator Ridgeway. He said in that speech:
It is fundamentally important that the federal government move away from the surrogate role which undermines the achievement of self-sufficiency . . . It is vitally important to the concept of self-sufficiency that, in time, communities must 
 reduce their dependence on government funds in exchange for increased political and economic rights.
That speech by Senator Ridgeway followed another landmark speech by an indigenous leader, which I suspect may be remembered as the most significant speech delivered by any Australian this year. That was a speech delivered by Noel Pearson to the Brisbane Institute on 26 July 1999. He opened with the words:
Like my elders and colleagues in Cape York, I am worried for my mob. We seem to just hold on to our ideals as a matter of philosophy and intellectual debate in the academies whilst the real society and economy unravels in front of our eyes, driven by the public policy ascendancy of those who accept that the growth of an underclass is the unfortunate but inevitable result of larger economic forces about which nothing can be done.
It is the `give up' mentality behind much of our welfare which is the most corrosive aspect of it.
Noel Pearson went on to say:
Negative welfare is a mentality that accepts that welfare resources to able bodied people should not involve reciprocity. It should be provided as a matter of social right.
He is really here articulating the view of the member for Grayndler. He goes on to say:
It is a mentality that accepts that the capable, responsible, powerful state should serve programs to the incapable, irresponsible, and powerless people on the ground.
The speech created considerable national comment. I refer, for example, to the response by Paul Kelly in the Australian , who said:
Aboriginal leader Noel Pearson has blown the whistle on the failed Aboriginal policies of the past generation by declaring that his people want the right to work, not the right to welfare.
Mr Pearson's recent speech to the Brisbane Institute is an assault on progressive Aboriginal orthodoxy and an attack on the urban based, Grayndler based—that is my insertion—political culture that has shaped policy and is an admission that the Aboriginal leadership needs to find a constructive basis for dealing with the Howard government. Nicholas Rothwell in the Australian  observed:
There is a new mood in Australia's relations with its first peoples. Federal and state leaders are responding eagerly to the indigenous voices explor 
 ing the idea of a new compact—constructive engagement, not political confrontation; less dependency, more self-empowerment.
Finally, Mark Latham has contributed very substantially to this debate, and I salute his intellectual leadership. He said:
Two weeks ago in Brisbane, Aboriginal leader Noel Pearson fingered the central failing of Australia's welfare sector: it operates under the suspicion that the poor are hopeless.
This government does not accept that the poor are hopeless, and neither should the rest of Australia. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY (INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,1999-08-30,"—I feel ashamed to be a member of the same parliament as the member for Parramatta. I have never heard such a mean-spirited speech in my life. It was a speech totally bereft of any compassion for human beings. It was totally bereft of any compassion for people who are disadvantaged. He showed a total lack of understanding of the issues that confront people on a daily basis. He really demonstrated his total commitment to economic rationalism in his speech on the Social Security (Administration) Bill 1999 .
The member for Parramatta obviously has no idea of what it is like to be unemployed. He has obviously lived in a very sheltered, insular environment. He has only to come and visit us in the Hunter to see how difficult it is to get a job, how people are desperate to find work and how they would give anything to have a job rather than to be in receipt of benefits. It is not a matter of saying, `You have been unemployed for six months, so we are not going to support you.' Where is that going to lead us? What kind of Australia will that lead us to? If that is the way we in this parliament go, each and every one of us stands condemned. If that is the legacy the member for Parramatta wants to leave to the people of Australia, I think he really should be ashamed of himself.
He talks about punishing young children because they do not go to school. They are, more often than not, young people who come from very disadvantaged backgrounds where there is poverty in their homes. When they do not go to school, what is the member for Parramatta's solution? To cut off financial 
 support to their families. Where is that going to leave those children? What sorts of opportunities will they have for the future? How many more people will we have living on the streets? If that is the type of Australia the member for Parramatta wants, I think he should be condemned, and condemned by every member of this parliament. He has made an absolutely disgusting contribution to this debate.
This legislation that we are considering in the parliament tonight is yet another example of the contempt this government has for those Australians who receive Centrelink payments and for the staff who administer the payments. This legislation will disadvantage both groups. It is legislation that will lead to injustice and create a more complex administration system, even though the government argues that it will actually simplify the act.
On a number of occasions in this House I have accused the government of having 1950s style policies and of looking back to the 1950s for its inspiration. But, on this occasion, it has surpassed itself by reverting to 1940s style legislation. This legislation represents a move back to the Social Security Act of 1947, an act that was rewritten in 1991. The 1991 act located most of the provisions relating to a particular payment together in order to reduce the need for cross-referencing—in other words, making it simpler to administer and making it more user-friendly. This government is moving away from that and looking to increase the red tape.
The government has argued that one aspect of this legislation is the simplification, as I just mentioned, yet it is separating provisions relating to the same payments. How is this going to simplify it? Tell me. You can just see the Centrelink staff in their offices. They have somebody come in with an inquiry about a benefit, so they have a look in the manual: `Yes, okay, that relates to family allowance. I will go over there and look in another part that relates to the family allowance.' By the time they have gone through all of the various manuals and pieces of paper they have to look at, they have spent twice as long on administering the payments.
Will it benefit the Centrelink recipient? I cannot see how having to stand at the counter for a longer period, when they already have to wait, will benefit them. The way I look at it, it is not going to benefit anyone. I was in a shopping centre in my electorate on Saturday and I was speaking to a person who works at Centrelink. This person was complaining to me about how there is an increased demand on their time to administer all of the payments that are being put in place. At the same time that they are having this increased workload, they are having a decrease in staff. So, once again, it is harder for people who work for Centrelink and harder for the people who need to access the services of Centrelink.
The government argues that the act will make minimal changes. I argue that this bill actually makes significant changes, changes that will have a very adverse impact on Centrelink clients. It actually allows the Executive Director of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal to direct that an issue be put before the tribunal by written submission. You might ask, `What problem will that create?' I can see it leading to injustice, particularly for the most disadvantaged clients of Centrelink. These are people who quite often have literacy problems, problems that make it difficult for them to adequately express themselves in a written submission.
Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 8.00 p.m
—Those people who will suffer the greatest disadvantage by being required to supply written submissions to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal are those people who are already disadvantaged to the greatest degree. It is not only those people who have literacy problems who will be disadvantaged by this requirement but also people who come from non-English speaking backgrounds and who struggle with literacy and sometimes with the requirements of our social security system, and indigenous Australians who live in remote areas. That requirement to provide a written submission rather than appear in person will really disadvantage them. The member for Parramatta was quite scathing in his attack when he said some indigenous 
 children do not attend school, but it demonstrates his lack of understanding of the issues that exist in those areas. The requirement to supply a written submission will always disadvantage the most disadvantaged people within the community.
Another change suggested within this legislation is a more strict time limit on appealing decisions. Currently, there is no time limit on the right of an authorised review officer to appeal. This legislation is looking at a time limit, of 52 weeks, except in `special circumstances'. Even though there is no prescribed time limit, effectively most cases do have a time limit, with a 13-week period being imposed on decisions to increase a person's payments. This legislation will put in place a situation where an authorised review officer cannot consider any issue after 52 weeks. You may say 52 weeks is a reasonable period of time, but you need to look at individual situations. What about a situation where a person is extremely disadvantaged? They may fit into the category of having poor literacy skills. They may be a homeless person or a person who has been struggling with a drug and alcohol problem. They may be somebody who has had a psychiatric problem. The people that will be affected by this legislation will tend to be the most disadvantaged people. They are people who change their address—people who go from one place to another. It may be a case of somebody who is a victim of domestic violence. We all know that students frequently change their address. If these people incur some sort of debt and do not appeal the decision within 12 months, that is it.
The legislation fails to define `special circumstances'. What are the special circumstances? Is a special circumstance a situation where a person has changed address and has not received notification? Is a special circumstance a case where a person ends up in hospital or, as I have mentioned, a case where a person has had a drug and alcohol problem or suffers from some sort of psychiatric illness? At the moment Centrelink has a problem in notifying people of overpayments. Within the last month I have seen people in my office who have been advised of debts 
 that they incurred prior to April 1998. Centrelink is in a position where they can now levy these debts on people. It has taken Centrelink over 12 months to work out that these debts are owed, yet they will not extend the same consideration to their clients who may, for some reason or other, have incurred a debt but have not got around to appealing the debt within 52 weeks. A number of issues come into play here. I do not feel that this legislation takes account of them, and I do not think it spells out what the special circumstances are. The legislation is designed to create distress and confusion amongst people in the community, and I think this is something that this government is particularly good at. Once again it is attacking the most disadvantaged people in our community.
In addition, this legislation will require that appeals to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal be lodged within 28 days. You might say, `Twenty-eight days is a month, that's plenty of time.' Although the current time limit for lodging an appeal is three months, they are further limiting the time. They are taking away people's right of appeal and restricting the rights of the most disadvantaged people. Centrelink clients lose all right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal if they do not lodge an appeal with the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, so it is a double whammy—and, as I have already said, it affects the most disadvantaged people. Twenty-eight days is not long. If a family in receipt of family allowance is away on holidays, by the time they get back the 28 days could have expired. I constantly see people who come into my office and say—as I know happens in the offices of other members—that they have not received letters from Centrelink. We do not know why that is, but it does happen.
It is also questionable as to whether the Social Security Appeals Tribunal will be able to consider new information. By not allowing new information to be considered when they are making their decision, even though it can be referred to the secretariat, it is removing the right of people to get true justice, and it is drawing out the process. This bill also reduces compliance times for some, not all, Centrelink clients. This change to their com 
 pliance times means that they will be obliged to advise Centrelink of changed circumstances within seven days instead of 14 days.
At present, pensioners and young people receiving youth allowance and families receiving family allowance have 14 days to comply with the requirement to notify Centrelink of any changes to their circumstances. For instance, under this new legislation, if they receive money through a compensation claim they will be required to advise Centrelink within seven days. On the other hand, if there is a change to an interview requirement or some such thing it will be 14 days. This is confusing, complicated and bureaucratic.
People have difficulty contacting Centrelink. There should be no reduction in the compliance time whatsoever until somebody can pick up a telephone, ring Centrelink and know they will get through. At the moment, there are long waits when people ring Centrelink. They are constantly disconnected and it is by no means a user-friendly system. Pensioners are constantly complaining to me about how difficult it is to get in touch with Centrelink and how confusing it is when they are trying to use the system. It is designed to create confusion and it is designed to affect those people that are most disadvantaged.
This legislation also moves the international social security agreements, currently scheduled under the Social Security Act 1991, to a separate act. It does not significantly change the operation of the international agreements—except by allowing agreements to be added to and varied by regulation. Once again, the question is whether the separation of the act simplifies it or complicates it, and makes it harder to administer. I believe it is another move toward a bureaucratic system. It is not a change designed to improve the system; rather it is a change designed to complicate it. It will increase the red tape and make it harder for staff to work with the legislation and with clients of Centrelink. At a time when their numbers are being slashed by this mean spirited government, it will increase the workload of Centrelink staff. This legislation may appear to be quite benign but 
 it could significantly disadvantage some Australians in receipt of Centrelink benefits.
We heard earlier from the member for Parramatta. In a mean spirited way, he attacked all people in receipt of social security benefits. He showed his lack of understanding of the problems faced by people who are unemployed and by families that struggle within our community. I believe he is symbolic of a lot of people on the other side of this House. This is a government that does not understand the hurt and pain that a number of its policies have caused. It is a government that does not understand ordinary, everyday people. It is a government that does not understand that, if you take money away from the families, you hurt the children. It is the children who will suffer and often they are children who are in the most disadvantaged families in the community. They are children who have to battle extreme conditions and situations of domestic violence. Yet a member of this government argues that those children should be punished.
The member for Parramatta argued that indigenous children should be penalised if they do not attend school. He also argued that anybody who is unemployed and in receipt of social security benefits should have those benefits cut after they have been unemployed for a period of time. He showed a lack of understanding of the problems that ordinary Australians are facing each and every day of their lives. Legislation should be designed to help people get into work and help them improve their education. It should not be designed to punish the most disadvantaged people in the community. It should be legislation that is easy to administer and will help Australians.",REPS,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY (INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Lawrence, Carmen, MP",ALP,1999-08-30,"—I want to address a number of principles that underlie the administration of social security generally and some of the specific provisions of the Social Security (Administration) Bill 1999 . I understand this is a cognate bill, so I will address some broader principles to begin with. One of the most destructive arguments being advanced by a lot of conservative politicians and some commentators around Australia at the moment surrounds the con 
 cepts of mutual obligation and welfare dependency. They are innocent enough—at least it may seem so—yet they have the potential to turn the contract that I believe exists between citizens and their government entirely on its head.
There is a view abroad, amongst some of these people, that people on pensions and benefits do not want to work and will not make the transition to work without the threat and the imposition of penalties by the government. There are some—I am sad to say, especially in government—who seem intent on pushing what is essentially a punitive agenda rather than one which addresses the need to provide opportunities for all of our citizens, the contract that I talked about.
In the provision of social security, we have seen a steady shift away from entitlement as a right once certain eligibility criteria were met to a position where payments are conditional on individualised, quasi-contractual arrangements between the benefit recipient and the relevant agency, and I think that causes problems for our society. This sort of quasi-contractual arrangement is most evident for the unemployed, particularly, as we have seen, for the young unemployed under the banner of the Work for the Dole scheme. It is supposed to turn passive recipients of unemployment benefits into active job seekers. We are seeing the language and logic of the market actively penetrating the provision of public services where I think they do not belong.
One result of this is that the more familiar notions of citizenship and acting together—of collectivity, if you like—are devalued. As Brennan pointed out in 1996:
They are about re-constituting citizens as consumers whose primary interests are personal and private . . . government is reinvented but citizenship, together with policies that bind us together in common cause with one another, is circumvented.
And I must say I think that is a backward step. The problem, as with the industrial relations changes, is that this is a very unbalanced contract with little real power residing with the individual who is in receipt of benefits. Failure, or perceived failure to comply, is punished in a peremptory and 
 often arbitrary fashion with appeal rights, as we see in this bill, being steadily eroded. On the other hand, any failure by the government—and there are many already—to deliver on its side of the bargain the mutual obligation does not attract any penalty at all. Indeed, there is often no public disclosure of these failures, unless by members of this parliament, and no public outrage either.
The recipients of benefits are amongst the most disadvantaged in every sense, including access to the media, so their story does not get up. They are more likely to be pilloried than assisted. One of the ministers responsible for the labour market programs calls them job slobs and, with his colleagues, encourages the view that they deserve their fate somehow, that they are the undeserving poor, that they are losers—something that has been inserted into the Australian vocabulary from the United States—and which I want to totally repudiate.
I am not opposed to the idea that recipients of taxpayers' funds have a responsibility to use those funds to the best advantage of themselves, their families and their communities. This should be true, I might say, whether they are sole parents, farmers in receipt of agricultural subsidies or businesses given tax breaks for investment purposes. They all have an obligation. We do not hear much about the last of those two groups. For unemployed people, clearly, this means providing for themselves and their families from the little they are given by way of cash payments—and it is little—looking for work and improving their education and skills to maximise their employment opportunities. I think everyone understands that. They do not need to be punished to make them understand it.
On the other side of the ledger, the government side of the obligation, first of all there have to be jobs to take up and quality job training and education programs available to make people job ready. Neither is currently the case. Despite recent falls in the published unemployment figures, and I underline the word `published', there are still 10 job seekers for every one vacancy—we have to remember that—and probably many more who are so discouraged they do not identify themselves 
 in ABS surveys. There are simply not enough jobs for everyone who wants one, particularly for unskilled older workers and inexperienced younger job seekers who will not be offered a job.
The mutual obligation rhetoric is too easily used to make those on unemployment and other benefits appear to be responsible for the failings in our system which, of course, are beyond their control. These are the most powerless people in the community. In my experience, most people who are unemployed—and I am sure this is true of most members, if they think about it—are not willing volunteers to that condition. They do not want to be unemployed. Indeed, it is often the cause of great distress from which they would prefer to escape as soon as possible and do, given half an opportunity. Again, they do not need to be punished in order to make them seek work. They are keen to take any opportunity that becomes available. Most, and I think any of us would, clearly prefer to earn more than the unemployment benefit of between $86 and $163 a week, if they could. Only someone from a region with little or no unemployment and not a skerrick of empathy—like Mr Abbott from the electorate of Warringah—could describe these people as job snobs. He fails the Christian test, in my view, of being able to put himself in another's position charitably.
Despite all the government's boasting, it is worth remembering that virtually all the jobs and all of the jobs growth have been in low paid, part-time and casual work. Even those in work often find themselves in poverty. As Michael Raper from ACOSS said in a recent speech:
. . . social security benefits for low income and disadvantaged people are not causing dependency—
when you look at those levels of income that I have talked about—
they are keeping people alive.
How else are they supposed to survive? A lot of the recent comment about increases in the number of people on disability support pensions, for example—and we have seen some of it again today—reflects a failure to understand that many of these people are the victims of the restructuring and downsizing of 
 industries which formerly employed blue-collar workers, and many of them are getting on a bit. Their chances of employment now are realistically vanishingly small, especially if they have, after years of labouring—and I know plenty of them—illnesses and disabilities which prevent their working in many occupations and few transferable skills. We all know of discrimination against older workers or, if we do not, we should.
Anyone with a disability, whatever level, faces substantial barriers to employment. If you are in receipt of a pension of this kind and are made to feel that you are somehow dissembling or malingering, that is a vicious and calculated insult. Indeed, the Department of Family and Community Services's own survey in 1997 found that, in addition to the disability itself, whatever it may be, factors inhibiting the return to employment of some of these people included: the lack of suitable work—a pretty important principle—discrimination on the basis of age or disability, and I might mention, too, pregnancy, as recently reported; the lack of suitable and affordable transport; the lack of appropriate education and training courses, which have been significantly cut in recent budgets; in many cases, especially with older workers and those with significant disabilities, the lack of skills for the work that is available; and, of course, in many cases, employer attitudes, which are of themselves a significant obstacle.
Sadly, rather than assisting in overcoming these problems—which their own department has identified and which, frankly, you do not need to be a genius to work out—the government have cut dedicated funds and programs to assist entry and re-entry of those with disabilities into suitable employment or community activities. They are actually rolling back those programs.
In my own state, for example, they have effectively gutted the very successful post-school options program for young people with disabilities. It took a lot of work to get cooperation between the state and federal governments. The program started in 1991 and it has been operating since then. It is suitable for all people with severe disabilities and takes them from school into supported 
 work. At the moment, no new places are being funded, so the program will run down with those in existing places and new entrants will be accepted only if one of those in an existing place dies. That hardly helps those people with disabilities. Needless to say, the parents and the people themselves are very upset at that reduction in services.
I think it is fair to say that at the moment, with the encouragement of the government, Australia's welfare system and, importantly, the debate about it are at risk of becoming very seriously unbalanced. In my view, there has been far too much emphasis on the obligations of the recipients—we hear it all the time—and their failings and not nearly enough emphasis on expanding opportunities for them and for the community thereby and on encouragement and involvement of those needing financial assistance in the design and implementation of appropriate measures. What about asking them sometimes what they think is a good idea?
Ours, it has to be said, is already one of the most tightly targeted and conditional systems of social security in the world. Access, for example, is far more restricted than the minister responsible seems to understand, but for her and her colleagues the political benefits of bashing those on social security sadly appear to be irresistible—the classic `blame the victim' mentality. Blaming the victim instead of looking at the reasons for growing inequality and for the associated social problems will not only fail to solve the problem that has been identified but I think, most importantly, betrays those in the community who most need our intelligent commitment to policy, not to rhetoric or game plan.
It also allows those, I must say, who have a disproportionate share of the community's wealth to avoid confronting the reasons for that maldistribution and what should be done about it. It is the easy way out. It is far easier for those who are, to use Galbraith's term, part of the `contented majority' to attribute continuing unemployment and poverty to individual shortcomings and a perverse refusal on the part of those unemployed to pull their weight than it is to attribute them to economic and social values and structures which we 
 endorse which inevitably result in so-called social exclusion. They are the things we have to change—the values and the structures—not the behaviour of individuals in this case.
This policy allows us to ignore the fact that as a nation we are rapidly becoming two societies—in income and employment. In the electorate of the minister responsible for many of these labour market programs, the unemployment rate is around two per cent, but in other parts of Australia it is as high as 25 per cent. Similarly, Gregory and Hunter's analysis of the economic distance between different parts of Australia showed that growing income inequality could be attributed in large measure to differences in rates of employment. As we all know and should not need to be told, unemployment is heavily concentrated in specific regional and rural areas where economic activity is in decline and/or the demand for unskilled labour is low. As Gregory and Hunter have suggested:
It may be increasingly true to say that one half of Australia does not know how the other half lives.
And the government apparently wants to keep it that way. Given the levels of unemployment and structural change both globally and nationally, I am amazed that there are some who still think such unemployment and such poverty can be fixed with policies which get tough on the dole bludgers, the welfare recipients. What is clearly needed, on the other hand, are imaginative policies which improve opportunities for people to contribute in some way to their society—and it may not always be in the paid work force—whether through paid work, supported employment, education and training or community participation. Some of those older people on disability support pensions probably cannot return to the labour market anymore, but I am sure they have things to offer our community. We should think of ways of employing them usefully in our society.
Such programs need to be intensive—something that the government is apparently not prepared to do—well funded and based on principles, as I said, of encouragement and involvement, not of penalties and subjugation. In my view, it is the system, the economy, including governments, which have failed 
 these people and not vice versa. These problems are being exacerbated, I might say, by huge cuts to employment programs and to Centrelink, which is often close to meltdown.
—Absolute rubbish, complete rubbish.
—Centrelink is often close to meltdown because it is under so much pressure from staff cuts and rapid, poorly planned change. The minister at the table says it is not happening, but I would have to say that, from the moment these changes were introduced, a steady trickle of complaints from Centrelink became a flood. Is the minister trying to tell me as a member responsible for a very varied electorate that all of these people were making up these difficulties, that the Centrelink staff who rang me in tears were making up these difficulties or that the number of resignations were being made up by these people? Centrelink, which employs some very good people but fewer and fewer of them, is in crisis and it is time the minister understood that.
I will just give a couple of examples, since the minister apparently wants to suggest that there are no problems in this area. I think he needs to understand that the daily bread of any decent member's office is to deal with many of these problems. In one of the cases referred recently to my office, after referral from a Job Networker, a constituent moved nearly 100 kilometres to secure a new job. It looked like he wanted to get employment. His wife and his sick baby moved with him, away from the nearest children's hospital, I might say. The employer who was listed with a Job Network agency underpaid him and `lost his time sheets'. As a result, he left the job and moved back into my local area. He simply was not getting paid.
Upon approaching Centrelink, he was advised that without a separation certificate—as if the employer would give him one under those circumstances—he would not be eligible to have his Newstart allowance reinstated. A little thoughtfulness should have prevented that decision. It was only after intervention by my office—when the fact that extenuating circumstances such as those can mean a separation certificate is not necessary—that 
 his allowance was reinstated. This is the sort of person whose rights to appeal will be curtailed. My office has received a large number of similar complaints about Job Network agencies referring people to unscrupulous employers, something the minister should also address.
To give another quite different example, a constituent twice informed Centrelink in writing that her fiance had moved in with her and asked for the appropriate forms to be sent to her so she could make the necessary disclosures. The new forms were not forthcoming. They were not sent and the constituent found that her family payments were cut off without any discussion or warning. On telephoning Centrelink—she did finally get through—she was advised that it was her problem that the forms were not sent to her because she did not follow the matter up promptly enough. So she should have known in advance that they were not going to arrive. Again, these are the sorts of decisions where appeal will be far more difficult under the circumstances of this legislation.
I think it is time in Australia for a bit of a compassionate rethink, particularly by this government. I think it is time that they have a good hard look at the contract between the government and their citizens. I think it is time they made it possible for people to be encouraged rather than discouraged, to take part rather than sit at the margins; otherwise before too long this will be a society in which we can truly say we are two nations within one. That is not an outcome I think anyone in this parliament would want to endorse, although, given the comments of some members opposite, I sometimes wonder about that too.",REPS,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY (INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Theophanous, Andrew, MP",ALP,1999-08-30,"—I wish to focus my comments primarily on the Social Security (International Agreements) Bill 1999  and the issues surrounding that bill, although I will have something to say about the general social security situation. When you consider the size of this legislation—look at it; this is the size of the legislation—the second reading speech of the then Minister for Community Services on this bill consisted of just three short paragraphs. That 
 is the total statement he had to make on this fundamental issue of social security and international agreements.
If you were to consider that, you would think there were no problems in this area. You would think there were no problems about the issue of international agreements on social security. Of course, the minister would be aware that I have raised a number of questions on notice in relation to this matter, particularly about the fact that we appear to have slowed down completely in relation to these social security agreements, especially with certain countries we have been negotiating with for years and years to try to achieve a reciprocal agreement on international social security. But we have failed to do so.
I have raised questions about Germany, Croatia, Greece and Turkey. They are not the only countries affected, but they are four countries which I have had a particular association with in terms of my foreign affairs involvement. In each of those countries, we have failed to make much progress on social security agreements. We then have the minister producing this document which says:
.	 provides for the consolidation of existing social security international agreements into a separate Act;
.	 provides for new social security international agreements to be added to the Social Security (International Agreements) Act (once enacted) by way of regulation . . . 
But he does not explain how we are going to overcome some of the difficulties and problems in this area. Let me illustrate this by talking about the social security agreement between Australia and Greece, which has been delayed now for about 15 years. I do not say that it is all the fault of the current government. There have been problems.
—That is generous of you.
—Minister, I have been working on this matter both when we were in government and in the current context. I want to know when we are going to be able to resolve this issue and the issue of the three countries I mentioned. In relation to the situation with Greece, the fact is that the government has decided that it is going to change the provisions from those which were 
 given to other European countries such as Italy. The offer which was made for a social security agreement with Greece is completely different from that which has been signed with Italy. Why is that the case? It is the case because the government decided that the agreement which it signed with Italy was one which it was not overly happy with.
In fact, I understand—and maybe the minister can illuminate this for us—that there have been attempts to renegotiate or rediscuss the agreement with Italy on the basis that Italy received too generous an arrangement according to the current government, although I am not sure the Italian community thinks that way. Therefore, the provisions which were offered to Italy were not offered to Greece. As a result of that, the government of Greece decided that it could not understand why the provisions which were offered to Italy should not also be offered to Greece and the government of Greece has decided that it does not want to proceed on an agreement until the provisions which have been received by Italy are also offered to Greece.
On 13 May this year, I asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services a set of questions about the social security agreement with Greece. This followed my asking a number of questions about the agreement with Germany, the agreement with Croatia and the agreement with Turkey. The kinds of responses that we have been getting from both Ministers Newman and Truss on these matters have been such that they are not really dealing with the issue. For example, I asked:
Is it a fact that the Australian Government is insisting on an agreement with Greece which is different from those with other European countries, in particular imposing a 49-year period rather than a 25-year period; if so, why?
The minister answered:
Australia desires a reciprocal Agreement with Greece. The same formula, as used with other European countries, would be applied to people leaving Australia to live in Greece after an Agreement is implemented. The only difference is that the combination of Australian and Greek working life residence will be used to work out the Australian rate of pension for people who have already resettled in Greece. This is necessary due to the limited coverage of Greece's social insurance 
 scheme and because Australia wants to achieve the same level of reciprocity that has been achieved in Agreements with other European countries.
If you can get through all that gobbledegook, it basically means that we are prepared to sign a social security agreement with some countries, provided they have a system of social security themselves which has provided substantial coverage for their people over the last 30 or 40 years. If, on the other hand, their social security system has not provided sufficient coverage from our understanding of the matter—or, more precisely, from the understanding of our bureaucrats in the department of social security—or the social security system of Turkey, Greece or Croatia is insufficient and does not provide enough in the domestic context, they say, `We'll use this as an excuse for demanding different conditions from those countries signing a social security agreement than we do with Italy and with other European countries.'
This is going to create a situation in Croatia, Turkey and other countries around the place—and it has in the case of Greece, where they have been waiting for 15 years—in which we virtually make it impossible to proceed on social security agreements. As I said, the minister gives us this new bill, which is supposed to show how much the matter is under control, but then has nothing to say in the second reading speech about all the issues which are confronting us in this very serious area. Why is this a serious matter? It is a serious matter because, in relation to these agreements, we are talking about Australian citizens who have worked in Australia, many of them for 20, 30, 40 or 50 years, and have decided that they want to live out the last years of their lives in the country from which they originally migrated. They are looking at an agreement which allows for reciprocity in relation to pensions and benefits.
If a person who has the pension goes from Australia to Italy, for example, there are many things which they are not likely to benefit from which they can benefit from in Australia. They do not benefit from the seniors card or various other concessions in Italy that they are able to gain in Australia. Basically, all they get is the pension and, in some countries, 
 an agreement in terms of health provisions with the Medicare system. That is about all.
This is a serious matter because, as you are aware, Madam Deputy Speaker, the current government has decided that it does not want to allow people's parents to come to Australia. We have a situation in the current immigration program where we have now limited the `elderly parents' category to fewer than 500 positions a year. There are 20,000 applicants in this area alone. Of course, many of them would be coming here under social security agreements, and the government of Italy or another government with which we have an agreement would be paying their pension. Those elderly people would come here and have their pensions paid by that government under the agreement. Where is the spirit of the agreement? The spirit of the agreement has been destroyed by the policy on immigration in relation to elderly people. Those 500 positions are not just for elderly people; they are also for brothers and sisters. You can just imagine—if we were to try to process all those people, it would take us about 40 years.
Mr Kerr interjecting—
—The member for Denison will restrain himself.
—The member for Denison is supporting what I am saying. He knows what I am talking about.
—Get on with it, please.
—He knows what I am talking about because he was the shadow minister for immigration. The fact is that we sign these agreements in good faith and yet in our immigration program and in our visitors visa program—that is another issue as well—we do not show the spirit which is supposed to be behind these agreements for elderly citizens coming to live with their children here in Australia and having a social security pension provided by another country. There is a lopsidedness in the whole matter. The governments of Italy, Greece, Turkey, Croatia and Germany do not say that they are going to stop somebody from going back to live the 
 rest of their life in one of those countries, which is what we are doing under the current immigration program.
Unfortunately, in the last few years the immigration program has lost all sense of humanitarian obligation. This is one of those areas. I would like the Minister for Community Services, who is at the table, to tell me this: if you are serious about the signing of agreements with the countries that I mentioned, what progress is being made? Why don't you make a statement to the parliament about the progress in this area? Here was a golden opportunity to do so with this bill, and nothing has been done.
The situation in the case of Greece and these other countries is stalemated. Let me tell you a little bit about the Croatian situation. There is no social security agreement with Croatia because it was decided that their social security system was somehow inadequate for us to have an agreement. But we did not tell the Croatian government that. We said to the Croatian government, `We'll talk about this.' However, the last serious discussion that took place on this matter—before I raised it in parliament—was in 1995. It was only after I raised it in a question to the minister that bureaucratic discussion suddenly took place on the Croatian matter. For a number of years, the whole thing had been frozen not only at a ministerial level but at the level of the bureaucracy. Nothing had been done in relation to a social security agreement, not even discussions of the groundwork between Australia and Croatia.
In relation to Turkey, we are nowhere. We have not progressed the matter, notwithstanding the fact that we have an estimated 100,000 citizens of Turkish background, some of whom—because they are ageing and have made a contribution to Australia—wish there to be a social security agreement so that they can perhaps go and live the last part of their lives in Turkey. And what about those young Turkish people who are trying to bring their parents here to participate in a social security agreement with Turkey? Nothing is happening.
In the case of Greece, we have had a huge and unbelievable saga. The last Minister for 
 Social Security in the Labor government, Mr Peter Baldwin, put forward a number of proposals for the solution of the impasse in the social security agreement with Greece. Unfortunately, shortly after those proposals were put forward, we lost government. It is unbelievable what happened after we lost government in 1996, and I am not sure that the minister at the table is aware of this. Senator Newman decided to completely change the proposals that had been put forward by Mr Baldwin and to go back to square one and much tougher and totally unacceptable proposals were put to the government of Greece. This resulted in acrimonious debate between the government of Greece and the government of Australia. For two years, nothing happened in these discussions because the government of Greece was asking: how can you go back from the proposals put forward by Mr Baldwin?
Just before the election, Minister Newman decided that there could be a bit of problem with this issue and with certain votes in the ethnic community. Therefore, she suddenly decided that the Baldwin proposals might have some substance to them. She decided to review the whole matter and went back to the Baldwin proposals—or, at least, to a version of the Baldwin proposals, because we do not know the fine print of the proposals. All we know is that the minister was prepared to go back to something like the Baldwin proposals. After two more years lost, and now another year lost since the last election, nothing has been achieved in terms of this social security agreement. Not only have some of the people who would have been eligible under this agreement not gained the benefits of such an agreement but many of the people are dying. Many people who contributed many years of their working lives to the Australian community are not getting the benefit of a social security agreement, and they are dying.
Minister, I call upon you to update for this House the answer that you gave to me on 13 May in relation to the social security agreement with Greece and in which, in the fourth clause, you said:
(4) The Australian Government would be prepared to discuss the issue at a ministerial level if neces 
 sary, once the position of the Government of Greece is known.
As far as I am aware, the government of Greece has made its position clear to the Australian authorities, and it is time to act on that agreement. It is also time to act on the agreements in relation to Germany, Croatia, Turkey, Lebanon and a number of other countries. We need to take action in this area.

"Anthony, Larry, MP",NP,1999-08-30,"—I would like to thank all honourable members, including the previous speaker and the member for Parramatta, for their contributions to the debate on these social security bills. This package of bills gives effect to the government's commitment to implement a simpler and more coherent social security system. I am pleased to bring forward these bills to the House and am confident that all members will see the benefits of the simplified arrangements contained in the bills. This legislative package comprises three bills: the Social Security (Administration) Bill 1999 , Social Security (International Agreements) Bill 1999  and Social Security (Administration and International Agreements) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1999 .
As I have said, these bills serve to simplify existing social security arrangements. The Social Security (Administration) Bill 1999 will provide the means to relocate and consolidate existing technical rules for a range of social security payments into one clear and concise set of provisions. In effect, it will bring about a major reduction in the length and complexity of social security law. For example, under these bills there will be only one section dealing with payment claims rather than individual claim sections for each payment type and for other benefits such as concession cards.
The Social Security (Administration and International Agreements) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1999 amends and repeals the provisions of the Social Security Act 1991 consequential upon the enactment of the Social Security (Administration) Bill 1999. The Social Security (International Agreements) Bill 1999 consolidates existing social 
 security international agreements into a separate act. The bill also provides for a new social security agreement to be added to the Social Security (International Agreements) Bill, once it is enacted, by way of regulation.
I should also note that the package in the Social Security (Administration) Bill 1999 also gives effect to some of the recommendations of the Guilfoyle report. These include giving the Social Security Appeals Tribunal the ability to consider matters without having to convene—if it is not required—an oral hearing and also establishing a 12-month time limit in which customers may lodge an application to a Centrelink authorised review officer to appeal a renewable decision. At the same time, there will be scope to extend the time limit in special circumstances.
While there appears to be general support for the bill, a small number of issues have been raised in relation to the Social Security (Administration) Bill 1999. I would therefore like to use this opportunity to state the government's position on a number of these issues. First, in relation to time limits on appeals, it does not surprise me to hear that the opposition is opposed to the introduction of both the 52-week time limit on seeking the review of the decision by an authorised review officer and the 28-day limit for appeals to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. However, it did come as a surprise to read that the opposition believes that A New Tax System (Family Allowance) (Administration) Act 1999 was amended to change both these periods in the Senate. The only time limit that was deleted as a result of amendments in the Senate was the 28-day time limit for appeals to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. This is why the government is seeking to amend the A New Tax System (Family Allowance) (Administration) Act 1999 to insert a 28-day time limit on appeals to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. The government is firmly of the view that the time limits should be introduced for the reasons given by Dame Margaret Guilfoyle. The government also believes that the power to extend the time limits in special circumstances will mean that the time limits will not operate to exclude the 
 rights of review of various disadvantaged groups in the Australian community.
Secondly, it is not intended that section 30 operate to exclude the availability of benefits to any person who currently receives them. It will be necessary to make a determination of the visas to be covered by that section so that it operates to the same extent as the current provisions of the Social Security Act 1991, and this will be done.
Thirdly, there appears to be some confusion between those social security payments which are portable overseas and for which it is necessary to have the proposed section 51 to facilitate the payment of those payments overseas and those social security payments, such as special benefit, which have only a very limited portability. Payments for social security payments with limited portability are paid in Australia while the person is overseas. In fact, the application of the proposed amendment to section 51 by the Democrats may result in those people receiving their instalments once a month overseas instead of fortnightly in Australia. This could cause hardship to the recipients who have commitments to be met in Australia while they are temporarily overseas.
Fourthly, the opposition is under the misapprehension that the government is reducing from 14 days to seven days the time allowed for notifying changes of circumstances. The Social Security (Administration) Bill 1999 has been drafted with great care to ensure that the 14-day notification periods in the Social Security Act 1991 that were inserted as a result of the amendments made by the Payment Processing Legislation Amendment (Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements) Act 1998 were retained. However, equally great care was required to ensure that the seven-day notification requirements for Newstart allowance that were not amended by the act did not become 14 days because this would have undermined the entire payment basis for that allowance.
To receive Newstart allowance, a recipient has to give a statement that relates to the payment of their Newstart allowance in respect of a seven-day period. This has been a well-established principle. If the recipient 
 does not give the statement, Newstart allowance is not payable and if, at a later time, a Newstart allowance becomes payable to the person an administrative breach reduction period applies to that person.
A comparison between section 658 of the Social Security Act 1991 and proposed sections 66, 67 and 71 of the Social Security (Administration) Bill 1999 shows that the bill has in fact reduced the circumstances in which a notice can specify seven days to stimulus payment notices. The bill still provides for 14 days notice for all other notices, other than where a person receives a compensation payment.
Similarly, the Payment Processing Legislation Amendment (Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements) Act 1998 did not alter time periods relating to the receipt of compensation payments. For example, the seven-day period provisions were specifically retained by amendments made in the Payment Processing Legislation Amendment (Social security and Veterans' Entitlements) Act 1998. While there may have been some 14-day periods in the Social Security Act 1991, the periods were standardised at seven days for all payments. Therefore, it is unclear why the opposition would be criticising the notification provisions aspects of the Social Security (Administration) Bill 1999.
This package of bills meets the government's commitments to a simpler and more coherent social security system. A significant outcome of the package will be that there will be far less social security legislation—about 500 pages less—and it will be more consistent. I am sure that this will be of great benefit to community groups, Centrelink customers, Centrelink staff and the administration of social security law. The bill provides for legislation that, firstly, is consistent across payment types; secondly, facilitates movements between payment types; thirdly, is easier to administrate; and, fourthly, reflects the current and desired best practice in administration and customer service. I therefore commend the bills to the House.
Question put: 
	That the bill be now read a second time.

Message from the Governor-General recommending appropriation announced.",REPS,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY (INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,1999-08-30,"—The A New Tax System (Taxation Laws Amendment) Bill (No. 1) 1999  seeks to implement two essentially administrative reforms which, nonetheless, are of vital importance to taxpayers. They are the amendments to the pay-as-you-go system, the PAYG, and the amendments to the running balance account arrangements. Labor does not oppose either of these proposals in principle. But, as the second reading amendment which is being circulated by the opposition states, we are concerned about the process relating to the legislation. This is really part of the business tax reform process and should therefore be dealt with in conjunction with other parts of that process.
 The most important elements are obviously those areas which have been reviewed by the Ralph committee. The government has now been sitting on the Ralph committee final report for a month. Why hasn't this report been released? Labor has consistently argued for its disclosure and an opportunity for consultation on the important issues contained 
 therein—full consultation, that is, not narrow and secretive consultation. For all of his bravado on tax reform, the Treasurer's silence on the process associated with Ralph is deafening. Labor's position on the process of the Ralph report is straightforward and sensible: release it, consult on it, negotiate with Labor on it and identify the common ground, which will lead to speedy passage of agreed legislation.
It was interesting as well as refreshing to hear the Prime Minister today in question time saying, `We are prepared to sit down and make sure that we have the most pro-investment taxation system coming out of Ralph.' He also said he was supportive of a `hands across the table exercise' with the opposition. If the Prime Minister wants hands across the table, why won't his Treasurer respond to correspondence from me seeking negotiations on the Ralph report and its recommendations? I sent correspondence to him, and to the chairman of the committee, John Ralph, three weeks ago seeking a briefing on the Ralph report so that we could analyse and be prepared for what we hoped would be the consultation period. We sought a comprehensive briefing and a commitment to negotiate the common ground but we have had no response.
Here today we have the Prime Minister and the government posturing about dialogue but smirking in their hubris, having failed to productively respond to requests made weeks ago. This is the height of arrogance. I said to the House last week that pursuing proper processes from the beginning is the only way for the government to demonstrate its bona fides in this regard—so far, it is failing the test. It also determines the extent of any Senate inquiry. We will judge the government's intention by their actions on this issue. The alternative will be another mad GST scramble at the end, with all of its imperfections.
The government will not serve the business community, our competitiveness and the economy well if they pass up the opportunity for bipartisanship. The choice is still with the government but they should decide now whether they want a cooperative process or a 
 repeat of the earlier experience. The Ralph process has been a good one. It was the process that Labor said it would follow. Stakeholders were involved in consultations with the committee and were able to have an input into and comment on the various discussion papers released over the months that the review was undertaken.
Why are we departing from that formula now? As soon as we get to the business end of the process, to the time when decisions are being made, suddenly the secrecy of the government takes over. We know from the Federation Fund scandal that this government are afraid of scrutiny. We know that they will try to rort any proper process. They are afraid of open government and they run away from operating transparently. But this simply is not good enough in the current context. Businesses have a right to input into a process which will fundamentally affect them. Why should they have to wait in the dark until they are told of what is in store for them?
The Ralph final report should be released—with the exception of market sensitive information and that is a judgment we recognise the Treasurer may want to make—immediately. In fact, it should have been released a month ago. The proposals in the report may come into operation as early as 1 January. That is only four months away, yet nobody knows what they are. What sort of a government are you running? There is no point in arguing the need for this comprehensive review and then ramming it through without any opportunity for people to contribute. Minister, what is the point of secrecy if you are not going to get the best outcome?
It is a very difficult, if not impossible, timetable to meet, even if business knows what the government has in store for it. But it is arrogant in the extreme to simply say, as the Treasurer is, `We will release the report when we are good and ready and not before.'
—That is right.
—It is right, the minister says. This is the way the Treasurer and his sidekick want to operate—arrogance, hubris, no effective consultation and no genuine commitment to bipartisanship. What is it that you are hiding? The Ralph report is an advisory report 
 to government. It is not the government's proposals; it is the recommendations by an expert group. That is what it is. The public has a right to digest what the experts have to say and then to evaluate the government's response.
So the current process is seriously deficient. If we add to this the fact that there is additional legislation both before the House now and supposedly coming in the future, we see that all proposals have to be considered together. That is our view. We should be treating them as a whole, as a package. We should be understanding the full implications of the totality, not piecemeal, so that the whole system can be evaluated properly.
There are also other elements of the PAYG system which are not covered in this bill. We are told by the government that we will have to wait for a later piece of legislation to cover some vital areas of pay as you go, especially the reporting requirements of employers to the Taxation Office. This also simply is not good enough. Labor's position on this proposed process is summed up in our second reading amendment, and I move:
That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House calls on the Government not to proceed with the bill until:
(1)		 the final report of the Ralph Committee, except for market sensitive information, has been released by the Government;
(2)		 full consultations have been undertaken with relevant stakeholders regarding the report's proposals; and
(3)		 matters directly related to this legislation (namely the reporting requirements of PAYG withholders to the Taxation Office which are critical to the proper evaluation of this legislation and are to be included in subsequent legislation) are before the House, so that the House can evaluate the full effects of this bill.""
I will be seeking to talk to this amendment when this bill continues to be debated. Australian businesses which already face the GST and the Y2K circumstances over the next 10 months are entitled to have some certainty about business tax. The motion I have just 
 moved is aimed at providing that certainty, and it ought to be supported by this House.
I want to go now to the specific provisions of the bill and, first of all, to the pay-as-you-go system. The bill proposes to introduce some of the provisions concerning the so-called PAYG system, announced by the government in its package last year. It deals with two categories of administrative issues.
First, there are the withholding systems where payers, for example employers, are required to keep—that is, withhold—a certain amount of payments that they make to other persons and then send them to the ATO, the Taxation Office, on behalf of payees. The most well known of these systems is the pay-as-you-earn system for employees, but there are many differing types. Second, there are the payment systems, which are the arrangements by which tax instalments are sent to the Australian tax office by companies and individuals who are not employees. The withholding system will apply to payments made on or after 1 July 2000. The instalment system will apply for the 2000-01 income year and later income years.
The Taxation Administration Act 1953 will be amended to enable the 11 existing payment and reporting systems—for example, pay-as-you-earn, the prescribed payment systems, the reportable payment systems and other withholding systems as well as the provisional tax and company instalment systems—to be abolished or replaced. The new pay-as-you-go arrangements will incorporate the following two systems.
First, a pay-as-you-go withholding system will replace the PPS and the RPS systems and incorporate the main elements of the current pay-as-you-earn system. The remaining withholding systems which cover various payments—for example, dividends, interest and royalties—will also be standardised and become part of the new pay-as-you-go withholding system. Second, a pay-as-you-go instalment system will replace the current provisional tax and company tax instalment systems. Broadly, under this system, taxpayers will make payments in arrears, generally on a quarterly basis, that reflect their current trading and investment conditions or are 
 based on last year's tax, and some small taxpayers will be able to choose to pay an annual instalment.
The trouble with the legislation is that it is not complete. The House is being asked to approve a major new system which will completely alter both the withholding obligations and the tax payment obligations of all business taxpayers. This is of critical importance in the day-to-day operations of all employers. They need to know how the system will work in its totality, but the government is not telling them. Indeed, it may be that it does not know yet what the whole system will look like. Perhaps that is why we do not have the full proposals. But, either way, it is not acceptable.
First, the amendments in this bill do not include the critical areas of recovery, procedural and evidentiary provisions to facilitate the commissioner recovering debts under the new pay-as-you-go withholding system. Australian businesses will have to get across the detail of this legislation and implement it perfectly from day one, or they potentially will face financial penalties and/or recovery action from the tax office. The government says in the explanatory memorandum that these further amendments will be introduced in a later bill as generic recovery rules for those debts and debts arising under other acts administered by the commissioner.
If you are setting up your business systems in order to comply with the new arrangements, one of the key design features is the documentary trail that the system will generate. Obviously, this documentation will be critical in dealing with any inquiries from or disputes with the tax office.
The only way that business can be certain that their new system will be adequate to comply with the new arrangements will be to know what the new provisions, such as the evidentiary provisions, will be. At the moment, they cannot be certain because the government has not yet made its proposals public. This would be bad enough in a normal taxation environment, but in the context of business having to cope with, firstly, the Y2K bug and its aftermath and, secondly, the massive complexities of implementing the 
 GST it is unacceptable. This is not the only area where the bill is deficient.
But the legislation before us today is critically deficient in terms of the integrity of the pay-as-you-go withholding provisions. The government claims that the new arrangements are supposed to assist in clamping down on the cash economy. It is a worthy goal and one that is supported by Labor, but it takes more than just words to make the tax system fairer. What it takes is a determination on the part of the government to make it happen and action to put in place the right legislative and administrative arrangements.
Critical to this is the information system dealing with payments which constitute income. If there is no effective system in place to deal with this information, the integrity of the new system will not be guaranteed. But the bill before us today is silent on the key issue. Again, the government's answer is that contingent legislation will be introduced some time in the future with amendments detailing the reporting requirements of withholders to the commissioner. So business has not yet been told what its obligations will be in advising the tax office of the amounts that it has withheld from payments nor the details of amounts that it has paid where it has not withheld any tax.
This bill deals only with the reporting requirements of withholders to payees. Standardising withholding arrangements is supported by Labor. If done properly, it should lead to lower compliance costs for business and administrative costs for government over time. That said, there are always transition costs in moving to new arrangements. This is especially so in the context of the GST being introduced at the same time as the Ralph business tax process.
Labor indicated before the election that we would pursue this type of standardisation policy because of the potential for efficiencies and simplification. This is really building on the law simplification process started by Labor, known as the Tax Law Improvement Project, where we are systematically upgrading the law, simplifying it and standardising provisions where feasible.
In addition, the proposals in the bill fill in a significant gap in the current withholding systems—that is, the treatment of workers employed by labour hire contractors. Workers employed by labour hire firms will be treated as employees and brought under the pay-as-you-earn net under this bill. This is a very important reform, as labour hire firms are growing very strongly and may soon employ a large proportion of the work force. It would be unfair to grant labour hire firms a competitive advantage over traditional employers by having a different rate of withholding for their employees compared to the employees in traditional employment roles. So this is an area that can be called reform, and Labor is happy to support this principle of equality.
However, Labor has significant concerns about another aspect of the proposed withholding arrangements. The reason for concern is that there is currently a significant trend towards employees being reclassified as contractors, even though for all intents and purposes they work as if they are employees. These people are known as `dependent contractors', as they generally only work for one employer. They are contractors in name only, and they are often forced to change their status by employers.
Unbeknown to these dependent contractors, they can lose many of their industrial rights when they cease to be employees. They can lose leave entitlements and other important conditions, such as workers compensation coverage. Even if the law covers these situations, very often the practice does not. Employers pursue this course for industrial purposes and they use the system as an inducement. This benefit to employees is largely tax driven and has the potential to severely erode the PAYE base.
This tax benefit has two aspects. First, less tax is withheld when the payment is initially made. Twenty per cent is the general rate, which is much less than the comparable PAYE rate in well-paid occupations. Also, independent contractors are able to claim many more deductions than those available to employees. These claims are then made by dependent contractors as well. As news of these types of arrangements spread, obviously 
 workers become interested in pursuing this option, as it can effectively be sold as a net pay rise. But the problem for these workers is that, if they are found out, they will cop the big tax bill, not the employer who has facilitated the arrangement.
So the employers win by reducing their costs, with the employee losing entitlements and sailing close to the wind for taxation purposes. This so-called PAYE tax base erosion is estimated by the tax office to cost the system between $½ billion and $1 billion per year. It was estimated in the Buchanan report at over $2 billion per year, and it is growing as employers pursue contracting more vigorously.
The problem with this bill is that it proposes that the PPS system be abolished. This will increase the tax incentive to change into a dependent contractor, as the current 20 per cent PPS rate will reduce to nil. Clearly, this will provide an even stronger incentive for dependent contractor relationships to flourish. It is true that those dependent contractors who enjoy the nil rate will have to be registered for GST purposes. However, this is still considered to increase the incentive for employees to convert to contractors.
Without seeing the anti-avoidance provisions nor the employers' reporting requirements to the tax office, it is very difficult to argue that this system will in fact help to clamp down on the abuse of the PPS system. On this basis, Labor says we should not support the abolition of the PPS system, which at least normally collects 20 per cent of the payment, until we are satisfied about the integrity of the new pay-as-you-go system. We cannot be certain about that until we have the contingent legislation which I have mentioned before. Consequently, Labor is concerned that, in the absence of a comprehensive regime to match and cross-check the new proposed arrangements, the threat to the PAYE tax base can be expected to increase, not to decrease.
Mr Hockey interjecting—
—The minister at the table says that I am a hard man. I am not. I am looking for fairness, and this government should not baulk at it. In addition, if the 
 company tax rate is cut to 30 per cent, Joe, this will also increase the incentive for high income employees to operate as contractors through companies. This is a very difficult issue to address legislatively as obviously we do not wish to hamper the activities of legitimate small business contractors.
Labor sponsored a Senate motion, which was carried, which requested that John Ralph's committee examine the issue in his review of business taxation. It is unclear if this in fact has occurred. We would like to know if it has. However, it is also expected to have been given some consideration in the Ralph committee final report. This is simply another reason why the government should release that report now so that the proposed solutions can be debated and evaluated. The revenue neutrality demand for the business tax exercise provides an opportunity to secure bipartisanship for this issue to be fairly resolved with an anti-tax avoidance measure. The resultant revenue would then be available as part of the tax reform process.
Business has indicated privately to the opposition a commitment to look favourably at addressing this and other anti-avoidance mechanisms in the context of meeting the revenue neutrality test. We should remember that the substantial revenue associated with this bill, which is almost $5 billion over four years, cannot be taken into account in the revenue neutrality equation. Why? Because these measures were announced in the ANTS document and the revenue from them is not therefore available for the business tax reform process. These funds were used to partially fund the unfair GST tax package. They cannot be double counted in the business tax exercise.
Labor supported this proposal without a GST prior to the last election. The main political issues in these administrative matters are the bringing forward of the timing of payments of company tax and the abolition of provisional tax. Currently, companies enjoy a benefit relative to pay-as-you-earn individuals in being able to pay some of their income tax liability after their income is earned. Pay-as-you-earn individuals on the other hand have amounts withheld when they actually earn 
 their wages. Labor reduced this preference for companies considerably when in office. However, this company tax deferral benefits companies by billions of dollars per year. There is no equity case to continue the current arrangements. However, there will be some cash flow costs imposed on business in the transition to this pay-as-you-go system.
This parliament should be mindful of the concerns of business about further costs being imposed on business. There are complicated transitional rules to attempt to ameliorate the effects. However, the objective is for the Commonwealth to obtain its tax revenues earlier and, by definition, this must impact on business cash flow. This disadvantage to business is not a reason to oppose the measure but should be borne in mind in careful consideration of the detail of the proposals. My colleague the member for Canning, who ran a small business prior to entering this place, will also be focusing on this aspect when she addresses the matter.
Pay as you go will facilitate the abolition of provisional tax. This is a much hated impost by some who have to pay it based on the generally incorrect notion that provisional tax is a prepayment of tax. It is generally not. Provisional tax was introduced to try to roughly equate the timing of tax payments between pay-as-you-earn employees and non-employee individuals who, up until then, did not have to pay tax until after their income year had finished. This broad equivalence is achieved for most individuals by requiring them to pay an estimate of their tax for the year after nine months of the year. Thus, the taxpayer gets up to nine months deferral on paying most of their tax but must pay the rest three months early.
While most taxpayers who have to pay tax will support getting rid of provisional tax, many will in fact be worse off under the quarterly pay-as-you-go system which will replace it. Many people in the community will think that they will get a great benefit from those proposals, but they will not. What they will get is a much more complex system which provides some marginal benefits to some taxpayers which are more than offset by the cash flow disadvantage that will be 
 imposed on other businesses. It is interesting in the context of Ralph that there is talk of changing the taxation base by broadening it, either through the so-called cash flow option or through restricting specific tax expenditures to fund the cut in the corporate rate. It is just another reason why this bill should be held over until the Ralph report is released.
Running balance accounts is the other area covered by the legislation. This refers to the process where the different taxation liabilities of business—that is, their own income tax and fringe benefits liabilities—are merged into a single account, the RBA, to simplify both tax compliance and tax administration. This merging process has started as an accounting practice of the ATO, but administration is still legislatively handled discretely in different areas of the ATO. The RBA will merge all tax liabilities and tax assets of the taxpayer and the resultant running balance will determine either the net amount that the taxpayer owes or is owed at any point in time. Labor is not opposed to this as it would provide benefits to both taxpayers and to the Commonwealth.
In conclusion, whilst not opposing the thrust of the bill, we seek deferral of its consideration until the final Ralph report is released, consultations are held with stakeholders and related contingent legislation dealing with reporting requirements to the ATO is before the House. The matters dealt with are complex. Business should be given the opportunity to comment on the myriad specific proposals. (Time expired)
—Is the motion seconded?
—I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT) BILL (No. 1) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,1999-08-30,"—I rise to support the government's measures in the A New Tax System (Taxation Laws Amendment) Bill (No. 1) 1999 . In following the member for Hotham, it is particularly interesting to see that after 13 years of Labor government they come in and say, `We need more time to examine this whole proposal—the pay-as-you-go tax and provisional tax provisions.' They had 13 years to fix the proposals and did nothing. The government has taken 
 the initiative and has this as part of the new tax system proposals, which is quite a significant change. It will be a great plus for small business and is welcomed by the business community, yet Labor members say they want more time because there are discussions in place with the business community about other initiatives that are being considered by the Ralph report.
Mr Deputy Speaker, you and I know that, during the 13 years that Labor was in power, many considerations were brought to the government as to how they could improve business taxation overall. But did they implement any to assist the corporate sector or the business sector generally? The answer is no. Yet we have the most significant, far-reaching reforms by way of taxation changes that this parliament has seen since Federation. We have introduced these proposals into the House and have them before us as part of the ancillary requirements for the bill, yet they are saying, `We need to look at what else you are thinking of.' Not only is this `can do' government looking at the whole aspect of changing the relationship between the states and the Commonwealth and providing incentives for exporters, tax cuts for the average salary and wage earner and real incentives for the people of Australia but it is also considering a whole range of other taxes.
Mr John Ralph, who has been chairing the committee, has been considering other proposals. This government has introduced the most significant changes that we have seen to the new tax system, and it should not rest there. We should also be looking at other proposals. How else can business move forward? What other incentives are required to ensure that the economic miracle in Australia continues by way of our economic progress? How else can we ensure that we have four to 4½ per cent growth in the economy continuing at least for the short term and into the future?
The member for Hotham is saying, `We want to know it all.' It is quite clear that this government have an agenda of reform and change and they are implementing that. The member for Hotham sits there on the sidelines and says, `If only we had had this initiative. If only we had had this vision of where we 
 want to take this country.' You do not need to be an economic Einstein to understand the provisions before us. We are simply making a number of provisions simpler for the average businessperson to understand. Any small businessperson would know that one of the key tax requirements they must meet is provisional tax. It is quite an imposition each year: they suddenly have to meet a large tax bill.
This is going to change all that. In the past you were faced with having to pay tax once a year—before you actually earned your income; this is a real pay-as-you-go situation. You will have this four times a year based on the income that you earn, then you pay the tax. It is not something that you pay up-front, where you can earn a lot more or, in some cases, a lot less and you bear the penalty as an individual self-employed businessman or businesswoman. These proposals take account of that. Instead of having to go to the tax office 22, 24 or 25 times, which is the average for the small businessperson, you need to go only four times. Everything is brought together in one simplified proposal in the provisions before us.
For the average businessperson, this is a great revolutionary step. They look forward to the provisions of the Ralph report. As an individual and as somebody who has contact with the business community, I look forward to that as well. I am sure that we would all like to see a 30 per cent tax rate. Many in the community are advocating that. I am sure that if we had a tax rate of 30 per cent we would see many more businesses getting going, establishing in Australia and saying, `This is the place where real business opportunity exists. This is the place where government provides the incentives that we need.' With these provisions the government is looking after the businessman and woman in Australia.
If we look at the provisions, firstly, there is only one income tax collection system. The new PAYG will replace provisional tax, company instalments, pay-as-you-earn tax, prescribed payments and reportable payments. It also draws together in one system all the other withholding arrangements like non- 
 resident withholding, tax file number withholding and withholding from mining and natural resource payments. It is one income tax collection system.
Secondly, all businesses will pay tax instalments at the same time. In the past, a small business person paid it up-front. A large corporation paid it after they got it. In these proposals, a single activity statement reduces the frequency of contact between the Taxation Office and businesses. At the moment, there are five different payment arrangements for businesses. Individuals must pay earlier than companies and before all of their income is earned. Companies pay later, after the income is earned in most cases and well after the end of the income year. Most businesses and investors will pay PAYG instalments on the income they receive each quarter. I do not think it could be fairer than that. You do not need to run out and say, `The sky is falling! We need more time.' It is a simple approach: you pay it each quarter, and everyone is the same. I can see various members in the House. We often advocate the proposal that like companies pay like tax. All businesses will pay the same tax every quarter.
The next provision is that individuals paying their tax quarterly will pay after the quarter. Currently, most taxpayers pay a percentage of last year's tax, and individuals also pay an uplift factor. PAYG instalments will be based on actual income. What is fairer than that? It is not based on the estimate of last year and a projection carried out. It is based on what you earn. That has simplified the previous arrangements and is a much fairer provision. Taxpayers will pay less when they earn less and more when their income increases.
The next provision is that the instalments will be based on income actually received in the quarter, which is a much fairer system. It takes account of fluctuations in earnings, which are quite common for many individuals and organisations. It will also be clearer which payments a business should deduct withholding tax from, making it easier for businesses to comply. There will be less need for an employer to make a difficult judgment about whether their payee is an employee or 
 an independent contractor. The no-ABN withholding will also impact on the cash economy, making it more difficult for tax evaders.
The member for Hotham was talking about the black economy and how we want to move on these tax evaders. Surely this system will make it easier to do so. It will be possible for businesses and their contractors to choose to enter into a voluntary agreement. Under these agreements, the businesses will withhold and, in most cases, the contractors will not have to charge GST. Finally, the new no-ABN withholding tax will impact on the cash economy by making it harder for unscrupulous operators to evade their fair share of tax. I think all Australians would say that that is appropriate and totally fair.
There have been a number of criticisms of this bill, and I have heard the member for Hotham talk about some of them tonight. There is a criticism that the 200 pages involved in achieving reduced compliance costs by removing uncertainty and reducing the amount of paperwork and the number of payments will achieve the opposite. This is totally incorrect. The new clear English guidelines evolved in accordance with the policy we took in introducing the new tax system to ensure that people do not have to be taxation lawyers to understand how to comply with the new tax system. This is a simple approach. It is set out clearly in clear English guidelines, and this criticism of the papers that are needed is a total furphy.
There is a criticism that this is adding to the Australian Taxation Office's burden. This complaint is totally erroneous. A company may have to contact the ATO up to 32 times per year to pay sales tax quarterly, PAYE every month, company tax quarterly, fringe benefits tax quarterly and so on—all on different dates. From now on, instead of these individual contacts for each aspect of the taxation reporting that they need to make to the ATO, they need to make just four reporting dates each year. The suggestion of an extra burden on the ATO is simply erroneous.
The next suggestion is that the government should wait until businesses are acquainted with the new GST before introducing PAYG. 
 This was the line that the member for Hotham was trotting out. It is very easy to do this. You were a do-nothing government when you were in power. When you are confronted with a can-do government, your reaction is, `We need more time. It's all too hard. Let's wait and see how it works out, what this other committee is doing over here and what they're doing over there. We can't cope with what we will say to the trade union movement overall.' This is nonsense. It is a simple solution; it is entirely integrated within the new tax system. It makes sense. The business community supports this proposal. It means that individual business people are going to be better off. They will pay according to their tax rates. It is an equitable system overall. The whole concept of the member for Hotham saying, `Let's delay it and wait and see what the Ralph report has to say, let's wait until the GST system is in place,' is total nonsense. It is all part of the total package that we have.
Some commentators have suggested that corporate Australia is heading for a cash flow squeeze as the PAYG legislation brings forward $5 billion in corporate tax collection. The bringing forward of revenue has always been openly stated in the new tax system. The government has not avoided that. At present, companies are paying later in the year than perhaps they should. In lining up payment dates, we have ensured that it will be done in instalments. All but the largest companies will receive cash flow benefits which are more significant than the negative features of the PAYG in this regard. The Labor Party are constantly saying, `Let's hold onto the old system,' in the same way they want to hold on to the wholesale sales tax with all its inequities and overcosting. This is a process where the great majority of companies are going to be significantly better off.
Finally, the government is aware of some definitional problems with `payments under labour hire arrangements' and is moving to tighten up this area of the bill. It is not the intention to include such relationships as those between solicitors and barristers. I have heard the comments of the member for Hotham about contractors or consultants whom the company has contracted out and questions 
 of classification. That is an area that needs review, and the government has clearly said that the question of relationships needs to be more closely defined.
Overall, what we have in these provisions within the  A New Tax System (Taxation Laws Amendment) Bill (No. 1) 1999  now before us is a sensible proposal. It will assist small business throughout Australia; it will recognise the various ups and downs of business income—of cash flow variations—which will give real incentive to small business; and it will provide assistance in paying after the event for small business, in that it will not be a once-off up-front payment where they need to have to then relate to the tax office with a myriad compliance taxes and reporting.
There will be one basis of reporting and payments will be made four times a year, after the event, according to the income of that particular individual and that particular company. Nothing could be fairer. It is equitable and comparable, whether you be a very large company or a small one-person operator in Australia. It is part of the government's total reform of the taxation system in this country. I am sure that all Australians would say, `Let's get on with the task and not go on with the total nonsense that the Labor Party is talking about, which is delaying it for delaying sake.'

"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,1999-08-30,"—I have to say that I was mightily amused to hear the member for Cook referring to the clear English guidelines for this legislation. I wonder whether he has actually had a look at the explanatory memorandum to the A New Tax System (Taxation Laws Amendment) Bill (No. 1) 1999 . At paragraph 2.104 on page 69, for example, it uses expressions like:
An entity that pays quarterly PAYG instalments based on the Commissioner's rate and their instalment income, may choose to use its own instalment rate instead of the Commissioner's instalment rate when it works out the amount of its instalment for an instalment quarter. 

We have this sort of stuff for over 100 pages, so I am sure that small business will be delighted that the member for Cook has been looking after them in that way. Indeed, I think the issue of complexity is one of the critical issues we need to confront when we are looking at this legislation because this is part of what the government has trumpeted as `not a new tax, but a new tax system'. Try telling that to small business once they have had the opportunity to have a look at it and appreciate just how complex the new PAYG instalment system is in practice.
The government claim that this new system is simpler than the current arrangements. The  A New Tax System (Taxation Laws Amendment) Bill (No. 1) 1999  is one which is supposed to embody a simple new system. But an examination of the explanatory memorandum shows just how hollow that claim is. It takes no fewer than 38 pages to explain this simple new pay-as-you-go system. Just how are busy small business people supposed to get across this kind of detail when they are trying to run their own business? The only viable option is for small business to consult their accountants to try to help them through this new maze. That means additional cost and more time taken off running and hopefully growing their business. Remember that this is a government that promised to cut the paperwork burden in half for small business. In fact, it is a government which is doubling it. Not only has it reneged on that commitment—presumably a non-core promise—but it is also actively making things worse.
We already know that the GST is starting to impact on small businesses. They are starting to get invoices which include GST—in respect of insurance, for example. Some small businesses are also already having to start charging GST where contracts span 1 July 2000 and, indeed, many of these businesses are not aware of these obligations. I notice this as I am talking to small businesses myself. Some of them are aware, some are asking questions and some are blissfully ignorant. Some will get a rude shock next year when they get a tax bill for contracts when they have not charged their clients. 
 They will end up with that tax liability, that GST liability, themselves.
As they are trying to come to grips with the complexities of the GST, they will also have to come to terms with the PAYG system in this bill. They will have to know which types of payments should have amounts withheld from them or face the consequences if they get it wrong. They also have to know how the new instalment system is going to work. I ask the question: how many government members, including the member for Cook who spoke before, can explain the intricacies of this bill to a small business person? Which member opposite would back themselves to accurately advise people on the difference between the following concepts contained in this bill? First, you have notional tax; second, adjusted tax; third, adjusted assessed tax; fourth, GDP-adjusted notional tax; fifth, adjusted taxable income; sixth, adjusted withholding income; and seventh, adjusted assessed taxable income. I invite members opposite—and indeed any member in the House—to get up and guarantee that they can tell us and get all those right under pain of financial penalty. Because that is how it works for small business. All Australian small businesses will face either getting these things right or having to pay those penalties if they get them wrong.

"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,1999-08-30,"—I rise to restate my opposition to a 24-hour international airport at Badgerys Creek. In so doing, I will refer to views expressed in a well-balanced speech which was presented recently to an anti-airport rally at Penrith by Clover Moore, the Independent member for Bligh in the New South Wales parliament. Clover is also a member of the federal government's community forum which was established to relieve the inner city of aircraft noise and pollution. In her speech Clover Moore said:
As the representative of an inner eastern Sydney electorate which has been assaulted by jet noise for the first time following the introduction of the so-called long term operating plan for Sydney airport and the political manipulation of flight paths, I am committed to ridding inner Sydney of the jet noise assault which is so destructive of residential amenity.
But in doing so I don't support pushing noise onto residents in other parts of our city. I am here today to support your opposition to the construction of Badgerys Creek airport because:
.	 I do not believe that any Sydney resident should be subject to the noise impact and risks of a major airport in the metropolitan area; and
.	 I do not believe that a second airport will provide any real benefit for inner city residents since Kingsford Smith would remain a busy and expanding airport.
The only solution which guarantees peace and quiet for all Sydney residents, and provides for Sydney's future air traffic needs, is a replacement airport outside the Sydney basin, in an environmentally suitable location, with investment in the infrastructure to make it viable and accessible.
The point of Clover's address was that two airports in the Sydney basin would result in continual expansion of both Badgerys Creek and the Sydney airport to cope with the predicted doubling of air traffic in the next 10 to 15 years, and its tripling over the next 20 years.
The issue of employment opportunities for people in Western Sydney has been put forward as a reason for the airport to be built at Badgerys Creek. I believe this is an excuse rather than a reason. The main reason that the Badgerys Creek site was selected in the first place was that, at that time, the site was far enough away from major residential areas not to be a major environmental concern yet close enough to Sydney CBD to minimise infrastructure costs. Certainly the former argument no longer stands up.
It should be remembered that employment opportunities go to people with the skills, not necessarily to those who live under the flight paths. Any net job growth that would arise from Sydney's second airport would be available to all citizens irrespective of where they lived. There would also be a transfer of some existing staff from KSA to Sydney's second airport. The aircraft industry itself is 
 a highly technical industry rather than being a labour intensive one. Over time there is likely to be an increase in the technical side of the industry and a decrease in the labour force.
What should be understood about employment in the aircraft industry is that much of the maintenance work on aircraft can be performed overseas. Qantas currently has a large jet maintenance facility at KSA and there are a number of maintenance and servicing facilities at the Bankstown airport. If forced to relocate to a second Sydney airport, Qantas could move its maintenance facilities to Brisbane, Melbourne or Auckland. Australia does not build international aircraft, and all equipment for aircraft is imported. The maintenance of aircraft could be transferred to a number of major overseas locations.
The creation of a large retail outlet at international airports does not result in a net increase of employment opportunities for local residents. The effect is that local retail activities are sucked into an international airport complex similar to the effect that major suburban shopping complexes have on local strip shopping centres.
The figures used by the pro-Badgerys Creek lobby group to predict employment growth as the result of a second airport at Badgerys Creek are greatly exaggerated. Due to globalisation, the aircraft industry would appear to be an unreliable source of increasing employment opportunities in Australia. The very fast train project linking Melbourne, Canberra, Sydney and Brisbane has the potential to create more employment opportunities than expanding our aircraft industry. By the year 2019, Western Sydney will have a population greater than that of the rest of Sydney.
The final question I put to this parliament is: if the federal government were looking for the first time at a suitable site for Sydney's second 24-hour no-curfew international airport, would it put it in the middle of Sydney's fastest growing residential area? Undoubtedly the answer would be a very loud and emphatic no!",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Second Sydney Airport: Badgerys Creek</title>,Adjournment,19,1
