"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AG,2018-06-28,"



Senator BARTLETT
 (Queensland) (09:31):  According to the speakers list, I am the final speaker before the government's representative concludes the second reading debate on these two pieces of legislation. We will then move into the Committee of the Whole, where there will be a number of amendments and, of course, an obligation on the Senate to query at length the government and, potentially, the Labor opposition about the actual impact of the 280-odd amendments that were made to these pieces of legislation in the House of Representatives just two days ago.


Just to recap for people: we are talking about two very significant pieces of legislation, the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill 2018 and the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2018. These have been around since late last year. They were the subject of an inquiry by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, but, as multiple speakers have noted, that committee excludes anybody other than the Labor and coalition parties, which means that no other party, no other member of the Senate, has had any opportunity to be part of those deliberations. So what we are, in effect, dealing with, given that 280 amendments were made to these two pieces of legislation just two days ago in the House of Representatives, is pretty much new legislation. From all reports, it is improved legislation compared to the original version from last year—and thank heavens for that is all I can say, because they were abominations. But nonetheless, in effect, this is new legislation that the Senate is now having to consider in detail, just a couple of days later. That is the situation we are faced with. It's not the first time that's happened, of course. I am not particularly interested in doing a lot of faux outrage about that. I'm simply describing the situation as it stands.


I will take the opportunity to put on the record again, as I have multiple times in the last few months and as I did multiple times 10 or more years ago, that I think it is completely inappropriate that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security excludes people other than the Labor and coalition parties. It has been the case for that committee and its predecessors for a long period of time, apart from a brief interregnum when Andrew Wilkie was on it, at the time when there was a minority government and he was able to use that situation to get himself on it. I think that is correct.


I recall raising this many times when I was here in the past. Senator Robert Ray, in particular, would put the case then that Senator Wong put yesterday—that this is a committee that really is only for people from parties of government. I think those were the precise words she used. And that is clearly the view of the Labor Party and the coalition parties. It perhaps has its own internal logic, but it also demonstrates a serious part of the problem here. We have the Labor Party and the non-Labor parties in their various forms over the years that have basically been part of the political establishment and the governing class for decades—in fact, for over a century. They basically see defence matters, security matters, intelligence matters as their domain, and the public just have to trust them. Some of the time, that is fine, but you honestly don't need to be much of a student of political history to demonstrate that that agency has, at times, acted in a way that's quite clearly inappropriate. In fact, all you need to do is read the actual history that's been put and written or authorised by the actual agencies, such as ASIO—the history of ASIO, for example, that's been quite thoroughly written in recent times and published. The agency has quite clearly been acting in the interests of the governing class against the interests of the public and against people's basic civil liberties.


When I came back into this place towards the end of last year and made what would loosely be called my first speech, in the formal sense of the word, I made the comment that this parliament as a whole—and, historically, parliaments around the world—far too often operates to actually continue to keep the community under the thumb and to suppress people and oppress people in the interests of the establishment and the governing classes. That applies even more to the executive and government, where the executive class and the government class, over time, basically just assume that their interests equate to the public interest. History has shown time and time again that, in our own country, let alone so many other countries that like to call themselves a democracy, that has not been the case. The state operates to protect its own interests against the public, and, where necessary, oppresses and suppresses the public if the state sees its interests are threatened. Time and time again, that has been shown to happen. It's not some conspiracy theory; that's just a natural consequence of how an embedded governing class will operate if there is insufficient transparency. And one of the reasons that is able to happen is precisely because the relevant committee that can examine this stuff is contained and is exclusively for those people from the parties of government, who basically operate as their own separate club on these issues, and the public are excluded from it. The fact that that is happening again now should not be a surprise. In fact, it would be an extraordinary surprise if something different had happened. We all hoped something different might have happened this time. There was a huge amount of civil society outrage about what was being proposed. There were strong calls, particularly on the Labor Party, not to do a deal on this and to just scrap these bills, start again properly and involve civil society in putting forward a better alternative, but the status quo always comes back around each time.


That is not to deny, let me say, that there have no doubt been some good improvements. I'd again use historical equivalence. The former senator John Faulkner, who was widely respected in this place and who did take that role seriously, definitely reduced some of the very dangerous provisions of security legislation in their original form that were put forward by the government of the day. I acknowledge that, and I'm sure that has happened again here. Nonetheless, the simple fact is that, particularly in regard to the espionage and foreign interference bill, this is delivering another massive expansion of state powers with completely inadequate scrutiny and transparency and with completely inadequate opportunity to scrutinise what is happening and to test some of the assertions that will be put forward, I'm sure, by the relevant minister over the course of this debate.


Nowhere is that shown more clearly than if we go back to just yesterday and the reasons given as to why this is urgent. Forget about the procedural issues—whether or not a motion was needed. This is still being pushed through on the last day of the sitting period. We could just as easily deal with this in August. There's plenty of other legislation to deal with today—in particular the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018, which the Greens and Labor opposes and which has a 1 July start date, so it has to get through if it's going to be operating; although I certainly hope it doesn't get through—but somehow or other it's this national security legislation amendment bill that is urgent, and with no justification.


The only justification, and we all know it, is the political imperative of the by-elections—the so-called super Saturday coming up in four or five weeks. The only reason for the urgency we been given is a very short statement from the government yesterday saying that it's urgent because they say it's urgent in response to an 'unprecedented threat of espionage and foreign interference'. You don't need to have been here for years and years or to have followed these proceedings for years and years like I have to know how hollow the comment of 'unprecedented threat of espionage and foreign interference' is. Any basic student of history in this country, let alone anywhere around the world, knows that Western democracies—anywhere as authoritarian as you like—always fall back on the excuse of 'unprecedented threat of espionage or foreign interference'. It goes back to the history of Federation—'We've got to federate to protect ourselves against foreign interference.' It's the one thing that all governments use to try to justify giving themselves more power and to put fear in the community—they say, 'We have to do this because of this scary thing over there.'


Again, I'm not saying that there are no threats. Of course there are threats. But the issue here is: why do we need these extra powers to deal with those threats? And that question has been asked time and time again for 20 or more years now, for—Senator McKim told me the number yesterday.




Senator McKim:
  Over 200.




Senator BARTLETT:
  Over 200 times this has happened with different pieces of legislation and amendments at both state and federal levels over 20 years. At the federal level it would be well into double figures. We've amended these pieces of legislation 30 or 40 times. And each time I'm sure we heard 'unprecedented threat'. Each time I'm sure we heard 'urgent'. We've certainly heard them time and time again. I quoted yesterday from an example from August 2004, under the shadow of the same non-existent urgency to ban same-sex marriage. We also had the non-existent urgency to deal with an 'unspecified threat' that suddenly had to be dealt with.


Each time, we've never really had the opportunity to test why these specific powers are needed. And, inasmuch as there have been reviews of some of the extra powers that have been provided to agencies, like ASIO and espionage and intelligence agencies, very rarely has it been said, 'Yes, it was really good that that change was made because otherwise—' Some of these powers have never been used. But what they do give governments is more and more power to use and act in their own interests. This is the political class and the establishment class and the governing class and the state acting in their own interests against anybody they see as a threat.


I saw an interesting quote in an interview yesterday that Mr Hastie, the Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, gave to the ABC. The interviewer was asking, in respect of journalists, about how much transparency is okay, because the government's likely to say it's made amendments now that makes it okay for journalists—it's safe now, if it's in the national interest. It's the old national interest test that's used in so many pieces of legislation. It's all over the place. It's in the Migration Act as well. It never has any meaning. The government can interpret it to mean whatever it likes. National interest means what the government says it means, which means national interest is the government's interest. And that's how it has basically operated in a legal sense time and time again. But the particular quote that caught my eye was Mr Hastie saying that apparently, under these amended bills, there's robust defence for journalists, and another check and balance is that the Attorney-General has to consent for a prosecution. That's okay then! The Attorney-General has to consent! That makes me feel much more relaxed—not.


We saw—I spoke about this last year, and I think we'll see about a specific case later today—the Pine Gap protesters and the way the Attorney-General not only explicitly consented to pursuing but also tried to get peaceful, harmless protesters, who presented absolutely no security threat at all, jailed for years. On the matter of consent, the Attorney-General enthusiastically pursued the powers that they had—powers that hadn't been used for decades that were set up for completely different purposes under an act during the Cold War—and used those powers totally for political purposes. If they can use powers under a 60-year-old act that had been set up for completely separate purposes, in the context of the Cold War, to pursue harmless protesters conducting prayers and singing songs inside Pine Gap but nowhere near the actual facilities, imagine what they can do with all of the powers that this Senate keeps giving them time and time and time again. 


Mr Hastie also said there was protection, saying:


… the Attorney-General actually has to consent for a prosecution, so there's a number of different things that have to be done for a prosecution to proceed, and that's designed to prevent a chilling effect on the media because a free media is critical to democracy and we don't want to diminish that at all, in fact we want to enhance it and I think we've struck the right balance …


The ABC host said, 'Given you've made such bold statements about the need for free reporting of these matters, I'm curious as to whether you are uncomfortable with codifying jail time for journalists for doing just that—for acting as a free media.' Mr Hastie said:


What we can’t have is radical transparency.


This is a new concept—not just any old garden-variety transparency but 'radical transparency'. He said the whole point of the secrecy offences was 'to prevent privileged and classified information from being inappropriately disclosed'. Of course, it will be the government that will decide what is inappropriately disclosed. We all know the government itself, over time, has repeatedly disclosed classified information. When it's in their interests, they're happy to do it. They just don't want anybody else to do it if it's against their interests—and those are the interests of the government of the day. The ABC person said, 'So where do you draw a line? What is ""radical transparency""?' Mr Hastie said:


Radical transparency is Julian Assange dropping a whole bunch of commonwealth secrets out for public consumption … 


That's what it is. That's just one example. But he is, of course, an Australian citizen—from Queensland originally, I might say—who has basically been abandoned by this government. I'm not giving him a character reference, but I am certainly saying he has a right as an Australian citizen to receive proper support against what has clearly been an international conspiracy by governments to try and silence him. He has been kept in isolation for years. He has been basically silenced already because of the threat he poses to the state—not to the community, not to the public. The things that he exposed and, more specifically and definitely, that Edward Snowden exposed are things that governments wanted hidden, things so-called democratic governments were doing to their own people. So we have that definition: 'Radical transparency is Julian Assange.' These laws are attempts to criminalise and attack people like Julian Assange. Let's not forget that Julian Assange is acknowledged as and registered as a journalist, and actually won a Walkley Award for his work exposing governments acting against their own citizens. We've seen this time and time again in the United States; it's a case of great debate at the moment. 


Let's not forget the other very significant thing. We've had this march over the last couple of decades towards more and more powers for our intelligence agencies. The size of ASIO and relevant organisations has expanded, and the size of their budget has gone through the roof over the last couple of decades—and that's in the context of ASIO's own history, their published history, showing the number of times they've clearly overstepped their legal authority. They have clearly acted against the rights of citizens in this country, based on their own belief, their own internal little bubble. I'm not saying they're bad people; I'm saying that's what happens when people are put in a bubble and made to think that their views are the only views that matter, and where there is no transparency and the powers that people are given are absolute. It is almost inevitable that, regardless of the good character of those involved, if people are put in a situation where they're given such absolute powers with such minimal accountability and transparency, you will get abuse of those powers. So, to expand those powers further, particularly without proper scrutiny and genuine opportunity to test the assertions made by the government of the day as to what those powers will and won't mean, is incredibly dangerous. That's why the Senate should have supported Senator McKim's motion to have these new pieces of legislation scrutinised by a Senate committee. 


I'm sure the minister will give answers he believes are true, as he's advised, over the course of the committee stage of this debate. However, there is no capacity for those answers to be tested by a range of other people and all of the legal experts in this country who have a whole range of different political views, ideological perspectives and philosophical ideals. We will do the best we can but, as good as Senator McKim and others in this chamber might be with their forensic minds, it would be much better to open that up to all of the forensic minds around this country to properly test all of the amendments that have been put forward to make sure they do what they say they are going to do. Even if you totally agree philosophically with the intent of what's being proposed here—which I do not—this would make sure that there are not broader powers than are intended, that they're worded the right way and that there are commas in the right places. We all know of times when this has gone wrong in the past. I'm deeply concerned about what is being done here. It is deeply disappointing that the Labor opposition is going along with the government in this process, although it is unfortunately not surprising because it's happened so many times before.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (09:51):  I have spoken already in this debate, so I don't seek to add to the substantive debate. I do, however, wish to briefly respond to the second reading amendments which were moved after I spoke. There were second reading amendments moved by Senator McKim, on sheets 8475 and 8476. There is also an amendment to be moved by Senator Patrick. Senator McKim's amendments seek to refer these bills to a further committee inquiry, and Senator Patrick is seeking to refer his amendments on sheet 8446 to an inquiry by the PJCIS. 


First, the effect of all of these amendments would be to interrupt further consideration of the bills. Under the committee's report in August, for the reasons that I outlined yesterday, the opposition will not be supporting further inquiry or delay on these bills, noting the extensive inquiry that has been undertaken by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. 


The amendments proposed by Senator Patrick on sheet 8472, which are the subject of referrals, seek to inform the intelligence committee's oversight powers in the Intelligence Services Act. I do wish to, again, mark that Labor has long sought to improve the oversight powers of the parliament with respect to intelligence and security legislation, and the operations of intelligence and security agencies. In addition, the L'Estrange and Merchant review of the Australian intelligence community recommended changes to the oversight powers of the PJCIS. The opposition welcomed these recommendations, and we hope the government will similarly consider them with a favourable eye. 


The oversight imperative was the purpose of the Faulkner reforms, which were proposed in this place by former senator John Faulkner—also a member, at that time, of the intelligence committee prior to his retirement. I would invite Senator Patrick to engage with the opposition and, in particular, Senator McAllister, who now has carriage of the legislation on these matters. I also invite the government to work with us to progress sensible and constructive reforms in line with the L'Estrange and Merchant review of the Australian intelligence community.

"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2018-06-28,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (09:54):  I want to thank my parliamentary colleagues for their contributions to the debate on the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2018—the EFI Bill; and the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill 2017—the FITS Bill. 


These two bills have been considered in detail by several parliamentary committees, and I thank those committees for their contributions. I particularly thank the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security for their detailed consideration of these two bills. The committee has produced detailed and robust reports, having considered the bills over a period of some six months. It received a total of 143 submissions and 68 supplementary submissions, held multiple public and private hearings and received multiple classified briefings. The committee considered the detailed proposed government amendments to each bill provided to it by the Attorney-General, which were the subject of further public hearings and submissions. The committee tabled its report on the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill on 7 June 2018 and its report on the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill on 25 June 2018. The government has accepted all of the committee's recommendations, as it has for each of the previous 10 tranches of national security legislation.


With respect to the EFI bill, covert interference and espionage by nation states are global realities which have the potential to cause immense harm to our national sovereignty, the safety of our people, our economic prosperity and the very integrity of our democracy. To counter this threat, Australia must have a robust legislative framework to ensure our law enforcement and national security agencies are sufficiently empowered to investigate and disrupt malicious foreign interference. The reforms in the EFI bill are comprehensive. They represent the most significant counterintelligence reforms since the 1970s. The measures in the bill will fundamentally reshape our national security offences to protect Australia's sovereignty and information, and protect the democratic principles and values that underpin our society.


The EFI bill includes comprehensive new espionage offences that are designed to capture the full range of conduct undertaken to compromise sensitive information and prejudice our national security. The new offences will target not just the person who discloses the information but also the actions of the foreign principal who receives the information. The bill will also introduce an offence criminalising economic espionage, or the theft of trade secrets, which will apply to dishonest dealings with trade secrets on behalf of a foreign government principal.


Senator McKim expressed the view that the espionage offences might capture persons who disclose information about potential human rights abuses or breaches of international law to international advocacy organisations or the United Nations. Senator Wong addressed these issues in her contribution to the debate, as did the shadow Attorney-General in his contribution to the second reading debate in the other place. I will not restate the point that Senator Wong and the shadow Attorney-General correctly made. A person seeking to draw human rights concerns to the attention of the United Nations or other international organisations will not commit an espionage offence as they did not intend to; nor are they reckless as to whether their conduct will prejudice Australia's national security.


The EFI bill will introduce, for the first time, a suite of foreign interference offences into the Criminal Code. These offences will complement espionage offences by criminalising a range of other harmful conduct undertaken by foreign principals who seek to interfere with Australia's political, governmental or democratic processes to support their own intelligence activities or to otherwise prejudice Australia's national security. Senator Leyonhjelm set out a series of scenarios where a person might entirely properly communicate with a foreign government in private in the course of informing themselves on a matter of public importance before engaging in debate in Australia. I want to thank the senator for providing specific examples and for clearly identifying the legislative provisions that he is concerned may be engaged. I can reassure the senator that the scenarios, as he described them, would not constitute foreign interference offences. In the scenarios he sets out, a person will only commit a foreign interference offence if they seek to covertly or deceptively influence a political or governmental process on behalf of or in collaboration with a foreign government—that is to say: it is the act of influence in the process that must be covert or deceptive for the offence to be committed.


The EFI bill contains a suite of new Commonwealth secrecy offences, which replaces sections 70 and 79 of the Crimes Act. There will be separate offences that apply to Commonwealth officers and non-Commonwealth officers. The offences that apply to non-Commonwealth officers will be narrower in scope and attract lower penalties. Defences will apply to ensure the offences do not apply too broadly, including a defence specifically applying to journalists as well as editorial and support staff who reasonably believe that their conduct was in the public interest. The new secrecy offences ensure harmful information cannot be released, while appropriate defences protect freedom of speech.


The EFI bill will update and simplify the offences of treason and treachery, as well as archaic and outdated offences in part 2 of the Crimes Act. These are some of the oldest offences in the statute book. As such, they require modernisation and updates to the language to reflect the modern environment and international law concepts of armed conflict. The EFI bill will also introduce reformed sabotage offences into the Criminal Code. The new offences will criminalise conduct causing damage to critical infrastructure where it could prejudice Australia's national security. The new offences will apply higher penalties where sabotage offences are committed on behalf of foreign principals and will also contain offences that apply where a person's conduct leaves an item or system vulnerable to future misuse or exploitation. Senator McKim expressed the view that the sabotage offences might capture persons who picket a coalmine or port. Senator Wong addressed these issues also in her contribution to the debate, as did the shadow Attorney-General in his contribution to the second reading debate in the other place. A person engaged in ordinary and lawful protest will not commit a sabotage offence, as they did not intend to nor are they reckless as to whether their conduct will prejudice Australia's national security.


 Finally, the EFI bill will amend the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 to ensure the powers under that act are available to investigate the offences contained in the EFI bill. While foreign actors are free to promote their interests in Australia's free and open society this must be done in a lawful and open way. The FITS Bill will provide transparency for the Australian government and the Australian public about efforts by foreign governments, foreign political organisations, and persons and entities closely related to foreign governments and foreign political organisations to use intermediaries to influence Australia's political and government processes. Decision-makers in the Australian government—and the public—should know what interests are being advanced in respect of a particular decision or process. For the first time, the public and decision-makers in government will have access to information to enable them to accurately assess how foreign sources may be seeking to influence Australia's government and political processes. The bill will empower the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department to issue a transparency notice setting out whether a particular entity or individual is related to a foreign government. Transparency notices will assist potential registrants to understand whether they are required to register and will also shed light where a company or individual seeks to conceal their relationship with a foreign principal.


The FITS bill exempts a range of organisations and persons from registering under the scheme. The exemptions extend to humanitarian assistance, legal advice, diplomatic activities, religious activities, commercial or business pursuits, industry representative bodies, individuals making personal legal representations, registered charities, activities with an artistic purpose, certain registered organisations and certain professions. These exemptions appropriately restrict the application of the scheme to those organisations and persons which seek to influence Australian political and government decisions or processes in a way that threatens Australian institutions. Senator McCarthy raised the issue of Indigenous rangers working in collaboration with international charities such as The Pew Charitable Trusts. I am pleased to say that the bill, incorporating the Attorney-General's amendments as well as those recommended by the PJCIS, will place beyond doubt that Indigenous rangers are not required to register in such circumstances. The FITS Bill will introduce offences which will promote compliance with the scheme.


I would like to thank my parliamentary colleagues for recognising the need for these important measures in these two bills. Comprehensive criminal laws are a critical part of Australia's response to the threat of espionage and foreign interference. The EFI bill reflects the government's commitment to addressing this threat and ensuring that our law enforcement and security agencies have the powers they need to respond to the broad spectrum of foreign interference and related criminal activities directed against Australia's interests. Legislative reform is also a critical step in shedding light on foreign interference. The FITS Bill reflects the government's commitment to addressing this issue and to ensuring that the public and decision-makers in government will have access to information to enable them to accurately assess how foreign sources may be seeking to influence Australia's government and political processes. I commend both bills to the Senate.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (10:26):  First, Minister, I'd like to go to the issue of urgency, which has been claimed repeatedly by the government and the opposition on what I believe to be totally spurious grounds. We've had numerous pieces of public commentary from government ministers over the last couple of weeks that said that these bills had to be passed before the by-elections occurred. So I'd like you, Minister, please, to explain whether that is still the government's position—that these bills are urgent because of the up coming by-elections. If you are still going to claim that as a position, could you explain why? If you are going to walk away from that position, could you explain why so many government ministers were on the public record as saying that these bills needed to be passed before the by-elections, when, if you are walking away from that position, that is an admission that they do not need to be passed before the by-elections?

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (10:27):  In relation to the urgency: absolutely, the government believes that this is an urgent threat and it is important that we have legislation in place to deal with that threat as quickly as possible. Obviously, by-elections are major exercises in democracy. So, where we've been in a situation where we don't have strengthened laws, obviously that provides potential for interference in our democratic processes. So, whether it's the by-elections coming up or any other democratic event beyond that, this legislation is urgent and the government absolutely maintains that. That's why we believe it's important that it's passed through the Senate as quickly as possible.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (10:30):  Thank you, Minister; I appreciate that. In response, I guess I'd make the obvious point that I'm not convinced that the argument we needed to get these in place for by-elections was anything other than a political argument. I note for the record that the statement of reasons for urgency that was tabled earlier this week by the government did not mention by-elections at all.


Minister, I want to take you now to some of the matters which have been contested between you and me in this debate, and that is the impact of these laws—should they pass as they currently stand—on things like peaceful protest and public interest journalism. I want to go first to the issue of peaceful protest. I note that in your summary on the second reading only moments ago, you were very careful to include the word 'lawful' in what you said, saying that this legislation would not have any impact on someone who was engaged in 'lawful' protests.


I want to remove that word from our discussions, Minister, because, as you know, blockading a road or an entrance gate to a particular industrial facility is actually not lawful; it's unlawful, under current law. So I want to ask, specifically, about those kinds of protests—peaceful, non-violent protests which are not lawful under current law. I think the easiest way for us to do that is to talk about examples. I want to use the example of a person or a group of people who blockade, unlawfully, a road or an access point that leads into a port that is being used for live sheep exports. Could a person or group of people who do that be charged with the sabotage offences currently contained in this legislation?

"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2018-06-28,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (10:33):  The short answer is no, and I'll just go through why. All of the sabotage offences need to be read together. The sabotage offences can only be committed where a person damages public infrastructure and intends for their conduct—or is reckless as to whether it does—to prejudice Australia's national security or to advantage the national security of a foreign country. There are a number of reasons why these offences wouldn't apply in that particular scenario.


'Public infrastructure' is a defined term set out in section 82.2 of the bill. This definition is unchanged since December, when it was first introduced. It includes Commonwealth facilities, premises and systems, defence premises, telecommunications networks and infrastructure that provides utilities or services to the public, such as the electricity or water grids. But I want to deal briefly and specifically with your line of questioning about the lawful versus the unlawful and whether or not that would, in and of itself, attract the sabotage offences. Obviously the government does not and would not condone behaviour that breaks state and territory laws in the context of protest. However, the fact that those laws may have been broken would not be enough to constitute a sabotage offence under sections 82.5 or 82.6. As stated earlier, these offences require a person to intend to, or to be, reckless as to whether they'll prejudice Australia's national security or advantage the national security of a foreign country. Simply breaking state and territory laws wouldn't be sufficient to satisfy that element.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (10:35):  Minister, thanks for that response. I want to take you to section 90.4 and the definition of national security. This goes to the argument you've just made about someone needing to be reckless as to the intent of their actions. Can you please confirm firstly that 'caught' in the definition of national security is something which would engage a country's political or economic relationship with another country or countries? If that is the case, wouldn't you agree that somebody who blockaded a port or an export facility in trying to prevent the loading of live sheep exports would impact on Australia's economic relations with another country and, therefore, be caught under this definition?

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (10:36):  The answer to the first part of your question is yes. But there is a big difference between the actions you're suggesting—actions which are taken for the intention of animal welfare—and actions which are taken either intentionally or recklessly to damage the national security of our nation.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (10:37):  I don't accept that at all, and I want to talk you through why I don't accept that. Actually, perhaps we can do this in question and answer, which is the way the forms of this committee are established. If somebody took a protest action with the intent of damaging Australia's economic relations with another country would that be caught under the sabotage provisions because of the way national security is defined in section 90.4?

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (10:38):  Again, we're distinguishing between different intent. You are talking about someone who intends to disrupt a particular trade for a particular reason as opposed to someone who intends to damage Australia's interests. That is quite a separate intention. That's why there's no prospect of that in circumstances where someone was acting in order to deal with animal welfare issues as opposed to the intent or recklessness that's needed. If you go to chapter 2 of the Criminal Code, obviously intent is pretty clear. But when we talk about recklessness the prosecution is required to prove that a person is aware of a substantial risk that their conduct will prejudice Australia's national security or advantage the national security of a foreign country, and, having regard to the circumstances known to him or her, it is unjustifiable to take the risk.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (10:39):  Thanks. Even though I've still got some concerns around intent, I do want to ask some questions about the recklessness aspect of this. Let's say someone did want to make a protest for a political reason to make a point about animal cruelty, as you've raised in a couple of your responses moments ago, so they decided to do that unlawful protest by blockading a port where live sheep were being loaded for export. They were doing it with the intent of making a political point, but they knew that their actions would damage Australia's economic relations with the country to which these sheep were being exported. Wouldn't they then be caught by the sabotage provisions of this legislation because of the way 'national security' is defined in proposed section 90.4?

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (10:40):  Obviously, ultimately these would be matters for the courts, but we've set out how the legislation applies. What we're talking about is that what this turns on is unjustifiable risk and unjustifiable actions. When someone is setting out or is reckless as to the fact that their actions are going to affect national security, potentially, then the elements are made out. But where someone sets out to make a political point, to protest about animal welfare, obviously that is in a different category in terms of what their intent is and what the fault element is in relation to an offence.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (10:41):  I invite you to reconsider the advice you've just given to this chamber, Minister. I think you were loose with the words you just used, and I'm concerned that you're placing inaccurate information on the record and potentially misleading this chamber. I thought I made my argument clear, but I'll make it again: proposed section 90.4 defines the 'national security' of Australia to mean any of the following—and then it goes through a series of criteria that you would think are reasonable in terms of how 'national security' is defined: the defence of our country, the protection of our country, the protection of the integrity of our country's territory and borders, and so forth. I want to put those aside and take you to section 90.4(1)(e), which catches a country's, including Australia's, 'economic relations' with another country. 


So, again, I put to you: if someone, even though their intent may be to make a political point about animal cruelty—for example, in the context of the hypothetical that I've put to you—is 'aware' that their actions could or would damage Australia's economic relations with the country to which the sheep are being exported, by delaying and perhaps preventing, totally, the export of those sheep, wouldn't that place them in a category of being 'reckless' and caught under the sabotage provisions of this legislation because of the way you've defined 'national security' in section 90.4(1)(e)?

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (10:43):  No. Again, I go back to the fault elements. You're dealing with recklessness here. I've dealt with it, but I'll deal with it again. The prosecution is required to prove that a person is aware of a substantial risk that their conduct will prejudice Australia's national security or advantage the national security of a foreign country, and having regard to the circumstances known to him or her, it is unjustifiable to take the risk. We are not dealing with a low bar when it comes to that in terms of recklessness. We're not dealing with carelessness as is dealt with in other areas; we are dealing with recklessness or intent. I simply don't accept the proposition that you're putting—that there is such a low bar that activity such as you're describing would fall foul of that provision.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (10:44):  Your defence here relates to the establishment of fault, and you've just advised this committee—and please correct me if I've got this wrong—that there are two elements to that: one is that the person is aware that there is a substantial risk that their actions may impact on national security. Remember, we're talking about economic relationships here, within the very broad definition of national security in section 90.4. The first bar that needs to be cleared, if you like, is that the person needs to be aware that there's substantial risk that their activities might damage Australia's economic relationship with another country. I submit to you that, in the hypothetical I've given you, that bar is comfortably cleared, because the person is well aware that their protest may delay or entirely prevent the loading of the sheep for live export, and that therefore they have cleared that bar because they have an awareness that their actions constitute a substantial risk to Australia's economic relationship with the country to which the boat is being loaded to travel to. Am I not correct in that categorisation of the first bar that needs to be cleared?

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (10:45):  Again, all of those elements need to be taken together. I'll take you back to one of the pieces of language you used, which was 'impact' national security. The legislation talks about 'prejudicing'. You are talking about a substantial risk that the conduct will prejudice Australia's national security, and, in all of the circumstances, it's unjustifiable to take the risk. No, I don't accept the proposition that you're putting.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (10:46):  We'll come to the second bar in a minute. By the way, I do accept that these elements would be considered together by courts if this hypothetical situation ever got to the courts—and I hope it doesn't but I suspect that it will at some stage in the future. I'll give a philosophical underpinning to my concerns here. A close reading of human history shows that, if parliaments create a particular power, power-hungry, desperate governments—including in Western democracies—have a track record of using those powers to the fullest extent to quash people taking action to hold governments to account. Your government has been guilty of this overreach on many, many occasions. If you want, I'll give you an ad hoc chapter and verse on that. In order to try to save us time, the philosophical underpinning of my expression of concern on behalf of the Greens here is that governments have a track record of utilising every last bit of power that parliaments make available to them if they feel politically threatened by the actions of a citizen or a particular group of citizens.


Having placed that on the record, and having said that I accept that a court would need to consider the fault elements together, I still want to take you to the first bar, which is the requirement that a person would have to have an awareness that there was a substantial risk that their action might—it's not 'impact', Minister, I'm sorry; the word you used was—




Senator Seselja:
  Prejudiced.

  Prejudiced.




Senator McKIM:
  Prejudiced. Thank you, Senator McAllister and Senator Seselja. If the person is aware that there is a substantial risk that their actions might prejudice Australia's economic relations with the country to which the live sheep are being exported, surely you have to accept, Minister, that that first bar, the substantial risk bar, is cleared. Do you not accept that?

I've put out very clearly, and through a range of processes we've put out clearly, exactly what those elements are. They are designed to deal with particular actions of sabotage. In terms of getting into the kinds of details that you're now inviting me to get into, I can't prejudge what kind of evidence might be put to a court in those circumstances. I think you're now asking me to get into that level of detail. We've set it out—I've set it out very clearly and it is set out very clearly in the legislation. The government believe and the opposition believe, having considered it as well, that these bars are at very reasonable levels before this offence is engaged. It is not aimed at the kind of political activity that you are referring to, but you are now inviting me to get into the realm of what a court would do. I don't believe that that's appropriate.

 (Tasmania) (10:49):  I'm actually not inviting you to do that at all, Minister. I'm putting a very specific circumstance to you and asking whether that circumstance would actually clear the bar that you have advised this committee exists? But, Minister, your response actually comes to the nature of the Greens' concerns, and the chilling effect that this legislation will have on participation in our democracy. That is because you're trying to now avoid answering entirely reasonable questions on this legislation on the basis that you don't want to start speculating about how a court might rule.


Imagine how a citizen is going to feel, Minister, when they ask themselves, 'Should I actually participate in this blockade of a live sheep export? What legal risk am I exposing myself to?' How are they supposed to understand where the bar is set if you won't place it on the record in this committee? You refusing to answer these entirely reasonable questions is actually compounding the problem, because citizens who want to participate in our democracy, who want to express their justifiable abhorrence about the live sheep exports that your government so cruelly supports, are going to ask themselves the question: 'What is my legal jeopardy here? Am I likely to be charged with sabotage under espionage provisions simply because my actions actually carry a substantial risk that they will impact on Australia's economic relationship with another country?' I mean, can't you understand the terrible situation that you are placing people in here and, more broadly—and actually more importantly for our democracy—do you accept the chilling effect that these laws will have on public participation, including engaging in peaceful protest action, whether it be lawful or unlawful?

 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (10:52):  No. I'd just make a couple of points. I think we're going around in circles a little bit, but you're talking about people engaging certain defences. When people act unlawfully, as you are describing—that is the basis of the propositions you are putting—of course they potentially attract the law as it stands. But what you seem to be trying to suggest is that the definition of 'national security' in this bill is somehow going to open up people to prosecution that may or may not be intended in the way that you're describing. And I'll just make the point that there is absolutely nothing unusual about the definition of 'national security' in this bill. It is consistent with existing definitions in the National Security Information (Criminal and Civil Proceedings) Act 2004 and with the Australian Law Reform Commission's 2009 report recommending reforms to Australia's secrecy offences. So the very proposition you're putting, that somehow there's a change in definition here, is flawed for the reasons I've set out.

Unfortunately, your refusal to engage fully—although I acknowledge you've attempted to engage partially—on this issue has reinforced our concerns about the chilling effect of this legislation on political participation, freedom of speech and freedom of political expression in our country, and you've abjectly failed to convince me that I was wrong in any way with the arguments I was putting in my speech in the second reading, which you've rejected but failed to rebut. You've denied them, but you've failed to fully explain, in a reasonable way, why you think I was wrong. Talking about freedom of speech and freedom of political communication, has the government taken advice from the Solicitor-General on whether these laws breach the implied right of freedom of political expression in Australia enshrined in our Constitution?

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (10:57):  Minister, I was concerned that you used the term that the debate was 'going round in circles'. These are very significant issues that go to the heart of problematic legislation. There has been such a range of groups' legal advice on this, and these groups advise that they are very troubled about where these two bills will take the fabric of Australian society and how our democratic processes work. To try to sidestep it by using terms like 'round in circles' doesn't do you justice or serve the debate well at all.


To go to my colleague Senator Nick McKim: he asked very clear questions; they weren't confusing questions at all. I would like to repeat those questions and put them in the context of some significant comments that have come from the dean of the University of New South Wales Law School and constitutional law expert, George Williams: This is what he said about the bill:


Even with the changes of the parliamentary joint committee, the bill will remain incomplete and dangerous. It will contain overbroad and uncertain definitions of critical concepts such as national security. The law also will undermine freedom of speech and of the press. As in past inquiries, the committee has given low weight to these values. It has failed to put forward amendments to prevent journalists being imprisoned. The possibility also remains that people who publish information about Australia's economic and political relations with other countries will face jail under new espionage offences.


I want to take you back to that comment from Mr Williams, where he says:


It—


referring to the bill—


will contain overbroad and uncertain definitions of critical concepts such as national security.


I ask: (1) are you aware of these views of Mr Williams, and (2) can you respond to these views, particularly in the context of the debate that we are having here about the bill and those sections of it relevant to the definition of 'national security'?

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (11:00):  Professor Williams criticised the definition of 'national security' for being 'uncertain and overbroad'. The government rejects this. This isn't correct. Espionage offences currently refer to 'security and defence of Australia', with no definition. In this bill, this term is replaced by 'national security', which is in turn exhaustively defined in a way that is consistent with definitions in other longstanding acts, including the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 and the National Security Information (Criminal and Civil Proceedings) Act 2004.

I was listening very intently during your summing up, although I wasn't in the chamber, and you commented that the covert aspect—and I note that 'covert' is not defined anywhere in the bill—had to relate to the influence in relation to the political or government process. How do you arrive at that conclusion? Section 92.2(1)(d) specifically says 'any part of the conduct'. That would seem to include covert conduct between the person and the foreign principal.

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (11:03):  If we look at section 92.2, we can't simply take (d) in isolation. If you look at the entirety of the offence: 


(a) the person engages in conduct; and


(b) any of the following circumstances exists—


—that is:


… acting on behalf of a foreign principal;


   (ii) the conduct is directed, funded or supervised by a foreign principal or a person acting on behalf of a foreign principal; and


(c) the person intends that the conduct will:


   (i) influence—


as set out in (c). Taking (d) in isolation is what you are seeking to do. I would simply respond by saying that it is the entirety of it and all of that conduct, as set out in section 92.2.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (11:04):  Yes, I accept that it has to be read in its entirety. Nonetheless, I don't think the statement you made in your summing up, that a covert aspect referred only to the element in which the person is seeking to influence political or government process, is accurate. Any part of the covert process would seem to be sufficient as a component of the offence.


I acknowledge that it has to occur in collaboration with a foreign principal, supervised, directed or funded by the foreign principal, and seeking to influence a political or government process or a right or duty and so forth. It then specifically says: 'any part of the conduct … is covert'. That's in addition to those other elements, which I acknowledge. So it would seem to me that, as to your summing up—in which you said that the covert aspect only refers to the communication between the person and the influencing of political or government processes and so forth—it is required. I can't see how that can be accurate.

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (11:05):  I am trying to better understand your question, because you seem to be suggesting that, if any part of the conduct is covert, that will attract the offence. But is it in relation to the communication that you're talking about? If you look at how the offence is structured, it involves a number of elements that are covert. I'm just not quite understanding your question. Perhaps you could just articulate it for me a little more clearly.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (11:06):  Perhaps it would be easier if I elaborated on it by means of an example. Assume, for the moment, that I am not exempt from this legislation. I'm not sure, actually; I may be confused between the two, being a senator. But, anyway, let's assume I am not subject to this legislation—or even let's assume that I am not a senator—and I am advocating, on behalf of Israel, that Australia's aid should no longer fund Hamas in the Palestinian Territories, and that I am advocating that Australia should cease that kind of funding. So I'm seeking to influence a political process. I'm working in collaboration with a representative of the Israeli government, because they have a common interest in that issue. I may be coordinating with them to ensure that I don't say anything which conflicts with what they're doing. I may be coordinating with them to ensure that the timing of my activities is complementary to anything they might do. And I may be communicating with the representatives of the Israeli government via means of WhatsApp, or telegram, or some other, encrypted, mechanism—which I would've thought would come within the definition of 'covert'. It would seem to me that all of that would add up to meeting the elements of the offence under section 92.2, for which there is, potentially, a 20-year jail sentence. Perhaps you'd like to address that example.

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (11:08):  In terms of that example, the conduct which would need to be covert would be the conduct where one is seeking to influence the outcome or the process. It is not merely in communicating using WhatsApp, in your example. It's impossible to see how that, in any way, could be seen as covert conduct which is engaging in the influence of these various processes. It's simply communicating with others. But you're not acting covertly in those circumstances, in the influencing of the process itself.

 (New South Wales) (11:09):  This is at the core of the dilemma. That's essentially what you said in your summing up as well—except that section 92.2(1)(d) says: 'any part of the conduct … is covert'. It doesn't limit the covert conduct to communications directed at the Australian government or the Australian political process. On my reading of the bill, any part of the conduct would include communication with the foreign principal. I'm struggling to understand how you can interpret it in the way that you're describing. Perhaps you can help me there.

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (11:10):  Again, Senator, I understand the challenge, but it does take a stepping through of all the elements of the offence. So, starting with (1)(a), the person commits the offence if the person engages in conduct. Then, if any of those circumstances exist—that is, acting in collaboration with or on behalf of the foreign principal and, then, intending that conduct to influence the various processes set out in (c)—that conduct, going back to (a), is covert or involves deception. Simply communicating via an encrypted messaging service such as WhatsApp does not engage the covertness element when it comes to engaging in conduct and the other elements that make up the offence.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (11:11):  I will move on. Let's use a little more of that same example of communicating in relation to Australian aid funding terrorism in the Palestinian territories. Let's assume that I indicate my views. I have been communicating with a representative of the Israeli government, so that would qualify as collaboration. I have sent a message to the Minister for Foreign Affairs via WhatsApp or telegram or some encrypted option. What would constitute 'supervised by' in this section—section 92.1(1)(b)(ii)? I draw your attention to the fact that 'directed' is also there, so it's obviously not synonymous with 'directed'. How is 'supervised' distinguished from 'directed'?

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (11:12):  Obviously, it's the ordinary meaning of the words—'supervised' versus 'directed'. 'Directed' would be 'taking instructions from'; 'supervised by' would obviously be akin to 'coordinated by' and 'reporting back to'. But, going back to the point you made at the beginning of this particular question, you talked about a WhatsApp message to the foreign minister. There is no prospect that that WhatsApp message would constitute acting in a covert or deceptive way to engage (d) and the other parts of the offence. There is nothing covert about sending a WhatsApp message, just because it's encrypted, when you are lobbying the foreign minister. You are not pretending to be someone you're not, which is the purpose of the offence. The fact that it is encrypted does not make it covert in those circumstances and wouldn't engage the offence under 92.2.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (11:14):  I will move on with yet another example, although my focus is still on 92.2. I invite you to consider the situation where a Catholic priest is campaigning to oppose legislation allowing for assisted suicide. That Catholic priest is acting in collaboration with the Vatican. You could argue that that Catholic priest is being directed by or supervised by a foreign principal, being the Vatican. He may, in fact, be literally directed or supervised by the Vatican, so the priest may indeed be acting at the behest of somebody acting on behalf of the Vatican. They may, indeed, be seeking to influence—or they are seeking to influence—a political event; namely, the outcome of a vote in the parliament, and they may well be engaging in covert activity directed at that outcome. They may well be having quiet meetings, telling fairy stories and not necessarily engaging in open political dialogue—whatever it takes, as a book once famously said—to achieve the defeat of this legislation. Wouldn't that Catholic priest be in breach of this section?

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (11:16):  The short answer is no. There is nothing in what you've described which would point to the priest in those circumstances acting deceptively or in a covert fashion. The provision we're referring to, obviously, deals with circumstances where things are deliberately remaining deceptive or hidden in a way that would cause confusion. The fact that the Catholic priest is talking to his church about an issue that he is concerned about and then making representations or campaigning in whatever way does not engage that definition in terms of being covert or deceptive.

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (11:17):  Senator, it goes to the nature of the offence, and that is in relation to being covert and deceptive in seeking to influence the decision-maker.


Let's go back, again, to your example with the foreign minister—we could use other examples. If the situation is that the Catholic priest—in this circumstance; it could be a foreign minister or any other minister—was making the advocacy but in some way was being deceptive or hiding who they were and who they represented, then that is a different circumstance. What you are suggesting is that, simply because someone has meetings or private discussions which are not public, that would somehow engage that definition of being covert. What we're talking about here is that the offence is very clearly aimed at penalising deceptive and covert conduct in terms of that communication and that attempt to influence. It would clearly be designed to deceive or to hide the truth in terms of the nature of the representations, but most particularly to hide those who are making them and on whose behalf they do it.


Again, going back to your clearest example, the fact that it is communicated on a private messaging app or, indeed, behind closed doors, does not in any way make it covert or deceptive, because it's very clear the individual who is making the representations.

Senator STORER
 (South Australia) (11:19):  I rise regarding these two pieces of legislation: the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2018 and the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill 2017. I note that I will support the amendments proposed by the Greens and the crossbench. Unless the Senate is provided with further review of the legislation, I will be voting against these bills. I'm not opposed to checks on foreign influence on our politics or to steps to address espionage in the digital era, but the Senate deserves the time the major parties gave themselves to determine whether these measures are genuinely in the public and national interests. The threat of foreign interference is real and we must take it seriously, but we must be careful to balance the need to defend ourselves with the need to protect our fundamental freedoms, beliefs and civil liberties. Overreach is a real risk when considering these matters. For these reasons, I am disappointed that both the government and the opposition have voted together not to give the Senate more time to consider these bills and reviews.


There were 280 amendments to these bills put forward by the government in only the last days, and most of the 126 amendments proposed to the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill flow from the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security which was released only on Monday. Furthermore, the committee itself is a closed shop, only open to government and opposition representatives, not Independents like myself. I think it would have been entirely reasonable for these bills to have been referred to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for inquiry and to have also been considered separately, as was requested yesterday and today. So I cannot in good conscience vote for the bills and amendments that I have not had time to fully understand, particularly when there are freedom of speech and civil liberties issues at stake.


As constitutional law expert George Williams has noted, this law would undermine freedom of speech and freedom of the press—key rights in any functioning and healthy democracy. The definitions in these bills of critical concepts, notably and especially 'national security', are too broad and too uncertain, and so too are the secrecy offences. They go too far in criminalising the receiving and possessing of information, not just disclosure. It's a chilling warning for whistleblowers seeking to shine a light on malpractice and corruption. As drafted, the legislation could still ensnare journalists who are doing nothing more than what is regarded as entirely legitimate scrutiny throughout the life of the Commonwealth. Equally, not-for-profit organisations could still find themselves ensnared and punished merely for doing the work they have engaged in for decades in the public interest. So we should not, and certainly not without far greater scrutiny by this House of review, undertake such wholesale changes to our security and espionage laws which could further erode freedom of the press, criminalise dissent and undermine democratic safeguards.

 (South Australia) (11:23):  I have a question that sort of relates to what Senator Leyonhjelm was talking about, in terms of some scenarios. I apologise if this is dealt with in the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill. The two are very closely related, and I'll take your advice on that. I present a scenario that seeks to draw out an understanding of where the boundary exists between parliamentary privilege and the operation of the act. I'm aware that nothing in the bill seeks to affect privilege, but let me provide you with a scenario. Let's say that a foreign entity talks to a member of a political party in this place and says to them, 'Could you help me convince your party at its annual conference to take a position on a piece of legislation?' and perhaps offers some money for that to occur. Is that considered by the government to be something where the politician would be subject to the provisions in this bill? I note that there are recommendations to deal with how privilege might be managed, and that may be a matter for the House, but the question is: where is the line drawn?


That's not a direct influence into this place but a direct influence to a party who may then vote in a particular way on the basis of a representation that took place at a party conference.

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (11:25):  I might have to clarify: part of this, I think, would probably be better dealt with in the discussion of the other bill, because this, as opposed to the other bill, which talks about politicians specifically, has criminal offences in relation to certain conduct and so doesn't specifically engage parliamentary privilege in that way. It's difficult for me to answer all of what you've described, because, if I heard you correctly, you're talking about a situation where someone was actually offered money to try to get a specific outcome at a party conference. Obviously there are the corruption and bribery elements of that, and other offences no doubt would deal with that, and I'm not going to give a comment on that. In terms of foreign interference, it would go to some of the elements we've been drawing out in terms of whether all of the elements in relation to acting on behalf of a foreign principal et cetera were engaged. If you wanted to drill down a little bit on that, as Senator Leyonhjelm has, I'll do my best to answer those questions, but I think we're perhaps dealing with two slightly separate concepts.

Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (11:26):  Maybe if we take the money part out of it: a foreign entity seeks to influence a member—if you simply want to take these on notice for the next bill, I'm happy for that to occur. If someone were to come and talk to me very privately and they were from a foreign government, as happens from time to time—we have ambassadors visit us and so forth—and they were to, in some way, seek to influence my vote in this parliament, I presume that would be covered by privilege in the context that people have a right to discuss their views with a politician? I'm really going to the situation where it's perhaps one step removed, where they're seeking to influence a party outside of the parliament who will bring that influenced position into the parliament.

There is nothing which affects parliamentary privilege in one way or another in this legislation; I'll be clear on that. I'm not going to give advice on how parliamentary privilege would apply; that's a matter for another day and for others to answer. This bill does not affect parliamentary privilege in one way or another, so it would stand on its merits.


In terms of the specific example you're speaking about, where a foreign principal is perhaps trying to influence a party official, the elements as set out in the legislation would all need to apply—that is, the party official probably would be engaging in conduct on behalf of or in collaboration with the foreign principal; the conduct is directed, funded or supervised et cetera; the person intends that the conduct will influence the political processes of the Commonwealth or a state or territory; and any part of the conduct is covert or deceptive. You have to have all of those elements for this legislation and these provisions that we've been discussing to be potentially engaged.

A party official may not normally attract privilege in all circumstances. Perhaps I get approached by a foreign entity who talks to me and convinces me of a particular position. I go and talk to my colleague, Senator Griff, and manage to influence him to vote in a particular way, so it's not direct in some sense—it's me then influencing my colleague. My colleague is completely unaware I've spoken to the foreign entity. I am just trying to simply see where the line is drawn between privilege and activities that might take place outside the parliament in a party context, not in a parliamentary context.

Simply lobbying someone and that person then taking a position is not what we're talking about here. There are a number of those elements that I have set out and there's nothing covert in that particular lobbying. There is no doubt that governments seek to influence things right around the world. We know that. Australia does that on behalf of our national interest in other countries. We are having legislation that would make certain acts unlawful where it is done in a covert way that is designed to undermine our national interest in one form or another. So simply lobbying on a policy proposal or an issue to a politician would not engage these particular offences.

Where it's clear, in that instance, that we've got someone who's operating in the context of a foreign entity or is associated with a foreign entity seeking to influence the outcomes of the political process, it's not openly declared.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (11:37):  Minister, I'll just state the question again with a bit of extra information, which I think will address the point you were just making. In the case of a group of people in Australia working with a foreign organisation that had two or more foreign people as the directors of that organisation—which I understand would be caught under that definition—if that organisation was affected by a decision the Australian government had made or not made or by a failure of Australia's regulatory processes and the group of Australians were working with that foreign organisation with the intent of achieving justice for that organisation or the people that that organisation represents who are affected by the regulatory failure in Australia or the decision that the Australian government had made or not made, would the Australian people working with that foreign organisation be caught by the provisions of this bill?

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (11:38):  I think there might be a slight misunderstanding, if I heard your question correctly, in terms of 'What is a foreign principal?' You talked about 'two foreign nationals', I think, who were directors. I won't read the whole definition again, but I think you might be talking about proposed section 90.2(e). If that's the case, I think you've misunderstood that paragraph. That paragraph says:


(e) an entity or organisation owned, directed or controlled by 2 or more foreign principals …


And 'foreign principal' is then defined separately in the proposed legislation. I think it's pretty clear, based on the scenario you're talking about, that it wouldn't fit within that definition. But if you were talking about an entity that did fit within one of those definitions then the discussion we've had in terms of all of the elements of the offence would then potentially have to be applied if this piece of legislation were to be engaged.

As I understand the last bit of your response to all of those matters that I've put to you: if the definition of foreign principal were met by this foreign group, then, in the context of everything else I've put to you, my understanding of what you've just advised the Senate is that the Australians who were working with that foreign group would be caught by the provisions of this legislation.

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (11:40):  No, I'm sorry, that's not what I said. What I said was that the circumstances you've described don't fit under 90.2, the definition of 'foreign principal'. You're talking about another hypothetical scenario where, perhaps, a foreign government principal was the foreign organisation which was working with the Australian group. I'm not saying that the legislation would apply, I'm saying that if they were dealing with that foreign principal in order for the legislation to apply, then there's a number of offence elements—as set out, for instance, in 92.2, the offence of international foreign interference—which would all have to be engaged in order for someone to be committing an offence, potentially, under the legislation.


Simply talking to a foreign principal or simply advocating on issues that they happen to share their view on would not, in and of itself, go anywhere near engaging those offence elements. What I was trying to say to you was that the circumstance that you've defined there doesn't even reach the first hurdle of the definition of foreign principal. If they do fit under the definition of foreign principal, then there are extensive elements to a potential offence that would all have to be satisfied—in terms of the action being covert and the like in order to influence processes et cetera—in order for there to be an offence, potentially, under this legislation.

I just wanted to go back to the chilling effect that this legislation will have on freedom of political expression in Australia. I'm sure you'd agree that the High Court has found repeatedly that there is an implied freedom of political communication in Australia. Accepting that it's impossible for anybody to predict entirely accurately how the High Court's going to find in any circumstances—which, of course, makes a mockery of the Prime Minister's assertion on the floor of the House in regard to section 44 issues when he said 'and the High Court will so find'—do you agree that it's at least arguable that this legislation is in breach of the Constitution because it unreasonably curtails the implied freedom of political communication in Australia?

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (11:43):  There are a number of elements to that question, including a sort of political statement about the Prime Minister which I won't engage with you on. You've asked me a number of questions. Firstly: is there an implied freedom of political communication? When I studied law many years ago at the ANU, we did study a number of cases which went to those matters. I wouldn't claim to be an expert on those matters but, of course, the High Court has in a number of cases found an implied freedom of political communication.


The subsequent part of your question relates to whether it is arguable. I accept that some people have made the argument, but it is an argument that the government does not accept. It is a situation which the government has considered very carefully, taking extensive advice. There will always be some who disagree. Some of those experts who have been quoted in the past are no doubt eminent experts and I'm not questioning their qualifications, but they've also been on the public record predicting what the High Court might do and, in many cases, they've been wrong.



An honourable senator interjecting—




Senator SESELJA:
  Well, they've made an argument. You're saying, 'Is it arguable?' I'm saying there are some people who've made the argument. The government has taken extensive advice. The government does not agree with that argument—we reject it. And we absolutely believe it complies with all elements of the Constitution.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AG,2018-06-28,"



Senator BARTLETT
 (Queensland) (09:31):  According to the speakers list, I am the final speaker before the government's representative concludes the second reading debate on these two pieces of legislation. We will then move into the Committee of the Whole, where there will be a number of amendments and, of course, an obligation on the Senate to query at length the government and, potentially, the Labor opposition about the actual impact of the 280-odd amendments that were made to these pieces of legislation in the House of Representatives just two days ago.


Just to recap for people: we are talking about two very significant pieces of legislation, the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill 2018 and the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2018. These have been around since late last year. They were the subject of an inquiry by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, but, as multiple speakers have noted, that committee excludes anybody other than the Labor and coalition parties, which means that no other party, no other member of the Senate, has had any opportunity to be part of those deliberations. So what we are, in effect, dealing with, given that 280 amendments were made to these two pieces of legislation just two days ago in the House of Representatives, is pretty much new legislation. From all reports, it is improved legislation compared to the original version from last year—and thank heavens for that is all I can say, because they were abominations. But nonetheless, in effect, this is new legislation that the Senate is now having to consider in detail, just a couple of days later. That is the situation we are faced with. It's not the first time that's happened, of course. I am not particularly interested in doing a lot of faux outrage about that. I'm simply describing the situation as it stands.


I will take the opportunity to put on the record again, as I have multiple times in the last few months and as I did multiple times 10 or more years ago, that I think it is completely inappropriate that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security excludes people other than the Labor and coalition parties. It has been the case for that committee and its predecessors for a long period of time, apart from a brief interregnum when Andrew Wilkie was on it, at the time when there was a minority government and he was able to use that situation to get himself on it. I think that is correct.


I recall raising this many times when I was here in the past. Senator Robert Ray, in particular, would put the case then that Senator Wong put yesterday—that this is a committee that really is only for people from parties of government. I think those were the precise words she used. And that is clearly the view of the Labor Party and the coalition parties. It perhaps has its own internal logic, but it also demonstrates a serious part of the problem here. We have the Labor Party and the non-Labor parties in their various forms over the years that have basically been part of the political establishment and the governing class for decades—in fact, for over a century. They basically see defence matters, security matters, intelligence matters as their domain, and the public just have to trust them. Some of the time, that is fine, but you honestly don't need to be much of a student of political history to demonstrate that that agency has, at times, acted in a way that's quite clearly inappropriate. In fact, all you need to do is read the actual history that's been put and written or authorised by the actual agencies, such as ASIO—the history of ASIO, for example, that's been quite thoroughly written in recent times and published. The agency has quite clearly been acting in the interests of the governing class against the interests of the public and against people's basic civil liberties.


When I came back into this place towards the end of last year and made what would loosely be called my first speech, in the formal sense of the word, I made the comment that this parliament as a whole—and, historically, parliaments around the world—far too often operates to actually continue to keep the community under the thumb and to suppress people and oppress people in the interests of the establishment and the governing classes. That applies even more to the executive and government, where the executive class and the government class, over time, basically just assume that their interests equate to the public interest. History has shown time and time again that, in our own country, let alone so many other countries that like to call themselves a democracy, that has not been the case. The state operates to protect its own interests against the public, and, where necessary, oppresses and suppresses the public if the state sees its interests are threatened. Time and time again, that has been shown to happen. It's not some conspiracy theory; that's just a natural consequence of how an embedded governing class will operate if there is insufficient transparency. And one of the reasons that is able to happen is precisely because the relevant committee that can examine this stuff is contained and is exclusively for those people from the parties of government, who basically operate as their own separate club on these issues, and the public are excluded from it. The fact that that is happening again now should not be a surprise. In fact, it would be an extraordinary surprise if something different had happened. We all hoped something different might have happened this time. There was a huge amount of civil society outrage about what was being proposed. There were strong calls, particularly on the Labor Party, not to do a deal on this and to just scrap these bills, start again properly and involve civil society in putting forward a better alternative, but the status quo always comes back around each time.


That is not to deny, let me say, that there have no doubt been some good improvements. I'd again use historical equivalence. The former senator John Faulkner, who was widely respected in this place and who did take that role seriously, definitely reduced some of the very dangerous provisions of security legislation in their original form that were put forward by the government of the day. I acknowledge that, and I'm sure that has happened again here. Nonetheless, the simple fact is that, particularly in regard to the espionage and foreign interference bill, this is delivering another massive expansion of state powers with completely inadequate scrutiny and transparency and with completely inadequate opportunity to scrutinise what is happening and to test some of the assertions that will be put forward, I'm sure, by the relevant minister over the course of this debate.


Nowhere is that shown more clearly than if we go back to just yesterday and the reasons given as to why this is urgent. Forget about the procedural issues—whether or not a motion was needed. This is still being pushed through on the last day of the sitting period. We could just as easily deal with this in August. There's plenty of other legislation to deal with today—in particular the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018, which the Greens and Labor opposes and which has a 1 July start date, so it has to get through if it's going to be operating; although I certainly hope it doesn't get through—but somehow or other it's this national security legislation amendment bill that is urgent, and with no justification.


The only justification, and we all know it, is the political imperative of the by-elections—the so-called super Saturday coming up in four or five weeks. The only reason for the urgency we been given is a very short statement from the government yesterday saying that it's urgent because they say it's urgent in response to an 'unprecedented threat of espionage and foreign interference'. You don't need to have been here for years and years or to have followed these proceedings for years and years like I have to know how hollow the comment of 'unprecedented threat of espionage and foreign interference' is. Any basic student of history in this country, let alone anywhere around the world, knows that Western democracies—anywhere as authoritarian as you like—always fall back on the excuse of 'unprecedented threat of espionage or foreign interference'. It goes back to the history of Federation—'We've got to federate to protect ourselves against foreign interference.' It's the one thing that all governments use to try to justify giving themselves more power and to put fear in the community—they say, 'We have to do this because of this scary thing over there.'


Again, I'm not saying that there are no threats. Of course there are threats. But the issue here is: why do we need these extra powers to deal with those threats? And that question has been asked time and time again for 20 or more years now, for—Senator McKim told me the number yesterday.




Senator McKim:
  Over 200.




Senator BARTLETT:
  Over 200 times this has happened with different pieces of legislation and amendments at both state and federal levels over 20 years. At the federal level it would be well into double figures. We've amended these pieces of legislation 30 or 40 times. And each time I'm sure we heard 'unprecedented threat'. Each time I'm sure we heard 'urgent'. We've certainly heard them time and time again. I quoted yesterday from an example from August 2004, under the shadow of the same non-existent urgency to ban same-sex marriage. We also had the non-existent urgency to deal with an 'unspecified threat' that suddenly had to be dealt with.


Each time, we've never really had the opportunity to test why these specific powers are needed. And, inasmuch as there have been reviews of some of the extra powers that have been provided to agencies, like ASIO and espionage and intelligence agencies, very rarely has it been said, 'Yes, it was really good that that change was made because otherwise—' Some of these powers have never been used. But what they do give governments is more and more power to use and act in their own interests. This is the political class and the establishment class and the governing class and the state acting in their own interests against anybody they see as a threat.


I saw an interesting quote in an interview yesterday that Mr Hastie, the Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, gave to the ABC. The interviewer was asking, in respect of journalists, about how much transparency is okay, because the government's likely to say it's made amendments now that makes it okay for journalists—it's safe now, if it's in the national interest. It's the old national interest test that's used in so many pieces of legislation. It's all over the place. It's in the Migration Act as well. It never has any meaning. The government can interpret it to mean whatever it likes. National interest means what the government says it means, which means national interest is the government's interest. And that's how it has basically operated in a legal sense time and time again. But the particular quote that caught my eye was Mr Hastie saying that apparently, under these amended bills, there's robust defence for journalists, and another check and balance is that the Attorney-General has to consent for a prosecution. That's okay then! The Attorney-General has to consent! That makes me feel much more relaxed—not.


We saw—I spoke about this last year, and I think we'll see about a specific case later today—the Pine Gap protesters and the way the Attorney-General not only explicitly consented to pursuing but also tried to get peaceful, harmless protesters, who presented absolutely no security threat at all, jailed for years. On the matter of consent, the Attorney-General enthusiastically pursued the powers that they had—powers that hadn't been used for decades that were set up for completely different purposes under an act during the Cold War—and used those powers totally for political purposes. If they can use powers under a 60-year-old act that had been set up for completely separate purposes, in the context of the Cold War, to pursue harmless protesters conducting prayers and singing songs inside Pine Gap but nowhere near the actual facilities, imagine what they can do with all of the powers that this Senate keeps giving them time and time and time again. 


Mr Hastie also said there was protection, saying:


… the Attorney-General actually has to consent for a prosecution, so there's a number of different things that have to be done for a prosecution to proceed, and that's designed to prevent a chilling effect on the media because a free media is critical to democracy and we don't want to diminish that at all, in fact we want to enhance it and I think we've struck the right balance …


The ABC host said, 'Given you've made such bold statements about the need for free reporting of these matters, I'm curious as to whether you are uncomfortable with codifying jail time for journalists for doing just that—for acting as a free media.' Mr Hastie said:


What we can’t have is radical transparency.


This is a new concept—not just any old garden-variety transparency but 'radical transparency'. He said the whole point of the secrecy offences was 'to prevent privileged and classified information from being inappropriately disclosed'. Of course, it will be the government that will decide what is inappropriately disclosed. We all know the government itself, over time, has repeatedly disclosed classified information. When it's in their interests, they're happy to do it. They just don't want anybody else to do it if it's against their interests—and those are the interests of the government of the day. The ABC person said, 'So where do you draw a line? What is ""radical transparency""?' Mr Hastie said:


Radical transparency is Julian Assange dropping a whole bunch of commonwealth secrets out for public consumption … 


That's what it is. That's just one example. But he is, of course, an Australian citizen—from Queensland originally, I might say—who has basically been abandoned by this government. I'm not giving him a character reference, but I am certainly saying he has a right as an Australian citizen to receive proper support against what has clearly been an international conspiracy by governments to try and silence him. He has been kept in isolation for years. He has been basically silenced already because of the threat he poses to the state—not to the community, not to the public. The things that he exposed and, more specifically and definitely, that Edward Snowden exposed are things that governments wanted hidden, things so-called democratic governments were doing to their own people. So we have that definition: 'Radical transparency is Julian Assange.' These laws are attempts to criminalise and attack people like Julian Assange. Let's not forget that Julian Assange is acknowledged as and registered as a journalist, and actually won a Walkley Award for his work exposing governments acting against their own citizens. We've seen this time and time again in the United States; it's a case of great debate at the moment. 


Let's not forget the other very significant thing. We've had this march over the last couple of decades towards more and more powers for our intelligence agencies. The size of ASIO and relevant organisations has expanded, and the size of their budget has gone through the roof over the last couple of decades—and that's in the context of ASIO's own history, their published history, showing the number of times they've clearly overstepped their legal authority. They have clearly acted against the rights of citizens in this country, based on their own belief, their own internal little bubble. I'm not saying they're bad people; I'm saying that's what happens when people are put in a bubble and made to think that their views are the only views that matter, and where there is no transparency and the powers that people are given are absolute. It is almost inevitable that, regardless of the good character of those involved, if people are put in a situation where they're given such absolute powers with such minimal accountability and transparency, you will get abuse of those powers. So, to expand those powers further, particularly without proper scrutiny and genuine opportunity to test the assertions made by the government of the day as to what those powers will and won't mean, is incredibly dangerous. That's why the Senate should have supported Senator McKim's motion to have these new pieces of legislation scrutinised by a Senate committee. 


I'm sure the minister will give answers he believes are true, as he's advised, over the course of the committee stage of this debate. However, there is no capacity for those answers to be tested by a range of other people and all of the legal experts in this country who have a whole range of different political views, ideological perspectives and philosophical ideals. We will do the best we can but, as good as Senator McKim and others in this chamber might be with their forensic minds, it would be much better to open that up to all of the forensic minds around this country to properly test all of the amendments that have been put forward to make sure they do what they say they are going to do. Even if you totally agree philosophically with the intent of what's being proposed here—which I do not—this would make sure that there are not broader powers than are intended, that they're worded the right way and that there are commas in the right places. We all know of times when this has gone wrong in the past. I'm deeply concerned about what is being done here. It is deeply disappointing that the Labor opposition is going along with the government in this process, although it is unfortunately not surprising because it's happened so many times before.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2018-06-28,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (09:51):  I have spoken already in this debate, so I don't seek to add to the substantive debate. I do, however, wish to briefly respond to the second reading amendments which were moved after I spoke. There were second reading amendments moved by Senator McKim, on sheets 8475 and 8476. There is also an amendment to be moved by Senator Patrick. Senator McKim's amendments seek to refer these bills to a further committee inquiry, and Senator Patrick is seeking to refer his amendments on sheet 8446 to an inquiry by the PJCIS. 


First, the effect of all of these amendments would be to interrupt further consideration of the bills. Under the committee's report in August, for the reasons that I outlined yesterday, the opposition will not be supporting further inquiry or delay on these bills, noting the extensive inquiry that has been undertaken by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. 


The amendments proposed by Senator Patrick on sheet 8472, which are the subject of referrals, seek to inform the intelligence committee's oversight powers in the Intelligence Services Act. I do wish to, again, mark that Labor has long sought to improve the oversight powers of the parliament with respect to intelligence and security legislation, and the operations of intelligence and security agencies. In addition, the L'Estrange and Merchant review of the Australian intelligence community recommended changes to the oversight powers of the PJCIS. The opposition welcomed these recommendations, and we hope the government will similarly consider them with a favourable eye. 


The oversight imperative was the purpose of the Faulkner reforms, which were proposed in this place by former senator John Faulkner—also a member, at that time, of the intelligence committee prior to his retirement. I would invite Senator Patrick to engage with the opposition and, in particular, Senator McAllister, who now has carriage of the legislation on these matters. I also invite the government to work with us to progress sensible and constructive reforms in line with the L'Estrange and Merchant review of the Australian intelligence community.

"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2018-06-28,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (09:54):  I want to thank my parliamentary colleagues for their contributions to the debate on the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2018—the EFI Bill; and the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill 2017—the FITS Bill. 


These two bills have been considered in detail by several parliamentary committees, and I thank those committees for their contributions. I particularly thank the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security for their detailed consideration of these two bills. The committee has produced detailed and robust reports, having considered the bills over a period of some six months. It received a total of 143 submissions and 68 supplementary submissions, held multiple public and private hearings and received multiple classified briefings. The committee considered the detailed proposed government amendments to each bill provided to it by the Attorney-General, which were the subject of further public hearings and submissions. The committee tabled its report on the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill on 7 June 2018 and its report on the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill on 25 June 2018. The government has accepted all of the committee's recommendations, as it has for each of the previous 10 tranches of national security legislation.


With respect to the EFI bill, covert interference and espionage by nation states are global realities which have the potential to cause immense harm to our national sovereignty, the safety of our people, our economic prosperity and the very integrity of our democracy. To counter this threat, Australia must have a robust legislative framework to ensure our law enforcement and national security agencies are sufficiently empowered to investigate and disrupt malicious foreign interference. The reforms in the EFI bill are comprehensive. They represent the most significant counterintelligence reforms since the 1970s. The measures in the bill will fundamentally reshape our national security offences to protect Australia's sovereignty and information, and protect the democratic principles and values that underpin our society.


The EFI bill includes comprehensive new espionage offences that are designed to capture the full range of conduct undertaken to compromise sensitive information and prejudice our national security. The new offences will target not just the person who discloses the information but also the actions of the foreign principal who receives the information. The bill will also introduce an offence criminalising economic espionage, or the theft of trade secrets, which will apply to dishonest dealings with trade secrets on behalf of a foreign government principal.


Senator McKim expressed the view that the espionage offences might capture persons who disclose information about potential human rights abuses or breaches of international law to international advocacy organisations or the United Nations. Senator Wong addressed these issues in her contribution to the debate, as did the shadow Attorney-General in his contribution to the second reading debate in the other place. I will not restate the point that Senator Wong and the shadow Attorney-General correctly made. A person seeking to draw human rights concerns to the attention of the United Nations or other international organisations will not commit an espionage offence as they did not intend to; nor are they reckless as to whether their conduct will prejudice Australia's national security.


The EFI bill will introduce, for the first time, a suite of foreign interference offences into the Criminal Code. These offences will complement espionage offences by criminalising a range of other harmful conduct undertaken by foreign principals who seek to interfere with Australia's political, governmental or democratic processes to support their own intelligence activities or to otherwise prejudice Australia's national security. Senator Leyonhjelm set out a series of scenarios where a person might entirely properly communicate with a foreign government in private in the course of informing themselves on a matter of public importance before engaging in debate in Australia. I want to thank the senator for providing specific examples and for clearly identifying the legislative provisions that he is concerned may be engaged. I can reassure the senator that the scenarios, as he described them, would not constitute foreign interference offences. In the scenarios he sets out, a person will only commit a foreign interference offence if they seek to covertly or deceptively influence a political or governmental process on behalf of or in collaboration with a foreign government—that is to say: it is the act of influence in the process that must be covert or deceptive for the offence to be committed.


The EFI bill contains a suite of new Commonwealth secrecy offences, which replaces sections 70 and 79 of the Crimes Act. There will be separate offences that apply to Commonwealth officers and non-Commonwealth officers. The offences that apply to non-Commonwealth officers will be narrower in scope and attract lower penalties. Defences will apply to ensure the offences do not apply too broadly, including a defence specifically applying to journalists as well as editorial and support staff who reasonably believe that their conduct was in the public interest. The new secrecy offences ensure harmful information cannot be released, while appropriate defences protect freedom of speech.


The EFI bill will update and simplify the offences of treason and treachery, as well as archaic and outdated offences in part 2 of the Crimes Act. These are some of the oldest offences in the statute book. As such, they require modernisation and updates to the language to reflect the modern environment and international law concepts of armed conflict. The EFI bill will also introduce reformed sabotage offences into the Criminal Code. The new offences will criminalise conduct causing damage to critical infrastructure where it could prejudice Australia's national security. The new offences will apply higher penalties where sabotage offences are committed on behalf of foreign principals and will also contain offences that apply where a person's conduct leaves an item or system vulnerable to future misuse or exploitation. Senator McKim expressed the view that the sabotage offences might capture persons who picket a coalmine or port. Senator Wong addressed these issues also in her contribution to the debate, as did the shadow Attorney-General in his contribution to the second reading debate in the other place. A person engaged in ordinary and lawful protest will not commit a sabotage offence, as they did not intend to nor are they reckless as to whether their conduct will prejudice Australia's national security.


 Finally, the EFI bill will amend the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 to ensure the powers under that act are available to investigate the offences contained in the EFI bill. While foreign actors are free to promote their interests in Australia's free and open society this must be done in a lawful and open way. The FITS Bill will provide transparency for the Australian government and the Australian public about efforts by foreign governments, foreign political organisations, and persons and entities closely related to foreign governments and foreign political organisations to use intermediaries to influence Australia's political and government processes. Decision-makers in the Australian government—and the public—should know what interests are being advanced in respect of a particular decision or process. For the first time, the public and decision-makers in government will have access to information to enable them to accurately assess how foreign sources may be seeking to influence Australia's government and political processes. The bill will empower the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department to issue a transparency notice setting out whether a particular entity or individual is related to a foreign government. Transparency notices will assist potential registrants to understand whether they are required to register and will also shed light where a company or individual seeks to conceal their relationship with a foreign principal.


The FITS bill exempts a range of organisations and persons from registering under the scheme. The exemptions extend to humanitarian assistance, legal advice, diplomatic activities, religious activities, commercial or business pursuits, industry representative bodies, individuals making personal legal representations, registered charities, activities with an artistic purpose, certain registered organisations and certain professions. These exemptions appropriately restrict the application of the scheme to those organisations and persons which seek to influence Australian political and government decisions or processes in a way that threatens Australian institutions. Senator McCarthy raised the issue of Indigenous rangers working in collaboration with international charities such as The Pew Charitable Trusts. I am pleased to say that the bill, incorporating the Attorney-General's amendments as well as those recommended by the PJCIS, will place beyond doubt that Indigenous rangers are not required to register in such circumstances. The FITS Bill will introduce offences which will promote compliance with the scheme.


I would like to thank my parliamentary colleagues for recognising the need for these important measures in these two bills. Comprehensive criminal laws are a critical part of Australia's response to the threat of espionage and foreign interference. The EFI bill reflects the government's commitment to addressing this threat and ensuring that our law enforcement and security agencies have the powers they need to respond to the broad spectrum of foreign interference and related criminal activities directed against Australia's interests. Legislative reform is also a critical step in shedding light on foreign interference. The FITS Bill reflects the government's commitment to addressing this issue and to ensuring that the public and decision-makers in government will have access to information to enable them to accurately assess how foreign sources may be seeking to influence Australia's government and political processes. I commend both bills to the Senate.

Senator CHISHOLM:
  I seek leave to make a short statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator CHISHOLM:
  The opposition is moving this motion today to ensure compliance with the guidelines for the use of special purpose aircraft published by the Department of Finance. Under paragraph 25 of these guidelines, the Minister for Defence is responsible for tabling the schedule of special purpose flights:


…in June (for the six months ending the previous 31 December) and December (for the six months ending the previous 30 June).


Regrettably, under this government, the schedule has routinely been tabled late. For example, the flight schedules for 1 January 2016 to 30 June 2016, which were to be tabled by the end of December, were not tabled until 8 August 2017—over eight months late. Six other schedules, out of nine, have been tabled late by the government.


The convention is that schedules are tabled in the last sitting day of June and December. Today is the last scheduled sitting day in June. I note the opposition has only taken this step after inquiring of the minister's office and giving the minister advanced notice of this motion, which, regrettably, has not resulted in the schedule being produced.

Senator McGRATH:
  The government opposes this motion. As per longstanding convention, the schedule is tabled twice yearly by the government once data collection and verification activities have occurred. The schedule or special purpose flights for the period 1 July to 31 December 2017 will be tabled in accordance with standard processes.

Senator GRIFF
 (South Australia) (11:59):  I move:


That the Senate—


(a) acknowledges that on 25 July 2018 the world's first IVF (in-vitro-fertilisation) baby, Louise Joy Brown, celebrates her 40th birthday;


(b) notes that:


   (i) IVF clinics provide a valuable service to the Australian community,


   (ii) there is a lack of publicly available performance data for individual IVF clinics—an annual report is produced by the University of New South Wales's National Perinatal Epidemiology & Statistics Unit (NPESU) but it only provides a national overview of the performance of participating clinics,


   (iii) no clinic-specific information is made public—IVF clinics can choose what information they disclose, if any, relating to their own success rates,


   (iv) according to the 2014 NPESU report, live birth rates between fertility clinics varied from between 9 per cent and 24 per cent for fresh cycles, and in 2012, the difference in live birth rates between clinics was as low as 4 per cent and as high as 31 per cent, the most recent report, for 2015, did not disclose these statistics,


   (v) in 2015, Richard Henshaw, a senior fertility expert with the Monash group of IVF clinics told the ABC's AM program that clinics in the top 25th percentile cost Medicare around $2 million to produce 100 live births, and clinics in the bottom 25th percentile cost Medicare triple that amount to produce 100 live births,


   (vi) the average cost of one IVF cycle in Australia (excluding other ancillary treatments) is $9,290, with estimated out of pocket costs being $4,502,


   (vii) lack of transparency rewards poor performing clinics while denying consumers the opportunity to make an informed choice about their treatment options,


   (viii) in the US, the CDC publishes performance data for 463 IVF clinics in a searchable database, broken down by procedures, pregnancies and live birth rates, and


   (ix) in the UK, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority publishes broad performance data for individual clinics and allows patients to rate clinics and see whether the clinic meets formal inspector standards; and


(c) calls on the Federal Government to work with industry to publish individual clinic performance data in a searchable database to ensure Australian families are able to make an informed choice in relation to their fertility treatment.

Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (12:00):  I move:


That the Senate—


(a) notes that:


   (i) on 20 June 2018, the Senate agreed to an order for production of documents directed at the Minister representing the Minister for Defence Industry (Senator Payne) for the following from the Final Cost Estimate Template that DCNS submitted in response to the Future Submarine Competitive Evaluation Process:


(A) the summary sheet total 'Australian Build Price', and


(B) the total sustainment cost from year one to year 40 including labour, material and other costs,


   (ii) the Minister has not tabled the information and has advanced a claim of public interest immunity on the basis that the material is commercially confidential,


   (iii) it is a long accepted view that total values are not commercial in confidence, noting the following:


(A) total costs that do not detail the scope of supply and/or services offered do not reveal any commercially sensitive information,


(B) AUSTENDER publishes total costs of all contracts,


(C) on 3 April 2018, the Department of Defence publicly released the total offer price in Luerssen's Offshore Patrol Vessel tender responses,


(D) the numbers sought in the order are for prices for a pre-concept design to meet purported unique requirements of the Royal Australian Navy's submarine force, not a real submarine design,

  The public interest immunity claimed by the minister in this instance is extremely shallow, suggesting that a total number offered on a submarine preconcept design that will never see the light of day is in some way commercially in confidence. In fact, the Department of Defence recently released the total number offered for the offshore patrol vessel contract. There is no reason why this number shouldn't be provided to the Senate.

(A) the summary sheet total 'Australian Build Price', and


(B) the total sustainment cost from year one to year 40 including labour, material and other costs,


   (ii) the Minister has not tabled the information and has advanced a claim of public interest immunity on the basis that the material is commercially confidential,


   (iii) it is a long accepted view that total values are not commercial in confidence, noting the following:


(A) total costs that do not detail the scope of supply and/or services offered do not reveal any commercially sensitive information,


(B) AUSTENDER publishes total costs of all contracts,


(C) on 3 April 2018, the Department of Defence publicly released the total offer price in Luerssen's Offshore Patrol Vessel tender responses,

  I want to talk a little bit about Hamel. It's a place I've visited on the Western Front, and I took the diary of my great-grandfather, who served there. And my Uncle Charlie won the Distinguished Service Medal very close to Hamel. So this is an issue that I take very seriously. I want to say today that it's fine to commemorate the sacrifice of Australian soldiers, US soldiers and other allied soldiers at a place like Hamel, but to tie it with blind allegiance to our US alliance is, I think, quite offensive. The Greens have raised as an issue the need for us to revisit our alliance. It's a perfectly rational thing. This motion does point out that that alliance dates back to the 1940s. It's high time we reviewed our relationship with the US, but to somehow tie it to a historic battle that is personal for many of us is offensive.

… what Venezuela has been able to achieve in so little time will be a source of inspiration and ideas for many in Australia. 


Today Labor and the Greens are joining to deny formality to my motion on Venezuela in order to hide their embarrassment and division. My notice of motion details how the IMF, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights have all lambasted the Venezuelan regime. 


Last year, the Victorian branch of the CFMEU and the Sydney branch of the Maritime Union of Australia both unanimously resolved to pledge solidarity with the people of Venezuela and their 'Bolivarian revolution' socialist government.

  Labor has denied this motion being taken as a formal motion because we do not believe complex and contested matters, including matters that concern foreign relations, should be dealt with in a way that compels senators to take a binary position on these matters without debate. For that reason, I'm restating and reaffirming Labor's long-held position that complex and contested matters should not be pursued by way of formal motions. With respect to this motion, the partisan language employed is a clear example of why such a motion cannot be dealt with as formal business. However, despite the intemperate language and some questionable assertions of fact, Labor would support the motion substantively. 


On 21 May 2018, at the G20 foreign ministers meeting, Australia, together with the governments of Argentina, Canada, Chile, Mexico and the United States, issued a joint statement on Venezuela.

The PRESIDENT
 (15:04):  Senators, as some of you may be aware, this morning marked the last occasion on which I will be ushered into the Senate by Brien Hallett, the Usher of the Black Rod. Brien joined the Senate department in January 2009 after undertaking senior roles in the Australian Electoral Commission and as Deputy Official Secretary to the Governor-General. He will shortly commence leave, pending his retirement prior to our resumption.


All of us have firsthand experience of Brien's courtesy and professionalism. He's often been the first point of contact for new senators—a somewhat busier job in the last 12 months than it was previously!—and he embodies the service ethos of the Senate department and the Black Rod's office, in particular. I've been particularly appreciative of his advice and support since I took this office last year.


Brien also led the Senate Committee Office in the previous parliament during an extended period of particularly high and intense committee activity. The capacity of the secretariats to cheerfully meet the Senate's requirements during that time is a credit to his leadership.


Senators should also be aware that part of the legacy Brien will leave behind will be found in two publications, There being no objection and I seek leave to continue my remarks, which bring to life, principally, in Brien's words, 'forgotten tales from the Australian Senate and the wider parliamentary world'.


I know we all think that all staff of the Senate, and particularly it's leadership, are important custodians of the traditions, mores and values of this place. They play a crucial role in assisting those of us elected to it to uphold and develop these as time goes on. I am sure that all senators will join me in thanking Brien for his exemplary service to the Senate and wishing him a long and leisurely retirement.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Finance, Special Minister of State and Vice-President of the Executive Council) (15:06):  by leave—Mr President, I rise to make some brief remarks on your statement on behalf of the government. With hindsight, it is possible to see each step in Mr Hallett's career as preparation for his time in the Department of the Senate and his eventual elevation to the job of Usher of the Black Rod. Graduating from the University of Melbourne, he became a high school English teacher in the western suburbs of Melbourne. Some may argue that his firm grounding in Shakespeare's tragedies and comedies left him well prepared for the drama of the Senate chamber from time to time. Similarly, his degree in journalism no doubt proved useful when dealing with the press gallery, which from time to time is known to invade areas that they shouldn't. Mr Hallett also worked in the media and public affairs areas of the Australian Electoral Commission, which is part of my broader portfolio. Later, a stint as Deputy Official Secretary to the Governor-General offered him a unique insight into our nation's political process and ceremonial matters more broadly.


Outside of this place, Mr Hallett's ongoing service as treasurer of the Michelago Rural Fire Brigade—I am from a humble non-English speaking background, so I am very sorry if I inappropriately pronounced this—in his local community speaks to a man with a genuine concern for his community. It also suggests that he has experienced putting out more than just the spot fires that can occasionally spring up on the Senate floor.


In addition to serving as Usher of the Black Rod, Mr Hallett has also run the Senate Committee Office and served as a clerk at the table, graduating to the right-hand chair just last year—a rare honour. I see him nodding. I note that you are nodding because, as is often observed, Hansard cannot pick up a nod.


On behalf of the Senate, and on behalf of the government, I thank Mr Hallett for his distinguished service to the Australian parliament and, in particular, the Senate and wish him all the best in his retirement.

You've served our nation diligently and efficiently for many years, although I confess that I have never got the spelling of your name completely right in my head! As Senator Cormann and the President have said, Brien is currently the Usher of the Black Rod for another month and a bit. Mr Hallett has always been helpful in assisting senators, particularly new senators, with a broad range of matters for which the office is the principal contact. I was reminded in estimates, I think earlier this year, that this was the third time that Mr Hallett was the Usher of the Black Rod.


Mr Hallett's interest in and knowledge of Senate practices and, dare I say it, eccentricities have obviously contributed to the publications that the President has described. As Senator Cormann has said, he served as clerk at the table in the Deputy Clerk's chair and more recently had the honour of serving in the Clerk's chair.


Mr Hallett garners much respect and affection from his colleagues and from senators in this place. He's regarded as a team player extraordinaire. He played an instrumental role in supporting colleagues through the establishment of the new departmental leadership team over the last 12 months. I'm also advised that he is a delightful MC at the Department of the Senate annual Christmas party and a regular and reliable supplier to his colleagues of eggs from his chooks.


Brien, I know you're looking forward to your retirement. I know you'll miss us—well, we hope so! We're probably likely to miss you more. On behalf of the Labor Party, thank you for all you have done not just in this role but in your previous roles. We all give you leave to continue your remarks.

  As one of the recent entrants that Mr Hallett has had the opportunity to welcome to this place, I would like to thank him for his hospitality and guidance, and particularly his assistance in facilitating my rather unusual needs in joining you all here as a legislator. It has been an honour to work with you and to be part of this process with you in making this space more accessible and inclusive for all Australians. I would like to extend my personal thanks for the assistance you've offered me in that process that continues going forward.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  Earlier today, during the motion relating to violence against women, Senator Leyonhjelm yelled an offensive and sexist slur at me from across the chamber. After the vote on the motion was complete, I walked over to the senator and confronted him directly. I asked whether I had heard him correctly. He confirmed that he had yelled, 'You should stop shagging men, Sarah.' Shocked, I told him that he was a creep. His reply was to tell me to 'f… off'. I informed the leader of the Greens, and he has raised it with both Senator Leyonhjelm and the President. I am disappointed that the senator has refused to apologise for this offensive and sexist slur, and I call on him to formally withdraw and apologise directly.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (15:14):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister representing the Minister for Finance (Senator Cormann) to the questions asked by Senators Singh, Marshall and Keneally relating to taxation.


Once again we had the example of Senator Cormann audaciously stating that the market will do everything for working people in this country and demanding that we simply accept that taking $80 billion out of government funding for health, for education, for pensions and for family benefits and hand it over to the big end of town—and hand over $17 billion of that straight to the banks—would make for a better Australia. What an absolute nonsense!


This is nothing but a rabble of a government. They are at each other's throats every day of the week. The only plan they have come up with for the future of this country is a plan for smaller government. Well, I can tell you what smaller government means. Smaller government means that the health system will be crushed. Smaller government means that the education system will not have the funding to make sure that we have a world-class education system. Smaller government means that people who need social security support will not get it. That's exactly what smaller government means. And that's exactly what will happen when you take $80 billion out of the public purse and hand it over to the big end of town, where executive salaries will go through the roof, where it will be simply buying back shares to force up the price of shares and making sure that executives get higher pay. That is what it's all about—and we know that it doesn't work.


Then there was this nonsense that we heard today about 'a rising tide will rise all boats'. What a load of nonsense! When you have a government punching holes in the boat of social security, that boat sinks. When you have a government that's punching holes in the health system, that boat sinks. And when you have a government that punches holes in the education system, that boat sinks. What sinks with that is a decent society, a decent Australia, an Australia that was once egalitarian but is nothing like it under this rabble of a government—a government that is too busy carving each other up on climate change and on economy policy and carving each other up over personalities. They are so diverted from focusing on the real issues for ordinary Australian people that they have lost all sense of reality in terms of what's important for working people and working families in this country.


They are teaming up with the Business Council of Australia. Why wouldn't the Business Council of Australia get out there and argue that it's great to hand $80 billion of public money back to big business, back to multinational corporations? The Business Council represent the highest paid chief executives in the country, and the money will go straight back to chief executives in higher pay. Why wouldn't they support this proposition? Why wouldn't they be saying, 'Give us more small government and we'll take higher wages and higher executive salaries'? 


Here we have a government that does what Senator Cash was doing—infiltrating all areas of the Public Service and appointing people in the Public Service that will look after the interests of the Liberal Party. We don't have an independent Public Service anymore. We've got a Public Service infiltrated by Liberal nominees who look after the Liberal Party. They are doing the same thing with Brian Loughnane and Andrew Bragg, the executive director of the Business Council of Australia—straight from the Liberal Party into the Business Council. There is absolutely no understanding of the key issues facing the Australian public and no understanding of what is good for Australia. They are only looking after themselves and the big end of town.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2018-06-28,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania) (15:20):  The undermining of Mr Shorten is now in full swing, as witnessed by the contribution we just heard, because Mr Bill Shorten, the current Leader of the Opposition, is unequivocally on the public record as saying that company tax cuts do flow through to the community. So Senator Cameron's contribution this afternoon has been a complete repudiation of that which Mr Shorten has said on the public record. Let me quote Mr Shorten:


Cutting the company income tax rate increases domestic productivity and domestic investment. More capital means higher productivity and economic growth and leads to more jobs and higher wages.


So when Senator Cameron seeks to assert to the unwitting people of Australia that cutting company tax just goes to line other people's pockets—namely, company directors—he is either deliberately misleading the Australian people or is clothing himself in complete ignorance and, of course, is in defiance of what his own leader said. Indeed, former Prime Minister Ms Gillard also was on record as saying:


If you are against cutting company tax, you are against economic growth.


The current shadow Treasurer, Mr Bowen, said that cutting company taxes was 'a Labor thing'. And guess who's sort of been saying that in recent times? The would-be Leader of the Opposition, Mr Albanese. He is starting to sidle up to business, knowing the importance of having a good relationship with the corporate sector, because ultimately they are the ones that provide the jobs within the community.


Senator Cameron is not right very often. On this occasion, when he says that there's a disproportionate benefit flowing from these company tax cuts, he's right—but not in the way that he so misleadingly asserted. Indeed, Professor Richard Holden, Professor of Economics at the UNSW Business School, has said that benefits to workers tend to flow disproportionately from company tax cuts—now listen to this—to women, to young people and to the less skilled. That is whom company tax cuts benefit.


So why is it that the current leader of the Labor Party is so maniacally opposed to delivering this support to women, young people and the less skilled? Because the Labor Party, when they are in extreme socialist mode, want to keep people on low wages. They want to keep them as victims, because then they can control them, courtesy of government; whereas the Liberal Party approach, the coalition approach, is to say to people on low incomes and whose jobs are vulnerable: 'We don't want to keep you down. We actually want to lift you up. Rather than having you as victims, we want to make you victors.' That is why delivering these company tax cuts does deliver more jobs and higher wages—something recognised by Labor leader after Labor leader. And, what's more, these benefits flow disproportionately in favour of women, young people and the less skilled.


So it will be very interesting to see how Senator Keneally, who might be taking note later on, is going to debunk that which the professor from the UNSW school of business economics has so rightly pointed out. They are the benefits. They are the recognised benefits. That is why Mr Shorten, Ms Gillard, Mr Bowen, Senator Penny Wong and Dr Andrew Leigh have—



Senator Pratt interjecting—




Senator ABETZ:
 The list of Labor Party people supporting company tax cuts, for the benefits I have outlined, is as long as my arm. But, today, for cheap political reasons, because they have decided to run the politics of envy rather than the politics of lifting people, rather than saying, 'We share your aspiration and we will assist you in achieving your aspirations,' they want to play the card of envy.

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (15:25):  I also rise this afternoon to take note of questions asked of Senator Cormann by Senators Keneally, Singh, and Marshall. Day after day we see the Liberals and the coalition here in this place arguing for the Liberal good, not for the common good, which is really a misnomer of a campaign designed to paper over the public interest in this country in favour of massive $80 billion corporate tax cuts. What we saw from Senator Cormann was a complete failure to address the question asked by Senator Keneally about the false campaign that's being run to try to build a mandate for these ridiculous corporate tax cuts.


Centre Ground is clearly running what can be seen to be an astroturfing campaign that has no real community sentiment behind it—their campaign called the Common Good in support of corporate tax cuts in South Australia, Queensland and Tasmania. Senator Cormann did not address, in any way, Senator Keneally's question, which was seeking to address the BCA's decision to use a front group to run a phoney grassroots campaign. These are the efforts to which the coalition and the BCA are prepared to go to try and mount a pre-election campaign in support of something that is clearly not in Australia's national interest. What we have here is an $80 billion big-business company tax cut that will drive, as interjections have shown, a large structural hole in our budget. This would leave our nation bereft of opportunities to fund future government service delivery and would not guarantee new investment in really critical areas of our nation.


As the opposition has argued in relation to alternative ways of stimulating the economy, we've seen recent modelling from the Melbourne Economic Forum by Janine Dixon which shows that, compared to a company tax cut, an investment subsidy is actually up to three times more effective as a stimulus to investment. And this was certainly shown during the global financial crisis when Labor gave tax breaks for business-level investment. That significantly boosted growth in our nation at a critical time. Instead, we see false economics coming from those opposite who are more interested in the Liberal good and giving support to their mates at the big end of town.


It really is a wonder to me that Senator Cormann could not answer Senator Keneally's question about whether there were and are any shared tactics between the BCA and the coalition regarding this BCA campaign. And it's very, very clear that there is, given that the BCA has appointed a former Liberal Party director to its new political advisory board, has also hired former political party director Andrew Bragg as its executive director for members and has established this new front group to create a false idea of there being a real grassroots campaign in this nation.


When the Labor Party go out campaigning on these issues, we will be in step with real communities and real people, knocking on doors around this nation, raising our real concerns and having real conversations with Australians about what a false and ridiculous idea this $80 billion tax cut to Australian big business really is.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2018-06-28,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:30):  I want to have a little game with Senator Pratt and Senator Keneally and ask them this question. It's like a game of 'Who am I?' or, perhaps, 'Who said this?' I will ask Senator Pratt who said this:


If you are against cutting company tax, you are against economic growth.


Who said that? Let me give you a three-part suggestion on who it might be. It could have been Malcolm Turnbull, it could have been Senator Mathias Cormann and it could have been Labor Prime Minister Julia Gillard. There you are—that should make it easy for you to pick who said that. Actually, it's a trick question, because all three of them said that. Ms Gillard, in March 2012, said:


If you are against cutting company tax, you are against economic growth.


Let me give you more:


... reducing company tax ... promotes investment, creates jobs and drives growth.


Who said that? No answer? I can give you the answer to that one: that was the Labor shadow Treasurer, Mr Chris Bowen, who wrote a book about it. He said:


... reducing company tax ... promotes investment, creates jobs and drives growth.


Here we are. My friends opposite haven't done very well in answering those questions, so how about these:


... cutting the company tax rate increases domestic productivity and domestic investment.


…   …   …


More capital means higher productivity and economic growth and leads to more jobs and higher wages.


Who said that?



Senator McGrath interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Yes, you've got it right, Senator McGrath: it was none other than Mr Bill Shorten, in August 2011. So there we go. If Mr Shorten said, in August 2011, 'Cutting the company tax rate increases domestic productivity and domestic investment. More capital means higher productivity and economic growth and leads to more jobs and higher wages,' then I ask the next Labor speaker, whom I guess is Senator Keneally: what changed Mr Shorten's mind? What changed Ms Gillard's mind when she said, 'If you are against cutting company tax, you are against economic growth'? They're her words; they're not mine; they're not Senator McGrath's. They are the words of the Labor Prime Minister.


Mr Shorten—I've given away the answer before I've asked the question—said this:


Any student of Australian business and economic history since the mid-1980s, knows part of Australia's success was derived through the reduction in the company tax rate.


That's what Mr Shorten said; not me, not Senator McGrath. Not even Senator Cormann said that. That was Mr Bill Shorten, the Leader of the Labor Party, who is now saying, 'Corporate tax cuts are bad for Australia.' I'll even hang around for a little while to hear Senator Keneally explain to me why those three Labor luminaries—and there are many others as well—were so precise and clear and emphatic and dogmatic about the fact that cutting company tax increases productivity, improves wages, creates jobs and drives growth. They are very clear; there's no misunderstanding of those words. And I'll wait around for a minute or so of Senator Keneally's speech to let her tell me why those three Labor luminaries said that just a couple of years ago and suddenly now they are stating the exact opposite position. I'd be fascinated to hear the answer.

"Keneally, Sen Kristina",ALP,2018-06-28,"



Senator KENEALLY
 (New South Wales) (15:35):  I'm so honoured that Senator Macdonald is going to stay in the chamber and listen to me. Thank you so much. I can dispense with these issues rather quickly. He cites a time when we were debating company tax. Who was opposing it at that time? The coalition opposed it. That's right. So let's just get that on the record right there. They opposed it, they opposed it, they opposed it. Secondly, the scale of multinational tax avoidance is now much clearer than it was back in 2011, and Labor has taken strong steps to address that. Thirdly, I'll tell you what's different between 2011 and now: the debt run up by this coalition government—half a trillion dollars. Remember when we used to have a debt and deficit emergency, when Tony Abbott was running around as though it was somehow important to solve the debt and deficit problems? Well, this government has run up the debt, crashed through half a trillion dollars. That's the ceiling they've got to be proud of.


That's the problem we have right now: the $200 billion in tax giveaways from this government—their corporate tax cut and their personal income tax cuts. They wanted to give money to multinationals and millionaires and take money off pensioners, students and working people. They came in here and voted against a personal income tax cut that was double what they were offering for working people—and they've got the hide to come in here and make an argument about corporate tax cuts! No wonder Senator Macdonald has left the chamber: he is ashamed to be part of a government that has run up the debt, that has run up the deficit, when they came to office saying they were going to get the budget under control. In fact, they have sent it spiralling out of control.


What is their prescription now for a budget that is in perilous circumstances, whereby in a best-case scenario, under their projections, we will get to a sliver of surplus? We will not be paying down debt for years. We put the budget in a very precarious position under their plan by going for a big corporate tax cut and a big tax cut for millionaires—the big end of town. Of course that is who the Business Council of Australia is representing when they run this fake, phony, grassroots campaign, commonly called astroturf. Astroturf, of course, is fake grass. An astroturf campaign is a fake, phony grassroots campaign. The Business Council of Australia have form on this. They ran their For the Common Good campaign in the South Australian state election. If you went to the For the Common Good website, if you went to their Facebook page, you would not see any Business Council of Australia logo or identification. You'd have to dig right down into the fine print, find Centre Ground, find them there, work out who their directors were. By the way, their directors included Andrew Bragg, a former Liberal Party director, now hired by the Business Council of Australia as an executive director. He is a director of Centre Ground, and Centre Ground is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Business Council of Australia.


The South Australian election was on 17 March. When did the Business Council of Australia disclose its ownership of Centre Ground? When did they own up to the fact that they were really behind the For the Common Good campaign? It was on 27 March. That is not transparent. That is not being up-front. That is running a shifty, underground campaign through a front group, trying to pretend that somehow there is a groundswell of support from the Australian community for corporate tax cuts.


This is not a grassroots campaign. This is a campaign being run by the business elite of Australia masquerading as something out there 'for the common good'. Well, now they're out there running this For the Common Good campaign in Queensland and in Tasmania. Surprise, surprise: we have by-elections in these two states, and they're out there trying to pretend there is a groundswell of support in these states for an $80 billion tax giveaway to big business. If you were a resident in one of these states and happened to wander onto social media, Facebook or Instagram and saw an ad that they were running on YouTube, you'd be very hard-pressed to know that this was actually a political message coming from the Business Council of Australia—the mates, the campaigning arm, of the Liberal Party. For the Common Good are out there raising $26 million from their corporate members to run this fake, phoney grassroots campaign. Well, this is not for the common good. An $80 billion tax giveaway to big business is not for the common good; it is not good for working people. The only good that the For the Common Good campaign is serving is the good of the Liberal Party.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2018-06-28,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training and Manager of Government Business in the Senate) (15:46):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



Many millions of Australians have had multiple superannuation accounts throughout their lives and many often leave these accounts untouched, only to find that have been eroded to virtually nothing through fees, charges and insurance premiums. 


The Government is well aware of the widespread nature of this problem. 


Almost every week someone writes to the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services to express their shock and disappointment at realising their hard-earned retirement nest egg has been eaten away. 


Or that the growth of their children's, partner's or other family member's balance has been stunted before it had truly had the chance to start.


The fact is, how well or how poorly your fund performs means absolutely nothing if your account balance is eroded to zero, or close to zero.


In a compulsory system, it simply isn't good enough.


And it's why the Government, through this Bill, is taking action to ensure people's hard‑earned savings are protected from fees, inappropriate insurance arrangements and the inefficiencies which result from holding multiple accounts. 


This Bill does so by amending the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act1993, the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act1999, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and the Taxation Administration Act 1953 to improve the superannuation regulatory system.


Firstly, the Bill will address the negative consequences of Labor's 2013 abolition of low balance protection as part of the MySuper changes. 


Low balance accounts are particularly vulnerable to erosion by fees and charges.


However, because of decisions made by the now Leader of the Opposition, there are no special protections in place to prevent low balance accounts from being eroded. 


Under the current rules for MySuper products, fees are generally required to be charged to all members on the same basis. 


Unfortunately, doing so can lead to significant erosion for low balance accounts, particularly where flat fees are imposed on small accounts receiving little or no contributions.


Schedule 1 to this Bill addresses this problem by preventing trustees of superannuation funds from charging administration and investment fees exceeding 3 per cent per annum of the balance of accounts below $6,000.


Based on the most recent data, it's estimated around 7 million Australians will save around $570 million in fees in just the first year, thanks to the Government's reforms. 


Schedule 1 also prevents trustees from charging exit fees on any superannuation product, no matter the member's balance. 


Currently, exit fees act as a disincentive for people to move money between funds when they wish to consolidate accounts. 


According to APRA data, approximately one-third of funds charged an exit fee in 2016-17, with all the fees collected across the industry totalling $52 million.


In combination, this Schedule will prevent erosion of low balance accounts by high passively-incurred fees, and will remove a disincentive to account consolidation or rollovers by members. 


Schedule 2 to this Bill will address the provision of insurance through superannuation. 


The Government recognises that insurance through superannuation is valuable for many Australians. Through the consultation process for this package, the government heard numerous examples of how people have benefitted from having insurance in times of need.


However, what is not always mentioned, and what people continue to write to the Government about, are those circumstances where a significant proportion of their retirement savings – quite often their entire account balance – is eroded by insurance premiums.


The now Leader of the Opposition's 2013 changes required trustees of default MySuper products to provide automatic life insurance, on an opt out basis. 


This has resulted in some members paying for cover they do not know they have, that goes beyond what they need, or which they cannot even claim on.


Insurance premiums can also reduce low income earners' retirement balances by 


10 per cent or more, compared to having no insurance, with the impact increasing with every additional set of policies held by an individual. 


Through this Bill, the Government will ensure that members who are at particular risk of account balance erosion will not have insurance provided on a default basis unless they have directed otherwise. 


The Government will put members first and give them the choice.


Specifically, Schedule 2 of the Bill will require that insurance be provided on an opt in basis only for:


members with balances below $6,000, 


accounts which have not received a contribution for 13 months or more, and 


new members from 1 July 2019 who are under the age of 25.


These changes will give around 5 million people the option to save up to an estimated $3 billion in premiums each year.


The Government of course recognises that many individuals already assess their insurance needs and make informed decisions to hold accounts with a certain level of insurance. 


To ensure this measure does not disadvantage those engaged members, the legislation allows for a member to elect to obtain or maintain existing insurance cover, and where they do so, they will not be affected by the changes in this Bill.


As a result of the deliberate decision to entrench superannuation within the industrial relations system in this country, when someone starts a new job, they are often directed – sometimes forced – to put their money into a different fund. 


For many Australians, this results in multiple accounts, multiple sets of fees and multiple insurance premiums.


The Minister for Revenue and Financial Services recently met with someone who had seven accounts. After he heard the news about how much it could cost him in retirement savings, he consolidated them. But he had already been charged seven sets of fees and insurance premiums for far too long, costing him goodness knows how much. 


This is by no means an isolated example. The ATO estimates that as at 30 June 2017, of the 14.8 million people who had a superannuation account, 40 per cent had more than one account. Amazingly, around 1.2 per cent or about 176,000 individuals held six or more accounts.


The Productivity Commission, in its ground-breaking draft report on the efficiency and competitiveness of the superannuation system, estimated that 1 in every 3 accounts were unintended duplicates. 


The Government knows that multiple accounts mean multiple fees and multiple sets of insurance premiums, ultimately leading to tens, sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars less at retirement. 


That is why, through Schedule 3 to this Bill, the ATO will, for the first time, be given the ability to proactively return the balances of inactive accounts, along with existing unclaimed superannuation monies, to their rightful owner. 


The ATO estimates that it will be able to reunify amounts within a month of receiving the funds. 


Under this Schedule, from 1 July 2019, funds will also be required to transfer all inactive accounts without insurance cover and with a balance below $6,000 to the ATO. 


Upon doing so, these accounts will be protected from fees and charges and the ATO can use data matching techniques to reunify the amounts with an active superannuation account.


As a result of these changes, in just the first year around 3 million members will be automatically reunited with around $6 billion.


Importantly, the changes in the Bill will not replace existing account consolidation processes, which will remain available to members. The changes will simply supplement the current arrangements and streamline consolidation for disengaged members, ensuring that Australian's superannuation savings are better protected.



Consistent with the Government's continued focus, the measures in this Bill are deliberately targeted at improving outcomes for members. 



Following their announcement, the Financial Services Council said it ""welcomes the Government's package of reforms to reduce the erosion of Australian's superannuation balances as well as promoting consolidation of super accounts as a positive policy step that will lead to better retirement outcomes.""



The Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees labelled the new ATO reunification powers ""welcome measures for the efficiency of the super system"".



While consumer advocates CHOICE have suggested the reforms ""will make a huge difference to the retirement savings of millions of Australians""


The Government would like to take the opportunity to thank all the stakeholders who engaged with the consultation process. 


The Government appreciate from the industry's perspective this will involve some substantial changes. 


However, the Government firmly believes that this Bill, which will benefit young members, members with low balances such as low income earners, and members with multiple accounts, is in the best interest of all Australians. 


After all, we must never forget the most important foundation stone in superannuation – your superannuation is your money.

 (Western Australia—Deputy President and Chair of Committees) (15:47):  by leave—I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the Republic of Korea and Japan, which took place from 11 to 21 April 2018. I seek leave to move a motion to take note of the document.


Leave granted.




Senator LINES:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


I report that I led the Korean part of the delegation. An important part is that all five members who were on the Korean part of the delegation were women. As the parliaments of both Korea and Japan are dominated by male politicians, the fact that we were an all-female delegation in Korea was a point of discussion. I think it gave encouragement to the women MPs who we visited and spoke to about how to improve the election of women into their parliaments, and, indeed, into ministerial positions.


The parliamentary delegation to the Republic of Korea formed part of the official 2018 bilateral parliamentary visits. The delegation to Japan was by invitation from the presiding officers of the Japanese Diet, and the Speaker, Mr Tony Smith, led that part of the delegation. I would like to thank our embassy staff and officials in Korea, who made our visit so enjoyable and really important. We met with a lot of Australians doing business in Korea, we heard from the Korean members of parliament how important and how valued their relationship with Australia is, and we visited the demilitarised zone, which was really important in the lead-up to the most recent talks with the leader of North Korea.


We also visited a number of private companies, and we saw a lot of Australian produce—sadly, mostly from Victoria—on supermarket shelves in Korea. They are very keen to do business with Australia, and I know that our agencies are working hard on this. They did, however, mention that we could do a better job of selling beef to Korea, and I raised that with Meat & Livestock Australia during estimates. That was commented on quite a number of times when we met with both Australian private employers and Korean officials. Whilst our meat is imported into Korea, there was a view that we could do better than we're doing. I commend the report to the parliament.


Question agreed to.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:51):  I present the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Northern Australia on opportunities and methods for stimulating tourism in northern Australia, together with minutes of the proceedings, and I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


The Joint Standing Committee on Northern Australia conducted a very wide-ranging and extensive inquiry into tourism in northern Australia. The committee made a number of recommendations, some 33 in all, about how tourism in northern Australia could be enhanced and made more accessible, and, importantly, how some of the fabulous tourist destinations in the north—some not quite so well known—could be better promoted around Australia and, indeed, around the world. I particularly note Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, two of Australia's external territories. It's a bit expensive to get there, but, if tourists can get there, it is a wonderful experience. There is some unique scenery. There are some unique ecosystems. There are some unique features across the board.


The committee met in many places around Australia, and was, again, so impressed by the wealth of experiences and natural beauty we have in this country. I particularly mention—and there are a number of recommendations about it—the Great Barrier Reef, which I think is Australia's finest tourist destination. Whilst you have the Greens political party and some others trying to denigrate the reef, telling the world—lyingly, I might say—that the reef is dead, the committee, and anyone who goes to the Barrier Reef, understands that it is one of the most magnificent natural assets in the world. Like any asset, it requires management, and it is being well-managed by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and by the scientists at the Australian Institute of Marine Science and elsewhere. It is a magnificent experience to dive on it, to see it, to appreciate it, to be part of it. It is just a fantastic experience. The committee, and everyone who lives up that way, are very well aware of its beauty and the ability of the reef to regenerate, to look after itself and to provide a wonderful destination for tourists from around Australia and, indeed, around the world.


The 33 recommendations of the committee are there to be read in this report. There is a lot of information in the report about the subjects of the recommendations and why the committee came to the recommendations that it did. There are wonderful experiences and real opportunity for what I'd loosely call 'Indigenous tourism'. There are Indigenous tourism champions, and the committee made some recommendations about that. Indigenous activities, Indigenous experiences, and their art—their cultures broadly—are increasingly of interest, particularly to overseas tourists.


The report makes recommendations about funding tourism demand programs, continuing on selected airport upgrades, which are very, very important, and continuing on selected seaport upgrades, which are a real issue that needs to be addressed, with cabotage, particularly in the Indian Ocean territories. The committee widely looked at other things, like incentives to use some tourist sites in northern Australia as the backgrounds for film and TV programs. There's a call for the City Deals program to be extended to other cities in the north. When I say 'other', that is in addition to Townsville, which was the first place where the Commonwealth government's City Deals program was initiated. The recommendations call for that to be extended into Cairns and Darwin, to name two.


The committee looked at the good work that Parks Australia does and that of their state and territory counterparts. The committee recommended that those parks bodies establish an agreed and consistent regulatory approach to the consideration of investment in national parks, including public-private partnerships. Very often, our national parks are magnificent but need a little bit of sensitive infrastructure. Very often, the relevant parks authorities don't have the money to do that. There are real opportunities for public-private partnerships so that all Australians—indeed, tourists everywhere—can get in and experience the wonderful scenery in some of our national parks.


Across the board, this is a very thorough study into tourism in the north of Australia, an area that isn't front of mind when you talk about tourism—apart, that is, from the Barrier Reef. There are so many unique and wonderful experiences that tourists can have in northern Australia. This report mentions most of them and makes recommendations for how those experiences can have access to them improved and, in cases, how we can better publicise some of these wonderful experiences that are available. I commend the report to the Senate.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AG,2018-06-28,"



Senator BARTLETT
 (Queensland) (15:59):  I'd also like to commend this report to the Senate and to the parliament—indeed, to the community. I had, in one way, the fortune of being able to participate in this. It was certainly fortunate, and a good experience for me, to be able to participate in this committee on this inquiry. My misfortune is that my participation was so brief. That's just the way things are. But even my brief experience with it—plugging into my own experience, of course, particularly with Queensland but in other parts of Northern Australia as well—gave me the opportunity to learn more and to highlight once again just how important tourism is to the Queensland economy, to Northern Australia and to Australia more broadly.


When we hear about opening up economic opportunities in Northern Australia it's almost always in terms of talking about new mines or new dams. Yet the fact is that the tourism industry is a far bigger employer than the mining sector—certainly more than the fossil-fuel or coalmining sector is in Queensland. As we all know, so many of those jobs are at risk if the natural environment that so much of tourism depends upon is harmed because of runaway climate change exacerbated by digging up and burning more fossil fuels.


Ironically, to some extent I agree with Senator Macdonald in his comment that the Great Barrier Reef is a magnificent natural asset and perhaps the greatest tourist destination in the country. As is fairly typical with Senator Macdonald, even when you get a committee inquiry that works to get consensus and gets a unanimous report, when talking about it he still manages to find a way to drop his usual bag of acid and falsehoods over various people. So it was no surprise that the 'Greens political party'—yes, indeed, we are a political party—copped it again, with his false claim that the Greens and others in the environment movement are saying that the reef is dead.


We are not saying the reef is dead. Like any marine scientist with any credibility—all the thousands of them—we say the marine park is in big trouble. The previous speaker was from the coalition, a person who is based in Northern Queensland, and tens and tens of thousands of jobs there depend on that magnificent asset and the fact that it is a magnificent tourist destination. That marine park is in trouble. One of the key reasons—as was made clear, in fact, by representatives of the government and the department at estimates hearings and elsewhere—and the biggest threat to the marine park is climate change. Until Senator Macdonald and so many of his fellow colleagues accept that, they can say all the nice-sounding things they like about the marine park and they can make all the lies they like about those of us who want to call out how much trouble it is in. But the fact is that it is they who are putting those jobs at risk and they who are hindering tourism opportunities as a consequence. This is not just in the marine park. The Wet Tropics in Far North Queensland, for example, has incredible natural value and in may ways finds it much more difficult, with even less opportunity, to adapt to more rapid climate change than might otherwise occur.


I will go to other significant parts of the report that I would like to highlight specifically. Because I was only part of this inquiry for such a brief period of time I don't feel it's appropriate for me to be passing comment on or suggesting changes to sections of the report to do with the Indian Ocean territories—for example, the Cocos Islands or Christmas Island. I wasn't able to be part of that visit, although I have been to Christmas Island a couple of times in the past. Apart from areas in Queensland, I would genuinely say that it is the most magnificent natural environment I've ever seen. There are the marine and forest environments. We all know about the red crabs, but there are other crabs too. And the bird life there is magnificent.


Obviously, there are economic challenges for that community, particularly with the necessary phasing out of phosphate and the closing down of the detention centre, which should never have been built in the first place. It faces economic challenges, and tourism is its biggest opportunity. The biggest challenge there, of course, is the cost of getting there. That was a common thread in this inquiry and the committee's previous inquiry called 'Pivot North'—the cost of airfares to so many parts of regional Australia and Northern Australia. I know there is a separate inquiry into that as well. It doesn't go into the detail on that but it does reinforce the challenges that it presents and the need to develop not just airport infrastructure—although that is necessary and recommendations contained in this report are about upgrades to airport facilities; in Queensland we are talking about areas like Rockhampton, Townsville and Cooktown—but also flight routes.


That means looking at ways to ensure that they are affordable. One of the challenges that was identified by one of the witnesses is that, in some of those areas, those routes are taken up by the resources sector, so leisure travellers have to pay high fares because the seats are so rare because the resources sector chew up so many of them. That's not the resources sector's fault, but it's a challenge that needs to be addressed. I would like to especially emphasise recommendation 16, requesting the Australian government to address:


… the impact of high insurance costs on tourism investment in Northern Australia (particularly since the privatisation of the Territory Insurance Office)—


That is another example where, because of the privatisation of a basic financial service, such as has happened in the banking sector and other parts of the financial sector, people in Northern Queensland and other parts of northern Australia, not just those in the tourism industry but many others, are facing ridiculously high insurance premiums because of market failure. Recommendation 16 further states:


that insurance be made available for homes and businesses in the Indian Ocean Territories to stimulate business investment.


The chair of this inquiry, Mr Entsch, to his credit, has gone on about this issue for many, many years, as have others. I've mentioned it in this place myself once or twice. Action has still not happened, and it is really hurting people in Northern Queensland and small businesses in particular. 


There is a recommendation to ensure that the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility applies to the Indian Ocean territories. That's something that could be done very quickly. The government has acted to ensure that the infrastructure facility—which we normally talk about in terms of again being used to open up massive infrastructure projects like mines, which will cause other economic, social and environmental damage in the region—needs to apply to the tourism sector, which mostly involves smaller businesses. It's pleasing that the rules around that facility have been changed somewhat to at least, in theory, enable it to be applied to smaller businesses, and I hope that is followed through on and able to be used. 


Recommendation 20, not just for tourism but critical for tourism and small business, is in regard to mobile and data services. There has been a debacle around the NBN and telecommunications. If it had been done properly it would have been one of the best ways to break down the inequality between opportunities for business, small businesses in particular, in regional, rural and remote areas compared with those in the big cities. But it has not been done properly. So recommendation 20 suggests improving mobile and data services across northern Australia, particularly those areas that have a high reliance on tourism. 


On basic infrastructure, instead of the same old 19th and 20th century idea of more dams and mines, what about infrastructure for facilities that people will use as part of their experiences in those communities and visiting those communities? That's often lots of small-scale infrastructure. Governments of all persuasions love announcing big projects with a big ribbon they can cut and a big plaque on which they can say 'opened by'. They're not so keen on, for example, small toilet facilities—they'd probably still put a plaque there with their name on it anyway, while ever they get the chance. But often it's those bits of small-scale infrastructure in all sorts of small ways that will make a region with lot of small, different destination opportunities one that will suddenly become much more viable economically, giving people the opportunity to enjoy what is mostly, although not only, natural environment based tourism. I make that point because it does come back to what has been a key message of the Greens, probably from the party's inception, about how much economic value there is in making sure we look after nature properly and interact with it properly. This report reinforces it. 


The other thing I'd say in the brief time I have left is that there are opportunities that we still clearly have not enabled with tourism related to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The report recommends:


… Tourism Australia work with Indigenous Business Australia to re-establish the Indigenous Tourism Champions Program.


Further, it recommends that the bodies set up to enable the development of northern Australia specifically be funded for the tourism aspect of that and that they be linked particularly to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people because they provide a unique experience that is available nowhere else— (Time expired)

I'll just use a hypothetical organisation that is based in Australia and travels overseas with the express intention of trying to persuade overseas markets not to purchase products produced in Australia. My understanding, or my recollection, is that, when I put that to you before question time, you said that that organisation would not be caught by this legislation.

 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (16:32):  If I can just go back for a second, in terms of earlier: I've sought to answer all of your questions, and I'll continue to seek to answer your questions. But where I am not answering is where I've answered a question several times. In the case of Senator Rhiannon, I think there was a question that had been asked and answered a number of times. I'm here to give as much information as I can, but I don't think it's helpful to go and ask the same question again. I'll just put that on the record. In relation to this one: there's nothing that you've put forward there that would, in any way, engage the sabotage offences. I can't see any link that would possibly see an organisation that was based in Australia and that campaigned for the boycott of certain Australian products, in any way, engage the sabotage offences—or any others that I can see, but the sabotage is the one you mentioned. 


A sabotage offence is: a person engages in conduct that damages public infrastructure—and that's defined—and intends that, or is reckless as to whether, their conduct will prejudice Australia's national security or advantage the national security of a foreign country. As I said, public infrastructure is defined as certain facilities—Commonwealth facilities, defence premises, telecommunication networks, et cetera. They'd have to be damaging that public infrastructure and they would have to intend to or be reckless as to whether in damaging that public infrastructure their conduct would prejudice Australia's national security. Nothing you've set out there, on the advice I have or on my reading of the legislation, would in any way go anywhere near being an offence under that particular provision or any other provision that I'm aware of.

I want to take your attention to section 82.6, offence of sabotage reckless as to national security. That's a reasonably easy provision to read and understand. I'll step you through this. I'm going back to the hypothetical situation where a person is blockading a port that's being used for the purposes of live sheep export. The first requirement, 82.6(1)(a), is that the person engages in conduct—and, clearly, blockading a port is conduct. Then we go to 82.6(1)(b):


(b) the conduct results in damage to public infrastructure …


First, can you confirm that damage to public infrastructure, as defined, includes preventing access? Second, can you confirm that public infrastructure can include privately owned infrastructure that is being used to deliver a service? Third, can you confirm that even a privately owned loading facility would be caught within the definition of public infrastructure?

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (16:36):  In relation to the first part, as you'd be aware, 82.1(d) defines damage to public infrastructure:


(d) the conduct limits or prevents access to it or any part of it by persons who are ordinarily entitled to access it or that part of it;


I think the answer to that would be yes. In relation to the second part of your question, it is in 82.2, public infrastructure; 82.2(e) reads:




(e) any infrastructure, facility, premises, network or electronic system 
…
 that:





(i) provides or relates to providing the public with utilities
 or services … 
of any kind; and





(ii) is located in Australia; and





(iii) belongs to or is operated by a constitutional corporation or is used to facilitate constitutional trade and commerce.



Obviously, it would depend on a number of circumstances as to whether it fit that definition.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (16:38):  Thanks, Minister. For the purposes of the question I'm about to ask, can we assume that the tests under 82.6(1)(a) and (b) have been met—that is, the person has been engaged in conduct that is a blockade and the conduct has resulted in damage to public infrastructure? Firstly, damage includes limiting access to, as I think you've just outlined. Secondly, public infrastructure can include private infrastructure, as long as it provides or relates to providing the public with utilities or services, including the transport of people or goods of any kind; it is located in Australia; and it belongs to or is operated by a constitutional corporation.


We assume that those criteria are met and then we go to 82.6(1)(c). This is a blockade which is done for the purpose of raising the political issue of animal cruelty, but which has a corollary impact of impacting on Australia's economic relationship with another country—by virtue of the fact that it, for example, delays or halts indefinitely the departure of that vessel.


So my question, Minister, is whether that blockade, in the hypothetical situation that I've outlined, could result in the commission of an offence under this legislation because that blockade, firstly, prejudices national security because of the way 'national security' is defined to include economic relationships between Australia and another country. I just don't see how that action could not be caught under 82.6(1).

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (16:40):  Thank you; I accept that you've asked the question in a slightly different way. I'll do my best to answer it, but I am going over a little bit of old ground. The answer to the question is that, in order for an offence to apply and for a potential charge or prosecution to occur under this particular provision, there would have to be actions by the person to damage the public infrastructure. With the public infrastructure that I've set out in terms of the definition, it's difficult to know in what circumstances. It's possible that it could be public infrastructure, but that is clearly defined and it may or may not be public infrastructure. But, if all of those were there, you would need the damage to the infrastructure and then, if in fact it is public infrastructure, there would have to be either an intent or recklessness to whether the conduct would prejudice Australia's national security or advance the national security of a foreign country—and, in addition to that, the conduct wouldn't be reasonable in the circumstances.


The government has certainly made it clear that ordinary protests such as picketing an MP's office or a building and the like are not designed to come under the scope of these directions. In terms of the 'reasonableness', the point I would make is that there are a lot of tests that would have to be met. There has to be the damage, it has to be public infrastructure within those definitions, there has to be an intent or recklessness to do damage to Australia's national security and, in addition to that, it wouldn't be reasonable in all of those circumstances for the actions to be taken.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (16:42):  Thanks, Minister. Once again, I thank you for your response. You've stepped us through that, and your response, I think, is helpful for the Senate's understanding, because you've placed clearly on the record the government's intention behind this legislation.


I will offer, I guess, a comment, if I may. Even though you've done that, and placed the intent on the record, I think an ordinary-English-language reading of this provision does provide for charges to be laid against a person or a group of people in the circumstances that I've outlined. As to how the courts might rule on that, obviously we'd have to wait and see. Again, obviously, it would pivot on the individual circumstances of the case, of course, as cases like this always do in our judicial system. So, even though you've placed the government's intent on the record, I'm not convinced that the way this section is drafted actually does reflect that intent, and I maintain my view that this section, as drafted, at least potentially could catch actions such as the one that I've outlined.

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (16:43):  I want to move on to some questions about section 91.1. This is the section about espionage and dealing with information concerning national security—how it's communicated et cetera. Firstly, I want to understand some of the definitions that are dealt with here in terms of what the reach of them is. The word 'deals' is used—we're talking about 'deals with information'. It's defined in section 90.1(1) to include if a person:


(a) receives or obtains it;


(b) collects it; 


…   …   …


(h) communicates it;


(i) publishes it;


(j) makes it available.


Minister, isn't this what journalists do? I'm just checking, therefore—because I have further questions—that this is the section under which people who are communicating, like journalists, could be captured.

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (16:45):  If I understand your question correctly, you're asking whether or not 'dealing with information' potentially attracts these particular provisions. If that's your question, the answer is yes. But looking at one section in isolation doesn't in any way go to whether there's a potential offence. As with the other provisions we've discussed, such as sabotage, in each case there are a series of things that need to be made out. If I understand your question correctly, and you want to lay it as a baseline for further questions, then I think the answer is yes.

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (16:46):  Then, to put with that—'national security' is defined in section 90.4(1)(e) to include:


… the country's political, military or economic negotiations with another country or other countries.


Again, an investigative journalist's work explores so many issues. We have a great many of them at the moment, with the issues around the relationship with China, with our whole region, with how DFAT works, et cetera. Going back to the definition I gave, in terms of 'obtain, collect, communicate, publish'—and maybe there are other sections where there are more boundaries on this—the way it's structured, with the definition of 'dealing with information' and the definition of 'national security', the conclusion that I came to from reading this material is that it could have a very broad reach, in terms of people who are analysing relations between Australia and other countries, considering the definition of 'national security'. What I'm really asking you to do is bring the definition of 'national security' in and explain how it will be interpreted in assessing this information about 'dealing with information'.

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (16:48):  I'll try and step through this a little bit as to what the elements of this offence would be. Obviously journalists, like others, if they were to engage every element of the espionage offence, would potentially be liable. But there is a high bar. One of the reasons it's designed the way it is is that, of course, when we are dealing with espionage and when we are dealing with foreign agents, it's not easy to absolutely define every type of activity in a piece of legislation. If we go through the elements that would be needed—and that might help, and then no doubt there'll be further questions—the espionage offences in the case of a journalist—if we take that as an example, although it's certainly not aimed at journalists—would apply only where that person intends to or is reckless as to whether their conduct will prejudice Australia's national security or advantage national security of a foreign country. With espionage, there also in this case must be a link to a foreign principal, which does not include foreign businesses or individuals. If a journalist engaged in the relevant conduct and these circumstances existed then of course there'd be the potential for the espionage offences to apply. But it wouldn't capture a journalist engaged in the ordinary practice of their profession, where their intent is to report on matters of public interest. So it absolutely goes to, yes, links to foreign principals, and damage, through intent or recklessness, to national security, but not to someone who was acting in good faith, in order to bring issues of national interest into the public domain—unless they were deliberate or reckless as to doing national security damage to Australia—and then it wouldn't, in that circumstance, apply.


But I would just make this broader point. I made the point earlier that, when it comes to secrecy offences, there are specific defences in relation to journalists, but when we are talking about espionage, we are talking about a very serious offence, a very high bar, and the idea of potentially completely carving journalists out of that actually presents some serious national security challenges. I think it was the Director-General who made some comments—I'll check my notes in a minute—that, if you did have a complete carve-out for journalists, that would potentially be very, very dangerous and would actually put journalists at risk of some of those attempts at foreign interference. So, in relation to these specific offences, whilst there is not a specific carve-out that exempts journalists or gives them a specific defence, the bar is very high one, and, in those circumstances, someone simply reporting in the public interest and getting things to light would not be engaging that, unless all of those other elements that I've pointed to were in existence and were able to be proved.

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (16:51):  Thank you, Minister. I will ask about an example shortly, just to try and understand this further, but first I will just pick up on some of your remarks. You spoke a number of times about the 'public interest'. It's an interesting term. It's an important term. But, when you think about it, so often—and maybe more so when a politician uses it—it's equated with what the government's interests are. To highlight what I mean by that, I will use some examples from history.


There was a period when Australia actually supported apartheid. Australian government figures supported apartheid in South Africa and supported the Vietnam War. Now, in time, we—all politicians of all persuasions—came to realise that those were very wrong aspects of our foreign policy. First I will make a comment, and then I'll ask a question. I think this will give context to the question. Let's think about reporting when there were dominant forces in the Australian government who were sympathetic to and supportive, in various ways, of the apartheid regime in South Africa, and, as we know, actually were directly involved in the Vietnam War. Say this bill had been in legislation at that time, and there had been reporting of criticisms—for instance, of the My Lai massacre. At the time when it was first reported, it was as just part of the war effort, with Australia supposedly doing the right thing by stopping the invasion of communist hordes coming down to invade this country, so we had to send troops there. In time, we came to find out about the My Lai massacre—and I'm not suggesting Australians were involved in that, but it's one of the standout examples. It was deeply shocking, with children, women and elderly men killed, and many rapes, and the village burnt. But the initial reporting on it was that it was part of the war effort. It was courageous journalists who pushed through, and some courageous soldiers who gave the story. But considering we were supporting that war effort, if this legislation had been in place wouldn't it have been necessary to prosecute reporters who were writing to expose what actually happened there and who weren't directly supporting the government interest, which so often is interpreted as the public interest, considering at that time the government was presenting the public interest as stopping communist hordes coming down from Vietnam, China and elsewhere into this country and that our soldiers had to be sent there? So if this espionage legislation was in place at the time, journalists who were writing about what actually happened could have been charged for receiving and obtaining, collecting, communicating, publishing or making information available that was contrary to the government interest and public interest of the time?

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (16:55):  I have a couple of points. One is that the espionage provisions have existed in one form or another in legislation for a long time. They exist now in, I think, areas such as the Criminal Code. I couldn't say exactly how long, but there hasn't been a spate of prosecutions of journalists for that type of activity. I just make the point that in the espionage provisions we're not necessarily talking of dramatic changes to what we've had. We've always had these types of provisions and, again, it fundamentally goes to the intent. The point you were making, Senator Rhiannon, about if it was a popular view versus an unpopular view is simply irrelevant to whether a potential offence would exist.


The provision that you have highlighted has a significant number of elements that would all have to be satisfied in order for a potential prosecution: a person deals with information or an article; the information or article has a security classification or concerns Australia's national security; the person intends that the person's conduct will prejudice Australia's national security or advantage national security of a foreign country; and the conduct results or will result in the information or article being communicated or made available to a foreign principal or a person acting on their behalf. They are the elements and, as I say, we have had these kinds of provisions for a long time. It's important that we do. Notwithstanding that, we haven't seen journalists who have engaged in their profession with anything other than an intent to damage national security being prosecuted for that.


Just going back to my earlier comment, which is related to this, it's a matter of public record, both from the Director-General of Security and from journalists reporting in Australian and overseas media, that foreign intelligence services have recruited and continue to recruit journalists to engage in espionage and related activities in Australia. This is a matter the Director-General spoke to in some detail in public evidence. The Director-General of Security said that a blanket exemption for journalists could 'effectively leave a door wide open for foreign spies to exploit, and may have the unintended consequence of increasing the intelligence threat that's faced by our journalists'. As I say, in some areas we have a specific defence when it comes to journalists; the espionage offences have a series of elements that would need to be made out. An offence would go to each of those elements particularly, and, most importantly, the intent to prejudice Australia's national security.

Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (16:58):  Minister, further to Senator Rhiannon's question, and following on from your answer, you said that, in order to make out the offence, the documents might involve a security classification. There are many, many different classifications that are used—such as 'cabinet in confidence', which is not necessarily a security classification; it's a protective marking but not a security classification per se. It could be about the Murray-Darling or some health initiative or something like that. There are other classifications such as 'restricted' and 'for official use only'. What's the bar? The normal classifications, military wise, are 'confidential', 'secret' and 'top secret'. They're kind of the normal military classifications. What's the bar?

 (South Australia) (17:01):  Sure, and I apologise for not articulating it properly. It is perhaps a complex or nuanced issue. I'll give you a real example. Former senator Nick Xenophon is currently in the AAT seeking access to documents which are marked 'for official use only'. The claim advanced by the respondent in that particular application—and it is not going to the substance of the matter; I really want to direct it back to the bill—is that 'this document is damaging to national security or would cause damage to national security if it were to be released under FOI'. This bill appears to now be creating an inconsistency across Commonwealth legislation in respect of how you define what is damaging to national security. Is the marking of 'secret' and/or 'top secret' the only thing that's covered under this legislation? No-one's going to seek to use a similar definition to FOI? I'm just trying to get some clarity on that.

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (17:03):  We're probably talking about two slightly separate things. In relation to secret and top secret, that goes to one of the elements that would potentially need to be proved to deal with this particular provision in section 91.1, espionage. Obviously we're dealing with the most serious of offences here. There has to be all of the elements. So the person would deal with information or an article. That's just a starting point. Then the information or article would have either a security classification—secret or top secret; that's defined—or concerns about Australia's national security. In addition to that, the person would have to intend that the person's conduct would prejudice Australia's national security or advantage the national security of a foreign country and then, as I said earlier, the conduct results or will result in that information going to a foreign principal or someone acting on their behalf. So the security classification is dealing with high level, secret and top secret. There is the national security element, but it would have to step through and get each of (a), (b), (c) and (d) of that provision in order for someone to potentially have contravened this piece of legislation or this part of the act.

You made the point, which is very apt, that espionage measures have existed in the law of this land for a long time—which is actually very relevant to the fact that we have this new legislation before us. Why was it judged that new legislation on espionage was needed, considering you've said it's already in the law? In answering that question, could you also advise what the threats were that you judged required that this new law was needed?

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (17:06):  The new espionage offences criminalise a broad range of dealings with information, including possessing or receiving, and protect a broader range of information, including unclassified material. The offences introduce tier defences covering intentional and reckless conduct with commensurate tiered penalties. The new offences will target not only the person who discloses the information but also the actions of the foreign spy who receives the information. The new offences will also criminalise soliciting or procuring a person to engage in espionage and will introduce a new preparation or planning offence. These offences will allow law enforcement agencies to intervene at an earlier stage to prevent the harmful conduct occurring. That is where we are effectively improving the laws.


On the point I made earlier in terms of the type of scenario you were talking about, we have always had, in one form or another, these kinds of secrecy and espionage provisions, and for good reason: because there are always foreign actors or, indeed, Australians acting against the national interest who, in some cases, have engaged in this type of activity, which we need strong laws to prevent. That gives you a summary of what we're seeking to improve through these new pieces of legislation.

The government itself effectively acknowledged that by the fact that it recognised that it had to seriously amend the bill and there were 280 amendments, I understand. So my question was not about the actual provisions and the description of the new aspects of the espionage legislation that will play out if this goes through; my question was: what are the actual threats that warranted coming forward with this legislation?

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (17:08):  Certainly the advice to government is that the threats of foreign interference and espionage are increasing and that, if unchecked, these threats can erode our sovereignty and diminish public confidence in the integrity of our political and government institutions. The judgement has been made by the government that existing laws are inadequate to deter and counter the pervasive foreign interference activities directed against Australia and that the current legislative and policy frameworks have created a permissive operating environment for foreign adversaries.


Espionage and foreign interference by nation states is a reality and can cause enormous harm to our national sovereignty and to the integrity of Australia's democracy. The Director-General of ASIO has advised that foreign intelligence activity against Australia is occurring on an unprecedented scale. Foreign interference can erode our sovereignty by diminishing public confidence in the integrity of our political and government institutions and undermining our societal values. So the advice is that these threats are growing, that the nature of them is obviously ever-changing and that having laws that simply stay still in response to these threats is no longer good enough. That's the very strong advice to government and that's a big reason we have this legislation before the Senate today.

I want to put to you a specific type of scenario, which I'm aware actually occurs in Australia. Say an Australian company had caused environmental damage in another country and that had affected not only the environment but people's capacity to earn their living as they used to. There's no recompense for those people, and they're seeking recompense. They're working with Australian not-for-profit organisations. The organisations in the other country are working with their own government, and the Australian organisations are working with those environmental organisations with, in fact, a foreign government, to either seek recompense from the Australian government or encourage the Australian government to take action. I'm aware that this happens. Will they get caught up in this legislation? The way I read the definition of 'foreign government principals', it would involve interaction with a foreign government. There is the potential that political or economic relations with that country may be damaged as a result of the activism. How would this scenario be handled when people from Australia are talking to foreign governments about specific remedies for this particular situation?

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (17:12):  I'm talking about the definition of 'foreign government principal', and I'm then looking at the definition of 'national security'. For example, the activists in Australia may be talking to the NGOs in the other country about how our system operates so that they know who to talk to, but it might be more than that. It may also be about activism, about how to draw attention to the issue if they're not getting the government's attention. It could also involve taking legal action and how you use the system that way.

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (17:13):  There's nothing you pointed to that in any way would, under any scenario, constitute illegal conduct. You've pointed to some of the definitions—foreign principals and the like—but it's about what then happens on behalf of, for instance, a foreign principal. Are you sabotaging things? Are you undermining Australia's national security with intent or recklessness? I'm not seeing any actions that you've pointed to that could in any way, shape or form be covered by this legislation. There would have to be some clear and specific action that's covered under one of the offence provisions that would engage the legislation, but there's nothing you pointed to there that would.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (17:14):  I'm looking, in particular the recklessness angle. I'm looking at definition (e)—




Senator Seselja:
  Under what provision?




Senator SIEWERT:
  In terms of national security, and looking at section 90.4 at (1)(e), it says:


The national security of Australia or a foreign country means any of the following:


…   …   …


(e) the country’s political, military or economic relations with another country or other countries.


I could foresee a scenario in which you're working with the organisation that's working with the foreign country and that then does impact on the relationship between that country and Australia—for example, in terms of the political relationship. The foreign country may, in fact, decide they're not going to engage with Australia in military exercises, for example, or it could affect the economic relationship—they may decide that in order to achieve the objective. That's what I'm looking at. There may be an intent to do that. To achieve the objective, the campaign could be that they want to influence that. They want to get Australia to be paying attention, and the way they do that is by making Australia feel the pain. Or it may be, in fact, reckless. I'm not saying they would be reckless doing that, but the government could see it as reckless to do that, because what's articulated under (e) happens.

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (17:16):  I think there's still just a little bit of confusion with the definitions, which you've rightly pointed to, that help with interpreting the offence provisions. The offence provisions have a number of elements. Let's take sabotage. You've rightly pointed out that national security is defined, but there has to be conduct, and with sabotage, the conduct is specific. It's specifically conduct that results in damage to public infrastructure, which is defined, again, separately, and then there's an intent or recklessness about it. It also prejudices Australia's national security and, indeed, in some cases, depending on the offence, it might be conduct engaged in on behalf of or collaborating with a foreign principal. We've covered this in some detail. Those offences each have to have all of their elements made out. The definitions you're pointing to don't constitute anything in terms of an office. All you've pointed to there is that there is a foreign principal and there is some sort of collaboration or activity with that foreign principal, but there's no offence that I can see. Certainly you have to look at each of the offences, and they're the ones that carry the penalties. The offences have to have a number of those elements made out and there's nothing you've described to me that would attract any of those offences that I can see, but if you've got more specificity I'm happy to try and answer those questions.

Please excuse me: I haven't managed to look at all the amendments, because of the time frames involved here, so forgive me if I ask a question that seems a little bit odd. This is just working with the principle that whenever you increase the power of somebody, and particularly a secret organisation, you want to make sure you've got the right checks and balances in place. I have had a briefing on this from the intelligence services, just talking about the bill generally. They suggested that there are no real, new powers for the intelligence agencies in relation to this bill—that they don't gain any additional powers. Can you confirm that for me, please?

Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (17:19):  I presume that it does, however, deal with the scope. If you're changing the way you view an offence—perhaps expanding its boundaries slightly or changing those boundaries—then the way in which the intelligence services may respond to that would change. That may involve the exercise of an existing power to deal with a new area of potential offence. Is it fair to say that?

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (17:20):  Because we're setting up a series of new offences, in many ways, instead of giving more power to the intelligence agencies, it would push things into the criminal realm—to the Australian Federal Police to investigate potential crimes that may have been committed under this legislation if it's passed, and, obviously, to the courts, who would need to determine whether an offence has been committed. If we were to look from the perspective of law enforcement generally, police powers are one thing—the ability to detain people, the ability to restrain people, the ability to use force—and that sits in one box. The actual criminal offences of the criminals they're seeking to apprehend and deter sit separately. In that context, this is about the criminal law as it applies to certain types of offences. It doesn't give the intelligence agencies any more or different powers, but obviously it is designed to make sure that, where there are potential offences and attempts to undermine our national security, there are proper penalties for that.

Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (17:22):  In some sense you talk about the AFP now having perhaps more operations as a result of this—the ability to examine the conduct of somebody and lay a charge. I might point out that the AFP generally doesn't sit inside the six organisations that would traditionally be considered the Australian intelligence community. But we know, from other legislation, that we are in fact trying to integrate, I think, 10 agencies under the same top-level coordination through the Prime Minister's office. We could have a circumstance where, in dealing with some of these new areas, we might have the AFP looking at matters in-country but perhaps being supported by ASIO—or indeed, ASIS outside the country—to verify some communications or something that's happening overseas. Is it fair to say that the execution of the enforcement of this bill would potentially involve all of the intelligence services all working together or at least a number of them working together?

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (17:23):  Obviously, Senator Patrick, the intelligence agencies work with other agencies. Of course the AFP works with other agencies; they work with prosecutors and the like to enforce the law. This provides different offences—stronger offences in many cases—for certain activities. That obviously makes it more likely that certain types of activity are captured under our criminal law. Therefore the AFP can investigate that, potentially lay charges and pass it over to relevant prosecutors. In relation to your earlier question about oversight, even though this doesn't actually give any additional powers to our intelligence agencies, there is additional financial support for oversight. So the government provided $52.1 million in the budget to augment the Office of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. Obviously, that is something we take very seriously. So, whilst this doesn't give additional powers as such to our intelligence agencies, we do take that oversight very seriously in the context of this type of legislation.

"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-06-28,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (17:24):  Yes. I will perhaps discuss oversight in that regard. I'm really just trying to understand where we would sit right now if the bill were to pass unamended—the reason I'm asking those questions now. I just want to talk you through a real situation and the idea that, as a result of the passage of this bill, we may end up with a situation where we have various different intelligence agencies operating, perhaps in new areas, carrying out different sorts of operations, using the same powers that I accept you've advised me of. I'll just talk through the situation. In fact, I'll use the matter raised by Senator McKim earlier today. I know he was talking about a matter that's before the courts; I will avoid the matter that is before the court. Here is a little bit of background on that matter from listening to Senator McKim. Back in 2004, the Howard government sought to bug the East Timor cabinet buildings in order to gain advantage during a negotiation in respect of the maritime boundary between East Timor and Australia. Of course, all these sorts of negotiations are conducted in good faith—that's the normal regime when doing so—and if you fail to do so you perhaps may, in some sense, be committing a fraud.


In that instance we had a particular agent who raised a concern with the IGIS. I note that you've suggested that there is greater funding for the IGIS in respect of the many changes that are going through the parliament now in relation to national security and intelligence and indeed for this bill. He raised a concern. The IGIS actually took the matter, received the agent—who we know as Witness K—and took his concerns, and passed them or authorised some independent legal action. So we now had a situation where we had counsel and we had an agent authorised by the IGIS to explore a matter that eventually led to a situation where Australia was actually taken to The Hague. Some quite extraordinary orders ended up getting made against Australia. You'll recall that there was a raid on the Attorney's office at that time. A whole range of documents were taken, and in fact the tribunal in The Hague ordered that those documents be returned. There was also an order that was placed restricting Australia's electronic surveillance of the ongoing negotiations.


Unfortunately for Witness K, there was a fallout there, in that he was then denied a passport application; and the person who denied that application was the Director-General of ASIS. The director-general—who it's not unlawful to name, who was then Nick Warner—acted as what is referred to as a competent authority to cancel someone's passport. So now someone's liberties had been constrained. And there's an irony there because it turned out that Mr Nick Warner was actually involved in the original bugging operation, so there was an issue of bias involved in terms of that decision. That matter is before the AAT, and unfortunately that's been stayed now as a result of criminal proceedings being implemented.


But there's an example where we have an intelligence officer who sticks up his hand and says, 'I think something's going wrong,' and goes to the right authority—the IGIS, in this instance. You've indicated in relation to this bill that IGIS has been given extra resources. But in this instance resources weren't the issue. This person followed through and did exactly what the IGIS suggested that he do, yet we now have a controversy that's developed as a result of the sequence of events. We've had claims about bugging. We've had passports cancelled. We've had people involved in the cancellation of the passport with, at the very least, an apprehended bias. And now we've introduced a piece of legislation into the parliament which expands the scope for operations to be carried out but with no additional oversight mechanisms, as you've suggested.


How do we guarantee or establish a trust with the Australian people as we increase the scope and areas that agencies can operate in, if we're not addressing the oversight of the agencies at the same time? You can see that, in that particular instance, the executive has had a look at all of this. Indeed, the AAT is also an executive arm of government, not a judicial arm. We have a great controversy. I've received advice from the Parliamentary Library as to how East Timor now views Australia as a result of some of these negotiations. You can see it's really important that we have proper oversight of these agencies, yet you're suggesting in this instance that there is no increase. You're increasing the operational space for these agencies but you're not increasing the oversight.

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (17:35):  I can't comment on most of what you've discussed there, and I won't. But the oversight is increasing—there is the $52 million to augment the Office of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security in the budget. So there's a significant increase in oversight. But when it comes to the matters we're dealing with in this legislation, there will be greater scope, potentially, in certain circumstances to prosecute certain individuals. That is a matter for the legal system; it is not a matter for the intelligence agencies.


The processes that we have are very robust processes. We have due process in the courts, and that will take care of the issues that would potentially flow from this legislation passing, which is that, potentially, certain acts are more likely to fall foul of the criminal law and therefore be more likely to be prosecuted and therefore go through the courts. We are overseeing it, with the $52.1 million to augment it in the budget, but I can't comment on any of those other issues you've raised.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (17:46):  Thank you for clarifying that. Could I go back to ask the question again? The scenario that I put to you deals with any information, as you just described it in the Criminal Code. That's the sort of information that could be provided. So why would it not constitute an offence if it could be seen to then breach the definition of 'national security' as I related to earlier, which is under at least 1E? I'm asking a question. Why would it not?

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (17:47):  Sorry, with all due respect, you haven't answered it. You've just said it wouldn't, so I want to know: why wouldn't it? This is what people are actually asking: why wouldn't it? Section (e) says that 'national security' means any of the following: 'the country’s political, military or economic relations with another country or other countries'. People may be trying to do that, so the government's paying attention. So why would it not constitute an offence? I genuinely don't understand why it wouldn't constitute an offence. These are real-life scenarios that I'm talking about. It's not a hypothetical situation. These are the sorts of things that happen in 'activist land' and in 'campaigning land'. The reason we wanted to send this off to an inquiry was to get these sorts of questions answered. That hasn't happened. This is the place we do that. Interpretation will come back to this debate once it starts to get implemented. Why won't it?

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (17:48):  That was very disappointing and quite serious. We've had all these amendments coming through and we're still trying to understand them. There were changes, from what I understand, with regard to foreign companies. The scope of the original legislation included foreign governments, foreign related entities, foreign government directed individuals, foreign political organisations and foreign companies. I understand that foreign companies have now been excluded. Is that correct, Minister?




Senator Seselja:
  Sorry, I'll take a point of order on this. This is not the bill we're dealing with right now. This is the other bill.




Senator RHIANNON:
  I apologise. I do have some questions following on from proposed section 91.1, which you answered some questions about before with regard to journalists. I'll go back to those. I do think we need to discuss this in greater depth because this is the section where the penalty is imprisonment for life. We have some really serious criminal penalties here and also, let's be frank about it, this is one of the sections that have come under considerable criticism from a range of organisations—the media, universities, religious organisations and legal groups. Certainly we've been asked about it many times. I feel I need to bring those questions here because it's where there is the most serious criminal penalty. 


You talk about prejudice. I'd like you to explain how the word 'prejudice' is used. It's set out that it's not embarrassment alone; it goes further than that. I think it's about where there is an advantage to the foreign powers. Could you explain in more detail the meaning of that word, because it obviously has great significance with regard to how national security measures are being judged in this legislation?

 (New South Wales) (17:51):  Seriously, Minister? We're talking about people being jailed for the rest of their natural life. Imprisonment for life is what we're talking about here. You don't answer. Seriously? It's not surprising that people are starting to call it a police state and say it's out of control and there's a degree of authoritarianism. You don't even answer questions about things that have been done in haste. It has a huge penalty on it. 


I will try an example. If a journalist were writing about trade agreements with another country and those trade agreements bring us in dispute with the World Trade Organization and if their reporting were seen to be more favourable and benefiting the trading partner, how would it be judged in terms of the dissemination of information and if prejudices came into the way the journalist or academic had undertaken the work? I'm really just asking you to explain how that section of the bill will work.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (17:53):  Minister, I haven't been in here during the entirety of the most recent questions Senators Siewert and Rhiannon were asking. I presume from your complete lack of response that your position would be that the questions have already been asked and answered. I'm interested in the answer to Senator Rhiannon's question. She'll be able to get up in a minute and tell you what she thinks about your lack of answer and her request again that you respond to her questions. 


I don't believe that this matter has been raised, Minister. I think this is a new issue. I want to ask you about proposed section 91.1(2), which is espionage dealing with information concerning national security which is or will be communicated or made available to a foreign principal. This goes to the recklessness element. The heart of my questions here go to concerns around a chilling impact on freedom of speech by curtailing press freedom or media freedom in Australia. I draw your attention to paragraph 6.21 of the PJCIS report:


The Attorney-General’s Department also confirmed that the espionage offences could cover privately, professionally or commercially produced research, opinions, advice or analysis made available to foreign principals.


I then draw your attention to paragraph 6.154 of the PJCIS report where the committee refers to the Commonwealth DPP and Attorney-General's discretion not to prosecute as the relevant safeguard. Minister, I want to put to you that providing the Attorney-General with a discretion not to prosecute does not constitute a safeguard. Certainly that provision of a discretion to the Attorney-General not to prosecute is nowhere near as strong as a legislated safeguard would be. Are you suggesting that it's the government's view that providing that discretion to the DPP and the Attorney-General is enough of a safeguard here to protect media freedom in Australia? And, remember, I ask you in the context of the revelations today that, in fact, both the DPP and the Attorney-General have signed off on prosecuting Mr Bernard Collaery and Witness K for conspiracy.

Senator SESELJA

I know you've said it to 91.1(2) but I'll make it very clear that you are seeking to prosecute the same ground. I'm not going to answer those questions anymore, because there appears to be an attempt now to filibuster.



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator SESELJA:
  I've gone through each of those elements a number of times. In relation to (2), the same applies. Each of those elements of the offence has to exist in order for an offence to be committed—the person deals with the information et cetera. All of those elements need to be there in order for a prosecution to potentially take place.

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (17:57):  We've come to one of the most serious aspects of the legislation before us, where people can be jailed for the rest of their life. For people who are listening to this or reading it at some stage, it's probably worth them understanding what is happening. The minister hasn't been that particularly cooperative, but we have got onto a new section and he was being half reasonable and starting to answer some questions. But a senior minister to Minister Seselja, Minister Birmingham, came in and they had a talk, and I can only assume that he said: 'Start curtailing your answers. You don't have to get up and reply to this; just sit there'—because that's what's now happening. We have got on to a section that has been so incredibly criticised in this country—by religious people, by legal experts, by charities, by university academics, by legal academics and by constitutional experts. It's unbelievable! It's like being back in the Cold War! They just sit there because they've got the numbers—because Labor delivered them. This minister was answering a few questions but now he's decided to bunker down. Why has he bunkered down? I would have to conclude that he's been given advice. This is really serious. It is no way for the Senate to be used—or abused, because that's what you're now doing.


People can now be captured by these laws. My colleague Senator Nick McKim has said—as have many others; I acknowledge that—that it has a 'chilling effect'. That 'chilling effect' means that people will think, 'I've got to be really careful about what I do'; 'Maybe I shouldn't write that article'; or, 'Maybe I shouldn't go and give that speech to that group of people who are concerned about the direction of Australian foreign policy or the direction of what's happening to our lack of interest in overseas aid and how it's misconstrued.' Look at the rubbish on the front page of The Daily Telegraph today. That chilling effect means that people back off from having an active and open engagement with public life. That is what this legislation will do. Maybe not many people will go to jail, but the government will have achieved what they're trying to do here: advance corporate interests and stifle civil society. The criticism that the government sometimes cops will be reduced, but so will the very rich fabric of what it means to live in a truly democratic society.


It is really alarming sitting in this senate tonight, 28 June. I think we should get it in the Hansard. There are three Labor people here. There are three coalition people here. There are three Greens here. There is one Centre Alliance here. I know people are busy—I'm often not here myself—but, seriously, what the coalition is getting away with is scandalous. What Labor's engaged in, what they've signed off on, will be remembered. We are talking about people going to jail for the rest of their lives, and a minister won't even get up and speak about it—disgraceful.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2018-06-28,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (18:01):  I can only concur with the views expressed by Senator Rhiannon. I want people to understand that this is the only opportunity. The committee stage of this legislation is the only opportunity that this Senate has to scrutinise the 280 amendments across the two separate pieces of legislation that are before us this afternoon that the government and Labor have agreed on. The reason for that is that the coalition and Labor refused to support a Greens attempt to refer these pieces of legislation, plus the 280 amendments, to an inquiry by the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee.


Now, it's true that the bills as originally drafted, sloppy and rank with overreach, were examined at a parliamentary committee, the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence and Security, but, of course, that's a closed shop between the coalition and Labor. The crossbench is frozen out of that. Having said that, the PJCIS process did not provide an opportunity for the Senate to interrogate the 280 different amendments across the two pieces of legislation that we're debating this evening.


What we've got, as Senator Rhiannon quite rightly points out, are provisions that will have a chilling effect on our democracy, on freedom of speech, on press freedom and on media freedom in this country. We have a government refusing to allow for proper scrutiny, and being backed to the hilt by the Labor Party in refusing to allow for that proper scrutiny. The chilling effect is important here, because journalists will need to regularly ask themselves whether a story that they intend to write or publish might fall foul of the provisions in this legislation. When they're facing life imprisonment if they get it wrong—or at least the potential for life imprisonment if they get it wrong—it would be entirely understandable if they decided to err on the side of caution. That is exactly what this government is trying to do. I have no doubt that that is the intent of the relevant ministers who have oversight of this legislation. The cabinet, who presumably all supported and certainly will all support this legislation when it's voted on in this place, have the intent to significantly curtail the media's capacity to hold the government to account and report on stories that are embarrassing to the government. Of course, the Labor Party knows that it will be in government again one day and that, when it's in government, it will benefit from this chilling denial of press freedom.


I agree with Senator Rhiannon. Here we are, it's ticking into the evening and almost no-one's in the chamber. The minister's not answering questions on legislation that, in some parts, has the capacity to impose sentences of life imprisonment on people who are found to have contravened the incredibly broad provisions of this legislation. It's massive overreach, and it continues the blind lock step of the coalition and Labor marching this country down the road to authoritarianism. I was at Bernard Collaery's press conference today. He was asked whether he thought Australia was a police state. He didn't hesitate; he said yes. And he's right. We're a surveillance state. We're a police state. And we're being marched down the road towards authoritarianism. More than 200 pieces of legislation that erode fundamental rights, freedoms and liberties in this country have passed through state and territory parliaments in the last 20 years, and that's been done, in zombie lock step, by the Labor Party and coalition parties.

As foreshadowed in my speech on second reading, this amendment seeks to amend the Intelligences Services Act to extend the oversight role of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security to cover the operations of those agencies. The PJCIS has undertaken some very valuable work. We are, indeed, today debating outcomes of its two latest advisory reports, but the joint committee is presently explicitly excluded from reviewing the operations of the agencies they are meant to oversee.


I have previously spoken about the importance of a well-resourced and capable intelligence community to protect Australia's national interests, and the importance of improving parliamentary oversight of those agencies as they are given more resources, more powers and more responsibilities.


The legislation before the Senate today is another part of the progressive expansion of the roles and responsibilities of the Australian intelligence community. Significantly, by creating new offences related to foreign interference and influence, this legislation will inevitably draw the Australian Federal Police as well as ASIO into the investigation and scrutiny of broad mainstream political activity. We live in a globalised world. Foreign connections are ubiquitous. That is the context of this legislation and the criminal offences it will create. This legislation does represent a significant shift in the relationship between these agencies and broad political activity. In that context, it is essential that we look again at the control and accountability mechanisms that relate to our national security agencies.


In my first speech to the Senate last December, I highlighted the need for parliamentary scrutiny of our intelligence community to extend beyond questions of administration and finance to matters of policy and effectiveness and, indeed, operational matters. The PJCIS is currently severely limited in the scope of its oversight role. It is prohibited from reviewing intelligence operations. It is barred from examining sources of information on other operational assistance, operational methods or any particular operations that have been, are being, or are proposed to be, undertaken by the Australian intelligence community. The committee is prohibited from reviewing particular operations or investigations that have been or are being proposed to be undertaken by the Australian Federal Police. These limitations on the extent of parliamentary oversight are very extensive and reflect an underlying bureaucratic mindset that MPs and senators, elected representatives of the people, cannot be trusted with our nation's most sensitive national security information.


This is not an approach taken by other countries, including Australia's intelligence partners. In the United States, high-powered congressional committees have the authority to reach far into operational matters. Those inquiries are accepted by the United States intelligence community as both necessary and appropriate. As I first pointed out to the Senate in December, in Canada, the new National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians is able to review any activity carried out by a department or intelligence agency that relates to national security or intelligence, unless that activity is an ongoing operation and the appropriate minister determines that the review would be injurious to national security. If the appropriate Canadian minister determines that a review would be injurious to national security, he or she must inform the committee of his or her determination and the reasons for it. If the appropriate minister determines that the review would no longer be injurious to national security or the appropriate minister is informed that the activity is no longer ongoing, he or she must inform the committee that the review may be conducted.


The Canadian parliamentary intelligence oversight arrangements have considerable merit. They have been adopted by a so-called Five Eyes partner with an intelligence committee and parliamentary system very similar to our own. The Canadian approach would provide an enhanced framework for the PJCIS oversight of our intelligence agencies, with the added provision that any ministerial veto over review of operational matters should be referred to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security for review and report to both the PJCIS and the Prime Minister.


I confirmed Centre Alliance's intention to pursue amendments to the Intelligence Services Act during the course of the debate in March on the Intelligence Services Amendment (Establishment of the Australian Signals Directorate) Bill 2018. In May, I moved amendments to the Home Affairs and Integrity Agencies Legislation Amendment Bill 2018 to extend PJCIS oversight along the lines of the Canadian practice. Although the Labor opposition have for some time expressed in principle support for expanding the role of the PJCIS, in May the opposition said that they did not have sufficient time to consider the proposal, and they declined to support it. The same amendments to the Intelligence Services Act are now before the Senate. Both the government and opposition have had plenty of time to consider them—rather more time, I might say, than the Senate has had to consider the very large number of amendments to these bills now proposed by the Senate.


The amendments now moved by Centre Alliance adapt the model provided by the Canadian parliamentary oversight legislation, with an additional safeguard provided by our own Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. The amendment removes most, though not all, of the current legislative constraints on the scope of the PJCIS's inquiries. It retains existing prohibitions on reviewing information provided by a foreign government where that government does not consent to the disclosure of that information. It also retains the prohibition on conducting inquiries into individual complaints about the activities of designated intelligence and national security agencies, as those complaints are most appropriately dealt with by IGIS.


There are details of intelligence operations involving sensitive and vulnerable sources that are best held by the smallest number of people with an absolute need to know. Accordingly, the relevant minister may certify that a review by the PJCIS relates to an ongoing operation and that that review would interfere with the proper performance of the relevant body or its function or otherwise prejudice Australia's national security or the conduct of Australia's foreign relations. In this case, the committee will be required to cease or suspend the review. However, the committee may refer the minister's decision to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, who, within 30 days, must review the matter and consider whether the activity is an ongoing operation and whether it is reasonable to conclude that a review by the committee would interfere with the proper performance by the relevant body or its functions or otherwise prejudice Australia's national security or the conduct of Australia's foreign relations. If the Inspector-General advises the committee that the activity is not an ongoing operation or that the review would not cause interference with the proper functioning of the relevant body or otherwise prejudice Australia's national security or the conduct of Australia's foreign relations, the committee may proceed with the review or commence a new review into the activity.


The need for the expansion of the PJCIS's role has been recognised by others in the Senate. Former senator John Faulkner urged the reform. The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Wong, has similarly observed that parliamentarians cannot outsource their duties to ensure the security of our nation and the people who entrust us with the responsibility of governing. If democratically elected MPs and senators cannot be trusted to deal directly with these questions, then something is wrong with the relationship that exists between the intelligence community and the parliament it is ultimately meant to serve.


Centre Alliance moved these amendments without any narrow interest. Neither I nor my colleague, Senator Griff, is a member of the PJCIS—and we don't imagine we will be members any time soon—but we do think expansion of the role and authority of the PJCIS is essential if we are to continue to have full confidence in our national security and intelligence agencies and their relationships with the parliament. I commend this amendment to the Senate.

Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (18:37):  I again thank Senator Patrick for his ongoing interest in this very important issue around the proper oversight of intelligence agencies. I thank him also for the thoughtful and constructive approach he has taken to drafting amendments which seek to meet—albeit in a slightly different way than Labor has approached this in the past—our objective, which is to ensure that proper oversight of the activities of the Australian intelligence community is able to be undertaken by parliamentarians.


As Senator Wong indicated earlier in the debate, and as I think is well-known in the chamber, Labor does have a private senators' bill which also goes to these questions. We have previously indicated, and I reiterate it here, that we would welcome constructive engagement with all senators in this place, and certainly with Senator Patrick. But I also invite the government to consider its willingness to look seriously at the mechanisms for oversight of the intelligence community.


In terms of this evening's debate, with regard to the amendments proposed on sheet 8458, these amendments are, in substance, unrelated to the subject matter and objects of the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2017. On this basis, Labor does not support the amendments. As I have indicated, that is not to say that we do not consider this to be a matter worthy of very significant attention in this chamber, and I look forward to cooperating with other senators in coming months.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (18:39):  The Australian Greens will be supporting the amendments put forward by Senator Patrick on behalf of Centre Alliance. We believe that reform of the JSCIS is long overdue. Senator Patrick has gone through a little bit of the history of various reports and attempts to reform that committee. I want to place it very clearly on the record that the Australian Greens have a very clear view that that committee should not be a closed shop between the old parties in this place—the parties that self-describe as the parties of government. There is no rational reason why only members of parties that have some kind of reasonable likelihood of forming government should be able to sit on the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence and Security, and, likewise, there is no rational reason why the crossbench should not have a representative on that committee.


As Senator Patrick has pointed out, the Five Eyes nations have a range of ways in which they scrutinise and provide oversight to their intelligence services and their intelligence communities, and it seems to me and seems to the Australian Greens that our country, Australia, is lagging behind most, if not all, of the other Five Eyes nations in providing capacity for their parliaments—where ultimate responsibility lies—to adequately oversight intelligence operations, intelligence agencies and the intelligence community.

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (18:41):  Just briefly, the government doesn't support the amendments moved by Senator Patrick for two reasons. First, this is not the appropriate vehicle nor the appropriate process by which to progress these amendments. The measures in the espionage and foreign interference bill focus on strengthening existing offences for espionage, treason, sabotage and secrecy; creating new foreign interference offences; and ensuring law enforcement agencies have access to appropriate powers to investigate these serious offences. While some measures in the bill relate to oversight, this bill is not the appropriate place to address integrity and oversight arrangements relating to national security generally. 


More broadly, the amendments proposed by Senator Patrick would fundamentally reshape the role of the PJCIS and its relationship with the intelligence services by extending its remit to include the ability to inquire into the operational activities and decisions made by the intelligence services. Amendments of this gravity should be the subject of careful consideration by the parliament, the public and the intelligence community. It would not be appropriate for these amendments to be introduced through an unrelated bill. For these reasons, the government won't be supporting the amendments.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (18:42):  I didn't intend to speak again and I will only be brief. Did I actually just hear the minister say that amendments like this should be the subject of proper scrutiny by the Senate and the public? After he is jamming through, with Labor's acquiescence, 280 amendments—




Senator Cameron:
  How many?




Senator McKIM:
  There are 280, Senator Cameron—with a complete lack of capacity for the public to have a say directly to this Senate, because of the Labor and coalition parties refusing the Greens' motion to refer these bills to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee for inquiry. So I just wanted to place on the record that the minister's argument is spurious and highly hypocritical.

It would have been a great opportunity for the government and the opposition, who are members of that committee, to actually have a close look at this. I don't understand why that suggestion didn't get your support. I also wish to put on the record that I find your remarks a little bit confusing in the context that an opportunity to refer these amendments for proper scrutiny was there and was not taken.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AG,2018-06-28,"



Senator BARTLETT
 (Queensland) (18:44):  I concur with the comments of the previous two speakers. That excuse—and that's all it is—is one that's used so frequently in here it probably would just save time if there were an auto button on the minister's desk and they could press it and play a recording without having to wear out their vocal cords. The minister has to do a lot of talking tonight, and I appreciate he's done well to maintain his equilibrium in the face of a lot of appropriate but nonetheless persistent questioning.


Another reason given is one that really triggered way too many echoes for me—that is, this isn't the appropriate vehicle to put forward this amendment. I've heard that used a number of times when a perfectly appropriate amendment is put forward to address something completely valid. It's just a matter of ensuring more comprehensive and adequate scrutiny of these government agencies that we have already given absolutely enormous, unprecedented and wide-ranging powers to with almost no way of assessing how they are being used in any meaningful way. And even those members who are part of the closed shop of the existing Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security are limited in what they can see. As Senators Patrick and McKim have already outlined, our country falls way behind our allies with regard to parliamentary scrutiny.


The Greens and others on the crossbench don't accept this false argument that somehow the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security has to consist only of the so-called parties of government—and that phrase in itself shows just what sort of mentality we have here. It's not just a confidential club; it's a secret club, and it's something that the rest of the parliament is locked out of. There is a role for the parliament, as a representative of the people, to ensure that the executive, the government, the state and the agencies of the state actually use the extraordinary powers they are given appropriately. There is any amount of evidence—we won't take the time of going through it now—about how those powers haven't been used appropriately in the past.


The other fact is the committee has had a non-government member on it. We know that Andrew Wilkie, an Independent MP, was a member of that committee from 2010 to 2013. That was at the time there was a hung parliament and, as part of agreements reached, he got the completely appropriate agreement to be on that committee. And, of course, he's also a very well-qualified person to be on that committee. Not only did we have someone who wasn't part of the so-called parties of government; he wasn't part of a party. But it was okay for him to be on the committee; the sky didn't fall in.


The great irony, of course, is that Mr Wilkie was the victim of inappropriate leaking when he was working for an intelligence agency. A report that he wrote when he was a systems analyst for the Office of National Assessments somehow found its way to Andrew Bolt. Andrew Bolt had this document and, quite appropriately, thought he'd write about it. For some reason or another there's some problem with letting people from non-government parties onto this committee. I don't know why—we can't be trusted or something; we might reveal things. That Independent member, when he became an ex-worker for an intelligence agency for the government, had something leaked against him—and quite obviously leaked against him purely for political purposes. So that single incident itself shows that there needs to be proper scrutiny of the activities of these agencies. This is just one more example.


Time and time again we've seen, over decades now, legislation after legislation that gives more and more powers to these agencies. Senator McKim earlier moved for a sunset clause. Never once has there been legislation to wind back any of it, even a little bit, not even those powers from the 1950s, from the Cold War. They've never been wound back; it's always more and more and more. We won't even put a sunset clause on them, so they just continue to expand. So we now have these powers where pretty much everybody in the country is under this mass surveillance regime, with all sorts of risks and all sorts of penalties and major jail risks for all sorts of potential activities. But the agencies themselves? Zero scrutiny. A small attempt like this—and, frankly, let's not forget this is a pretty minor amendment; it's not like we're wanting to bug ASIO while they're bugging us. It's a just little bit more proper and broader scrutiny, and being able to dig a bit deeper about what's going on. And yet all we hear is, 'This isn't the appropriate vehicle; this isn't the appropriate time.' Well it would be good if we could at least get a commitment to an in-principle agreement, but we can't even get agreement about getting a national ICAC for scrutiny about what the government itself and the politicians—all of us—are doing, so to expect to get proper scrutiny of intelligence agencies is probably asking a bit much. But there is a growing desire amongst the Australian community for growing scrutiny of parliamentarians and government, and that has to include those agencies that have the greatest powers of all to scrutinise the citizenry.

In my speech in the second reading debate, I expressed regret that the PJCIS did not examine the question of official secrecy and media and public access to government information from a wider perspective. It is vital that, whenever the parliament seeks to clamp down on unauthorised disclosures of government information—and there are reasonable grounds to replace what are antiquated provisions of the Crimes Act—we should also consider measures that would make government more transparent and assist the role of media and citizens in accessing information under the law.


Freedom of information must always be a counterpoint to official secrecy. Freedom of information provides the lawful means for citizens, the media and parliamentarians to obtain access to what is, at the end of the day, information that belongs to the public. I might point out that, in circumstances where we routinely find that the government doesn't respond properly to orders for production, FOI is an important tool for the parliament.


The National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2018 significantly tightens control over government information, especially classified national security information. It will increase the penalties on those persons within government who disclose classified information without authority. It will probably make it more likely that a person who leaks information without authority will be caught and prosecuted. It does provide protection for persons making disclosures of information to oversight bodies such as the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and the Ombudsman.


It significantly improves the Commonwealth's power to control and protect classified information. But it does absolutely nothing to improve the ability of the public, the media or, indeed, this parliament to secure the release of government information through FOI, including through independent review of the claimed classified status of information. For some of you who may not be aware of it, sometimes when claims are made about a document being secret, or even top secret, those matters can ultimately be determined by the courts, and have been in the past. Indeed, in certain circumstances the High Court has overridden the government's claim of material being classified.


To remedy this significant deficiency Centre Alliance is moving this amendment which is designed to significantly improve the effectiveness of Australia's freedom of information laws. The amendments insert a new schedule 7 into the bill, which would amend the Freedom of Information Act, the Australian Information Commissioner Act and the Archives Act. These changes are designed to address the considerable dysfunction that has developed in our freedom of information system, which is now characterised by chronic bureaucratic delay and obstruction, unacceptably lengthy review processes, often prohibitive expenses for the applicants, increased preparedness by agencies to incur very large legal expenses to oppose the release of information and the deliberate undermining by the current government of the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner.


I'm happy to advise that after a year and a half of fighting the government to try and find out what the ISDS costs were under FOI—I've been through a process of obstruction—in this instance I managed to win. The Information Commissioner ordered the government to disclose information to me. Indeed, when that occurred, the government challenged it in the AAT. There are significant legal expenses involved for the Commonwealth to challenge the Information Commissioner's ruling. Fortunately for me, I had some assistance from some willing solicitors and barristers. And I now find, thankfully, that the Commonwealth has pulled out of the proceedings. They've decided to surrender in that instance. Accessing information under FOI can be quite a lengthy and difficult process.


The specific changes I propose in this bill include requiring the government to fill all three offices of the Australian Information Commissioner—the Privacy Commissioner, the Freedom of Information Commissioner and the Information Commissioner. Since 2014, even though, in my view, the legislation—it's Labor's legislation—makes it very clear that there should be three commissioners, since 2014 we have been left with only one. That certainly has frustrated people in getting access to information.


I also propose allowing FOI applicants to elect to have their matters bypass the Information Commissioner, who can take more than a year to make a decision on a controversial issue, and instead take it to the AAT. Another benefit of these amendments includes granting an FOI applicant the right to switch a review into the AAT without charge in the event that the Information Commissioner takes, or indicates that he will take, more than 120 days to make a decision. Going to the AAT involves a cost. I think it costs more than $800 to make an application. We shouldn't put citizens in a situation where they have to pay because we simply haven't resourced the Information Commissioner properly.


This amendment also seeks to prevent agencies from making submissions to the FOI decision reviews that have not been advanced by the agency in its internal decision-making, so they can't switch exemptions halfway through a review as often happens now. In effect, this allows the agency to re-make a decision halfway through a review—something that's not normally permitted in other merit reviews. What happens is that the department advances an exemption, you get a significant way through an information commissioner's review and the government realises it's on shaky ground, so it switches the exemption. The normal principle in any merit review is that once you hand responsibility for the review to a commissioner the agency is not allowed to re-make the decision. The decision is now in the hands of a commissioner or some sort of review body.


Next is preventing the Information Commissioner from making a FOI decision if he or she does not hold the legal qualifications required of the FOI commissioner. When Timothy Pilgrim was in office—and I have great respect for Timothy Pilgrim; this is not a criticism of him—he made FOI decisions, for a number of years, when he did not possess a legal degree. The act made it very clear that, if you were a FOI commissioner, you had to have a law degree. You had to understand how to read case law and how precedence worked. We have a situation now where there is a loophole in the act that says the Information Commissioner can make FOI decisions and doesn't have to have a legal qualification.


Another thing I'd like to see happen, which we're attempting to do in this amendment, is the prevention of agencies from publishing information released under FOI until 14 days after the applicant has received his or her copy of the information. That's designed to encourage journalists to use FOI properly and not have a story gazumped by the agency simply publishing FOI information immediately after a two-year fight to get access to information. That's an improvement specifically targeted at journalism.


Next is requiring an agency to publish its external legal expenses for each information commission or AAT FOI matter that has concluded. I know of one person who has been involved in a FOI matter that cost half a million dollars—I correct myself; it is an Archives-related matter, seeking access to archived information. The government spent half a million dollars trying to prevent someone getting access to archived data; the matter is still ongoing. We should at least get agencies to publish the amount of money that they're spending on legal costs in opposing citizens getting access to information. Having said that, there is an amendment in there that would apply to legal expenses in circumstances where someone makes an application to the National Archives.


This is a comprehensive array of reforms that reflects the practical experience of journalists, researchers and members of parliament seeking information under FOI or, indeed, the Archives Act. Passage of these measures would significantly enhance the operation of our freedom of information laws. They would be of benefit to journalists. As I suggested, there would also be a benefit to members of parliament. They would benefit any citizen seeking access to FOI laws.


Some senators may say that these matters should be addressed elsewhere, but Centre Alliance is of the view that they are very appropriately addressed here, in the context of a bill that will otherwise enhance the government's control of official information. Senators have the same opportunity to consider these amendments as they do any other amendments to this bill. However, it should be said that these amendments are less complex and more unambiguously beneficial than many of the provisions in this very complex legislation that we're dealing with tonight. Centre Alliance commends these amendments to the Senate and commits to continue to pursue comprehensive FOI reforms and improvements at every opportunity.

It's a pathway towards a police state and authoritarianism, and, ultimately, towards a totalitarian state. This bill will significantly curtail freedom of political expression. It will have a chilling effect on media freedom and democratic action in this country.


It's entirely reasonable for this government and this parliament to want to protect Australia against malicious foreign influence and foreign interference. That is an entirely reasonable aim. But you don't protect democracy by smothering it. And that is what this legislation does. It risks curtailing press freedom by placing journalists and media outlets in a difficult, and, at times, almost impossible position. It will dissuade journalists from publishing stories that are clearly in the public interest because they are too scared that they may be charged and face years, decades or their whole lives in prison.


I will confidently predict now that if this legislation ends up before the High Court it will be found to be unconstitutional. And the minister's assurances that the government is confident that it is a piece of legislation that is in line with the Constitution and that it does not breach the implied freedom of political communication in our Constitution offer no comfort whatsoever. Remember, the Prime Minister decided to give the High Court a lecture one day around a section 44 case when he said, infamously, on the floor of the House of Representatives: 'And the High Court shall so rule.' Well, you know what? The High Court did not rule in that way. Presumably, the Prime Minister was receiving advice from the same place that Minister Seselja received advice or the government received advice on this legislation. The place where that advice came from—overwhelmingly likely to be the office of the Solicitor-General—was wrong on section 44. The High Court did not so rule, and I confidently predict that the High Court will not so rule that this legislation is in accordance with the Constitution.


This is a sad day for our country. It's sad because of the sheer weight of numbers in this place and in the House of Representatives that are supporting this legislation: every single one of the old political parties in this state, the parties of command and control, the parties that don't support transparency, the parties that are made ever more uncomfortable by freedom of speech, the parties that, together in lock step, support the indefinite detention of thousands of innocent people on Manus Island and Nauru. These are sad, sad days for our democracy.


These two bills will collectively chill freedom of public expression and place an unfair regulatory burden on many organisations that work to expose government abuses of human rights and government destruction of our environment and hold government to account. It's a sad day for the NGO sector—organisations that work every day to try to protect our environment and try to stand up for human rights; organisations that work every day to hold governments to account. Environmental NGOs, human rights NGOs and media outlets are the big losers today. The big winners are the people who already have the levers of power in this country—the big corporations, the big religions, big government and big politics. Those are the winners today; and it's the Australian people, the environment, the media and human rights that will pay the price.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (16:30):  Minister, I'll try again on the matter I was asking about before question time. I was asking you about an organisation—and I used Markets for Change as an example, which attempts to—actually, I'll withdraw that. I'll just use a hypothetical organisation that is based in Australia and travels overseas with the express intention of trying to persuade overseas markets not to purchase products produced in Australia. My understanding, or my recollection, is that, when I put that to you before question time, you said that that organisation would not be caught by this legislation. I wonder if you could step me through the reasons that you believe that such an organisation conducting those activities would not be caught by this legislation and be subject, potentially, to charges of sabotage or any other charge under this legislation.

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (16:32):  If I can just go back for a second, in terms of earlier: I've sought to answer all of your questions, and I'll continue to seek to answer your questions. But where I am not answering is where I've answered a question several times. In the case of Senator Rhiannon, I think there was a question that had been asked and answered a number of times. I'm here to give as much information as I can, but I don't think it's helpful to go and ask the same question again. I'll just put that on the record. In relation to this one: there's nothing that you've put forward there that would, in any way, engage the sabotage offences. I can't see any link that would possibly see an organisation that was based in Australia and that campaigned for the boycott of certain Australian products, in any way, engage the sabotage offences—or any others that I can see, but the sabotage is the one you mentioned. 


A sabotage offence is: a person engages in conduct that damages public infrastructure—and that's defined—and intends that, or is reckless as to whether, their conduct will prejudice Australia's national security or advantage the national security of a foreign country. As I said, public infrastructure is defined as certain facilities—Commonwealth facilities, defence premises, telecommunication networks, et cetera. They'd have to be damaging that public infrastructure and they would have to intend to or be reckless as to whether in damaging that public infrastructure their conduct would prejudice Australia's national security. Nothing you've set out there, on the advice I have or on my reading of the legislation, would in any way go anywhere near being an offence under that particular provision or any other provision that I'm aware of.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,32,2
"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2018-06-28,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (16:34):  Thank you, Minister. I appreciate your willingness to engage with that, and the response that you've placed on the record. I do appreciate that genuinely. Because we're on sabotage, I'm going to go back to the matter I was discussing before. I appreciate what you've just said about questions being asked on numerous occasions. I ask you to bear with me this time, because I am going to go back to an issue that I was talking about before. I'm going to try to really clearly step out my concerns. I hope that you're able to respond to them in the genuine way that I'm putting them, notwithstanding the fact that I've already raised similar matters before.


I want to take your attention to section 82.6, offence of sabotage reckless as to national security. That's a reasonably easy provision to read and understand. I'll step you through this. I'm going back to the hypothetical situation where a person is blockading a port that's being used for the purposes of live sheep export. The first requirement, 82.6(1)(a), is that the person engages in conduct—and, clearly, blockading a port is conduct. Then we go to 82.6(1)(b):


(b) the conduct results in damage to public infrastructure …


First, can you confirm that damage to public infrastructure, as defined, includes preventing access? Second, can you confirm that public infrastructure can include privately owned infrastructure that is being used to deliver a service? Third, can you confirm that even a privately owned loading facility would be caught within the definition of public infrastructure?

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (16:36):  In relation to the first part, as you'd be aware, 82.1(d) defines damage to public infrastructure:


(d) the conduct limits or prevents access to it or any part of it by persons who are ordinarily entitled to access it or that part of it;


I think the answer to that would be yes. In relation to the second part of your question, it is in 82.2, public infrastructure; 82.2(e) reads:




(e) any infrastructure, facility, premises, network or electronic system 
…
 that:





(i) provides or relates to providing the public with utilities
 or services … 
of any kind; and





(ii) is located in Australia; and





(iii) belongs to or is operated by a constitutional corporation or is used to facilitate constitutional trade and commerce.



Obviously, it would depend on a number of circumstances as to whether it fit that definition.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2018-06-28,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (16:38):  Thanks, Minister. For the purposes of the question I'm about to ask, can we assume that the tests under 82.6(1)(a) and (b) have been met—that is, the person has been engaged in conduct that is a blockade and the conduct has resulted in damage to public infrastructure? Firstly, damage includes limiting access to, as I think you've just outlined. Secondly, public infrastructure can include private infrastructure, as long as it provides or relates to providing the public with utilities or services, including the transport of people or goods of any kind; it is located in Australia; and it belongs to or is operated by a constitutional corporation.


We assume that those criteria are met and then we go to 82.6(1)(c). This is a blockade which is done for the purpose of raising the political issue of animal cruelty, but which has a corollary impact of impacting on Australia's economic relationship with another country—by virtue of the fact that it, for example, delays or halts indefinitely the departure of that vessel.


So my question, Minister, is whether that blockade, in the hypothetical situation that I've outlined, could result in the commission of an offence under this legislation because that blockade, firstly, prejudices national security because of the way 'national security' is defined to include economic relationships between Australia and another country. I just don't see how that action could not be caught under 82.6(1).

"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2018-06-28,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (16:40):  Thank you; I accept that you've asked the question in a slightly different way. I'll do my best to answer it, but I am going over a little bit of old ground. The answer to the question is that, in order for an offence to apply and for a potential charge or prosecution to occur under this particular provision, there would have to be actions by the person to damage the public infrastructure. With the public infrastructure that I've set out in terms of the definition, it's difficult to know in what circumstances. It's possible that it could be public infrastructure, but that is clearly defined and it may or may not be public infrastructure. But, if all of those were there, you would need the damage to the infrastructure and then, if in fact it is public infrastructure, there would have to be either an intent or recklessness to whether the conduct would prejudice Australia's national security or advance the national security of a foreign country—and, in addition to that, the conduct wouldn't be reasonable in the circumstances.


The government has certainly made it clear that ordinary protests such as picketing an MP's office or a building and the like are not designed to come under the scope of these directions. In terms of the 'reasonableness', the point I would make is that there are a lot of tests that would have to be met. There has to be the damage, it has to be public infrastructure within those definitions, there has to be an intent or recklessness to do damage to Australia's national security and, in addition to that, it wouldn't be reasonable in all of those circumstances for the actions to be taken.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (16:42):  Thanks, Minister. Once again, I thank you for your response. You've stepped us through that, and your response, I think, is helpful for the Senate's understanding, because you've placed clearly on the record the government's intention behind this legislation.


I will offer, I guess, a comment, if I may. Even though you've done that, and placed the intent on the record, I think an ordinary-English-language reading of this provision does provide for charges to be laid against a person or a group of people in the circumstances that I've outlined. As to how the courts might rule on that, obviously we'd have to wait and see. Again, obviously, it would pivot on the individual circumstances of the case, of course, as cases like this always do in our judicial system. So, even though you've placed the government's intent on the record, I'm not convinced that the way this section is drafted actually does reflect that intent, and I maintain my view that this section, as drafted, at least potentially could catch actions such as the one that I've outlined.

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (16:43):  I want to move on to some questions about section 91.1. This is the section about espionage and dealing with information concerning national security—how it's communicated et cetera. Firstly, I want to understand some of the definitions that are dealt with here in terms of what the reach of them is. The word 'deals' is used—we're talking about 'deals with information'. It's defined in section 90.1(1) to include if a person:


(a) receives or obtains it;


(b) collects it; 


…   …   …


(h) communicates it;


(i) publishes it;


(j) makes it available.


Minister, isn't this what journalists do? I'm just checking, therefore—because I have further questions—that this is the section under which people who are communicating, like journalists, could be captured.

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (16:45):  If I understand your question correctly, you're asking whether or not 'dealing with information' potentially attracts these particular provisions. If that's your question, the answer is yes. But looking at one section in isolation doesn't in any way go to whether there's a potential offence. As with the other provisions we've discussed, such as sabotage, in each case there are a series of things that need to be made out. If I understand your question correctly, and you want to lay it as a baseline for further questions, then I think the answer is yes.

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2018-06-28,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (16:46):  Then, to put with that—'national security' is defined in section 90.4(1)(e) to include:


… the country's political, military or economic negotiations with another country or other countries.


Again, an investigative journalist's work explores so many issues. We have a great many of them at the moment, with the issues around the relationship with China, with our whole region, with how DFAT works, et cetera. Going back to the definition I gave, in terms of 'obtain, collect, communicate, publish'—and maybe there are other sections where there are more boundaries on this—the way it's structured, with the definition of 'dealing with information' and the definition of 'national security', the conclusion that I came to from reading this material is that it could have a very broad reach, in terms of people who are analysing relations between Australia and other countries, considering the definition of 'national security'. What I'm really asking you to do is bring the definition of 'national security' in and explain how it will be interpreted in assessing this information about 'dealing with information'.

"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2018-06-28,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (16:48):  I'll try and step through this a little bit as to what the elements of this offence would be. Obviously journalists, like others, if they were to engage every element of the espionage offence, would potentially be liable. But there is a high bar. One of the reasons it's designed the way it is is that, of course, when we are dealing with espionage and when we are dealing with foreign agents, it's not easy to absolutely define every type of activity in a piece of legislation. If we go through the elements that would be needed—and that might help, and then no doubt there'll be further questions—the espionage offences in the case of a journalist—if we take that as an example, although it's certainly not aimed at journalists—would apply only where that person intends to or is reckless as to whether their conduct will prejudice Australia's national security or advantage national security of a foreign country. With espionage, there also in this case must be a link to a foreign principal, which does not include foreign businesses or individuals. If a journalist engaged in the relevant conduct and these circumstances existed then of course there'd be the potential for the espionage offences to apply. But it wouldn't capture a journalist engaged in the ordinary practice of their profession, where their intent is to report on matters of public interest. So it absolutely goes to, yes, links to foreign principals, and damage, through intent or recklessness, to national security, but not to someone who was acting in good faith, in order to bring issues of national interest into the public domain—unless they were deliberate or reckless as to doing national security damage to Australia—and then it wouldn't, in that circumstance, apply.


But I would just make this broader point. I made the point earlier that, when it comes to secrecy offences, there are specific defences in relation to journalists, but when we are talking about espionage, we are talking about a very serious offence, a very high bar, and the idea of potentially completely carving journalists out of that actually presents some serious national security challenges. I think it was the Director-General who made some comments—I'll check my notes in a minute—that, if you did have a complete carve-out for journalists, that would potentially be very, very dangerous and would actually put journalists at risk of some of those attempts at foreign interference. So, in relation to these specific offences, whilst there is not a specific carve-out that exempts journalists or gives them a specific defence, the bar is very high one, and, in those circumstances, someone simply reporting in the public interest and getting things to light would not be engaging that, unless all of those other elements that I've pointed to were in existence and were able to be proved.

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2018-06-28,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (16:51):  Thank you, Minister. I will ask about an example shortly, just to try and understand this further, but first I will just pick up on some of your remarks. You spoke a number of times about the 'public interest'. It's an interesting term. It's an important term. But, when you think about it, so often—and maybe more so when a politician uses it—it's equated with what the government's interests are. To highlight what I mean by that, I will use some examples from history.


There was a period when Australia actually supported apartheid. Australian government figures supported apartheid in South Africa and supported the Vietnam War. Now, in time, we—all politicians of all persuasions—came to realise that those were very wrong aspects of our foreign policy. First I will make a comment, and then I'll ask a question. I think this will give context to the question. Let's think about reporting when there were dominant forces in the Australian government who were sympathetic to and supportive, in various ways, of the apartheid regime in South Africa, and, as we know, actually were directly involved in the Vietnam War. Say this bill had been in legislation at that time, and there had been reporting of criticisms—for instance, of the My Lai massacre. At the time when it was first reported, it was as just part of the war effort, with Australia supposedly doing the right thing by stopping the invasion of communist hordes coming down to invade this country, so we had to send troops there. In time, we came to find out about the My Lai massacre—and I'm not suggesting Australians were involved in that, but it's one of the standout examples. It was deeply shocking, with children, women and elderly men killed, and many rapes, and the village burnt. But the initial reporting on it was that it was part of the war effort. It was courageous journalists who pushed through, and some courageous soldiers who gave the story. But considering we were supporting that war effort, if this legislation had been in place wouldn't it have been necessary to prosecute reporters who were writing to expose what actually happened there and who weren't directly supporting the government interest, which so often is interpreted as the public interest, considering at that time the government was presenting the public interest as stopping communist hordes coming down from Vietnam, China and elsewhere into this country and that our soldiers had to be sent there? So if this espionage legislation was in place at the time, journalists who were writing about what actually happened could have been charged for receiving and obtaining, collecting, communicating, publishing or making information available that was contrary to the government interest and public interest of the time?

"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2018-06-28,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (16:55):  I have a couple of points. One is that the espionage provisions have existed in one form or another in legislation for a long time. They exist now in, I think, areas such as the Criminal Code. I couldn't say exactly how long, but there hasn't been a spate of prosecutions of journalists for that type of activity. I just make the point that in the espionage provisions we're not necessarily talking of dramatic changes to what we've had. We've always had these types of provisions and, again, it fundamentally goes to the intent. The point you were making, Senator Rhiannon, about if it was a popular view versus an unpopular view is simply irrelevant to whether a potential offence would exist.


The provision that you have highlighted has a significant number of elements that would all have to be satisfied in order for a potential prosecution: a person deals with information or an article; the information or article has a security classification or concerns Australia's national security; the person intends that the person's conduct will prejudice Australia's national security or advantage national security of a foreign country; and the conduct results or will result in the information or article being communicated or made available to a foreign principal or a person acting on their behalf. They are the elements and, as I say, we have had these kinds of provisions for a long time. It's important that we do. Notwithstanding that, we haven't seen journalists who have engaged in their profession with anything other than an intent to damage national security being prosecuted for that.


Just going back to my earlier comment, which is related to this, it's a matter of public record, both from the Director-General of Security and from journalists reporting in Australian and overseas media, that foreign intelligence services have recruited and continue to recruit journalists to engage in espionage and related activities in Australia. This is a matter the Director-General spoke to in some detail in public evidence. The Director-General of Security said that a blanket exemption for journalists could 'effectively leave a door wide open for foreign spies to exploit, and may have the unintended consequence of increasing the intelligence threat that's faced by our journalists'. As I say, in some areas we have a specific defence when it comes to journalists; the espionage offences have a series of elements that would need to be made out. An offence would go to each of those elements particularly, and, most importantly, the intent to prejudice Australia's national security.

Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (16:58):  Minister, further to Senator Rhiannon's question, and following on from your answer, you said that, in order to make out the offence, the documents might involve a security classification. There are many, many different classifications that are used—such as 'cabinet in confidence', which is not necessarily a security classification; it's a protective marking but not a security classification per se. It could be about the Murray-Darling or some health initiative or something like that. There are other classifications such as 'restricted' and 'for official use only'. What's the bar? The normal classifications, military wise, are 'confidential', 'secret' and 'top secret'. They're kind of the normal military classifications. What's the bar?

 (South Australia) (17:00):  I have seen in circumstances—for example, an FOI claim—where they might talk about a security classification; in fact, they use the term 'damage to national security', which is similar to terms used in this bill.

 (South Australia) (17:01):  Sure, and I apologise for not articulating it properly. It is perhaps a complex or nuanced issue. I'll give you a real example. Former senator Nick Xenophon is currently in the AAT seeking access to documents which are marked 'for official use only'. The claim advanced by the respondent in that particular application—and it is not going to the substance of the matter; I really want to direct it back to the bill—is that 'this document is damaging to national security or would cause damage to national security if it were to be released under FOI'. This bill appears to now be creating an inconsistency across Commonwealth legislation in respect of how you define what is damaging to national security. Is the marking of 'secret' and/or 'top secret' the only thing that's covered under this legislation? No-one's going to seek to use a similar definition to FOI? I'm just trying to get some clarity on that.

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (17:03):  We're probably talking about two slightly separate things. In relation to secret and top secret, that goes to one of the elements that would potentially need to be proved to deal with this particular provision in section 91.1, espionage. Obviously we're dealing with the most serious of offences here. There has to be all of the elements. So the person would deal with information or an article. That's just a starting point. Then the information or article would have either a security classification—secret or top secret; that's defined—or concerns about Australia's national security. In addition to that, the person would have to intend that the person's conduct would prejudice Australia's national security or advantage the national security of a foreign country and then, as I said earlier, the conduct results or will result in that information going to a foreign principal or someone acting on their behalf. So the security classification is dealing with high level, secret and top secret. There is the national security element, but it would have to step through and get each of (a), (b), (c) and (d) of that provision in order for someone to potentially have contravened this piece of legislation or this part of the act.

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (17:05):  I want to go back to the example, but I did want to pick up on your response to my last question. You made the point, which is very apt, that espionage measures have existed in the law of this land for a long time—which is actually very relevant to the fact that we have this new legislation before us. Why was it judged that new legislation on espionage was needed, considering you've said it's already in the law? In answering that question, could you also advise what the threats were that you judged required that this new law was needed?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,32,2
"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2018-06-28,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (17:06):  The new espionage offences criminalise a broad range of dealings with information, including possessing or receiving, and protect a broader range of information, including unclassified material. The offences introduce tier defences covering intentional and reckless conduct with commensurate tiered penalties. The new offences will target not only the person who discloses the information but also the actions of the foreign spy who receives the information. The new offences will also criminalise soliciting or procuring a person to engage in espionage and will introduce a new preparation or planning offence. These offences will allow law enforcement agencies to intervene at an earlier stage to prevent the harmful conduct occurring. That is where we are effectively improving the laws.


On the point I made earlier in terms of the type of scenario you were talking about, we have always had, in one form or another, these kinds of secrecy and espionage provisions, and for good reason: because there are always foreign actors or, indeed, Australians acting against the national interest who, in some cases, have engaged in this type of activity, which we need strong laws to prevent. That gives you a summary of what we're seeking to improve through these new pieces of legislation.

I think that is very relevant to the discussion here. What are the threats that warrant this legislation, which has come under enormous criticism? The government itself effectively acknowledged that by the fact that it recognised that it had to seriously amend the bill and there were 280 amendments, I understand. So my question was not about the actual provisions and the description of the new aspects of the espionage legislation that will play out if this goes through; my question was: what are the actual threats that warranted coming forward with this legislation?

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (17:08):  Certainly the advice to government is that the threats of foreign interference and espionage are increasing and that, if unchecked, these threats can erode our sovereignty and diminish public confidence in the integrity of our political and government institutions. The judgement has been made by the government that existing laws are inadequate to deter and counter the pervasive foreign interference activities directed against Australia and that the current legislative and policy frameworks have created a permissive operating environment for foreign adversaries.


Espionage and foreign interference by nation states is a reality and can cause enormous harm to our national sovereignty and to the integrity of Australia's democracy. The Director-General of ASIO has advised that foreign intelligence activity against Australia is occurring on an unprecedented scale. Foreign interference can erode our sovereignty by diminishing public confidence in the integrity of our political and government institutions and undermining our societal values. So the advice is that these threats are growing, that the nature of them is obviously ever-changing and that having laws that simply stay still in response to these threats is no longer good enough. That's the very strong advice to government and that's a big reason we have this legislation before the Senate today.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (17:09):  This morning, Senator McKim was asking some questions about activists working on international issues. I want to put to you a specific type of scenario, which I'm aware actually occurs in Australia. Say an Australian company had caused environmental damage in another country and that had affected not only the environment but people's capacity to earn their living as they used to. There's no recompense for those people, and they're seeking recompense. They're working with Australian not-for-profit organisations. The organisations in the other country are working with their own government, and the Australian organisations are working with those environmental organisations with, in fact, a foreign government, to either seek recompense from the Australian government or encourage the Australian government to take action. I'm aware that this happens. Will they get caught up in this legislation? The way I read the definition of 'foreign government principals', it would involve interaction with a foreign government. There is the potential that political or economic relations with that country may be damaged as a result of the activism. How would this scenario be handled when people from Australia are talking to foreign governments about specific remedies for this particular situation?

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (17:12):  You might need to be a bit clearer, Senator Siewert, on the type of activity you're talking about. Talking to a foreign government is not banned in any way, shape or form under this legislation. There are sabotage offences, which we've dealt with in some detail in terms of all of the elements. Later we'll get to the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme, where certain activities need to be declared, made public and not done in a covert manner and the like, but I'm not sure which particular provisions you're referring to. It might help the conversation if you can refer me to those.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (17:12):  I'm talking about the definition of 'foreign government principal', and I'm then looking at the definition of 'national security'. For example, the activists in Australia may be talking to the NGOs in the other country about how our system operates so that they know who to talk to, but it might be more than that. It may also be about activism, about how to draw attention to the issue if they're not getting the government's attention. It could also involve taking legal action and how you use the system that way.

 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (17:13):  There's nothing you pointed to that in any way would, under any scenario, constitute illegal conduct. You've pointed to some of the definitions—foreign principals and the like—but it's about what then happens on behalf of, for instance, a foreign principal. Are you sabotaging things? Are you undermining Australia's national security with intent or recklessness? I'm not seeing any actions that you've pointed to that could in any way, shape or form be covered by this legislation. There would have to be some clear and specific action that's covered under one of the offence provisions that would engage the legislation, but there's nothing you pointed to there that would.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (17:14):  I'm looking, in particular the recklessness angle. I'm looking at definition (e)—




Senator Seselja:
  Under what provision?




Senator SIEWERT:
  In terms of national security, and looking at section 90.4 at (1)(e), it says:


The national security of Australia or a foreign country means any of the following:


…   …   …


(e) the country’s political, military or economic relations with another country or other countries.


I could foresee a scenario in which you're working with the organisation that's working with the foreign country and that then does impact on the relationship between that country and Australia—for example, in terms of the political relationship. The foreign country may, in fact, decide they're not going to engage with Australia in military exercises, for example, or it could affect the economic relationship—they may decide that in order to achieve the objective. That's what I'm looking at. There may be an intent to do that. To achieve the objective, the campaign could be that they want to influence that. They want to get Australia to be paying attention, and the way they do that is by making Australia feel the pain. Or it may be, in fact, reckless. I'm not saying they would be reckless doing that, but the government could see it as reckless to do that, because what's articulated under (e) happens.

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (17:16):  I think there's still just a little bit of confusion with the definitions, which you've rightly pointed to, that help with interpreting the offence provisions. The offence provisions have a number of elements. Let's take sabotage. You've rightly pointed out that national security is defined, but there has to be conduct, and with sabotage, the conduct is specific. It's specifically conduct that results in damage to public infrastructure, which is defined, again, separately, and then there's an intent or recklessness about it. It also prejudices Australia's national security and, indeed, in some cases, depending on the offence, it might be conduct engaged in on behalf of or collaborating with a foreign principal. We've covered this in some detail. Those offences each have to have all of their elements made out. The definitions you're pointing to don't constitute anything in terms of an office. All you've pointed to there is that there is a foreign principal and there is some sort of collaboration or activity with that foreign principal, but there's no offence that I can see. Certainly you have to look at each of the offences, and they're the ones that carry the penalties. The offences have to have a number of those elements made out and there's nothing you've described to me that would attract any of those offences that I can see, but if you've got more specificity I'm happy to try and answer those questions.

Please excuse me: I haven't managed to look at all the amendments, because of the time frames involved here, so forgive me if I ask a question that seems a little bit odd. This is just working with the principle that whenever you increase the power of somebody, and particularly a secret organisation, you want to make sure you've got the right checks and balances in place. I have had a briefing on this from the intelligence services, just talking about the bill generally. They suggested that there are no real, new powers for the intelligence agencies in relation to this bill—that they don't gain any additional powers. Can you confirm that for me, please?

"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-06-28,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (17:19):  I presume that it does, however, deal with the scope. If you're changing the way you view an offence—perhaps expanding its boundaries slightly or changing those boundaries—then the way in which the intelligence services may respond to that would change. That may involve the exercise of an existing power to deal with a new area of potential offence. Is it fair to say that?

"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2018-06-28,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (17:20):  Because we're setting up a series of new offences, in many ways, instead of giving more power to the intelligence agencies, it would push things into the criminal realm—to the Australian Federal Police to investigate potential crimes that may have been committed under this legislation if it's passed, and, obviously, to the courts, who would need to determine whether an offence has been committed. If we were to look from the perspective of law enforcement generally, police powers are one thing—the ability to detain people, the ability to restrain people, the ability to use force—and that sits in one box. The actual criminal offences of the criminals they're seeking to apprehend and deter sit separately. In that context, this is about the criminal law as it applies to certain types of offences. It doesn't give the intelligence agencies any more or different powers, but obviously it is designed to make sure that, where there are potential offences and attempts to undermine our national security, there are proper penalties for that.

Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (17:22):  In some sense you talk about the AFP now having perhaps more operations as a result of this—the ability to examine the conduct of somebody and lay a charge. I might point out that the AFP generally doesn't sit inside the six organisations that would traditionally be considered the Australian intelligence community. But we know, from other legislation, that we are in fact trying to integrate, I think, 10 agencies under the same top-level coordination through the Prime Minister's office. We could have a circumstance where, in dealing with some of these new areas, we might have the AFP looking at matters in-country but perhaps being supported by ASIO—or indeed, ASIS outside the country—to verify some communications or something that's happening overseas. Is it fair to say that the execution of the enforcement of this bill would potentially involve all of the intelligence services all working together or at least a number of them working together?

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (17:23):  Obviously, Senator Patrick, the intelligence agencies work with other agencies. Of course the AFP works with other agencies; they work with prosecutors and the like to enforce the law. This provides different offences—stronger offences in many cases—for certain activities. That obviously makes it more likely that certain types of activity are captured under our criminal law. Therefore the AFP can investigate that, potentially lay charges and pass it over to relevant prosecutors. In relation to your earlier question about oversight, even though this doesn't actually give any additional powers to our intelligence agencies, there is additional financial support for oversight. So the government provided $52.1 million in the budget to augment the Office of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. Obviously, that is something we take very seriously. So, whilst this doesn't give additional powers as such to our intelligence agencies, we do take that oversight very seriously in the context of this type of legislation.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,32,2
"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-06-28,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (17:24):  Yes. I will perhaps discuss oversight in that regard. I'm really just trying to understand where we would sit right now if the bill were to pass unamended—the reason I'm asking those questions now. I just want to talk you through a real situation and the idea that, as a result of the passage of this bill, we may end up with a situation where we have various different intelligence agencies operating, perhaps in new areas, carrying out different sorts of operations, using the same powers that I accept you've advised me of. I'll just talk through the situation. In fact, I'll use the matter raised by Senator McKim earlier today. I know he was talking about a matter that's before the courts; I will avoid the matter that is before the court. Here is a little bit of background on that matter from listening to Senator McKim. Back in 2004, the Howard government sought to bug the East Timor cabinet buildings in order to gain advantage during a negotiation in respect of the maritime boundary between East Timor and Australia. Of course, all these sorts of negotiations are conducted in good faith—that's the normal regime when doing so—and if you fail to do so you perhaps may, in some sense, be committing a fraud.


In that instance we had a particular agent who raised a concern with the IGIS. I note that you've suggested that there is greater funding for the IGIS in respect of the many changes that are going through the parliament now in relation to national security and intelligence and indeed for this bill. He raised a concern. The IGIS actually took the matter, received the agent—who we know as Witness K—and took his concerns, and passed them or authorised some independent legal action. So we now had a situation where we had counsel and we had an agent authorised by the IGIS to explore a matter that eventually led to a situation where Australia was actually taken to The Hague. Some quite extraordinary orders ended up getting made against Australia. You'll recall that there was a raid on the Attorney's office at that time. A whole range of documents were taken, and in fact the tribunal in The Hague ordered that those documents be returned. There was also an order that was placed restricting Australia's electronic surveillance of the ongoing negotiations.


Unfortunately for Witness K, there was a fallout there, in that he was then denied a passport application; and the person who denied that application was the Director-General of ASIS. The director-general—who it's not unlawful to name, who was then Nick Warner—acted as what is referred to as a competent authority to cancel someone's passport. So now someone's liberties had been constrained. And there's an irony there because it turned out that Mr Nick Warner was actually involved in the original bugging operation, so there was an issue of bias involved in terms of that decision. That matter is before the AAT, and unfortunately that's been stayed now as a result of criminal proceedings being implemented.


But there's an example where we have an intelligence officer who sticks up his hand and says, 'I think something's going wrong,' and goes to the right authority—the IGIS, in this instance. You've indicated in relation to this bill that IGIS has been given extra resources. But in this instance resources weren't the issue. This person followed through and did exactly what the IGIS suggested that he do, yet we now have a controversy that's developed as a result of the sequence of events. We've had claims about bugging. We've had passports cancelled. We've had people involved in the cancellation of the passport with, at the very least, an apprehended bias. And now we've introduced a piece of legislation into the parliament which expands the scope for operations to be carried out but with no additional oversight mechanisms, as you've suggested.


How do we guarantee or establish a trust with the Australian people as we increase the scope and areas that agencies can operate in, if we're not addressing the oversight of the agencies at the same time? You can see that, in that particular instance, the executive has had a look at all of this. Indeed, the AAT is also an executive arm of government, not a judicial arm. We have a great controversy. I've received advice from the Parliamentary Library as to how East Timor now views Australia as a result of some of these negotiations. You can see it's really important that we have proper oversight of these agencies, yet you're suggesting in this instance that there is no increase. You're increasing the operational space for these agencies but you're not increasing the oversight.

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (17:35):  I can't comment on most of what you've discussed there, and I won't. But the oversight is increasing—there is the $52 million to augment the Office of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security in the budget. So there's a significant increase in oversight. But when it comes to the matters we're dealing with in this legislation, there will be greater scope, potentially, in certain circumstances to prosecute certain individuals. That is a matter for the legal system; it is not a matter for the intelligence agencies.


The processes that we have are very robust processes. We have due process in the courts, and that will take care of the issues that would potentially flow from this legislation passing, which is that, potentially, certain acts are more likely to fall foul of the criminal law and therefore be more likely to be prosecuted and therefore go through the courts. We are overseeing it, with the $52.1 million to augment it in the budget, but I can't comment on any of those other issues you've raised.

You'll be aware that the United States, for example, has a congressional oversight of the intelligence services. Canada does as well, and so does the UK.

But it's difficult for me to add much more to the answer to your question other than to reiterate that we've looked at these criminal laws, the activities of ASIO will continue, the oversight of ASIO and our intelligence agencies will continue to be increased and properly resourced, but in passing this legislation, if that's what the Senate chooses to do today, we will have stronger criminal laws, and at the end of that we will have a series of processes, and of course that engages most particularly the AFP and our justice system.

I'm just trying to understand whether or not we would—and I'm actually presuming, from some of the material that's in the intelligence review that led to this legislation that it's an integrated approach that you take when you are looking to detect and gather evidence and prosecute people under this sort of legislation.

 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (17:46):  Thank you for clarifying that. Could I go back to ask the question again? The scenario that I put to you deals with any information, as you just described it in the Criminal Code. That's the sort of information that could be provided. So why would it not constitute an offence if it could be seen to then breach the definition of 'national security' as I related to earlier, which is under at least 1E? I'm asking a question. Why would it not?

This is what people are actually asking: why wouldn't it? Section (e) says that 'national security' means any of the following: 'the country’s political, military or economic relations with another country or other countries'. People may be trying to do that, so the government's paying attention. So why would it not constitute an offence? I genuinely don't understand why it wouldn't constitute an offence. These are real-life scenarios that I'm talking about. It's not a hypothetical situation. These are the sorts of things that happen in 'activist land' and in 'campaigning land'. The reason we wanted to send this off to an inquiry was to get these sorts of questions answered. That hasn't happened. This is the place we do that. Interpretation will come back to this debate once it starts to get implemented. Why won't it?

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (17:48):  That was very disappointing and quite serious. We've had all these amendments coming through and we're still trying to understand them. There were changes, from what I understand, with regard to foreign companies. The scope of the original legislation included foreign governments, foreign related entities, foreign government directed individuals, foreign political organisations and foreign companies. I understand that foreign companies have now been excluded. Is that correct, Minister?




Senator Seselja:
  Sorry, I'll take a point of order on this. This is not the bill we're dealing with right now. This is the other bill.




Senator RHIANNON:
  I apologise. I do have some questions following on from proposed section 91.1, which you answered some questions about before with regard to journalists. I'll go back to those. I do think we need to discuss this in greater depth because this is the section where the penalty is imprisonment for life. We have some really serious criminal penalties here and also, let's be frank about it, this is one of the sections that have come under considerable criticism from a range of organisations—the media, universities, religious organisations and legal groups. Certainly we've been asked about it many times. I feel I need to bring those questions here because it's where there is the most serious criminal penalty. 


You talk about prejudice. I'd like you to explain how the word 'prejudice' is used. It's set out that it's not embarrassment alone; it goes further than that. I think it's about where there is an advantage to the foreign powers. Could you explain in more detail the meaning of that word, because it obviously has great significance with regard to how national security measures are being judged in this legislation?

I will try an example. If a journalist were writing about trade agreements with another country and those trade agreements bring us in dispute with the World Trade Organization and if their reporting were seen to be more favourable and benefiting the trading partner, how would it be judged in terms of the dissemination of information and if prejudices came into the way the journalist or academic had undertaken the work?

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (17:53):  Minister, I haven't been in here during the entirety of the most recent questions Senators Siewert and Rhiannon were asking. I presume from your complete lack of response that your position would be that the questions have already been asked and answered. I'm interested in the answer to Senator Rhiannon's question. She'll be able to get up in a minute and tell you what she thinks about your lack of answer and her request again that you respond to her questions. 


I don't believe that this matter has been raised, Minister. I think this is a new issue. I want to ask you about proposed section 91.1(2), which is espionage dealing with information concerning national security which is or will be communicated or made available to a foreign principal. This goes to the recklessness element. The heart of my questions here go to concerns around a chilling impact on freedom of speech by curtailing press freedom or media freedom in Australia. I draw your attention to paragraph 6.21 of the PJCIS report:


The Attorney-General’s Department also confirmed that the espionage offences could cover privately, professionally or commercially produced research, opinions, advice or analysis made available to foreign principals.


I then draw your attention to paragraph 6.154 of the PJCIS report where the committee refers to the Commonwealth DPP and Attorney-General's discretion not to prosecute as the relevant safeguard. Minister, I want to put to you that providing the Attorney-General with a discretion not to prosecute does not constitute a safeguard. Certainly that provision of a discretion to the Attorney-General not to prosecute is nowhere near as strong as a legislated safeguard would be. Are you suggesting that it's the government's view that providing that discretion to the DPP and the Attorney-General is enough of a safeguard here to protect media freedom in Australia? And, remember, I ask you in the context of the revelations today that, in fact, both the DPP and the Attorney-General have signed off on prosecuting Mr Bernard Collaery and Witness K for conspiracy.

Senator SESELJA:
  I've gone through each of those elements a number of times. In relation to (2), the same applies. Each of those elements of the offence has to exist in order for an offence to be committed—the person deals with the information et cetera. All of those elements need to be there in order for a prosecution to potentially take place.

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2018-06-28,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (17:57):  We've come to one of the most serious aspects of the legislation before us, where people can be jailed for the rest of their life. For people who are listening to this or reading it at some stage, it's probably worth them understanding what is happening. The minister hasn't been that particularly cooperative, but we have got onto a new section and he was being half reasonable and starting to answer some questions. But a senior minister to Minister Seselja, Minister Birmingham, came in and they had a talk, and I can only assume that he said: 'Start curtailing your answers. You don't have to get up and reply to this; just sit there'—because that's what's now happening. We have got on to a section that has been so incredibly criticised in this country—by religious people, by legal experts, by charities, by university academics, by legal academics and by constitutional experts. It's unbelievable! It's like being back in the Cold War! They just sit there because they've got the numbers—because Labor delivered them. This minister was answering a few questions but now he's decided to bunker down. Why has he bunkered down? I would have to conclude that he's been given advice. This is really serious. It is no way for the Senate to be used—or abused, because that's what you're now doing.


People can now be captured by these laws. My colleague Senator Nick McKim has said—as have many others; I acknowledge that—that it has a 'chilling effect'. That 'chilling effect' means that people will think, 'I've got to be really careful about what I do'; 'Maybe I shouldn't write that article'; or, 'Maybe I shouldn't go and give that speech to that group of people who are concerned about the direction of Australian foreign policy or the direction of what's happening to our lack of interest in overseas aid and how it's misconstrued.' Look at the rubbish on the front page of The Daily Telegraph today. That chilling effect means that people back off from having an active and open engagement with public life. That is what this legislation will do. Maybe not many people will go to jail, but the government will have achieved what they're trying to do here: advance corporate interests and stifle civil society. The criticism that the government sometimes cops will be reduced, but so will the very rich fabric of what it means to live in a truly democratic society.


It is really alarming sitting in this senate tonight, 28 June. I think we should get it in the Hansard. There are three Labor people here. There are three coalition people here. There are three Greens here. There is one Centre Alliance here. I know people are busy—I'm often not here myself—but, seriously, what the coalition is getting away with is scandalous. What Labor's engaged in, what they've signed off on, will be remembered. We are talking about people going to jail for the rest of their lives, and a minister won't even get up and speak about it—disgraceful.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,32,2
"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2018-06-28,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (18:01):  I can only concur with the views expressed by Senator Rhiannon. I want people to understand that this is the only opportunity. The committee stage of this legislation is the only opportunity that this Senate has to scrutinise the 280 amendments across the two separate pieces of legislation that are before us this afternoon that the government and Labor have agreed on. The reason for that is that the coalition and Labor refused to support a Greens attempt to refer these pieces of legislation, plus the 280 amendments, to an inquiry by the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee.


Now, it's true that the bills as originally drafted, sloppy and rank with overreach, were examined at a parliamentary committee, the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence and Security, but, of course, that's a closed shop between the coalition and Labor. The crossbench is frozen out of that. Having said that, the PJCIS process did not provide an opportunity for the Senate to interrogate the 280 different amendments across the two pieces of legislation that we're debating this evening.


What we've got, as Senator Rhiannon quite rightly points out, are provisions that will have a chilling effect on our democracy, on freedom of speech, on press freedom and on media freedom in this country. We have a government refusing to allow for proper scrutiny, and being backed to the hilt by the Labor Party in refusing to allow for that proper scrutiny. The chilling effect is important here, because journalists will need to regularly ask themselves whether a story that they intend to write or publish might fall foul of the provisions in this legislation. When they're facing life imprisonment if they get it wrong—or at least the potential for life imprisonment if they get it wrong—it would be entirely understandable if they decided to err on the side of caution. That is exactly what this government is trying to do. I have no doubt that that is the intent of the relevant ministers who have oversight of this legislation. The cabinet, who presumably all supported and certainly will all support this legislation when it's voted on in this place, have the intent to significantly curtail the media's capacity to hold the government to account and report on stories that are embarrassing to the government. Of course, the Labor Party knows that it will be in government again one day and that, when it's in government, it will benefit from this chilling denial of press freedom.


I agree with Senator Rhiannon. Here we are, it's ticking into the evening and almost no-one's in the chamber. The minister's not answering questions on legislation that, in some parts, has the capacity to impose sentences of life imprisonment on people who are found to have contravened the incredibly broad provisions of this legislation. It's massive overreach, and it continues the blind lock step of the coalition and Labor marching this country down the road to authoritarianism. I was at Bernard Collaery's press conference today. He was asked whether he thought Australia was a police state. He didn't hesitate; he said yes. And he's right. We're a surveillance state. We're a police state. And we're being marched down the road towards authoritarianism. More than 200 pieces of legislation that erode fundamental rights, freedoms and liberties in this country have passed through state and territory parliaments in the last 20 years, and that's been done, in zombie lock step, by the Labor Party and coalition parties.

As foreshadowed in my speech on second reading, this amendment seeks to amend the Intelligences Services Act to extend the oversight role of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security to cover the operations of those agencies. The PJCIS has undertaken some very valuable work. We are, indeed, today debating outcomes of its two latest advisory reports, but the joint committee is presently explicitly excluded from reviewing the operations of the agencies they are meant to oversee.


I have previously spoken about the importance of a well-resourced and capable intelligence community to protect Australia's national interests, and the importance of improving parliamentary oversight of those agencies as they are given more resources, more powers and more responsibilities.


The legislation before the Senate today is another part of the progressive expansion of the roles and responsibilities of the Australian intelligence community. Significantly, by creating new offences related to foreign interference and influence, this legislation will inevitably draw the Australian Federal Police as well as ASIO into the investigation and scrutiny of broad mainstream political activity. We live in a globalised world. Foreign connections are ubiquitous. That is the context of this legislation and the criminal offences it will create. This legislation does represent a significant shift in the relationship between these agencies and broad political activity. In that context, it is essential that we look again at the control and accountability mechanisms that relate to our national security agencies.


In my first speech to the Senate last December, I highlighted the need for parliamentary scrutiny of our intelligence community to extend beyond questions of administration and finance to matters of policy and effectiveness and, indeed, operational matters. The PJCIS is currently severely limited in the scope of its oversight role. It is prohibited from reviewing intelligence operations. It is barred from examining sources of information on other operational assistance, operational methods or any particular operations that have been, are being, or are proposed to be, undertaken by the Australian intelligence community. The committee is prohibited from reviewing particular operations or investigations that have been or are being proposed to be undertaken by the Australian Federal Police. These limitations on the extent of parliamentary oversight are very extensive and reflect an underlying bureaucratic mindset that MPs and senators, elected representatives of the people, cannot be trusted with our nation's most sensitive national security information.


This is not an approach taken by other countries, including Australia's intelligence partners. In the United States, high-powered congressional committees have the authority to reach far into operational matters. Those inquiries are accepted by the United States intelligence community as both necessary and appropriate. As I first pointed out to the Senate in December, in Canada, the new National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians is able to review any activity carried out by a department or intelligence agency that relates to national security or intelligence, unless that activity is an ongoing operation and the appropriate minister determines that the review would be injurious to national security. If the appropriate Canadian minister determines that a review would be injurious to national security, he or she must inform the committee of his or her determination and the reasons for it. If the appropriate minister determines that the review would no longer be injurious to national security or the appropriate minister is informed that the activity is no longer ongoing, he or she must inform the committee that the review may be conducted.


The Canadian parliamentary intelligence oversight arrangements have considerable merit. They have been adopted by a so-called Five Eyes partner with an intelligence committee and parliamentary system very similar to our own. The Canadian approach would provide an enhanced framework for the PJCIS oversight of our intelligence agencies, with the added provision that any ministerial veto over review of operational matters should be referred to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security for review and report to both the PJCIS and the Prime Minister.


I confirmed Centre Alliance's intention to pursue amendments to the Intelligence Services Act during the course of the debate in March on the Intelligence Services Amendment (Establishment of the Australian Signals Directorate) Bill 2018. In May, I moved amendments to the Home Affairs and Integrity Agencies Legislation Amendment Bill 2018 to extend PJCIS oversight along the lines of the Canadian practice. Although the Labor opposition have for some time expressed in principle support for expanding the role of the PJCIS, in May the opposition said that they did not have sufficient time to consider the proposal, and they declined to support it. The same amendments to the Intelligence Services Act are now before the Senate. Both the government and opposition have had plenty of time to consider them—rather more time, I might say, than the Senate has had to consider the very large number of amendments to these bills now proposed by the Senate.


The amendments now moved by Centre Alliance adapt the model provided by the Canadian parliamentary oversight legislation, with an additional safeguard provided by our own Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. The amendment removes most, though not all, of the current legislative constraints on the scope of the PJCIS's inquiries. It retains existing prohibitions on reviewing information provided by a foreign government where that government does not consent to the disclosure of that information. It also retains the prohibition on conducting inquiries into individual complaints about the activities of designated intelligence and national security agencies, as those complaints are most appropriately dealt with by IGIS.


There are details of intelligence operations involving sensitive and vulnerable sources that are best held by the smallest number of people with an absolute need to know. Accordingly, the relevant minister may certify that a review by the PJCIS relates to an ongoing operation and that that review would interfere with the proper performance of the relevant body or its function or otherwise prejudice Australia's national security or the conduct of Australia's foreign relations. In this case, the committee will be required to cease or suspend the review. However, the committee may refer the minister's decision to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, who, within 30 days, must review the matter and consider whether the activity is an ongoing operation and whether it is reasonable to conclude that a review by the committee would interfere with the proper performance by the relevant body or its functions or otherwise prejudice Australia's national security or the conduct of Australia's foreign relations. If the Inspector-General advises the committee that the activity is not an ongoing operation or that the review would not cause interference with the proper functioning of the relevant body or otherwise prejudice Australia's national security or the conduct of Australia's foreign relations, the committee may proceed with the review or commence a new review into the activity.


The need for the expansion of the PJCIS's role has been recognised by others in the Senate. Former senator John Faulkner urged the reform. The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Wong, has similarly observed that parliamentarians cannot outsource their duties to ensure the security of our nation and the people who entrust us with the responsibility of governing. If democratically elected MPs and senators cannot be trusted to deal directly with these questions, then something is wrong with the relationship that exists between the intelligence community and the parliament it is ultimately meant to serve.


Centre Alliance moved these amendments without any narrow interest. Neither I nor my colleague, Senator Griff, is a member of the PJCIS—and we don't imagine we will be members any time soon—but we do think expansion of the role and authority of the PJCIS is essential if we are to continue to have full confidence in our national security and intelligence agencies and their relationships with the parliament. I commend this amendment to the Senate.

I thank him also for the thoughtful and constructive approach he has taken to drafting amendments which seek to meet—albeit in a slightly different way than Labor has approached this in the past—our objective, which is to ensure that proper oversight of the activities of the Australian intelligence community is able to be undertaken by parliamentarians.


As Senator Wong indicated earlier in the debate, and as I think is well-known in the chamber, Labor does have a private senators' bill which also goes to these questions. We have previously indicated, and I reiterate it here, that we would welcome constructive engagement with all senators in this place, and certainly with Senator Patrick. But I also invite the government to consider its willingness to look seriously at the mechanisms for oversight of the intelligence community.


In terms of this evening's debate, with regard to the amendments proposed on sheet 8458, these amendments are, in substance, unrelated to the subject matter and objects of the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2017. On this basis, Labor does not support the amendments. As I have indicated, that is not to say that we do not consider this to be a matter worthy of very significant attention in this chamber, and I look forward to cooperating with other senators in coming months.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (18:39):  The Australian Greens will be supporting the amendments put forward by Senator Patrick on behalf of Centre Alliance. We believe that reform of the JSCIS is long overdue. Senator Patrick has gone through a little bit of the history of various reports and attempts to reform that committee. I want to place it very clearly on the record that the Australian Greens have a very clear view that that committee should not be a closed shop between the old parties in this place—the parties that self-describe as the parties of government. There is no rational reason why only members of parties that have some kind of reasonable likelihood of forming government should be able to sit on the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence and Security, and, likewise, there is no rational reason why the crossbench should not have a representative on that committee.


As Senator Patrick has pointed out, the Five Eyes nations have a range of ways in which they scrutinise and provide oversight to their intelligence services and their intelligence communities, and it seems to me and seems to the Australian Greens that our country, Australia, is lagging behind most, if not all, of the other Five Eyes nations in providing capacity for their parliaments—where ultimate responsibility lies—to adequately oversight intelligence operations, intelligence agencies and the intelligence community.

"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2018-06-28,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (18:41):  Just briefly, the government doesn't support the amendments moved by Senator Patrick for two reasons. First, this is not the appropriate vehicle nor the appropriate process by which to progress these amendments. The measures in the espionage and foreign interference bill focus on strengthening existing offences for espionage, treason, sabotage and secrecy; creating new foreign interference offences; and ensuring law enforcement agencies have access to appropriate powers to investigate these serious offences. While some measures in the bill relate to oversight, this bill is not the appropriate place to address integrity and oversight arrangements relating to national security generally. 


More broadly, the amendments proposed by Senator Patrick would fundamentally reshape the role of the PJCIS and its relationship with the intelligence services by extending its remit to include the ability to inquire into the operational activities and decisions made by the intelligence services. Amendments of this gravity should be the subject of careful consideration by the parliament, the public and the intelligence community. It would not be appropriate for these amendments to be introduced through an unrelated bill. For these reasons, the government won't be supporting the amendments.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (18:42):  I didn't intend to speak again and I will only be brief. Did I actually just hear the minister say that amendments like this should be the subject of proper scrutiny by the Senate and the public? After he is jamming through, with Labor's acquiescence, 280 amendments—




Senator Cameron:
  How many?




Senator McKIM:
  There are 280, Senator Cameron—with a complete lack of capacity for the public to have a say directly to this Senate, because of the Labor and coalition parties refusing the Greens' motion to refer these bills to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee for inquiry. So I just wanted to place on the record that the minister's argument is spurious and highly hypocritical.

Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (18:43):  I also wish to respond to the minister and say that at the second reading stage I moved a motion to have these amendments referred to the PJCIS. It would have been a great opportunity for the government and the opposition, who are members of that committee, to actually have a close look at this. I don't understand why that suggestion didn't get your support. I also wish to put on the record that I find your remarks a little bit confusing in the context that an opportunity to refer these amendments for proper scrutiny was there and was not taken.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,32,2
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AG,2018-06-28,"



Senator BARTLETT
 (Queensland) (18:44):  I concur with the comments of the previous two speakers. That excuse—and that's all it is—is one that's used so frequently in here it probably would just save time if there were an auto button on the minister's desk and they could press it and play a recording without having to wear out their vocal cords. The minister has to do a lot of talking tonight, and I appreciate he's done well to maintain his equilibrium in the face of a lot of appropriate but nonetheless persistent questioning.


Another reason given is one that really triggered way too many echoes for me—that is, this isn't the appropriate vehicle to put forward this amendment. I've heard that used a number of times when a perfectly appropriate amendment is put forward to address something completely valid. It's just a matter of ensuring more comprehensive and adequate scrutiny of these government agencies that we have already given absolutely enormous, unprecedented and wide-ranging powers to with almost no way of assessing how they are being used in any meaningful way. And even those members who are part of the closed shop of the existing Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security are limited in what they can see. As Senators Patrick and McKim have already outlined, our country falls way behind our allies with regard to parliamentary scrutiny.


The Greens and others on the crossbench don't accept this false argument that somehow the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security has to consist only of the so-called parties of government—and that phrase in itself shows just what sort of mentality we have here. It's not just a confidential club; it's a secret club, and it's something that the rest of the parliament is locked out of. There is a role for the parliament, as a representative of the people, to ensure that the executive, the government, the state and the agencies of the state actually use the extraordinary powers they are given appropriately. There is any amount of evidence—we won't take the time of going through it now—about how those powers haven't been used appropriately in the past.


The other fact is the committee has had a non-government member on it. We know that Andrew Wilkie, an Independent MP, was a member of that committee from 2010 to 2013. That was at the time there was a hung parliament and, as part of agreements reached, he got the completely appropriate agreement to be on that committee. And, of course, he's also a very well-qualified person to be on that committee. Not only did we have someone who wasn't part of the so-called parties of government; he wasn't part of a party. But it was okay for him to be on the committee; the sky didn't fall in.


The great irony, of course, is that Mr Wilkie was the victim of inappropriate leaking when he was working for an intelligence agency. A report that he wrote when he was a systems analyst for the Office of National Assessments somehow found its way to Andrew Bolt. Andrew Bolt had this document and, quite appropriately, thought he'd write about it. For some reason or another there's some problem with letting people from non-government parties onto this committee. I don't know why—we can't be trusted or something; we might reveal things. That Independent member, when he became an ex-worker for an intelligence agency for the government, had something leaked against him—and quite obviously leaked against him purely for political purposes. So that single incident itself shows that there needs to be proper scrutiny of the activities of these agencies. This is just one more example.


Time and time again we've seen, over decades now, legislation after legislation that gives more and more powers to these agencies. Senator McKim earlier moved for a sunset clause. Never once has there been legislation to wind back any of it, even a little bit, not even those powers from the 1950s, from the Cold War. They've never been wound back; it's always more and more and more. We won't even put a sunset clause on them, so they just continue to expand. So we now have these powers where pretty much everybody in the country is under this mass surveillance regime, with all sorts of risks and all sorts of penalties and major jail risks for all sorts of potential activities. But the agencies themselves? Zero scrutiny. A small attempt like this—and, frankly, let's not forget this is a pretty minor amendment; it's not like we're wanting to bug ASIO while they're bugging us. It's a just little bit more proper and broader scrutiny, and being able to dig a bit deeper about what's going on. And yet all we hear is, 'This isn't the appropriate vehicle; this isn't the appropriate time.' Well it would be good if we could at least get a commitment to an in-principle agreement, but we can't even get agreement about getting a national ICAC for scrutiny about what the government itself and the politicians—all of us—are doing, so to expect to get proper scrutiny of intelligence agencies is probably asking a bit much. But there is a growing desire amongst the Australian community for growing scrutiny of parliamentarians and government, and that has to include those agencies that have the greatest powers of all to scrutinise the citizenry.

In my speech in the second reading debate, I expressed regret that the PJCIS did not examine the question of official secrecy and media and public access to government information from a wider perspective. It is vital that, whenever the parliament seeks to clamp down on unauthorised disclosures of government information—and there are reasonable grounds to replace what are antiquated provisions of the Crimes Act—we should also consider measures that would make government more transparent and assist the role of media and citizens in accessing information under the law.


Freedom of information must always be a counterpoint to official secrecy. Freedom of information provides the lawful means for citizens, the media and parliamentarians to obtain access to what is, at the end of the day, information that belongs to the public. I might point out that, in circumstances where we routinely find that the government doesn't respond properly to orders for production, FOI is an important tool for the parliament.


The National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2018 significantly tightens control over government information, especially classified national security information. It will increase the penalties on those persons within government who disclose classified information without authority. It will probably make it more likely that a person who leaks information without authority will be caught and prosecuted. It does provide protection for persons making disclosures of information to oversight bodies such as the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and the Ombudsman.


It significantly improves the Commonwealth's power to control and protect classified information. But it does absolutely nothing to improve the ability of the public, the media or, indeed, this parliament to secure the release of government information through FOI, including through independent review of the claimed classified status of information. For some of you who may not be aware of it, sometimes when claims are made about a document being secret, or even top secret, those matters can ultimately be determined by the courts, and have been in the past. Indeed, in certain circumstances the High Court has overridden the government's claim of material being classified.


To remedy this significant deficiency Centre Alliance is moving this amendment which is designed to significantly improve the effectiveness of Australia's freedom of information laws. The amendments insert a new schedule 7 into the bill, which would amend the Freedom of Information Act, the Australian Information Commissioner Act and the Archives Act. These changes are designed to address the considerable dysfunction that has developed in our freedom of information system, which is now characterised by chronic bureaucratic delay and obstruction, unacceptably lengthy review processes, often prohibitive expenses for the applicants, increased preparedness by agencies to incur very large legal expenses to oppose the release of information and the deliberate undermining by the current government of the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner.


I'm happy to advise that after a year and a half of fighting the government to try and find out what the ISDS costs were under FOI—I've been through a process of obstruction—in this instance I managed to win. The Information Commissioner ordered the government to disclose information to me. Indeed, when that occurred, the government challenged it in the AAT. There are significant legal expenses involved for the Commonwealth to challenge the Information Commissioner's ruling. Fortunately for me, I had some assistance from some willing solicitors and barristers. And I now find, thankfully, that the Commonwealth has pulled out of the proceedings. They've decided to surrender in that instance. Accessing information under FOI can be quite a lengthy and difficult process.


The specific changes I propose in this bill include requiring the government to fill all three offices of the Australian Information Commissioner—the Privacy Commissioner, the Freedom of Information Commissioner and the Information Commissioner. Since 2014, even though, in my view, the legislation—it's Labor's legislation—makes it very clear that there should be three commissioners, since 2014 we have been left with only one. That certainly has frustrated people in getting access to information.


I also propose allowing FOI applicants to elect to have their matters bypass the Information Commissioner, who can take more than a year to make a decision on a controversial issue, and instead take it to the AAT. Another benefit of these amendments includes granting an FOI applicant the right to switch a review into the AAT without charge in the event that the Information Commissioner takes, or indicates that he will take, more than 120 days to make a decision. Going to the AAT involves a cost. I think it costs more than $800 to make an application. We shouldn't put citizens in a situation where they have to pay because we simply haven't resourced the Information Commissioner properly.


This amendment also seeks to prevent agencies from making submissions to the FOI decision reviews that have not been advanced by the agency in its internal decision-making, so they can't switch exemptions halfway through a review as often happens now. In effect, this allows the agency to re-make a decision halfway through a review—something that's not normally permitted in other merit reviews. What happens is that the department advances an exemption, you get a significant way through an information commissioner's review and the government realises it's on shaky ground, so it switches the exemption. The normal principle in any merit review is that once you hand responsibility for the review to a commissioner the agency is not allowed to re-make the decision. The decision is now in the hands of a commissioner or some sort of review body.


Next is preventing the Information Commissioner from making a FOI decision if he or she does not hold the legal qualifications required of the FOI commissioner. When Timothy Pilgrim was in office—and I have great respect for Timothy Pilgrim; this is not a criticism of him—he made FOI decisions, for a number of years, when he did not possess a legal degree. The act made it very clear that, if you were a FOI commissioner, you had to have a law degree. You had to understand how to read case law and how precedence worked. We have a situation now where there is a loophole in the act that says the Information Commissioner can make FOI decisions and doesn't have to have a legal qualification.


Another thing I'd like to see happen, which we're attempting to do in this amendment, is the prevention of agencies from publishing information released under FOI until 14 days after the applicant has received his or her copy of the information. That's designed to encourage journalists to use FOI properly and not have a story gazumped by the agency simply publishing FOI information immediately after a two-year fight to get access to information. That's an improvement specifically targeted at journalism.


Next is requiring an agency to publish its external legal expenses for each information commission or AAT FOI matter that has concluded. I know of one person who has been involved in a FOI matter that cost half a million dollars—I correct myself; it is an Archives-related matter, seeking access to archived information. The government spent half a million dollars trying to prevent someone getting access to archived data; the matter is still ongoing. We should at least get agencies to publish the amount of money that they're spending on legal costs in opposing citizens getting access to information. Having said that, there is an amendment in there that would apply to legal expenses in circumstances where someone makes an application to the National Archives.


This is a comprehensive array of reforms that reflects the practical experience of journalists, researchers and members of parliament seeking information under FOI or, indeed, the Archives Act. Passage of these measures would significantly enhance the operation of our freedom of information laws. They would be of benefit to journalists. As I suggested, there would also be a benefit to members of parliament. They would benefit any citizen seeking access to FOI laws.


Some senators may say that these matters should be addressed elsewhere, but Centre Alliance is of the view that they are very appropriately addressed here, in the context of a bill that will otherwise enhance the government's control of official information. Senators have the same opportunity to consider these amendments as they do any other amendments to this bill. However, it should be said that these amendments are less complex and more unambiguously beneficial than many of the provisions in this very complex legislation that we're dealing with tonight. Centre Alliance commends these amendments to the Senate and commits to continue to pursue comprehensive FOI reforms and improvements at every opportunity.
