"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-06-14,"—I am continuing my speech on the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Tax Reduction and Improved Depreciation Arrangements) Bill 2006, and I was at the question of whether effective marginal tax rates can be reduced to no more than the top income tax rate. The sustained high-powered campaign to lower the top tax rate of 47 per cent applying to our best-off Australians contrasted starkly with the lip-service given to addressing the much higher effective tax rates applying to our worst-off Australians. So I posed a challenge to the Treasurer: would he work to make sure that no Australian would suffer an effective marginal tax rate greater than the new top tax rate of 45 per cent? A challenge is easy, but what would it cost? Could it be done? These questions are very big ones that have no simple answers. They are also ones which have not received a great deal of attention.
Effective marginal tax rates of up to 70 per cent apply to low-income Australians when income tax and the removal of welfare are combined when moving from welfare to work. High effective marginal tax rates affect the willingness to work. Reducing EMTRs competes as a policy objective with other important objectives. Targeting of assistance to those most in need was the major objective of family assistance reform through the years of the last Labor government. Those reforms dramatically increased the adequacy of assistance to low-income families but also produced much of the EMTR problem facing us today.
The present government has both exacerbated and relieved the problem to some degree. Creating part B of the family tax benefit stacked another income test onto those already faced by women re-entering the workforce. Reducing taper rates reduced EMTRs for some and extended assistance further up the income range. However, it also increased EMTRs for middle-income families. Very high EMTRs have been reduced as the objective of unemployment assistance has changed. They had to come down to encourage part-time and casual work amongst recipients. At the same time, if they came down too far, unemployment assistance could become some sort of income supplement for low-income workers. That has not been the traditional role of unemployment assistance.
The problem to be addressed is how to produce lower EMTRs without compromising the other equally important objectives of family assistance and low-income support. EMTRs are produced by the overlapping of income tests on government payments, subsidies and income tax rates. The more payments, subsidies and rebates a family attracts, the higher the EMTRs. There are not only income tax rates but also a low-income rebate and a Medicare levy that both modify the tax rate and have phase-out ranges that can add to EMTRs. Family assistance is broken into two parts which overlap and inevitably produce higher EMTRs when combined with tax rates, levies and rebates. Families with youth allowance dependants face further stacking when the family income test for youth allowance is added. Other families may have further complications due to public housing subsidies.
Research on how many people are facing high EMTRs is surprisingly thin on the ground. A NATSEM report by Gillian Beer in 2002 gave an idea of the considerable scale of the problem. She found that high proportions of families with children, and especially sole parent families, faced high EMTRs. In 2000, David Ingles from the ANU mapped out three approaches to EMTR reduction: harmonisation, integration and separation. The harmonisation approach essentially tries to ameliorate the existing system by adjusting income tax and income tests to avoid the most serious conjunctions of withdrawal rates. In terms of fundamental reform, Ingles canvassed integration of tax and income tests. Separate means tests for welfare payments would be removed and replaced with special tax scales for those in receipt of payments. However, he warns that the differing definitions of income used for income tax and for welfare may be too far apart for integration to be feasible except as a very long term goal.
The opposite approach is to aim for full separation of the tax and welfare regimes. One suggested model involved adding family tax benefits, youth allowance and rent assistance to basic income support payments in a family and subjecting them to a single withdrawal rate. A tax credit would be provided to ensure that no tax was paid until all income support and additional payments were exhausted under the income test. This would ensure that the family was subject to only the taper on the income test for payments until they ceased and then taper on the tax credit plus the underlying tax rate.
All of these approaches involve quite radical restructuring of tax and welfare systems, but government action to date has just modified EMTRs to some degree through reduced tapers and tax rates. Without fairly fundamental recasting of tax and welfare interaction, any further adjustments to the existing system may tend to shift the EMTRs to another income or benefit group and, like squeezing a balloon, it will not get smaller but just bulge out in a different place.
However, having said all that, we still remain with the impossible situation where the community, media, business and many members of parliament have squealed loudly about the high top tax rate, wanting to bring it down from 47 per cent, and yet that same squealing is not going on for low- and middle-income Australians who face high effective marginal tax rates of 70 per cent or more. Therefore, you have to ask the question: why won’t the Treasurer address that issue and ensure that no Australian pays a tax rate greater than the highest top tax rate, whether it is an effective marginal tax rate or the nominal rate?
The Democrats have argued that Australia’s tax-free threshold is too low. Australia’s income tax free threshold is $6,000, and it has remained unchanged since 2000. It is not indexed and is therefore constantly losing real value. If it had been indexed since 2000, it would now be well over $7,200. Had the 1980 personal threshold of $4,041 kept pace with earnings, it would now be over $14,200.
Working Australians have a much lower tax free threshold than the three million senior Australians who enjoy a tax-free threshold well over $20,000. People cannot live on $6,000 a year. Australia’s welfare floor is around $12,500, calculated as the minimum income required for basic subsistence. There is no justification for taxing the income of someone earning that amount. However, the budget papers indicate that, once the proposed low-income rebate has been taken into account, a person whose income is below $25,000 per annum has an effective tax-free amount of $10,000 per year, excluding Medicare. I am glad that the Treasurer has recognised the long and consistent campaign by the Democrats for the effective tax-free threshold to be lifted.
The tax-free threshold is supplemented by a numerous and distorting array of tax exemptions, concessions and deductions, plus a myriad of welfare measures. Raising the tax-free threshold significantly should be accompanied by base-broadening measures. Revenue advantages would be matched by a simplification of the tax act.
Australian governments regularly benchmark themselves against the 30 countries of the OECD. Australia’s tax-free threshold compares poorly with the OECD. With the caveat that it is difficult to readily compare tax systems in the OECD, the data indicates that Australia’s current $6,000 tax-free threshold is less than half the OECD sample average of $15,400.
There is support for the Democrats’ position from many sources. However, the Minister for Finance and Administration, Senator Minchin, in answer to questions in the Senate, recently said that the government will not raise the tax-free threshold because of the cost. Apparently it would cost over $35 billion over four years if the tax-free threshold were raised to $12,500, which is roughly the poverty line.
The Democrats’ answer has been that raising the tax-free threshold significantly is a necessary equity and work-motivating reform that should be phased in over a number of years and that it can be funded from the surplus and base broadening. You either have a meaningful tax-free threshold or you do not, and $6,000 is not meaningful. Those who argue that there should be no tax-free threshold but instead tax credits and benefits to low-income Australians probably have a stronger case than those who argue that the tax-free threshold should remain at $6,000. We do not take that point of view. We think that the tax-free threshold should continue to rise, and rise not only meaningfully but consistently with the CPI.
Unlike the superannuation proposals, there is no significant public or media interest in the income tax cut bills. Indeed, the Labor opposition did not even take up its full 20 minutes in speaking to this bill in yesterday’s second reading debate. The ACTU, whilst it has been strongly critical of the gross benefits accruing to high-income earners in comparison to low- and middle-income earners, is not getting a matching kind of response from the Labor Party, which accepts that these income tax cut bills will pass and should pass without much concern. Both the media and the public regard the bills as a done deal.
The problem with the tax cuts package is the excessive generosity to better-off Australians compared with the benefits—which do exist—that are accorded to lower-income Australians. However, we Democrats do not have the time, the opportunity or the resources to develop a comprehensive alternative package. You need extensive access to modelling and research capabilities. Given the Senate numbers, it would be a futile waste of time for us to put up a complete alternative package.
Given our long and consistent support for raising the real income of low-income Australians, despite the inordinate largesse to high-income Australians, it is difficult for the Democrats to oppose a tax cuts package that delivers an effective $10,000 tax-free threshold and raises the disposable income of persons earning $10,000 by 3.8 per cent and persons earning $25,000 by 4.6 per cent. The Democrats do not consider the income tax package as a whole to be worthy of outright condemnation, because there are sufficient equity and positive policy elements within it concerning low- and middle-income Australians, and certainly if the government had left the highest tax level at $125,000 and the rate at 47 per cent then there would be very little room for criticism.
However, the Democrats will attempt to amend this package. We do criticise the policy choices and priorities made by the government. Our greatest concern is that the Treasurer, despite his obvious intellect and abilities, and the Treasury, despite their obvious intellect and abilities, have failed to come up with a meaningful, long-term tax reform plan. That is a matter that has been the subject of great commentary by the business and academic community, who are quite damning, in many respects, of the failure of the Treasurer and the Treasury to match the sort of long-term planning they did with respect to indirect tax with an equivalent long-term view for direct tax.
The Democrats suggest that, with respect to this package, there are only two possibilities for amendments that we can have a look at. The first would be a small tax-free threshold rise or the second would be a partial indexation of the tax rate. If we raised the tax-free threshold to $7,500, it is estimated that it would cost $8½ billion over four years, less the saving from keeping the top rate at $125,000 and 47 per cent. That would save $5.05 billion. So the net cost would be $3.45 billion over four years, which we think is easily affordable in the context of the forward estimates. As an alternative, partial indexation can be revenue neutral and is perhaps easier to sell. Organisations like the ACCI strongly support indexation of tax scales. Indexing the present $6,000 tax-free threshold would cost only $2.4 billion over four years, less the saving from keeping the top rate at $150,000 and 47 per cent, which would also cost $2.4 billion. So the net cost would be zero. Both propositions benefit all taxpayers, although the benefit is greater for low-income taxpayers.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (PERSONAL TAX REDUCTION AND IMPROVED DEPRECIATION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2006-06-14,"—I rise today to comment specifically on the government’s Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Tax Reduction and Improved Depreciation Arrangements) Bill 2006. As I indicated on the night of the budget, the Greens do not support the tax cuts. We think that the surplus would have been much better spent on addressing the significant challenges facing the Australian economy. The Treasurer did not mention these challenges in the budget and even failed to recognise them in the small print in the budget papers. These challenges are the significant impact on the Australian economy that is going to occur, and is already occurring, because of climate change and the need to address energy security issues—in particular, oil proofing the country—in an age where we are going to see not only oil depletion but also much more expensive oil supplies coming into Australia as we shift to being a net importer of oil within the next 10 to 15 years.
The Greens have also said that we believe that this squandering of the surplus—which is how we would see what the government has chosen to do with these tax cuts—is basically taking away a future income stream from government which is going to be challenged by the costs of infrastructure and service delivery to an ageing population. All around the country, people complain of the inadequacy of health services, in particular. They complain about the ongoing costs of providing accessible, high-quality health care in rural and regional Australia—and that is certainly significant in my state of Tasmania—and yet we find the government feels that the surplus is such and the infrastructure is such that it can give away personal tax cuts.
I think it is interesting that the budget has virtually died without a trace. Within weeks of the budget, the ‘Manna from Heaven’ and the ‘Rivers of Gold’ headlines have disappeared. What has replaced that in the public debate is the energy crisis, which I talked about in my budget reply speech. Since the budget, the Prime Minister has discovered climate change in an attempt to legitimise his rush to embrace nuclear power, and we now have a global discussion occurring in relation to the new nuclear club. We have discussions every day about the ongoing cost of fuel. The issue that is the focus in the business pages is the government’s so-called reforms to the fuel taxes and how fuel is delivered around the country. So the issues that the Greens identified on budget night as being the main threats to the budget and as being the areas in which there needed to be forward planning are precisely the issues that are rushing onto the agenda. Meanwhile, the government’s tax cuts have been lost out there in the ether.
Whilst the government might consider that it will get some benefit from votes in next year’s election because of the tax cuts, I doubt that that will be the case—because, for all that it was dressed up to be about middle Australia, these tax cuts were for the rich. This has been a budget for rich Australians, and it has exacerbated the gap between the rich and the poor. Any improvement in the lower- to middle-income bracket is completely absorbed by the increased costs of trying to access services, whether they be health services, education services, public transport services or child care. You name it, everything has become increasingly more expensive, and the tax cuts will not offset the increased costs of trying to access those services.
I think the issue of the government’s loss of a revenue stream into the future is incredibly serious. The entire budget is predicated on the assumption that corporate profits will continue into the future without any kind of interruption. Those corporate profits rely particularly on the mineral boom continuing—not being cyclic, as has always been the case in the past—because of the insatiable demand for minerals from India and China. That assumes that those economies have the capacity to grow indefinitely. It is again a failure to recognise the ecological limits. If China and India continue to grow at the rate that they are currently growing—and as is predicted—their demand for raw materials will be such that there will be huge ecological devastation around the planet in trying to fuel this particular growth. What is more, the inequities in terms of trade between the United States and China will destabilise markets into the future.
My great concern here is that the whole Australian economy has been simplified under the Howard government. Rather than being strengthened, it has been weakened. We have gone back to being, as I said in my budget reply speech, and as Doug Cameron described, a quarry, a farm and a nice place to visit. The manufacturing sector has virtually been lost, and the tertiary sector is tiny and struggling as a result of having its research and development funding strangled. The opportunity was here with the surplus to invest heavily in the research and development that would build us a more sophisticated economy, particularly in the tertiary sector, but instead it is delivering tax cuts.
We have already seen some of the great technological breakthroughs in Australia going offshore to China. We have a situation where the Treasurer gave a $52 million subsidy to car manufacturers in Australia without tying it to fuel efficiency. We had a recent discussion about how well the free trade talks are going with China, and there was even some speculation in the estimates that Australia might be able to export cars to China, but there was no apparent recognition that the Chinese have set higher vehicle fuel efficiency standards than Australia. We will not be exporting cars to China, not just because they can produce theirs more cheaply but because they have set higher fuel efficiency standards than we have in our own country. We need to wake up to the fact that the Chinese are constantly building competitive advantage into the sophisticated environmental management technologies of the next century.
The same applies to renewable energy technologies. China have set a 15 per cent target for renewables. As a result, we have Dr Shi, Australia’s first solar billionaire, making his money in China, because it is in China that he can roll out the photovoltaic technology that he learned how to establish at the University of New South Wales. Meanwhile, Professor Martin Green’s program at the University of New South Wales is underfunded.
What does that say about this budget strategy, which is to rake in the dollars from digging things up and sending them offshore? Having got those dollars, instead of investing in research and development to address climate change—the big security threat of this decade—and building a more sophisticated economy through research and development, and rolling out those technologies and transferring those jobs—as the Germans have done, as the Japanese are doing and as the Chinese are doing—what do we then do? We say: ‘No, any money that we’ve got to invest in R&D we’re going to invest in more digging up. This time, we’re going to invest it more heavily in the coal industry because we hope that, by sending our research dollars to carbon capture and storage and pumping carbon dioxide back down holes in the ground, we can continue digging it up, with business as usual.’
In terms of the uranium debate, we have precisely the same thing. We have a strategy of digging it up. But this time it is even better, because not only are we digging it up but we are filling up the holes with the waste we get back. That is an incredibly sophisticated strategy: Australia becoming the nuclear waste dump of the world and generating income from the storage of high-level nuclear waste which will be sent back to us from any number of countries around the world! That includes America—and President Bush. At the moment, he cannot get domestic approval in the United States for the storage of high-level nuclear waste, so what could be better than turning to his good friend Prime Minister John Howard and asking if he can dig a hole in the ground and store the high-level nuclear waste here for a fee? Australia is continually building budgets on digging it up, sending it away and, in the case of nuclear, taking back the waste.
This budget was an opportunity to use the surplus to invest in the new economy, and it has failed to do so. There is nowhere near the investment that is needed in solar thermal technology, for example. For all the talk about nuclear being needed for energy security, nothing could be further from the truth. The CRC on coal technology in Australia released a report saying solar thermal could produce all of Australia’s base load power using 37 square kilometres of land and could be cost competitive with coal within seven years. Why aren’t we investing in that technology, which would then be taken up in a huge way by countries such as China, and in other parts of the world where they are desperate for base load energy to replace fossil fuels? It makes absolutely no sense that Australia’s greatest resources, our huge area and our sunshine, are not being recognised as being a competitive advantage.
Instead, we are predicating a budget surplus future on the basis of our ongoing capacity to dig up minerals and send them overseas on the assumption that the minerals boom will last forever. If that is not a high-risk strategy for a budget, I do not know what is. We also have the ageing population. We have to deal with the fact that fewer and fewer Australians will be paying the taxes to keep a larger number of people who are living longer and requiring not only health and transport services but all the community services that provide a reasonable quality of life for people in their old age.
From the Greens’ perspective, we are seeing a squandering of the surplus on the basis of a risk that we can continue to dig up minerals. It is a failed strategy for our future and one that does not benefit low- and middle-income earners, who overwhelmingly would rather have better access to health, education, public transport and child care today rather than a few dollars in their pockets which do not go towards meeting those needs. In the committee stages of this bill I intend to move an amendment to address the issue of building some sort of real energy security in Australia. We have had some discussion of it since the budget, but there has been no discussion of the practical measures that could be taken to reduce energy demand in Australia. That is the simplest and cheapest way of dealing with increasing energy challenges.
Earlier this year, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage moved the Energy Efficiency Opportunities Bill, which required companies using more than 0.5 petajoules of energy per annum to engage in a mandatory energy efficiency audit. I thoroughly support that. That is precisely the way we should be going in a whole range of areas. But the government has failed in that because all it requires is that those companies conduct the audit. It does not require companies to implement the findings of those audits. At the time that bill was being debated I moved an amendment saying that the companies should not only identify the energy efficiency measures but be required to implement them with a payback period of two years initially, phasing into a period of five years, so that we got an upgrade in Australia’s business community and so that we became much more energy efficient. If you are serious about energy efficiency and security, that is what you do.
When the government moved for accelerated depreciation in the budget it was a clear opportunity to tie that accelerated depreciation to energy efficiency. In the committee stage of this bill I will be moving an amendment which does what the government had an opportunity to do with the Energy Efficiency Opportunities Bill. Hopefully, they will rethink it. If we are going to give business a windfall for accelerated depreciation, why should those businesses which are the most energy thirsty, the energy guzzlers on the grid, get a windfall benefit without having to take some responsibility for upgrading plant and equipment? As a result, that is what I will be moving, to make sure that the accelerated depreciation provisions do not apply to these energy guzzlers unless they implement the findings of the mandatory audit that the government now requires them to conduct. That is a first step and a practical step. It will be a test of the government’s so-called new commitment to climate change and to reducing our energy footprint.
The whole issue of climate change is not seriously on the government’s agenda. In the estimates just recently we had a situation where I asked the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Senator Coonan whether they were looking at the national security ramifications of climate change for Australia in the Asia-Pacific region, just as the Pentagon has done for the United States. Senator Coonan had difficulty understanding the question. She asked several times and she could not understand what an environmental matter might have to do with national security. Today the Lowy Institute released their report on the national security ramifications of climate change. Only a few months ago I moved a motion asking the government to recognise environmental refugees and to work to have it incorporated into the UN convention on refugees. The government once again rejected that. I am not prepared to accept that the government even have climate change on their radar, except to invoke the words when they want to use it to cover another agenda, like being part of President Bush’s nuclear club, which is the most recent invocation of the issue of climate change.
Whether the government likes it or not, climate change, energy security and oil depletion are the big challenges to Australia in this century. They are the challenges which will rock the budget and knock it right out of the water when we have major and extreme weather events occurring because of climate change. They are going to be the issues when the next generation of Australians look back and see that the government squandered a massive surplus, failed to recognise how the world had significantly changed and failed to take advantage of Australia’s competitive opportunity at this point of significant change to embrace renewable energy and solar technologies and to go out and create a sophisticated economy that helps Australia, is globally responsible and demonstrates global leadership.
That is why the Greens are opposing the tax cuts. That is why I will be moving to require companies to do what is the right and responsible thing at this time. If they want the benefits of accelerated depreciation then they can take the responsibility for implementing the energy efficiency measures that will begin the process of focusing business on what needs to happen in Australia to address climate change.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (PERSONAL TAX REDUCTION AND IMPROVED DEPRECIATION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Watson, Sen John",LP,2006-06-14,"—The Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Tax Reduction and Improved Depreciation Arrangements) Bill 2006 is a very important piece of legislation because it continues the government’s commitment to being the responsible manager of the Australian economy. This bill takes an excessive tax burden off people’s backs. The steady management of our economy by the government will be one of the most enduring legacies that we can leave to the Australian people, but it is important that we do not rest on our laurels and that we continue to improve and to reform aspects of legislation when appropriate. I believe that this bill does just that.
The Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Tax Reduction and Improved Depreciation Arrangements) Bill has several purposes. Obviously, the primary purpose is to reduce the personal income tax rates for 2006-07. I will note here that while Australia’s tax regime is quite competitive when compared to the OECD average, for example, our top marginal tax rates have for a long time been amongst the highest in the OECD. This bill reduces our top marginal tax rates towards the OECD average, which has to be a good thing in retaining workers here in Australia and attracting others back to our shores who have left because of excessive taxation. At the same time, the bill manages to reduce the margin and increase the thresholds of most of the other brackets, which is a good thing. I think this is a fantastic achievement and one that the Treasurer is to be commended on.
The bill also seeks to increase the low-income tax offset for 2006-07. It will decrease the amount of Medicare levy paid by low-income senior Australians in 2006-07. As more and more Australians retire, this measure will become more and more valued. It will also increase deductions of the decline in value of depreciating business assets under the diminishing value method from 10 May 2006. For me this is perhaps one of the most important measures contained in the bill, and I will deal with that later in my address. The bill amends the Income Tax Rates Act 1986, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, the Fringe Benefits Tax Act 1986 and the Medicare Levy Act 1986 to achieve all these grand results.
The bill is good legislation because it continues the trend of the Howard government towards the redistribution back to taxpayers of the proceeds of increased tax revenues. Taxes, I remind the Senate, have steadily come down under the Howard coalition government. Unfortunately, those on the other side of the chamber might disparage the size of the weekly reductions in tax, but I remind you that when Labor was in government taxes were rising, not falling. An extra $500 in the pocket at the end of the year might not seem much to my colleagues on the other side, but it is far better than being $500 out of pocket.
The effect of this bill will be to increase the disposable income of taxpayers. It will give taxpayers greater control over their own financial situation. I firmly believe that private citizens are far and away the best people to manage their money. We have seen that in the recent amendments to end benefits taxation on superannuation. People under a taxable superannuation arrangement will be able to walk away with their lump sums tax free, and if they invest that money in a pension that will be tax free. In other words, they will not have to have as much capital to enjoy the equivalent level of disposable income. This is another good measure introduced by this government. It will take away the increased complexity associated with calculating termination payments and the like, where you had eight different calculations because of the previous arrangements. As I said, I firmly believe that private citizens are far and away the best people to manage their money. The government has a role, and an important one, but I believe that the Australian public should be trusted with as much of their own money as the government can permit.
By reducing the marginal tax rates and increasing the thresholds, the bill will continue to make Australia’s tax regime one of the most competitive in the world. In our region, the South-East Asian region, this is important. It will help attract and retain the highly skilled workers and professionals that our economy needs. We cannot afford to have our best and brightest move overseas because of our tax laws. I have spoken in other places about some of Australia’s brightest people being leading players in the London financial markets and increasingly occupying such positions in America. We want them back here in Australia using their brains and expertise to advance Australia’s competitive position in the world global economy.
The bill contains increased incentives to undertake additional work or start new businesses, thereby increasing productivity and employment opportunities. Unemployment is already at the lowest rate it has been in 30 years, and this bill will help ensure that unemployment rates stay as low as possible for as long as possible. I worry that if the Labor Party got power at the next election there would be massive unemployment in this country as employers take fright at the consequences for their workplace relations.
The bill also slightly decreases the tax advantages from the negative gearing aspects of property, thereby putting less upward pressure on residential property prices. This is important right across Australia, including in my own state, which has seen property prices skyrocket since 2000 without a comparable increase in the average wage.
I mention again that the bill features a 200 per cent uplift factor on the prime cost basis where people use the reducing balance method of calculating their depreciation or reduction in value. To my mind this is one of the most important aspects of the bill, as it will strongly encourage business investment. It will help farmers and small business. It will help start-up businesses and it will help established industry. In fact, this bill will dramatically help anyone who uses the diminishing value accounting method. It is an option the taxpayers have. Finally, this bill reduces the reliance on personal income tax as a source of tax revenue, and this can be a good thing. I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (PERSONAL TAX REDUCTION AND IMPROVED DEPRECIATION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2006-06-14,"—I would like to acknowledge the speeches of my colleagues on the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Tax Reduction and Improved Depreciation Arrangements) Bill 2006. I am always particularly interested in the contributions of Senator John Watson, who has a reputation for giving very thoughtful speeches in this chamber.
As part of the budget, the government announced personal income tax cuts for all Australian taxpayers. As is well known, from 1 July 2006 the government will reduce the marginal tax rates of 47 and 42 per cent to 45 and 40 per cent respectively. This builds on reductions to lower income rates in earlier years. In addition, the bill will increase the thresholds so that the 15 per cent tax rate will apply up to $25,000, the 30 per cent rate will apply up to $75,000, the 40 per cent rate will apply up to $150,000 and the 45 per cent rate will apply to income above that. The low-income tax offset will be enhanced by increasing it from $235 to $600. It will begin to phase out at $25,000 from 1 July 2006, compared to $21,600 currently. This means that those eligible for the full low-income tax offset will not pay tax until their annual income exceeds $10,000.
Overall, in percentage terms, the greatest tax cuts have been provided to low-income earners. These tax changes will ensure that more than 80 per cent of taxpayers face a top marginal tax rate of 30 per cent or less over the forward estimates period. Let me repeat that: the tax changes will ensure that more than 80 per cent of taxpayers face a top marginal tax rate of 30 per cent or less over the forward estimates period. That is a measure of the achievement of this government and its ability to reduce taxes.
The Medicare levy low-income phase-in rate will be cut from 20 per cent to 10 per cent, ensuring more low-income taxpayers pay a reduced rate of Medicare levy. Further, the bill ensures that senior Australians who are eligible for the senior Australians tax offset will now pay no tax on their annual income of up to $24,867 for singles and up to $41,360 for couples. The fringe benefits tax rate will also be cut to 46.5 per cent by this bill, and this will ensure that the FBT rate aligns with the top marginal tax rate, including the Medicare levy. This package provides $36.7 billion of benefits to taxpayers over four years and reinforces Australia’s reputation as a low-tax country. These tax cuts significantly restructure the personal income tax system to increase disposable incomes, to enhance incentives for participation and to improve Australia’s international competitiveness.
The bill also includes measures that substantially improve Australia’s depreciation arrangements by increasing the diminishing value rate for determining depreciation deductions from 150 per cent to 200 per cent. This change aligns depreciation deductions for tax purposes more closely with the actual decline in the economic value of an asset, which is consistent with the government’s tax policy strategy of ensuring that the tax system has minimal effect on the allocation of resources within the economy. The new depreciation arrangements provide increased incentives for Australian business to invest in new plant and equipment. This will mean that businesses will be better able to keep pace with new technology and remain competitive. Taxpayers will get the benefit of the improved depreciation arrangements for assets acquired on or after 10 May 2006. For the reasons I have outlined above, I commend this bill to the Senate and hope that it can enjoy the support of all senators, because we know that taxpayers are waiting.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2006-06-14,"—I rise to speak on the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2006, which sets out a range of measures consequent upon the so-called Welfare to Work legislation which was pushed through the Senate by the government late last year. The amendments that are today before the Senate really ought not be necessary. If last December the Howard government had finally, after 10 long years, delivered the real welfare reform that this country does need, this bill would not be before the Senate. However, as history will regretfully record, the Howard government did not deliver real welfare reform, it did not tackle the reasons why people are not working and it did not deliver practical solutions. Instead it used its complete control of the parliament and of this chamber to ram through, in a guillotined debate, extreme and incompetent changes. Some of that incompetence has already come home to roost with the need for additional amendments that the government, in its unseemly haste, failed to make in previous bills.
In the context of the new welfare changes, Labor does not oppose this bill, which largely adds some consistency to the botched changes of last year. In particular, it extends some benefits that are open to single parenting payment recipients, such as the 14-week bereavement period, to principal carers who are on the dole. Of course, it would not be necessary to do this if the government were not dumping people onto the dole in the first place. The bill also applies some more consistency across similar groups receiving different payments, such as providing for a seasonal workers preclusion period for students and new apprentices claiming youth allowance. But the bill does not amend that which needs to be amended most. It does not scrap the incompetent welfare changes imposed by this government which leave people with less incentive to work than they had before. It does not scrap the incompetent changes that make it harder for jobless Australians to prepare for work with training and study.
The government’s changes cut income support for some of our most vulnerable Australians and, perhaps even more importantly, reduce the rewards from work. What this government has consistently ignored, and continues to ignore with this bill, is the impact of putting people on lower welfare payments. It is not just the immediate loss of money but the potentially disastrous effect that this will have on people’s ability to work their way out of poverty, which is what we all want. The basic cut to the money in people’s pockets is bad enough—around $20 a week for sole parent families and about $40 a week for people with a disability. Of course, we know that of family groupings in this country the family type most overrepresented in the poverty statistics is that of sole parents.
From 1 July many people who would have received the disability support pension or the single parenting payment will instead be dumped by this government onto Newstart—what is colloquially known as the dole. By 2008-09, according to the government’s own figures, 60,000 people with a disability who would have received the DSP will instead receive the dole, as will 77,000 single parents who would have received the parenting payment. Think of not only these people but also their dependants, the children who will now have to survive on less money and fewer opportunities, making life far more difficult for them. Not only does the dole provide less money for these vulnerable Australians who have many additional expenses associated with their circumstances; Newstart also has a lower free area, higher withdrawal rates and harsher tax treatment than both the disability support pension and the single parenting payment. This will mean that when these Australians are dumped onto the dole by this government they in fact will get to keep less of every dollar earned—an extraordinary proposition if you were serious about moving people from welfare to work.
Last year the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling undertook modelling research on the changes. According to this research, which the government has never tried to refute, if a sole parent with one child does the right thing and works 15 hours a week they will keep only $81 of their earnings while the Howard government claws back the other $114 in tax and loss of social security payments. The effect of this is that this parent will be $91 a week worse off by moving into work under these changes than if they moved into work under the previous arrangements. The government dresses up this policy as welfare to work but in fact takes more out of every dollar earned for this group of people than it would under previous arrangements. It has increased the disincentive and reduced the rewards for working. It is hardly a way to try to improve people’s passage from welfare to work.
The Howard government has effectively told sole parents to work for a return of $3.88 an hour, because for their 15 hours work a week they would only be $58 ahead of someone not working. That would be before they pay for the costs of work—things like travel, clothing and so forth. For people with a disability, the situation is even worse because the DSP is not taxable whereas the dole is. According to NATSEM—in the research I referred to earlier—if a person with a disability worked 15 hours a week at the minimum wage they would keep only 25c in every dollar earned while the Howard government would claw back 75c. Such a person would be $122 per week worse off by moving into work under these changes than if they had moved into work under the previous arrangements. Again, this reduces the reward for work and creates greater financial disincentives to move into work. That is this government’s so-called plan. According to the NATSEM research, the Howard government is effectively telling people with a disability to work for a return of $2.27 an hour. Again, that is before the costs of work were taken into account.
Last month, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Minister Kevin Andrews, announced that the government had—and can I say that this was obviously under some pressure—set a threshold for the return from work that a parent would need to gain in order to be required to accept a job. If you missed this announcement, it is not surprising. The announcement was made on the afternoon when the nation’s attention was squarely focused on the East Timor deployment. But when you see the detail of Minister Andrews’s announcement, his motivation for burying it is patent. He decreed that parents would have to accept jobs that left them just $50 a fortnight better off from work, after the costs of working, such as income tax, loss of income support, clothes, travel costs et cetera, had been taken into account. Minister Andrews can complain about Labor’s response to this all he likes, but the maths of his position are quite simple: $50 a fortnight is $25 a week. If parents are being asked to work for 15 hours for a net gain of $25, they are working for an effective return of $1.66 an hour—$1.66 an hour! That is what this government is telling parents they will have to work for under these extreme welfare changes.
It gets even worse for people with a disability, who have no such threshold. The government has not yet indicated why it is that parents are given a threshold of $25 a week—even if it is manifestly inadequate—but no such safeguard, inadequate as it might be, exists for a person with a disability. Under this government’ policy, a person with a disability will have to accept a job with an even lower return than $25 a week. In fact, a person with a disability could very easily end up paying to work under the government’s changes once you take out the costs of working. What greater symbol of incompetence could there be from this government than promising welfare reform but delivering a policy that makes work less desirable than welfare?
In the recent budget, the Treasurer announced around $37 billion worth of tax cuts and a $10 billion surplus, but he could not find a way to fix this mess. He could not find a way to reverse the damage done to incentive by the government’s welfare changes. It is fair to say that the budget did finally provide some limited financial work incentives, largely as a consequence of the government adopting tax proposals that Labor had outlined over the last year. The new effective tax-free threshold of $10,000 for low-income earners does go some way to improving incentives for those moving from welfare to work and parents returning to work. Despite these changes, however, sole parents and people with a disability will still go backwards when the welfare to work measures are implemented in a few weeks, with their effective marginal tax rates increasing by up to 20c in the dollar.
Since this legislation was rammed through in December, the government has also broken its promise to provide an extra 4,000 places in disability open employment services to help people who are already on the disability support pension to move into work. These places will instead go to people with a disability who are on the dole and are further evidence that the Howard government is not serious about helping people who are currently on the DSP move into work. It does seem extraordinary that the government, after complaining about the burgeoning numbers on the disability support pension, has removed one of the significant measures it pointed to when criticised about the lack of support for existing disability support pensioners. Let us not forget that in last year’s budget this was the group that the Treasurer identified as being problematic—the 700,000-odd people on the disability support pension. For political reasons, those people have been grandfathered. They are not subject to mutual obligations, and now the government is removing one of the aspects in last year’s budget that would have assisted some of those people move from welfare to work.
Of course, consistent with their approach to training and their failure to train Australians is the refusal of this government to encourage people who are on welfare to get training so they can get the skills employers need. Once you are on the dole, you cannot satisfy your mutual obligation requirements by studying or training and you cannot access the pensioner education supplement, which is a payment made to try and assist with some of the costs of studying and training.
This is a point that the Minister for Workforce Participation appears to be somewhat embarrassed about, and when this point is raised she protests and suggests that Labor is incorrect in its views. The fact remains that, under her policies, unless you are going to do the most basic entry-level short course via your Job Network provider, you cannot acquit your Newstart obligations by studying or training. The government response is, ‘There’s nothing stopping you from studying or training on top of working 15 hours a week.’ Perhaps this is all you can expect from an out-of-touch government—out of touch after 10 long years in office. But the reality is that if you are a single parent and you are already working 15 hours a week, that will be challenging enough. It will be very difficult for people to find the time and money to study on top of that. Never mind if you want a better job, never mind that this country has a skills crisis—you still cannot study or train. It is an extraordinarily incompetent set of policy measures.
But then the government says, ‘You can acquit your obligations by studying on Austudy.’ Apart from starting off at about $6 a fortnight worse off on Austudy, you have to study full time, meaning no time for private earnings, so in fact you will be even worse off. Under the welfare changes, you cannot substitute an equivalent amount of study for work. You either work part time or study full time. It is disingenuous in the extreme for the government to claim that you can acquit your obligations with study when you would in fact have to do almost twice as much study as work to meet the obligations imposed on you. This is simply an unrealistic choice for sole parents. It is even more dishonest to make the claim that full-time study acquits obligations when it is clear that the financial penalties are so great for somebody participating in full-time study. There is the loss of income through the slightly lower Austudy rate and, more importantly, there is the loss of capacity for additional private earnings. It is a purely theoretical choice, and it is consistent with this government’s failure to make training Australians a priority.
Finally, of course, there is the ridiculously extreme set of changes that the breaching regime imposed by this government will bring. The government’s own figures are that 18,000 Australians under this regime will go without any income support assistance for eight weeks at a time. They will have two months when they receive no income support no matter what they do during that period, even if they remedy whatever breach of obligation they have engaged in. Of the 18,000 people who will be without any income support for two months, only 4,000 to 5,000, on the government’s own figures, will be eligible for what they call ‘financial case management’, that is, emergency payments for food and shelter. The remaining 14,000-odd will have no support whatsoever and will simply have to hope that the community is more charitable than the government. Only those who are classified as ‘exceptionally vulnerable’ or who have ‘vulnerable dependants’ will be eligible for this emergency assistance through financial case management. And perhaps one of the most extraordinary examples of how extreme this government’s approach is on this front is that it does not consider people who are homeless to be vulnerable enough to qualify for this financial case management.
Of course, we do not know exactly how this breaching regime or the financial case management will be implemented because the government has not made the guidelines public. In just under 2½ weeks this regime will come into place. We still have not seen the guidelines in relation to the financial case management nor have we seen final versions of the social security guidelines. Indeed, after the questioning of the department and the minister through the budget estimates process it is hard for anybody to be confident that this policy and these guidelines are well-developed at all. The social security guidelines, as I said, have not been finalised and made public. In less than three weeks we will see the biggest welfare changes this country has seen in over a generation but we are not exactly sure how they will take place. We cannot say for sure how people will be affected or what their entitlements will be because of the government’s decision to place so many of these issues in the guidelines. It is an astonishingly rich blend of arrogance and incompetence from this government.
This bill does nothing to fix these major flaws in last year’s changes. You cannot fix faulty foundations with a thin coat of paint. I want to make it clear: Labor support real welfare reform that goes far beyond moving people from one welfare queue to the dole queue. We believe people who can work should work, and for those who cannot work we should provide care and respect. Instead, this government’s changes make it harder for people on welfare who cannot work and harder still for those who can.
I just want to remind the chamber that when the legislation that this is amending passed through the House in December Judi Moylan MP made a very worthwhile contribution in the House of Representatives. It is a pity that more of the government’s back bench did not take on board some of the changes she was outlining and some of the views she put. She made the point that Labor had been making all along: that there is nothing wrong with imposing obligations on people, obligations that are reasonable and directed to trying to move people from welfare to work. These are things that Labor can support. These are things Labor has argued for. But the core of the government’s changes was a reduction in the income support paid to vulnerable families in Australia. The core of the government’s policy is moving people from one welfare payment to the lower welfare payment. The core of the government’s policy is putting people on the dole.
As Mrs Moylan pointed out, this policy could have been implemented without the reduction in income support. The government could have put in place programs to improve people’s passage from welfare to work. Instead, they went for a cheaper solution: dumping people onto the dole. The most incompetent aspect of this is that, through the effect of tax and welfare withdrawal rates, work will become less financially rewarding under these changes. The government is telling this group of Australians: ‘We are going to pay you less. Worse, we are going to make sure that you keep less of every dollar you earn. But we are still going to call it a Welfare to Work policy.’ What an extraordinary arrogance and what extraordinary incompetence.",SENATE,<title>EMPLOYMENT AND WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE TO WORK AND OTHER MEASURES) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-06-14,"—Like Senator Wong, the Democrats do not oppose the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2006 per se. It does make some improvements here and there to the existing regime. But it must be stated once again that the Democrats strongly oppose the current new regime that goes under the Orwellianly misleading title of ‘Welfare to Work’. It is one of the worst examples in this government’s 10 years in office of the gross abuse of the English language and the deliberately misleading description of government policy and legislation. It is a simplistic slogan of just three words—welfare to work—and that is all the government has used as a fig leaf to try to deflect every single criticism and cover up every single flaw in this highly flawed package. Every single complaint, every single concern that is raised, every single flaw that is pointed out in the Welfare to Work package is simply responded to by government ministers saying, ‘You must be against people getting off welfare and into work,’ and then dismissing the substance of the complaint and the concern. Frankly, I am appalled not only that this government has done that and continues to do it but that to date it has got away with it.
I was extremely disappointed at the end of last year when this legislation was guillotined through the Senate at how little attention was paid to its extremely unjust components by the press gallery and by the wider public. I acknowledge that there were other very serious pieces of legislation also being guillotined at the same time, most notably the workplace relations changes—also going under the Orwellianly misleading title of ‘Work Choices’. And, of course, there was antiterrorism legislation, which at least some of us might suggest could potentially inadvertently increase the risk of terrorism—but I will not go to that separate debate at the moment. There was also the VSU legislation and a range of other bills being guillotined through, so there is perhaps a reason why there was not as much attention to and recognition of what was being done at that time. But as we now move to 1 July, when these changes kick in, there is more awareness of what is involved and there is a recognition that the title ‘welfare to work’ is at best an extremely inadequate description of the legislation and the government’s package or, at worst, a deliberate and flagrant lie.
Under these changes a large number of people will not be assisted from welfare into work. They will be assisted from one form of welfare to a worse form of welfare. In some cases, they will be assisted—as it is called—from welfare to no income at all. That is a negative outcome. There undoubtedly will be people assisted into work through various aspects of this government’s package, but those changes and those areas of assistance are quite able to be provided without the accompanying components that cut the income of many sole parents and many people with disabilities. There is nothing about reducing people’s income that assists them into work. It is quite clear from the overall package that, in total, this was a savings measure for the government under the guise of the feel-good Orwellian title of ‘Welfare to Work’. We actually had a savings measure for government to try to reduce the number of people on the disability pension and parenting payment single and move them onto the lower payment of Newstart.
It is particularly galling now that the federal budget has appeared because, as all senators would know, there was a significant community debate about the need to change our taxation system. We have had some debate on that with the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Tax Reduction and Improved Depreciation Arrangements) Bill 2006. There were a lot of people across the community contributing to that debate on the need for wide-ranging structural tax reform. About the only people who did not contribute to the debate were the senior ministers of the government—even a lot of government backbenchers constructively contributed to it. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister did not contribute to the debate. The Treasurer’s response was to try to squash that debate with a farcical comparative study that was supposedly independently done but basically was written by Treasury anyway to divert attention from the real issues of the need for structural tax reform.
There were a lot of issues and a lot of views put forward across the community. That is understandable and as it should be. It was also interesting how much common ground there was across the community—across the different sections and philosophical viewpoints of the community. There were some key areas of common ground, and one very common area that was mentioned was the need to reduce the tax burden on the lowest income earners through measures such as raising the bottom tax threshold, on which we have just had a debate, so I will not repeat it. Also, almost all comments talked about the need to fix the growing and serious problem of the very high effective marginal tax rates that people pay, particularly low- to middle-income earners.
The Treasurer’s response to this was to say, ‘They call it an effective marginal tax rate but it is not really tax; it is a withholdings test.’ It is like Wayne Swan and Mark Latham’s notorious claim that the family payment was not real. The Treasurer’s income withdrawal supposedly is not real either, according to him. I can assure him that it is very real and it is effectively a tax, which is why people call it ‘an effective marginal tax rate’ when they are calculating its impact.
One aspect of this government’s changes that has not been acknowledged, that needs much greater attention and that categorically is a major disincentive for people to take up work is the fact that, under these laws, many people will have their effective marginal tax rate increased. By pushing them off the disability support pension and parenting payment single and pushing them onto Newstart, you change their income test so that, if they earn small amounts of income, the withdrawal rate is significantly higher. Therefore their effective tax rate is much higher.
These people, who are amongst the lower income earners in our community, are paying tax rates much higher than people who are earning $150,000 a year or more. That is completely unjust; it is also gross inefficiency by people who are talking about the need to make our economy as productive at possible, to get people into the workforce and to meet some of our workforce shortages. This is a massive disincentive. It is a grotesque distortion and it is clearly impacting on the ability of the employment market to fill available jobs. To do all that under the label of ‘Welfare to Work’ is a disgrace. It is appalling that this government is getting away with it. The Democrats will continue to do all we can to make sure that the government does not get away with it in the long term.
We all know that people who have been on welfare for a prolonged period—particularly people who have personal issues such as being the sole parent caring for a child or children or having disabilities, even if they are termed ‘mild’ by a bureaucratic formula—are far more likely to take up part-time work than get into full-time work. That is good. The more people who can be assisted to do that, the better. Of course, it is precisely people taking up part-time or casual work who are most hit by high effective marginal tax rates because they will have those sorts of income levels—a couple of hundred dollars a week—from paid employment and they will have very significant reductions in their overall take-home income as a result of working, particularly when you add the costs of transportation and other costs involved in getting, holding down and performing a job.
The farcical formula that the government is applying in deciding whether or not people will have to take up a job on the basis of how much better off they are each week would be a joke if how it impacts on people’s lives were not so serious. But it is a very serious matter. One of the other very disturbing aspects of this debate and the misleading language that the government has used is the way that it has completely turned the notion of welfare reform on its head. These sorts of changes that the government made have again been excused and promoted under the label of ‘welfare reform’. It is a phrase the government has been using for a while but the agenda has been very different to what the phrase implies and, indeed, what was initially proposed.
Going back quite a number of years—at least five—if you look at what is known colloquially as the McClure report into welfare reform, you see that it is a fairly simple and quite readable report, which is not necessarily the case with many of these sorts of reports. It clearly demonstrated that a major aspect of trying to assist people into work is not just looking at it as a narrow, linear line from one position to another but also recognising that there is a range of barriers to people getting into the workforce and to people basically being able to have opportunity—and that means ‘opportunity’ in the widest sense of the word. Some of those key barriers are housing costs, transportation, access to training and particularly the ability of work to meet the needs of people, whether they are family needs because of being a sole parent or personal needs because of a disability. They were all recognised as key factors.
Another key component that was highlighted is the need to reduce the gap between the pension payment and what is colloquially known as the dole—the Newstart payment. The two payments have been getting steadily further apart over time because they have different indexing measures attached to them. The other aspect, which is less recognised but equally important, as I flagged before, is that different income tests apply. There is a much more generous income test for pensions than for Newstart, a more generous assets test and other concessions such as health care cards and the like. All of those things are lost to those people that are now not eligible for those payments; they will now be put on Newstart. That will mean, undoubtedly, significantly lower incomes and levels of assistance for many Australians who are already amongst the most disadvantaged. It is a contemptible approach that the government is taking and it is disgraceful that it is still pursuing it. This is one area where there needs to be a lot more attention paid to the impacts on families—on human beings—and on individual people around Australia who are affected as a result of the legislation that was passed in this place. The legislation, I might say, is supported by the Family First senator, which I find quite extraordinary, given how negatively it is going to impact on so many families around the country. That is something that needs to be monitored and followed much more closely, and the Democrats commit to doing that, as I am sure many other senators in this place will.
Finally, I want to indicate the wider problem with the approach that has been taken in the government’s welfare legislation. Whilst the changes, as far as they go, are welcome, there are still changes being made within the broader context that are going to cause major hardship to a significant number of people. We need to remember that we are talking about people’s incomes. One area of the public debate that is very misleading—and I do not blame the government alone for this one, at least—is the common assumption amongst the community and the media about what the average income of Australians is. The assumption, which is often quoted, is that the average income is $50,000 or $55,000 per annum. People hear that and assume that most people earn that amount or over. That is completely incorrect. That figure is the mean income. The median income, which is the midpoint, is much lower down—around the $30,000 mark. If you count those people who are not in the workforce and who have no income at all then the figure moves down into the $20,000 to $30,000 range, depending on which statistics you read. And so the average Australian actually earns less than $50,000 per year—around $30,000 per year. They are the sorts of people who are impacted significantly by any sort of increase in the effective marginal tax rate. That is another reason that these sorts of measures are so negative. It is about time, when we are talking about the income of people in the community, that we recognise that the majority of Australians do not earn $50,000 or $55,000 a year; the majority of Australians earn $30,000-odd or less. That is not a lot of money; obviously, that is a key reason that many families need to have two incomes. Even the average household income median, or midpoint, is only in the $50,000 to $60,000 per year range.
We need to keep those facts in mind when we are looking at measures that can affect people’s incomes, whether they are taxation or welfare changes or some of the interconnects between them. In that respect, the government is clearly putting in place changes that will mean a significant group in the community will become less well off. There has been a lot of talk from the government in recent times suggesting that there has not been greater inequality in Australia. The government denies the common phrase ‘the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer’ and says, ‘Everybody is getting richer.’ It has even suggested that the gap between the so-called rich and the so-called poor is not increasing. Inasmuch as there is truth in that, the government should acknowledge that that is in large part because of the Democrats—particularly during the period when we had the balance of power in the Senate. The Democrats prevented some of the more extremely draconian and unjust welfare and tax measures that the government was going to put in place and that would have undoubtedly increased inequality. The government once again refuses to acknowledge that, in the same way that it refuses to acknowledge the significant role the Democrats have played in producing the positive workplace environments and workplace statistics that the government continues to gloat about.
But of course the key thing now is that the government have control of the Senate. In the period of time since gaining that control, they have destroyed the workplace relations system that they themselves continually say has produced such good economic outcomes. They are introducing draconian measures—like the one before that Senate today—which never in a million years would have got through the Senate before. As the government well know, measures that were far less draconian than today’s were not passed previously, because they were unjust and increased inequality. Even inasmuch as there is some truth in saying that inequality has not increased as much as some people might think, that has not been the government’s doing. It has been the Senate and the Democrats in particular that have protected that equality. Whatever might happen to the Democrats in the future, that is certainly a legacy that I will remain proud of.
It also needs to be emphasised that, despite the best efforts of the Senate and the Democrats and others, there has clearly been a growing inequality in Australia. It is not just measured, and you cannot just measure it, on straightforward income through employment. But if you measure it on overall income, unearned as well as earned, and particularly if you measure it in terms of wealth, there has been a massive increase in the gap between the haves and the have-nots in this community. This is particularly between those who have housing assets and those who do not. Those who do not are less and less able to get into the housing market and have housing based assets. Measures such as the government’s Welfare to Work package will increase the number of people who have little prospect of getting into that area. It will therefore increase the number of have-nots, who are being left behind.
As that wealth gap grows bigger, particularly the component of it that is based around those who can purchase their own the house and housing investments, people’s ability to cross that gap will become less and less. It will become, eventually, an unbridgeable gap. Once it is an unbridgeable gap we have a permanently divided society, and that is not in the interests of those of us who are on the ‘haves’ side of that chasm—let alone those who are the have-nots. That is a path this country should not be going down, and we need to reverse it urgently. The changes in the legislation are okay, but the Welfare to Work changes need to be monitored. The disadvantages and injustices not only need to be highlighted but need to be reversed, and they need to be reversed as soon as possible.",SENATE,<title>EMPLOYMENT AND WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE TO WORK AND OTHER MEASURES) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2006-06-14,"—The Greens share the concerns articulated today by Senator Wong and Senator Bartlett. But today I want to focus on one particular area of the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2006. I have circulated an amendment to this legislation to deal with an issue that I have been raising repeatedly about this legislation whenever I can. That is the issue of family carers.
Before I go into some of the broader issues as they relate to family carers, I want to go through a short history of this legislation and a few of the changes that were, thankfully, made to it. When this legislation was first talked about, only biological parents of young children under the school age of six were to be exempted from it and from the requirements under Welfare to Work. When there was community outrage about the fact that this would unfairly affect carers, and in particular foster carers—and the Greens were very outspoken about this as well—the government, thankfully, saw that the changes did disadvantage foster carers and it made changes to exempt foster carers from this legislation. Unfortunately, at the time family carers were left out.
Family carers carry out the same responsibilities as foster carers, and therefore are subject to the same disadvantages or pressures that this legislation places on foster carers. In fact, many would argue that family carers face even more trauma than foster carers, because often they are caring for children who have been subjected to extremely traumatic circumstances. Not only are they looking after the children but they are dealing with family crises and with other family members. So I believe that the arguments for foster carers being exempt from this legislation apply just as much, if not more, to family carers.
Some people in this chamber may be aware that I have raised this issue here in this place and repeatedly in estimates, asking questions about how family carers are being looked after. When I raised this question during the debate in the Committee of the Whole on the legislation in the first place, I was assured that few children would be affected by this legislation—the children that are being cared for by family carers. I quote Hansard, in which the Special Minister of State, Senator Abetz, said:
Hopefully—and I think we would all be in agreement on this—the number of children involved in this situation would be small.
Unfortunately he got it wrong. In January this year the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare released its report, Child protection in Australia 2004-05. It did a survey of children placed in out-of-home care; in other words, children not living at home, whether they be in foster care, family or kinship care, or residential care. The report found that 40 per cent, or almost half, of children placed in out-of-home care—I emphasise ‘placed in out-of-home care’, and I will come back to that—are placed in family or kinship care. That is 9,435 kids. Twelve thousand, six hundred and eighty kids are placed in foster care and 939 kids are placed in residential care. Almost half of all kids who are placed in out-of-home care are placed with family carers. So much for the small number placed with family carers; it is almost as many as are placed with foster carers. So the argument that only a small number of children are placed in family care so we do not need to worry about them because the vast majority is in foster care is blown out of the water. If you are just relying on numbers, it is almost the same. On numbers alone the argument should be that the same exemption should apply to family carers as applies to foster carers.
But the report also found that the number of children being placed in out-of-home care is going up yearly. On 30 June 1996 there were 13,979 children in out-of-home care. On 30 June 2005 there were 23,695. That is an increase from three per thousand to 4.9 per thousand. Further, the figures show that this is a yearly increase. So we can expect that there will be more and more children placed in out-of-home care, whether it be foster care or family care. That is a 70 per cent increase over that nine-year period. I would argue that is a significant increase.
Unfortunately, the figures also point out that, proportionally, more Aboriginal children are going into out-of-home care. There were 5,678 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander kids in out-of-home care in June 2005. This is an increase of 619 since June 2004. About 26 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children per 1,000 are in out-of-home care versus about four non-Aboriginal children per 1,000. Aboriginal children are six times more likely to be in out-of-home care. The point here is that Aboriginal families are much more likely to be affected by these changes than non-Aboriginal families. There are also greater impacts for large urban Aboriginal populations. Nearly nine children per 1,000 in the Northern Territory, nearly 21 children per 1,000 in Queensland and nearly 23 children per 1,000 in Western Australia are in out-of-home care, whereas in Victoria it is nearly 41 per 1,000 and in New South Wales it is nearly 40 per 1,000. In other words, it is Aboriginal urban populations that are being more strongly affected by these changes.
I would like to reiterate that we are talking about 9½ thousand children. This is a large percentage of children who are being affected. The trend is increasing. It impacts most significantly on Aboriginal families, particularly urban ones. These figures are for children who are placed in family care. It is likely to underestimate the number of kids in family care, because many children are placed in family care informally—in other words, the families step in and take care of the children before it comes to the attention of the department. They are struggling to deal with the trauma of children in family care and take it upon themselves, without intervention.
During various opportunities in estimates I asked a number of questions on this issue because I am deeply concerned about the adverse impact this is going to have on the families that provide family and kinship care and, of course, the impact that that necessarily has on the children in their care. I have been told that this is a policy decision of government. The agency, it seems, is not able to deal with it very well. In fact, I have had very unsatisfactory answers to my questions about it. I have been mainly told that this is about foster carers. It was a political decision, a policy decision, taken by government to look after foster carers. It is one I very strongly support, but it is also one I am very greatly disappointed about, in that it is not picking up a large cohort of carers and the children they care for.
I also understand that there are going to be some guidelines on this issue, but it is not regulation and it is not in the legislation. They are not being given the same protection, support and exemption that foster carers and the children in that foster care receive. I believe it is much better to acknowledge and to protect the large contribution made by family and kinship carers and their rights. It is in the best interests of the children to protect them under the law and to protect them under the same exemption that the foster carers have. I believe the place to do this is in a provision under the act.
We need to understand the situation of family carers. Often, as I said before, they take over the care of children in extremely difficult and traumatic circumstances. I suggest to you that there are no circumstances under which children move out of parental care into either foster care or family care where there are not difficult and traumatic circumstances. In many circumstances, the children who go into family care have suffered and, unfortunately, have been subject to abuse. They need extra support and extra counselling, which means, for example, taking children out of school during the day to counselling sessions, often a number of times a week. This applies not only to children under the age of six but, in many cases, to children of all school ages, and they all need support. Sometimes it is very sudden; other times it is a gradual thing where, over a period of time, as circumstances become more difficult, family and kinship carers find that they have been handed over the care of children. Often this is informal, and they do not approach agencies, so they are not registered as foster carers are registered—and I will come back to that point in a minute. Often they do not want to be washing their so-called dirty linen in public. They do not want to be telling an agency what is going on in their family. They are just doing it.
The process can be messy. Sometimes it is only temporary and sometimes it is a long time before the process is finalised. People have to go to court, and it can take up to 18 months or longer to have the formal responsibility and care of the children in your family. Sometimes there is a source of conflict within families over what is in the best interests of the child, whether the child should stay with the parents or whether aunts, uncles or grandparents should step in and provide care for children. Sometimes there is a death or disability, and this can be drawn out. So formal custody is not taken over straightaway. Sometimes they go into family care over a protracted period of time as a person, for example, gradually becomes sicker or goes in and out of hospital.
As I said, it is often under tragic circumstances, where the trauma of loss can be overwhelming. Families go into denial and they have an attitude of: ‘We can cope.’ It is not until they reach a point of financial crisis that they reach out for help. But they still need that help, whether or not they have formally registered for it and formally registered for income support for the children. They should still be supported and they should not be required to undertake all the strenuous activity that is associated with the new Welfare to Work process. The other complicating factor here is that different states and territories have different rules about the register for foster carers and whether they register family or kinship carers and what that register means. It is not standard across Australia. Some states have registers for family carers—for example, I understand the ACT does—and some do not, and it is very hard to find that information.
The other thing is that family carers are much less likely to know their rights and have access to formal channels of support than foster carers. There are foster carers’ associations and registers of foster carers. Various government agencies have foster carers registers. You have to go through a process to become a foster carer. So foster carers know their rights, but it is more than likely that very often family carers do not know theirs. They do not know where they can get information from. They do not know what support they can get from Centrelink, for example, or from other government agencies in their states. Therefore, communication and education is critical, but it is very difficult for this group. There is no obligation, as far as I am aware, for carers and family carers to be told of any support that they could receive.
Under estimates questioning, DEWR has acknowledged that the legislation is inconsistent for foster carers and family carers, that there is a significant number of family carers—and that has been pointed out in the report, so it could hardly deny it—and that the work they do is the same as that of foster carers. DEWR also acknowledged that most states and territories do not register or authorise family care in a way that fits into the act. But it states that the exemption of the family carers—I come back to it—was a government policy decision. It is a government policy decision that I believe is badly flawed. The legislation is inconsistent for these groups of children and for these carers. One set of children is advantaged because they have the exemption and their carers are covered by the exemption. Another set of children—an equal number, almost; and, in fact, if you include informal care, more children are covered—does not have the advantage of this exemption. How is that fair? How is that just?
These are our future generations. These are the children who are most disadvantaged in our society. It can be easily dealt with. Accept the amendment that the Greens will move to support family carers and give them equality with foster carers. You have done the right thing in acknowledging the hard work of foster carers. It was supported by the community. It was supported by everybody. There was acknowledgment of the work that foster carers do. Family carers do the same amount of work. Why are they not subject to and given the support of this exemption? There are problems that need to be sorted out at the state level—there is no doubt about that. There are problems about legitimisation and registration of family and kinship carers. But the Commonwealth need to provide the lead on this. They need to change the legislation to include family carers.
The other thing is that you need to make sure that it is for children over six, because children over six are traumatised by the terrible circumstances which lead to them being in care. The fundamental issue here is the welfare of children in extremely difficult circumstances. The point is to give them a chance to lead worthwhile, meaningful and productive lives in spite of the many and deep crises and extra challenges they face. This is through no fault of their own. Through no fault of their own they are starting a step back from everybody else in the first place. What matters is their welfare and that we as legislators are prepared to provide support to the people who love and care for them. We are talking about people who sacrifice a great deal to look after these children in often tragic circumstances and in circumstances where they are often dealing with their own sense of loss and grief. They are prepared to take on the extra responsibilities. We should be prepared to support and help them and not add to their burden. I will be moving the amendment to this legislation during the committee stage. I really hope the government can find it in their hearts to support this small amendment that would mean so much to so many children.",SENATE,<title>EMPLOYMENT AND WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE TO WORK AND OTHER MEASURES) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2006-06-14,"—I rise to support the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2006 and to indicate that there is a very important need for Australia to restructure the nature of participation in the workforce in light of the dynamics of our society today.
Members of the Senate will be aware of the previous debates on this question. They will be aware of the inquiry by the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee late last year. That inquiry laid out a variety of issues being addressed in the transition of the Australian social security system from one which supported, and perhaps in some senses even encouraged, a very significant proportion of Australians of working age to receive benefits and not participate in the workforce to a system where the onus is placed on people who are capable of participating in the workforce to do so. By doing so, they help to address the serious imbalance emerging in the Australian economy between the number of positions being advertised and the number of jobs being thrown up in business and the economy generally, and the number of people available to fill them.
The Senate would be aware that we have seen in only the last few days wonderful news about the unemployment rate falling below five per cent. It is extremely important that we acknowledge the evidence that this represents for the change in the nature of the Australian workforce. There is now no longer a shortage of jobs so much as a shortage of workers. We should perhaps be focusing on other indicators of the health of our economy rather than on unemployment figures. We should be looking at ways that we can address that situation as it stands today. That situation is going to worsen in light of the ageing of our population. There will be an increasing vacation of the working population by those who get older and a lack of replacement of those people by others of working age who are available to contribute to manpower shortages in our economy. The Workforce Tomorrow study by the Centre of Policy Studies at Monash University illustrated that point extremely well. It described the phenomenon of the disparity between available positions and people available to fill those positions as being in the order of 195,000 within five years.
I particularly feel an urgency to ensure that this issue is pursued, because the ACT was identified as the jurisdiction which would have, after South Australia, the worst disparity of all. Indeed, in the ACT there are already serious manpower shortages in a range of areas. It is simply going to get worse unless measures are taken to encourage as many people as possible to participate in the workforce. There cannot be any doubt that that process represents a huge cultural change in the nature of Australia’s welfare system and its policies on participation in the workforce. It is an absolutely huge change.
In today’s debate, I have heard criticism by other senators across the chamber about the changes that the federal government is engineering with these bills, but I say to them that, in addressing the so-called shortcomings in these arrangements, they need to seriously ask themselves what they would do differently if they were on the government benches. What would they do to address the looming crisis in Australia’s capacity to be a productive economy that delivers a worthwhile standard of living to all of its citizens?
We know that providing a job is the best form of welfare that we can furnish to our citizens. We know that those who have the capacity to work ought to be encouraged to work. We know that services provided to people who have an obligation to seek work should focus on getting those people into the workforce at the first available opportunity, given other constraints and their particular conditions—such as their need to care for children or the problems that some sorts of disabilities may bring to a work environment.
We acknowledge those factors. However, having done that, you cannot then avoid the question of what you actually do to effect that change. It is a significant change. With respect to supporting Australians who for a variety of reasons choose not to be in the workforce, it is a change which represents, in some senses, the repudiation of policy of many decades duration. But it would be irresponsible to fail to address those issues. I hope that this debate goes beyond simply highlighting what are, apparently, in the eyes of some people, inadequacies or shortcomings in the government’s proposal.
I move to the question of what can be done to make those changes happen and to make that outcome actually occur for the sake of the standard of living of future Australians. Currently, Australia’s participation rate of working people is 73.6 per cent—at least that was the figure available from the OECD last year. It needs to be noted that that rate is significantly behind other major OECD countries, such as Canada, Denmark, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. Comparisons are perhaps odious, but they illustrate that we are not leaping into the unknown and we are not engineering some kind of unacceptable change in the nature of the workforce by taking measures that stimulate people’s involvement in the workforce. Frankly, in order to meet the skill and labour shortages that the Australian economy will experience in the next few years, we have to ensure that we get that participation rate up as high as possible.
At present, the net growth in the Australian workforce is 170,000 people each year. Access Economics has estimated that, over the decade from 2020 to 2030, the workforce will grow by just 125,000 people—that is, a growth in the size of the workforce of about 12½ thousand people each year. The side effects of the disparity between the size of the workforce and the size of the required workforce, if you like, will lead to an ever-diminishing tax base and revenue base for governments at all levels, not simply for the federal government. It will impact seriously on the ability to provide a range of government services, including pensions, income support payments, health services and education services—all sorts of services to the Australian community. So it is obvious that we will engineer an intergenerational inequity if we cannot provide the next generation of Australian taxpayers with the opportunity to pay taxes at a reasonable level and to get reasonable access to services of the kinds that are enjoyed by the taxpayers of today.
Of course, that was the issue that the Treasurer, just a few years ago, very clearly placed on the table with his Intergenerational report, in which he warned:
Although the ageing of the Australian population is not expected to have a major impact on the Commonwealth’s budget for at least another 15 years, forward planning for these developments is important to ensure that governments will be well placed to meet emerging policy challenges in both a timely and effective manner.
Having said that we have an insufficiently high participation rate of working people in our economy, we have to acknowledge that the nature of the Australian welfare system has led to a higher degree of welfare dependency than is appropriate in order to reverse the trend towards a deficit in the number of people available to fill positions.
There are currently 2.6 million working age Australians—that is, people between the ages of 15 and 64—who are on income support. I acknowledge that the retirement age is now a moveable feast—and so it should be—but, if we take that to be the age at which people might be expected, in all circumstances, to work, there are 2.6 million Australians who are on income support, of which only 15 per cent are required to be actively searching for a job. In other words, a relatively small minority of that 2.6 million is actually required to go out into the workforce. There is a variety of issues confronting those approximately two million people who are not required to seek employment and who are on income support. Of course, there are some who will never be in a position to participate in the workforce, but it cannot be denied that we have, at the present time, a system in which far too many are capable of participating but are simply not appropriately encouraged by the nature of the system to take that decision and to seek employment.
With the present unemployment rate, there has never been a better time to seek those positions. Some people may have been discouraged by a lack of available positions on the basis of, for example, having a disability, being a mature age worker or having a low skills set, and they may have had a long history of rejection and inability to obtain employment. But what is different about the environment today, particularly with the measures that have been announced in the Welfare to Work package, is that active steps are being taken by government to engineer people through the difficulty of having a problem which perhaps makes them, in the eyes of some, less attractive employees than otherwise might be available. We acknowledge that there are many factors that can contribute to a person not obtaining employment, but we should not allow a situation to remain whereby one of those factors is their unwillingness to participate despite a capacity to do so.
In the 12 months prior to June 2004, 55 per cent of people transferred to the disability support payment from another payment in Australia. That was in reaction to changes in government policy which tightened up access to other forms of payment. In the seven years prior to June 2004, the DSP had grown to 26 per cent and the parenting payment single by 33 per cent. It needs to be recorded that there are now more working age Australians on the DSP than there are on the Newstart allowance.
There may have been factors which contributed to an increase in the number of Australians with disabilities—there may have been factors related to definitional changes which led to people having an eligibility for that payment which they did not previously have—but I think we also need to be up front and sincere enough to acknowledge that some people have taken advantage of the system to make that transition and that in some cases the disabilities complained of are not in effect a barrier to participation in the workforce, particularly given that systems are now being put in place to allow people’s particular conditions to be much more readily taken into account in their role in the workplace than has ever been the case in the past.
Money was made available, under the package announced last year, for workplaces to be modified to allow those issues to be addressed and for advice and support to be given to employers who choose to employ a worker with a disability of a level that we have not previously seen in this country. We are at last serious about getting people with disabilities a role in the workforce. Admittedly, circumstances may have forced that on us, rather than a philosophical change of viewpoint, but the fact is that those changes are taking place now. It is important that we indicate to people, particularly those with disabilities, that the system we are putting in place is now about accommodating those requirements, working through those needs and treating those with disabilities who want to participate in the workforce as citizens who have a greater capacity to do that than ever before.
I hope that, as with last year’s legislation, the changes in this legislation that are being discussed will be sympathetically considered by senators. We realise that none of these decisions is necessarily very easy. It is certainly possible for people to be miscategorised by a system which places a greater emphasis on participation. It is certainly possible for people who do not have a capacity to work to be required to work in a way which causes them some disadvantage or some loss of income support. But I am convinced that the best measure to overcome that potential is goodwill and an accepted willingness on the part of Centrelink and other agencies of the federal government that deal with people in these circumstances to address people on the basis of their individual circumstances, and to not use inflexible rules to apply to people irrespective of those individual circumstances—not, in short, to attempt to force a square peg into a round hole.
We owe it to future generations of Australians to ensure that we do this sensitively and with regard to those individual circumstances. I believe that the flexibility exists in the legislation and in the approach being taken by agencies of the federal government to engineer that outcome. I do not, of course, preclude the possibility of stories of people being mistreated by the system—and I have no doubt at all that, when those cases occur, the media will hungrily lap them up and there will be headlines. However, at the end of the day, as long as we are fair minded, we are prepared to approach this on the basis of providing for an acceptable and appropriate transition to a different kind of welfare operation in Australia, and we accept that a measure of flexibility can be applied and should be applied, I think we will be on the right track. I hope that that is the outcome of the exercise.
The Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee recommended last year that the system be overviewed and monitored, and I believe that that is important. I understand that the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has accepted the recommendations for a mechanism that reports to parliament on the way in which these changes operate. Personally, I think we need to see the system in operation in order to be able to gauge just how well that transition has been made. I know that some would prefer to front-end load this so that no problems can possibly occur. With respect, I think that is naive. We are not going to be able to do that. What we need, however, is a capacity to acknowledge when things do not work and to make changes when that is appropriate.
That is my sense of the response that the minister gave to the report. I certainly will take that approach as a representative of this territory in my discussions with the minister in identifying what issues arise for my constituents in facing that transition. I hope that that will be a phenomenon repeated across other parts of Australia. We certainly owe it to our constituents to give them as much opportunity to bring those issues to our attention as we possibly can so we can help fix them. I support this legislation. It is important to provide this outcome for the people of Australia. This is about the future living standards of our community and, as such, it deserves to be supported.",SENATE,<title>EMPLOYMENT AND WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE TO WORK AND OTHER MEASURES) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2006-06-14,"—The bill before us is a ‘consequential amendments’ bill and, in that sense, the Labor Party position is that we will be supporting the technical provisions in the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2006. But I ask this question: consequential to what? The Welfare to Work and other measures legislation came into this place before the end of last year and was very quickly debated. It was legislation that, as Senator Humphries has just described, was going to make an overwhelmingly significant change to the way in which these issues were going to be looked at in this country. I believe that, as Senator Bartlett mentioned, it was guillotined in this place because it was agreed by the government that this had to be imposed on the citizens of Australia with effect from next month. In fact, many of the provisions of the Welfare to Work legislation will be taking effect from 1 July this year for the first round of people who are making claims, but some people on the disability support payment are already in the process of having their ongoing review activities picked up by elements of the Welfare to Work changes.
As a community, we should be able to expect, as Senator Humphries has just outlined, the participation of as many people as possible in our economy. No-one disagrees with that. What I find most offensive in the debates that we have had up until now is that from the government point of view any questions or issues that are raised about how this particular legislation will operate in practice, and any concerns raised by those people who have genuine questions about the impact of the legislation and about how families will continue to operate with reduced income, are dismissed as opposition. The people asking those questions are dismissed as people who do not understand the system. And the Labor Party are dismissed as though we do not share a commitment to encourage Australians to take an active role in the economy, to fulfil their need to work, to effectively communicate more widely in the community and to be part of an Australia that we should all share.
We have been told in this place that the best form of welfare is a job. I dismiss the term ‘welfare’; I find that overwhelmingly patronising in many ways—except when it is used specifically in legislation. Of course we want people to have the opportunity to work. Senator Humphries has just outlined extremely effectively the need for the people of our country to have greater participation in the workforce. We agree. But what we do not agree with is the particular methodology of this legislation.
We do not disagree with the consequential amendments. With all legislation, the ability to go back and look at things and impose new processes to make it better is a good one. If all legislation had a series of consequential amendments, we would be effectively working together to make the legislation better, so we welcome consequential amendments—even the very technical ones that we have before us today, which I do not think that many people who are not working in the system would truly understand the operation of. These amendments are all responding to particular issues to make sure that the thing works better.
However, what has not been picked up in these consequential amendments is the key question which we have been debating for several months and, in fact, in a way, for many generations: how do you effectively work with people to ensure that they can all share the largesse of our country? What we on this side of the chamber have from the start objected to in the Welfare to Work legislation is that there is no way that the best way to support people is to cut the amount of money they have to live on. The only element of the way in which this particular process is worked through that we object to specifically is that a key part of the Welfare to Work changes means that people are forced onto a lower living income.
We do not object to the fact that there needs to be training, support and acknowledgment to encourage people into the workplace. We do not object to the fact that there need to be closer working arrangements between the Job Network and the Centrelink systems so that people have access to the range of support mechanisms which everyone should have access to if they are seeking work. People who are now sole parents or who are now on the disability support payment should not have some special label on them when they are seeking work that says, ‘Danger, danger: needs special help.’ We are saying that the type of support in the Job Network should be available to all Australians seeking work under any provisions in our system.
The government has announced that extensive new support networks—we have not seen them working yet—will be put in place to work through the Welfare to Work processes. These special arrangements are in fact doing no more than acknowledging the need for these Australians to have some special support in their efforts to seek work. Of course we support that. We want to be actively involved in developing these programs and in ensuring that they are the most effective possible. We want to ensure that they meet the needs of the people working through the process of changing their way of living and their expectations for their daily routines—and, in the case of sole parents, balancing the particular issues involved in raising kids by themselves.
In the very short inquiry that the Community Affairs Legislation Committee held around this legislation, we received a number of submissions. They were not one-off submissions; they did not come from nowhere. The people who actually made submissions to this committee work on a daily basis with the welfare system—working with the Centrelink processes or acting as support networks for people who are sole parents or have a form of disability. The submissions were from organisations with enormous amounts of effective and practical corporate knowledge of this area. Their choice to come forward—and no-one is forced to give evidence to a Senate committee, or at least to the Community Affairs Committee—was based on two major elements: firstly, they wanted the voices of the people who are to be affected by the legislation heard in the development of the legislation and, secondly, they wanted to be a part with their knowledge and experience in whatever was happening—I think Senator Humphries used the term ‘the engineering of the process’—in regard to the government looking at the needs of people in the process of seeking work.
The department gave evidence to the inquiry and subsequently at a range of Senate estimates processes—and I think that will continue as the legislation is implemented—about their need to consult with the community and with the various agencies. That is a necessary mechanism of our system. But I want to know what the response to the consultation is when the consultation happens.
The kinds of issues that were being raised in the Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry were to do with concerns about the methodology of a punishment model, which is the only way you can describe a change of entitlement which reduces people’s living money: how they survive, how they feed their kids, how they pay their rent—how they actually do all those things that every person in Australia does. If you are reliant on a Centrelink payment, you know to the last dollar exactly what your fortnightly budget is—and this came out in evidence heard by the committee—because you have to work through the numerous demands that you have on your time and your budget. It was clearly put to the legislation committee that single parents actually work on a fortnightly basis to see exactly how they can dish out the money for their families. And it is the same for people with disabilities.
Within this process, of course, any incentive or support to get a higher wage and to be reintegrated into a workforce was seen as a positive element. There is no doubt about that. In reviewing the committee report today and looking at the submissions received, I found that there was not one person who came before the committee who rejected the value of a job. Not one piece of evidence said that it would be better not to work. It is a dismissive response from the government to say that any questions of objection indicate that there is no support for the issue of giving people the opportunity to have a job and a career. Getting a job in itself may be a result, but it is certainly not an incentive for people to develop, train and earn and have access to career progression. It has always been a balance. Just getting a job in itself may provide a step away from welfare dependency, but we should be encouraging people to enjoy the genuine values of a workplace and have the opportunity to enhance their income, training and skills so the job has genuine value beyond just the wage.
We need to widen our concept beyond just getting employment. We need to look at the value of employment so that we are not restating a whole range of cheap casual jobs and letting people be used in the job market in a dismissive and not particularly well valued way. That particular issue came out in the inquiry. Whilst people had no opposition to a chance of employment, they certainly did not think that the Centrelink and Job Network system that pushed them into jobs that provided no fulfilment and actually did not fit their other life needs, particularly child-care needs, was in itself the most effective way to work with the community and ensure that people who were identified by this legislation had the enhanced opportunities that we all seek.
However, the report said that there has been significant consultation with welfare and community groups on the impact of the changes. That is true. There has been consultation. The St Vincent de Paul Society, a group that consistently gives evidence at these inquiries with credentials that are beyond question, I believe, in working with people across our community who need immediate support, said: ‘I think’—and they refer in particular to people with disabilities and sole parents, who are the focus of this legislation—‘we will just find life harder than it was before. I do not think there is any doubt about that. They will come to us more seeking help and we will do our best to help them—we and the others who are there.’ Where is the government in that equation?
What we find so often in these debates is that the expectation of compassion and open communication and the expectation of what Senator Humphries defined as ‘goodwill’ are not always fulfilled in the system. The very people who are the focus of the Welfare to Work changes—and I am not convinced that that is going to be the automatic outcome of the legislation—are those who often have had the most negative experiences of the system as it currently exists. We are imposing further change on that group. Despite all the rhetoric about encouragement and support and giving people a chance to remove themselves from the welfare trap—rhetoric which we have all heard so often—the core element and the immediate impact of the Welfare to Work changes for people who are sole parents who have children of a certain age and for people currently on the disability support pension or those who will be claiming that pension after 1 July will be a cut in their fortnightly allowance.
That is a tough step to encourage continuation of goodwill because goodwill is not always enhanced by having less money to go through your daily expectations of living. What we seek as people who want to be part of the future development of our changing system is genuine communication, genuine consultation and the acceptance that there needs to be continued evaluation of these processes. In our legislative committee reform recommendations we said that this needs to be constantly reviewed and discussed, but it also needs to involve the people who are living the expectations of the legislation, the people who are currently using the system and the people who are providing the support for the people St Vincent de Paul identified.
A statement made consistently during the previous Senate inquiry on poverty in this country was that there are so many welfare agencies in this country who are picking up the immediate needs not just economically—although economically is so important—but also in terms of personal support, emergency housing, emergency support for family breakdown; all those areas where the people who are focused on in this legislation often need extra support that is provided by a range of community organisations. These organisations have the immediate knowledge and can best work with the government to enhance the program of encouraging people from a dependent model to some option to earn and be further involved in their community.
We seek the evidence that shows that punishment gets the best result. We reject that it is the best way to encourage people from welfare to a work model. There cannot be goodwill if you lead with punishment. There needs to be an understanding that there will be support, encouragement and a fall-back if things do not work out. We have found that leading closer to the date of 1 July there has been fear amongst areas of the community about their ability to succeed within this model. It also makes it a little more difficult to get goodwill clicking in if there is fear and worry about what is going to happen because of the punitive nature of the model. When Senator Humphries talked about what would be an alternate process, the best way would seem to be to have a cooperative process. Effective encouragement and effective training would be provided without necessarily punishing people at the first step, by removing immediate funding, and they would be given some security about the issues they will be facing and about what the results of the further changes will be.
In terms of where we go next, I expect there will be a series of further consequential amendments as we find out how the legislation kicks in and we see how the different layers work with each other in terms of payments, support networks and so on. It seems confronting that the marginal tax rates, which were mentioned a lot in our committee work, at this stage still seem to actively work against those people who are seeking to get back into the work force. It would seem to be an automatic challenge to those who are working in the development of further policy to enhance the encouragement financially. So not only do you lose your money as your immediate payment element but any attempt to move into the workforce is further punished by the marginal tax system so that you are working seemingly because you have to. The system is forcing you in but you are not receiving the monetary benefit that you should receive. That cuts across the enhancement of the process.
The people in this place have a genuine responsibility to the Australian community. There is an expectation that there will be change. There is an expectation also that the economic largesse that we are experiencing in many areas in this country could be shared effectively by all Australians. The way that the Welfare to Work changes have been implemented has already alienated groups of people who should be able to expect support the most from their government. If we are genuinely going to encourage people from welfare into work as opposed to one form of welfare into another, there must continue to be consequential changes to the legislation in front of us. As it stands, I do not think the work elements will be attractive or supportive for the people who are being targeted by the legislation. I do not think that we, as a government, have effectively done our job.
Debate interrupted.",SENATE,<title>EMPLOYMENT AND WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WELFARE TO WORK AND OTHER MEASURES) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2006-06-14,"—When rugby legend Phil Kearns accidentally reversed his car over his 19-month-old toddler in the driveway of his Mosman home in Sydney, did any right-minded person suggest or demand that he be charged or prosecuted for what was just a plain or garden variety tragic accident? Of course not, and no action was taken by New South Wales Police. So you would think that the same thing would apply when the now leader of the state opposition in Western Australia accidentally discharged a .22 rifle which injured the thumb of his adult son.
In fact Paul Omodei was charged with the heaviest offence on the Western Australian statute books relating to non-intentional bodily harm. The magistrate presiding over the case cited the Kearn’s case and, in fining Omodei, spent the conviction so that no conviction has been recorded against him today. It is clear to anyone who has any passing knowledge of criminal law in WA that Omodei had the book thrown at him in stark contrast to the Kearn’s matter in circumstances where both incidents are comparable.
So it was that more than 12 months ago now, on Wednesday 25 May, the then leader of the state opposition in Western Australia, Matt Birney, was being followed home from parliament by police. He was subsequently stopped and given a breathalyser. His reading was below the legal limit, he was found to be lawfully driving his car and he was never charged with any offence.
Notwithstanding this, the police minister announced on a radio talkback program shortly thereafter that the reading had been 0.047. It is unclear whether this reading was on the preliminary breath test or the full breathalyser where there had been a calculated reading. But the main issue in this case is the role of the police commissioner in Western Australia. He had, as he disclosed, as a matter of practice been providing briefing notes to the minister, including those relating to ‘high profile’ people. So the commissioner was at that time a conduit for information on police operational matters involving high profile private citizens to the police minister—even those citizens who did not break the law. The minister, as was always very likely, knowing that minister, misused the information to seek political advantage.
During an interview on talkback radio, when questioned as to where the minister may have obtained her information as to the breathalyser reading, the police commissioner said of the disclosure:
… look, it could have come from someone else, it could have come from a number of sources and I intend to talk to the Minister and find out. If anything is untoward about this I am happy to report back on it.
About 90 minutes later the police commissioner issued a statement confirming and confessing it was he who had disclosed the reading to the minister. That was a police commissioner playing fast and loose with the public on radio as to the facts of a political matter. What sort of commissioner would stoop to involve police in the murky depths of state party politics? This undermines police integrity and brings the office of the police commissioner into disrepute.
So it was that Jonathan Daventry was charged and put before a district court jury in March of this year. The facts of the matter are quite straightforward. Mr Daventry was alleged to have shirt-fronted and frogmarched a 72-year-old man from an office, during which event the man fell and fractured his skull. One witness gave direct evidence in support of the prosecution case. Five witnesses gave direct evidence as to the event not having taken place as alleged by the prosecution and exonerating Mr Daventry. In such circumstances one might reasonably ask: why would the police proceed with this matter? The answer lies in the fact that the office concerned was that of the federal member for Curtin, a Liberal member. Indeed, the honourable member gave evidence for the defence at the trial. Needless to say, Jonathan Daventry’s jury returned a verdict of not guilty.
I pause to note that when the police interviewed the parliamentarian—now a Howard government cabinet minister—they sought to do so on the pretext of charging the man concerned, the 72-year-old, with disorderly conduct. In other words, the investigating officers commenced an interview with a witness misleading her to believe that the matter was relevant to disorderly conduct whilst having an ulterior motive of pursuing Mr Daventry—another surreptitious piece of policing unworthy of skilled professional police investigators. So we have an overwhelmingly strong defence case in a matter pursued with great and unexplained zeal. The weight of evidence was obviously and unequivocally supportive of Mr Daventry’s version, yet a jury trial was held. Again the question has to be asked: why so much zeal? The answer is that it is political.
More amazing and shocking police conduct came to light at the end of May this year, conduct which gives rise to alarm at the integrity and management capacity of senior police, particularly the commissioner. For about 18 months the police commissioner has appeared in person on free-to-air commercial television in Perth extolling the virtues of DNA testing at crime scenes and personally looking down the lens of the television camera and telling the viewers that burglars will be arrested and prosecuted with the assistance of the relatively new weapon of DNA forensic testing of evidence.
This campaign was and continues to be founded upon a lie—that is, that DNA testing was in fact being done in a timely manner or at all. A recent report of the Western Australian Auditor-General, Mr Des Pearson, has found that during the commissioner’s nightly television appearances there was a backlog of some 37,309 unanswered requests for DNA test results dating back to 2000. The audit report confirms that this backlog relates to burglary offences. WA unfortunately has a very high rate of burglary.
So we have what amounts to a fraud being perpetrated upon the public of Western Australia by this police commissioner, who told the public that an active and successful crime detection tool was being used to fight the crime of burglary while all the time knowing that the testing was not being done. The commissioner must now explain to Western Australians whether that is due to his ignorance of the facts, his or his senior officers’ managerial incompetence in the administration of this testing regime or him simply not having the money to pay for these backlogged tests. Such developments again bring the office of the police commissioner in Western Australia into disrepute.
But all of this is mere background and contextual, because the WA Police Service has now gone one better. In 2003 a union official, a Mr Joe McDonald, an infamous and notorious member of the CFMEU, was charged with making threats pursuant to section 338A(b) of the WA Criminal Code. The penalty for this offence is imprisonment for seven years. Mr McDonald has a significant track record of intimidation, violence and union thuggery on commercial construction sites in Western Australia. In 2001 he lost his permit to enter industrial sites which have federal coverage after being found to have threatened and intimidated employers. In April this year Mr McDonald was stripped of his right to enter sites under state coverage following another act of violent intimidation on a building site. He was fined $800 for criminal assault arising out of this incident.
The most recent charge, the charge pursuant to section 338A(b), flowed from an incident at a construction site in 2002 wherein the police were called and some months later a detective charged Mr McDonald with an indictable offence pursuant to the section I have mentioned. The matter was listed for hearing in the district court in Perth until a state crown prosecution lawyer reviewed the matter and remitted it to be heard before a stipendiary magistrate in the summary criminal jurisdiction. The matter was then scheduled to be heard on 14 September 2004 but, because Mr McDonald was facing other charges, including assault and relating to his intimidation of people at a building site, the matter was deferred to a hearing on 21 March this year, 2006.
At the trial, several prosecution witnesses gave evidence in support of the charge and, upon closing the prosecution case, the defendant, Mr McDonald, through his counsel called no evidence to rebut the prosecution case. The defendant did, however, make legal submissions upon the law only. The presiding magistrate retired to duly consider her verdict. Counsel for the defendant was heard in the courtroom to ask the prosecutor after the magistrate had left the courtroom: ‘Will you be asking for imprisonment? Do you want a jail sentence?’ The clear inference was that a conviction was likely.
The legal argument put forward by the defence was based upon a unique construction of industrial law and in stark contrast to the understanding of most experienced practitioners and the current state of the authorities and precedent cases in this area. It is also important to note that, in not calling any evidence, the defence does not appear to have established any basis to prove that Mr McDonald was an accredited official of the CFMEU or that the union was in fact registered. These are legal formalities which would appear essential to be established if the defence submission on the technical law was to have any possibility of success.
What next occurred is one of the most perplexing events in the annals of administration of justice in Western Australia. It subsequently transpired that police prosecutors, of their own motion and without the benefit of any other legal advice, made an assessment of the defence submission and concluded that the prosecution could not succeed. Having unilaterally made a determination of the case, an application was made to another magistrate—it so happened to be the Chief Stipendiary Magistrate—to withdraw the charges. This was done with not a word to those involved in the case—namely, the witnesses or the people who had been threatened—and, of course, no word or advice to the media, which had shown much interest in the case. The charges were not withdrawn; they were ‘dismissed’, which precludes Mr McDonald ever being charged again with this offence upon the double jeopardy principle. The magistrate who presided at the trial was apparently soon to deliver her decision.
So what is so odd about this matter? Let me spell it out: an experienced police officer laid a serious charge after considerable consideration of the factual circumstances of the matter; an experienced state prosecutor reviewed the matter and sent it for trial in the Magistrates Court; witnesses gave detailed evidence in support of the charge; the defence made legal submissions only that were relevant to technical interpretations of industrial law; the magistrate was considering her verdict as the case had closed; the police gratuitously made an evaluation of the case and unilaterally resolved to pull it out in circumstances where no legal advice was taken on the matter and the dismissal of the charge was done as discreetly as possible by another magistrate; and the magistrate considering her verdict was pre-empted and the defendant cannot be charged again on the matter.
As a legal practitioner of some 25 years standing, I have no hesitation in saying that such conduct is unheard of. To intervene in a completed prosecution in pre-emption of the consideration of the presiding judicial officer is in breach of every proper principle and practice surrounding the administration of justice and our system of courts. If the police officers concerned were correct in their view of the failings of their case, the least they could have done was wait for the magistrate to find that the case had no possibility of success or for an appeal court judge to agree with them. These policemen have taken it upon themselves to be the judge and the jury. There is only one word to describe the police conduct in this matter: corrupt. I do not use this word lightly or without great consideration, but I maintain my assessment, given their conduct.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Western Australia: Police</title>,Matters of Public Interest,3,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2006-06-14,"—On 9 May 2006 I took on notice a question from Senator Hogg. I have provided Senator Hogg with a copy of the answer. I seek leave to incorporate the answer in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—

Senator Hogg asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, upon notice, on 9 May 2006:

Senator HOGG—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister confirm how many terminations that have occurred since the new laws took effect the Office of Workplace Services is currently investigating? How many of these investigations have been triggered by the minister? Are the outcomes of these investigations made public? And what options are open to employees where the investigations find that they were unlawfully dismissed?

Senator Abetz —The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has provided the following answer to the honourable Senator’s question:

Question 1: Can the Minister confirm how many terminations that have occurred since the new laws took effect the Office of Workplace Services is currently investigating?

Answer: As at 5 June 2006, the Office of Workplace Services (OWS) was undertaking investigations into terminations involving 15 employers.

Question 2: How many of these investigations have been triggered by the Minister?

Answer: None.

Question 3: Are the outcomes of these investigations made public?

Answer: The OWS informs the employer and the worker(s) directly involved in an investigation of the outcome. OWS does not seek to restrict these parties from publicising the outcome. Where an investigation results in OWS litigation, a media release will generally be issued. One has been issued in every case to date. The OWS will consider making public the outcome of other investigations on a case by case basis, taking account of public interest considerations and privacy laws.

Question 4: And what options are open to employees where the investigations find that they were unlawfully dismissed?

Answer: Under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (WR Act), it is unlawful for an employer to terminate an employee’s employment on certain prohibited grounds.
An employee can apply to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission pursuant to section 643 of the WR Act if they believe their employment was terminated for an unlawful reason.
These are set out in section 659 of the WR Act and include:
temporary absence from work because of illness or injury;
trade union membership or participation in trade union activities;
non-membership of a trade union;
seeking office as a representative of employees;
the filing of a complaint, or the participation in proceedings, against an employer;
race, colour, sex, sexual preference, age, physical or mental disability, marital status, family responsibilities, pregnancy, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin;
refusing to negotiate, sign, extend, vary or terminate an AWA;
absence from work during maternity leave or other parental leave; and
temporary absence from work because of the carrying out of a voluntary emergency management activity.
Employees who believe they have been unlawfully terminated may be eligible to receive up to $4,000 worth of independent legal advice, based on the merits of their claim. They will be eligible for assistance if they have a certificate from the Australian Industrial Relations Commission indicating that their claim has merit and could not be resolved through conciliation. The application for assistance will be assessed by the Office of Workplace Services on the basis of financial need.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Workplace Relations</title>,Questions Without Notice: Additional Answers,7,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2006-06-14,"—Pursuant to standing order 74(5), I ask the Minister for the Environment and Heritage for an explanation as to why answers have not been provided to questions on notice Nos 1708 and 1709, asked on 21 April this year.
—Did you forewarn the minister of the question?
—Yes, I did. I move:
That the Senate take note of the minister’s failure to provide either an answer or an explanation.
We have seen over the last few weeks a very intense debate generated by the Prime Minister about nuclear energy, but my questions go to the minister’s actions with regard to greenhouse emissions. I would have thought that this was a very topical issue at this point in time. To be precise, I asked the minister the following:
(1)           What environmental taxes on cars, petrol, wood and other products have recently been imposed by China.
(2)           Were these environmental taxes negotiated as part of the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate; if not, how do they relate to the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate.
(3)           To what extent is China using market-based mechanisms to address greenhouse abatement and/or avoidance.
(4)           To what extent is each of the other parties to the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate, including Australia, using market-based mechanisms to address greenhouse abatement and/or avoidance.
(5)           To what extent is China using the expansion of nuclear power to address greenhouse abatement and/or avoidance by 2020.
(6)           Does, or will, nuclear power expansion form part of the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate; if so, can details be provided.
(7)           Is it still the case that Australia’s greenhouse emissions are expected to increase by more than 20 per cent above 1990 levels by 2020; if not, what is the anticipated increase.
(8)           How does Australia’s increase above 1990 levels by 2020 compare with each of the other countries in the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate.
There were several other questions along those lines but, of course, we have not heard very much about the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate in recent weeks. The debate has been totally overtaken by questions about whether Australia will move to a nuclear power future and whether we will enrich uranium in this country, ignoring totally what measures would be adopted in order for Australia to reach that massive reduction of 60 per cent on our 1990 greenhouse emission levels.
I also asked the minister a related question, following his answer to another question, which stated:
The Vision Statement for the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate explicitly includes wind power as one of the areas for collaboration by partner countries. However, no decisions have yet been made on specific implementation measures or arrangements. These issues will be discussed at the initial ministerial meeting of partner countries, which will be held in Australia in November 2005.
My questions were about that meeting. I asked:
What were the results of that meeting of partner countries with regard to renewable energy.
What we do know is that the minister has stopped two wind farms. He said today that he has given the okay to one, but two have been stopped—one in his home state, at Denmark, which I happen to know was three small turbines which were set up by a community group there. He stopped that development on the spurious grounds that it did not have community support. It was put up by the community itself as part of remote area renewable power generation, which was negotiated some time ago with the Democrats. I also wanted to know:
Have the industry development mechanisms to accelerate the generation of wind power, as proposed by the Global Wind Energy Council, been agreed to; if not, why.
We have heard nothing about that. The minister tells us all about water labelling, which again is a Democrat initiative, but we hear very little when it comes to the formal procedures which should lock Australia into heading towards these massive reductions in greenhouse energy. I asked:
Have Australia’s commitments to renewables been affected by the decision to invoke the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC) on the Bald Hills Wind Farm: if so, how.
We have heard nothing more about that, after an initial flurry in the papers. I also asked:
Can details be provided on progress with the states and territories through the Ministerial Council on Energy to reduce regulatory and technical impediments to renewable energy uptake, with a particular focus on wind energy.
The minister is so keen on wind, why have we not had answers to those questions? Why do we not have any discussion along these lines? I asked:
(a) What share of the renewable energy market does the Government consider will be captured by Australia’s renewable energy industry in: (i) 2010, (ii) 2015, and (iii) 2020; (b) what would this mean in terms of investment and export income and jobs in Australia; and (c) if no projection has been made, why not.
It is my understanding that no projection has been made. Maybe I should not have even bothered asking that question because it is very unlikely that the minister is at all interested in the wind power sector. He is much more interested, apparently, in taking Australia down the nuclear path. I asked:
What is the current estimate of greenhouse emission abatement and/or avoidance for each of the following Federal Government programs and by when will this be achieved:
(a)           $14 million Wind Energy Forecasting Capability;
(b)           $20 million Advanced Electricity Storage Technologies Program; and
(c)           $100 million Renewable Energy Development Initiative.
These are all reasonable questions. We get the usual diatribe from this minister but we never get any details on how the government programs are going that are supposed to be taking Australia in the right direction with regard to greenhouse and renewable energy. No, we do not hear anything of that sort, which is why we have to put questions like this on notice. The fact that it has taken eight weeks and still there is no sign of an answer to any of those questions suggests to me that this minister has no interest in the subject. The fact that he was not even here, knowing that I was going to ask this question, that he did not even bother to turn up, suggests there is an arrogant disregard for the parliament and its right to know when government money is being expended, what it is being expended on and how successful that is.
I think the government’s performance on this issue is really disappointing. Taking Australia down a path of a debate about nuclear energy is a diversion from all of those questions that I have asked and more that I have not read out. It is avoiding those critical debates about how Australia reaches a situation where it can reduce its greenhouse emissions by 60 per cent. The minister says this is necessary, the Prime Minister says it is necessary and even the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources now says that it is necessary. That is a really good step in the right direction. But, so far, all this government has done with that information, with that acknowledgment, is say, ‘Let us have a debate about nuclear.’
Let us go back to those questions of how we achieve this aim. It is not just a question of coal or nuclear; there is a range of other issues that need to be taken into account and a lot of other sources of energy supply that should be considered. My questions go to the core of this issue. I urge the minister not only to get those answers back to my office as soon as he can but also to answer them with some honesty, which we have not seen much of in this place, and as if they are serious questions—because they are; they are about the future of this country. I ask that they be treated with some seriousness because this minister is supposed to be about looking after the environment and heritage, and the environment is very much tied up with the amount of greenhouse emissions this country emits.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Question Nos 1708 and 1709</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,8,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2006-06-14,"—I was informed by my staff shortly after question time that someone from Senator Allison’s office did contact my office during question time—before question time.
—Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. The minister is misleading the Senate. It was more than an hour ago—probably more like two to 2½ hours ago—that my office rang his office.
—There is no point of order.
—The point of order is that the minister is misleading this house, and I wish to make that point.
—There is no point of order.
—I suggest that the senator is being quite churlish here. I was informed immediately after question time, as I walked back to my office, by one of my staff members that my office had been contacted. I thought it was during question time, but I then corrected myself and said ‘before question time’. We were contacted before question time by a staff member from Senator Allison’s office who said, as is the normal courtesy, that a question was overdue and that it would be raised. That staff member was given an explanation that the question was long and complex. I think if you had the patience to listen to Senator Allison’s immediate contribution you would understand that it was a long and complex question about one of the most important policies before this government—and that is our response to the greenhouse challenge that this country is faced with. We have around $2 billion worth of programs—probably dozens of programs, not to exaggerate—all aimed at addressing the challenge of providing a reliable energy supply to Australia and the world and to do so with significant reductions to greenhouse gases.
So we informed Senator Allison’s staff that we had received from the department the draft response but that it had only been received in my office some 10 days after the date for tabling. All of this information was given to Senator Allison’s staff. It may be that Senator Allison’s staff did not pass the message on to her. But it was very carefully relayed to Senator Allison’s staff that my office had just received those draft responses and that we obviously wanted to give them the sort of diligence that Senator Allison has called for here. All of that was explained to her office, and my staff thought that that was the end of the matter. They thought that we had given a legitimate, sensible and honest explanation and that that would be the end of the matter. As soon as I knew that Senator Allison was on her feet I returned to the chamber. So I think to make an allegation that I have some sort of contempt or arrogance not to address this issue in the parliament is very churlish, unfair and unjustified.
The accusation that we do not take this subject seriously really flies in the face of the facts. Under the leadership of John Howard and the initial leadership of former environment minister Robert Hill, this government has put in place a range of programs over the past decade that are unrivalled in most parts of the world. The government has put in place a comprehensive program to address how you supply energy and transportation to Australia and to the world in a way that brings down our greenhouse gas signature. I will make a couple of points that need to be made repeatedly in this debate. Firstly, Australia has been incredibly successful in meeting this challenge. We will by about 2011, depending on Australia’s economic growth over the next couple of years, have doubled the size of the Australian economy from its size in 1990, which is the year the UNFCCC, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, has chosen to make a benchmark year for emissions. So the Kyoto targets that around 35 per cent of the world, including Australia, have set for themselves use 1990 as a base year.
In that period of time, Mr Deputy President—and a Queenslander would understand this better than most people, and certainly more than a Victorian Democrat senator—Australia’s economy has roughly doubled, and Queensland and Western Australia have led that phenomenal growth which has underpinned so much of the living standard security that people have enjoyed during the nineties and this decade. We have doubled the size of the economy, yet we are on track to achieve a greenhouse signature that is only eight per cent above our 1990 level. Image that: we have doubled the size of the cake economically, doubled the size of industrial production, doubled the output from the economy and massively improved the number of jobs but increased our greenhouse signature by but eight per cent. Is that any sort of signal that we should be complacent? Of course it is not. What we do know is that in the next 10, 20 or 30 years, with good economic management, a good industrial sector, a good productive sector and all of the people of Australia working as hard as they do, we would like to see the economy expand again.
The International Energy Agency predicts that the use of energy in the world will roughly double by 2030, and we know that Australia will probably see a similar sort of expansion in its energy requirements. We also know, as Senator Allison has said, that the Australian government is making a magnificent contribution to the science that is building—a contribution that all Australians and all of the Australian science sector should be proud of. We are committing in excess of $30 million to building that science—to understanding the impacts of human induced climate change, what carbon and methane do when they accumulate in the atmosphere at the sorts of levels that we have seen over the last 100 or so years, what will happen if they keep accumulating at the rate they are accumulating at, what the impacts will be on the climate and what the impacts will be on Australia. We know from all of that science, to which Australian scientists make an extraordinary contribution, kicking way above their weight as a country and scientific community, that we will need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by around 50 to 60 per cent by 2060.
Senator Allison’s question goes to these vital issues. She asks that we respond in detail. Of course, that is exactly what my office will do. But she challenged me in her contribution to answer the question and she said that the government was not serious about renewables. We have hundreds and hundreds of millions of taxpayers’ dollars going into direct investment in research and development of renewables, on wind, on solar, and on solar thermal. I recently opened for the CSIRO their solar centre in Newcastle. This is world-leading technology and development on solar thermal which could see a hybrid technology between solar thermal and gas, increasing the energy coefficient of the gas by around 30 per cent and therefore creating the sort of breakthrough the world needs to store renewable energy—one of the problems that the world needs to get to the nub of—by storing it in an existing fossil fuel. It is what I would call a hybrid technology. The government is pursuing world-leading energy efficiency measures. The energy efficiency legislation that passed through this parliament mandating efficiency measures for major companies and major emitters is world-leading legislation, and we have a range of other efficiency measures.
The questions that Senator Allison asks me to provide answers to her office on will in fact cover this, but we will make the point, when we answer the question with the detail and diligence and the honesty that she should expect from the government and from me on these issues, that the solution to the dual policy dilemma of stabilising and reducing greenhouse gas emissions and of providing reliable energy to Australians so that we can have job security is a multitrack and multifaceted approach. We also need to supply energy to the world so that those in developing countries who do not enjoy our living standards can at least aspire to them, and that too will be part of that multitrack, multifaceted approach.
People on the Left—and the Democrats I think could be accused of this—will tell you that you can do it all without addressing the coal issue; that you can get rid of coal, move away from fossil fuels and just go for renewables and energy efficiency. That is a very dangerous proposition because it is false and it will lead people down the wrong path. It cannot be done. All of the expert advice around the world coalesces around the fact that you need to use all of the available technologies, invest in all of them, and bring them all on as quickly as possible if you are to reach that dual goal: energy reliability and security and lower greenhouse gas emissions. I may seek to incorporate this graph in Hansard, if Hansard has got full colour, because I think that this one stabilisation triangle graph from Princeton University tells the picture better than any thousand words I can ever put down. It shows on the left-hand axis where you have got rising levels of—
—We do not think, from the picture you have shown us, that it will be able to be incorporated or in a way that will do justice to it.
—I might just table it for the edification of senators from all parties. As I said, people on the Left try to tell you that you can just do it with renewable energy and energy efficiency. People on the Right will say that you can do it with nuclear power. I put to the Senate that both of them are equally wrong. There is no silver bullet in nuclear power and there is equally no silver bullet in renewable energy or energy efficiency. The reality is that we need to invest and bring on technologies in all of these areas, in renewable energies and fuels. The Australian government are investing enormously in solar and in wind turbines, with $3 billion worth of cross-subsidies to wind energy. We approved one last week and another one today. We will build around 600 turbines under the existing program. Before 1996 there were 20; there will be 600 by the end of the current program, and we are investing more. We believe that we need to continue to build wind energy, so we are doing a wind-forecasting program to predict where wind turbines should be located so that they create the best efficiency and the best outcome. I will be taking to my ministerial counterparts at the Environment Protection and Heritage Ministers Council in Sydney on Friday week a proposal for a national wind farm code so that we can get a sensible planning approach to wind farming.
We know that we need to do carbon capture and storage. I welcome the Victorian and Queensland Labor governments coming on board and supporting the federal coalition’s Low Emissions Technology Demonstration Fund, with $500 million being matched by the Queensland government and the Victorian government with lesser amounts and by the coal industry with $300 million, to see if we can get that breakthrough in capturing the carbon at the top of the smokestacks of coal-burning power stations and geosequestering it or in finding ways to make coal burn more cleanly.
We know that that is one of the technologies that you have to have. If you set that aside and say that you should not put money into cleaning up coal, you know that the problem cannot be solved. I refer to an eminent person on this issue, arguably one of the best informed in the world, and that is Eileen Claussen, the head of the Pugh Center’s climate change project which Australia participated in through Howard Bamsey and the dialogue at Pocantico, a two-year dialogue. She and a group of people from all around the world including Howard Bamsey, the head of the Australian Greenhouse Office, participated in this two-year project. Eileen Claussen, who was President Clinton’s climate change negotiator, said to me at a breakfast at the Montreal climate change function that she hosted that one of the immutable truths that she got out of the project was that if we do not get a breakthrough in carbon capture and storage of fossil fuels we will not solve the problem. She was not saying: don’t do all the other stuff. More than anyone else she would say that you have got to do all the other stuff. She would totally agree with this approach. But she said that one of the absolute do-or-die things for the planet is carbon capture and storage. So a member of the Clinton White House, a very well-informed person, says that you have got to do this. To those people from the Left or the Right who say it is wacky and you cannot do it and you cannot sequester carbon, firstly, I say: go to Norway and see where they have done it in Sleipner in huge quantities. Secondly, I say: go and look at the Gorgon proposal on the North-West Shelf where they intend the biggest sequestration ever anywhere in the world.
We also need a breakthrough in the efficiency of our vehicles. We need fuel efficiency, we need emissions efficiency and we need to transform our transport fleet in Australia and around the world, massively. We need fuel switching. We need to find a way to encourage people to move more to gas. The Queensland government has once again taken a lead in that area by creating a policy to move to gas. By switching to gas, you get a nearly 50 per cent reduction in greenhouse gases. We also need to globally—and this will be in the answer that Senator Allison is chasing—transform our landscape. We in Australia are leading in this area. We need to stop deforestation and to plant more trees not only for commercial reasons but also for environmental reasons.
As you would know, Mr Deputy President, we have revegetated something like 2.1 million hectares, we have invested $4 billion through our natural resource management programs, and Australia has a marvellous story to tell in relation to stopping deforestation and seeing more forests planted. Further, we need to transform our agricultural sector. We need to do all of these things. We need to move to low tillage to stop nitrogen and methane being released into the atmosphere. Senator Allison is absolutely correct about this: it is an incredibly serious issue.
We have got to get the economics of this right and we have got to get the environmental consequences of it right. That is why the Prime Minister has said that the security of the world’s energy supplies, Australia’s role in energy supplies and the greenhouse side of the equation are so serious and so important that you cannot leave one of these seven segments out of the equation. Anyone on the Left who says you have got to leave nuclear out of the equation is creating the same problem as anyone on the Right who says that renewables should be left out. They are both as bad as each other. You have to do nuclear as well. Imagine a world where we said no to nuclear. You would see France closing down 75 per cent of its power and reverting to coal or gas. That would be brilliant! Well done, Democrats—great idea! You would see the United States closing down the 20 per cent of its power that is coming from nuclear—as Senator John McCain told me on 2 January. How stupid it would be to say no to nuclear, which the Democrats would have you do, and to see the United States importing more coal, gas or oil to burn. It is the sort of idiocy that you expect from the Australian Democrats.
If this problem is going to be solved, you need to work in each one of these seven areas. You need to invest heavily in them, and the great thing about the Australian government—and all Australians should be proud of this—is that we are investing in renewables. We are investing in solar and we are investing in wind. We are investing in energy efficiency and we are investing in carbon capture and storage. We are putting massive investments into alternative energies and alternatives fuels, and we are putting massive investments into the biofuels industry, fuel switching, forests and soils. And now, because of the leadership of the Prime Minister, we are not shying from a debate that we have shied away from for too long, and that is: how do we use our uranium resources to help solve this global challenge of reliable energy, a clean future and a low greenhouse future?
I look forward to delivering to Senator Allison a comprehensive answer, diligently and honestly prepared, to all of those questions. I apologise for my office not advising me that she would get to her feet and raise this issue here today. There was clearly a breakdown in communications. My office thought that we had, through one phone call, given Senator Allison’s office a sensible and reasonable response to the query and that it would be entirely unnecessary for her to stand up here. But I do undertake to get that answer to her as quickly as I possibly can.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2006-06-14,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of answers given by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Senator Vanstone) to questions without notice asked by opposition senators today relating to skills shortages and to detention practices.
What we heard today at question time really misses the point of the debate. The minister had the opportunity to bring all her colleagues to heel, but what we have found is that the government is still very much divided on this issue. And no wonder, when you look at the issues that were brought before the committee that looked into the Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill 2006. What a name. Most submissions and witnesses before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee put to the committee that the bill represents a flawed domestic policy in a number of key areas, it breaches Australia’s obligations under international law, particularly under the refugee convention of 1951, and it represents deficient foreign policy in terms of a perceived attempt to appease Indonesia over situations in West Papua.
Perhaps it is worth while explaining briefly what the bill does. This bill provides what this government brought in in 2001, which was the Pacific solution. It will mean that the offshore processing regime will apply to all persons arriving on mainland Australia unlawfully by sea. It does not try to differentiate as to whether those persons arrive by canoe, cargo ship or cruise liner. But I suspect the minister will sort that out, using her own discretion.
Therein lies one of the problems. The bill will also cover certain air arrivals, where a person travels most of the way to Australia by sea but travels the last leg by air. So we have got this enormous piece of legislation which will change the way these things are dealt with. We have a government report which unanimously recommends that this bill not proceed because of the matters that I have already mentioned. It is wrong. The report states:
… the Bill is an inappropriate response to what is essentially a foreign policy issue.
What this report shows is what Australians had already recognised—that is, you cannot fix this piece of legislation. There are no amendments that can be moved that will affect the law of Papua New Guinea, where people are dumped on Manus Island. The legislation is about pretending Australia has no border and dumping people in other countries. There is no way of amending Australian law to prevent that from being anything other than offensive, anything other than throwing away every single human right obligation that Australia considers part of the concept of a fair go.
We already knew Mr John Howard was willing to listen to Indonesian politicians. We now get to find out whether he is willing to listen to Australian politicians. Without exception, the Australian politicians who have been looking closely at the evidence have said that there is no way to fix this piece of legislation and the only way to fix it is in fact to vote no. It is unamendable. The majority government report went on to try to ameliorate its effects. It is irredeemable, and they know it. That is why they said at the outset that it should not be proceeded with. No matter what form the legislation ends up in, you cannot take away its effect. That involves dumping people in other countries and pretending that Australia has no borders.
There are no amendments that will cause us to end up supporting this bill. Labor will be voting against this bill. It is wrong on every count, on every point. The government knows that but they are going to persist with it. More importantly, the government backbenchers know that, and we will be interested to see how they feel about it. We have already heard today that there has been a bit of minor revolt over there—a bit of minor scurrying about—but guess what? I think that at the end of the day they will lock in, because they like their comfy zone over there and they are not prepared to take it up to Senator Vanstone and tell her that the legislation is wrong, that she should desist and that she should realise that it is a wrong piece— (Time expired)

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2006-06-14,"—The bill that is currently being considered is, it has to be pointed out, quite a lengthy one and is still under consideration. The committee has suggested that its work was supposedly significantly hampered by the absence or limited availability of critical information and also by the provision of documentation that it says provided only a minimalist framework for the proposed system. I understand that the department in fact provided a lot of detailed information in relation to the current arrangements regarding both Nauru and Papua New Guinea. This covered details of such things as accommodation, health care, education, arrangements for processing asylum claims, access to legal assistance and opportunities for monitoring by the Commonwealth Ombudsman. Let us not forget that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has foreshadowed that a number of reviews are also being undertaken in relation to practical arrangements for offshore processing, such as community accommodation arrangements for women, children and families.
What I would like to do in the limited time I have available to me is to just focus a little bit on what this new legislation will actually mean. What it means practically is that people who arrive, unauthorised, by sea will no longer be able to make a protection visa application by reaching the mainland rather than an excised place. People who arrive in Australia by sea and seek asylum will be processed offshore. People found to be refugees will remain offshore while resettlement is arranged. As under the existing provisions, the minister will have a personal, non-compellable power to allow a person to make a valid visa application in Australia.
Australia will continue to meet its international obligations as far as refugee processing goes. Australia has a very, very good record in relation to its intake of refugees and its processing in this area. Any claims to refugee status will be properly assessed at an offshore location in accordance with the provisions of the refugee convention. As I said, Australia will continue to meet its international obligations in relation to refugee processing.
I remind the Senate that the refugee convention does not set down any particular process for signatory countries to decide who are refugees. This is a matter for each country to determine. Australia will ensure that reliable refugee assessment processes are in place. The Australian government and the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs have taken several opportunities to brief the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees on the operation of the proposed new arrangements, and I am sure that the department will continue to do so as the new arrangements are further articulated.
I want to take the opportunity to make some general comments in relation to what is a constant attack on the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs that we see in this chamber. I think we need to look at the department in a wider context. This is a department that makes in excess of four million decisions a year. It administers a large and complex migration and refugee program. In terms of statistics, in addition to the 43 per cent of Australians who either are born overseas or have at least one parent born overseas, Australia is host to a large number of temporary entrants. In December 2005, for example, there were around three-quarters of a million people in this country on a temporary basis. Just to illustrate my point in relation to the department that makes four million decisions a year, in the five minutes or so that I am speaking today, the department has considered and granted around 45 visas and around 225 people have entered and left our country, which is almost one a second.

"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2006-06-14,"—I rise to take note of answers given by Senator Vanstone in question time today. I asked a number of questions of Minister Vanstone in relation to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee report that was tabled in the Senate yesterday on the Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill 2006. As has been said in the chamber here this afternoon on a number of occasions, the Senate committee of which I am a member recommended that the bill should not proceed. The committee report has endorsed what Australians worked out long ago, that this bill is fundamentally wrong and should not become law. Let me explain why. There are a number of reasons but I only have a short period of time in which to speak so I will try to identify some of the key problems with the bill. As we know, the result of the reforms that were enacted last year by way of the Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005 means that, not before time, Australia now has a somewhat softer edge on mandatory detention. As we know, that bill resulted in children not being held on the mainland in detention centres.
The effect of this bill before the Senate now is that all of the changes that were made last year mean nothing. What the bill will do, as well as not ensuring that children will be kept out of detention, is remove reasonable time periods of detainment and improvements in the provision of mental care. One of the questions that I addressed to Senator Vanstone today was in relation to the Commonwealth Ombudsman’s jurisdiction over persons held in detention. The minister said today that her understanding was that the Commonwealth Ombudsman would still have jurisdiction in relation to persons being held in Nauru. This is in fact what the department said to the committee. They confirmed that the Ombudsman’s jurisdiction does extend to processing on Nauru. But when we questioned them further it was made quite clear that this would still be contingent on the government of Nauru granting a visa to the Ombudsman to travel to Nauru. As we heard in the evidence before us, it is a very rare occurrence for the Nauruan government to grant a visa to persons wishing to visit there to observe and investigate what is happening to people in detention.
This is not something which is within the control of the Australian government. If the Nauruan government determines that the Ombudsman is not to be granted a visa, then he—as is the present case—will not be able to go to Nauru and investigate. It is also quite clear, and this came out in the evidence, that the requirement in part 8C of the Migration Act that the Commonwealth Ombudsman provide reports on persons held in detention for more than two years will not apply in relation to persons held in offshore processing locations. So the improvement put into place last year in relation to detainees held in Australian detention centres, namely that the Ombudsman will be required to investigate the reasons for their detention if they have been held for a period greater than two years, simply will not occur on Nauru. This is one of the many problems that exist in this bill. As Senator Ludwig said, it is for this reason that the committee reported unanimously that the bill should not proceed. It is for this reason that Labor will be voting against this bill when it comes before the Senate.
This bill can hardly be said to be for border protection. In fact, if it is passed Australia will effectively have no border in relation to those persons coming here by boat seeking asylum. All of those people who are seeking asylum in this country who reach the mainland by boat will be taken away and put into mandatory detention on Nauru. The primary reason, as I have indicated, that this is totally unacceptable is that the processes that occur on Nauru are not subject to independent review. I have mentioned the Ombudsman, but also any decisions that are made are not subject to independent review. The RRT does not have jurisdiction in relation to decisions made. Any decisions that are made will simply be reviewed by another departmental officer. (Time expired)

"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2006-06-14,"—I also rise to take note of the answers of Minister Vanstone. I will commence by commenting on some of the remarks of Senator Kirk a moment ago. There is a lot of presupposition that people who arrive illegally and are processed offshore are not going to be catered for. That is just not true. This is a government that will not stand by and allow people not to be cared and catered for in a humane and dignified way. I think that needs to be clearly stated and placed on the record. We are talking about border security as well as the matters of the report handed down by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee yesterday. We must understand that intelligence has been presented to this government that there are more people staging a process to move to Australia. We have to protect our borders in every possible way we can and also the lives of those who want to endanger themselves in coming to this country by means regarded as very substandard. I think it is very responsible of this government to create a deterrent effect to prevent people embarking on the most dangerous of voyages that they possibly could, endangering the lives of women and children, not to mention the male adults that would accompany them.
As indicated earlier today, the Senate committee report handed down yesterday is very comprehensive. It was only released yesterday, and I think it takes some time for anyone, let alone a government, to consider all the points in detail. This is a government that does that. It considers many things in detail. It examines each and every point in the report and will, where necessary, respond. I think that is the most responsible attitude that any government or any administration can take.
I also think it is important to note that the department itself has undergone tremendous transformation under the guidance of Mr Andrew Metcalfe. This department is one that has grown, developed, improved and responded to ever-changing scenery, an ever-changing feast of activities and an ever-changing host of problems that are presented to it. I think it is commendable that we have a department in a reformation process and constantly adjusting, as many departments need to do.
I think we need to be cognisant of some of the aspects of the report that were handed down yesterday, and my colleague Senator Fierravanti-Wells has indicated some of these. It is important to emphasise that the committee has suggested that its work was significantly hampered by the absence or limited availability of critical information and by documentation that provided only a minimalist framework for the proposed system. With that background, we need to understand that this report is not overly comprehensive in some areas. This report goes some way to guide the government, but it is not a complete document in itself; it is for guidance. Also, we need to understand that the report covered details of accommodation, health care and education arrangements for processing asylum claims, together with access to legal assistance and opportunities for monitoring by the Commonwealth Ombudsman.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—I note that senators opposite indicate that the Commonwealth Ombudsman may have fettered access. The Ombudsman will have access to asylum seekers as and when necessary and this government will support that process.
—There is no guarantee of that.
—I hear interjections from the other side about no guarantee. This government will stand by the need to ensure that there is that independent Ombudsman capability, and we will facilitate that in any way we possibly can. It is important to point out, certainly in relation to the alleged lack of information provided by the department, that the majority report states at page 59:
3.197 Despite the volume of evidence received, the committee has been significantly hampered by the absence or limited availability of critical information to assist with its deliberations in this inquiry. This is primarily due to the Bill and associated documentation providing only a minimalist framework for the proposed system. As a result, the committee has been forced to rely on information provided by the Department since the Bill was referred for inquiry to ‘fill in the gaps’.
It clearly states ‘to rely on information provided by the department’. The department is a complex and multidisciplined department that is dealing with a myriad of issues. (Time expired)

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2006-06-14,"—I rise to take note of the answers from Senator Vanstone today. In particular I want to note and highlight the lack of commitment from this minister to actually take this report seriously, and I want to pick up on a couple of comments I have heard in the last half an hour. We had two days of hearings into this bill. I note with interest that the government did not wheel out any of its members of the committee to actually stand before us in taking note to defend or to provide comment on their own report today—an interesting fact.
There were a number of problems in terms of information provided to the committee during the hearing, particularly on Tuesday last week in Sydney, where the department was not able to provide answers and in fact failed to even send anybody—if I remember correctly—to the proceedings in the morning. There was actually no-one from the department sitting in the public hearing for the first four hours taking notes to enable any senators to refer to the department for clarification of what was being said. I do not think I have sat in very many Senate committees in my time in this parliament where someone from the department has not at least been at the back of the room watching and listening to what was being said. The absence was particularly notable given the department was due to appear at 1 o’clock that afternoon.
Senator Parry, you are right: the lack of detail about this bill is because your government has not worked it out. The department was not able to provide us with this information and this detail. Of 136 submissions received, one wanted the bill supported—and that was your department. The 136 submissions included a large representation from churches and from the Refugee Council of Australia, which represents over 80 organisations defending the rights of refugees. Large organisations such as those can see nothing in this bill that warrants any of it being supported. In fact, as we left the committee hearing last week, I thought, ‘It will be a surprise to me if the government members can find anything in the two days of hearings that will lead them to want to support this bill being passed.’ I was not surprised when I got the chair’s draft to find that the major recommendation of this report was that the bill should not proceed. I want to commend the chair of this committee for actually coming up with that conclusion. Quite frankly, she had no other option but to do that.
It is disappointing today that we have not heard from the minister that the report is going to be taken seriously and that a response will be provided as soon as possible. In light of the massive criticism around this country and given that three of the minister’s own government members who signed up to this report do not want the bill to proceed, it is disappointing to hear from the minister that this bill is still going to proceed. There is an article in the Age today—more likely the editorial—headed ‘Human rights should not take a back seat to appeasement’. It points out that only in January this minister, Minister Vanstone, pledged that the department would not be swayed by foreign policy considerations in deciding refugee claims. But that is exactly what this bill is about.
This bill is about decisions of immigration policy being made independently of our relationship with Indonesia. But that is not what is happening here. Indonesia have got their fingers in the pie of our immigration policy now and will dictate to us, and this government has responded and changed the policy and will want to change the laws accordingly. That is clearly evident in the report and it was clear in the evidence that was given to the committee. This is a bill that excises Australia from the rest of the world and from our international obligations. There is no justification for it and there are no reasons for us to believe otherwise, given the evidence that we were provided with during the public hearings. The claims about the Ombudsman are absolutely and totally incorrect and were justified and backed up by the department. There will be access to the Ombudsman only to appeal decisions of Commonwealth officials. (Time expired)

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2006-06-14,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I give notice that 15 sitting days after today Senator Watson shall move that the following legislative instruments, a list of which I shall hand to the Clerk, be disallowed.
The list read as follows—
Airworthiness Directive Part 39-105—AD/750XL/6: Centre Console Wiring Loom made under subregulation 39(1) of the Civil Aviation Safety Regulations 1998
Civil Aviation Order 82.1 Amendment Order (No. 2) 2006 made under paragraph 28BA(1)(b) of the Civil Aviation Act 1988
Instrument No. CASA 49/06 made under subregulations 42ZC(6) and 308(1) of the Civil Aviation Regulations 1988
I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a short summary of the matters raised by the committee.
Leave granted.
The summary read as follows—

Airworthiness Directive Part 39-105—AD/750XL/6: Centre Console Wiring Loom

This Airworthiness Directive requires an inspection of the wiring loom and the installation of additional mechanical protection for the wiring and tie-wraps for the Pacific Aerospace 750XL Series Aeroplanes. The Directive was made on 9 December 2005 and became effective from that date. It is nevertheless numbered as 2/2006 TX. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking advice on the numbering of this instrument.

Civil Aviation Order 82.1 Amendment Order (No. 2) 2006

This Order permits flight crew competency checks to be carried out by overseas flight simulator training organisations. According to the Explanatory Statement, it has been the practice of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority to permit one of the two annual competency checks to be carried out by overseas trainers, the second check being carried out in Australia. The stated purpose of this Order is to put this administrative practice onto a more certain legal footing. It is not clear, however, whether it is intended by this Order that both of the annual competency checks may now be carried out by overseas trainers. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking advice on this matter.

Instrument No. CASA 49/06

This instrument revokes a previous instrument (CASA 579/05) dealing with the supervision requirements for aircraft polishers.
The Explanatory Statement to this present instrument states that the revocation is necessary because the scope of the previous instrument has been misinterpreted, leading to possible concerns for aircraft safety. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking advice about the nature of this misinterpretation and its effect on aircraft safety to assist in its consideration of any future instrument that might be made in substitution for the revoked instrument.

Senator Bob Brown to move on Tuesday, 20 June 2006:
That the Senate—
notes that:
microcredit is a particularly effective and sustainable means of eradicating poverty,
microcredit borrowers, particularly women, generate income that allows them to feed, clothe, educate and care for the health of their children,
to date, 66.6 million people in the world have been reached with microcredit services,
Goal 1 of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) seeks to eradicate poverty, while its 2015 target is to reduce by half the number of people living on less that $1 per day,
if the new Microcredit Summit goal of having 175 million of the world’s poorest families receiving microcredit was reached by 2015, then nearly half the MDG target would be met,
Australia spent $14.5 million on microcredit in the 2005-06 aid budget which is 0.6 per cent of the aid budget, and
the United States of America, which has funded microcredit longer than most donor countries has established an international benchmark for microcredit spending, being 1.25 per cent of the aid budget; and
urges the Government to:
agree to support the new Microcredit Summit goal of having 175 million of the world’s poorest receiving microcredit by 2015 as a means of achieving the MDGs, and
increase the proportion of money it allocates to microcredit to 1.25 per cent of the budget.

Senator Siewert to move on the next day of sitting:
That the time for the presentation of the report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee on water policy initiatives be extended to 30 November 2006.

Senator Siewert to move on the next day of sitting:
That the Senate—
recognises that unregulated high seas bottom trawling is inconsistent with international law as recognised in the United Nations (UN) Convention on the Law of the Sea;
commends the Government for its initiatives in developing long-term governance arrangements to address destructive fishing practices such as illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing and high sea bottom trawling;
calls on the Government to report on its actions to inform a review of progress and future recommendations to address the destructive impacts on deep sea ecosystems, as requested by the UN, and which was to have been provided by 1 May 2006;
notes that:
these governance measures will take time to develop and implement and the need, therefore, for interim short-term measures, such as a global moratorium on high seas bottom trawling, and
the UN General Assembly will consider a proposal for a global moratorium on high seas bottom trawling in October or November 2006; and
calls on the Government to support interim measures to address the destructive impacts of bottom trawling on deep sea ecosystems while long‑term governance measures are put in place.

Senator Bartlett to move on the next day of sitting:
That the following bill be introduced: A Bill for an Act to amend the Migration Act 1958 to return excised offshore places to Australia’s migration zone, and for related purposes. Migration Legislation Amendment (Migration Zone Excision Repeal) Bill 2006.

Senator Nettle to move on the next day of sitting:
That the Senate—
notes:
the increasing conflict in West Papua and the systematic abuse of the human rights of West Papuans by the Indonesian military and police,

Proposal to refer a bill to a committee


Name of bill(s):

Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 2006 and Petroleum Resource Rent Tax (Instalment Transfer Interest Charge Imposition) Bill 2006

Reasons for referral/principal issues for consideration

The primary concern in this Bill relates to Schedule 3 which amends the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax to allow the present value of expected future expenditures associated with closing down a particular petroleum project, where these future expenditures relate to so much of this project as continues to be used under an infrastructure licence, to be deductible against the PRRT receipts of this project.
It relates to ‘closing down’ costs when a project is terminated. Costs from this project are allowed to be offset against revenue until the project ends. Under this provision the Parliament has been asked to support a provision that allows proposed future expenditure of an unsuccessful project to be used as a deduction against PRRT as long as an infrastructure licence is held. However, the expenditure has not even been made, and the deduction is claimed now.
The definition of expected expenditure is loose and needs clarification, while Treasury and industry should also be asked to justify schedule 3 and indicate whether these are sufficient integrity safeguards to protect against tax avoidance.
This measure has been presented to the parliament before and has been subject to Senate review.

That the Senate take note of the reports.
I seek leave to incorporate my tabling statement in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—

HMAS Cairns Redevelopment, Cairns, Queensland;

The ninth report of 2006 addresses the redevelopment of HMAS Cairns for the Department of Defence, at an estimated cost of $76.3 million.
Defence submitted that the purpose of the proposed works is to provide facilities at HMAS Cairns for the berthing and effective operation of the new ARMIDALE Class Patrol Boats; and to refurbish and reinvest in ageing base infrastructure. This will be achieved by the acquisition of increased berthing access at the adjacent commercial wharf; and the refurbishment of existing shore facilities at HMAS Cairns.
One of the issues raised in submissions to the inquiry was regarding proposed property acquisition by Defence. At the public hearing the Committee heard evidence from representatives of Defence, the Cairns Navy League and the Training Ship Endeavour on this matter. After questioning witnesses, it became clear to the Committee that there were still unresolved issues and further consultation and negotiation had to be undertaken by Defence. At the hearing Defence reaffirmed its commitment to the Training Ship Endeavour and to working with all stakeholders to resolve the property acquisition issue in the best interest of the cadets. As a result the Committee recommends that the Department of Defence keep it informed of progress and the outcome of negotiations in respect to the acquisition by Defence of the Training Ship Endeavour land and facilities.
Defence submitted that an Environmental Impact Assessment undertaken at HMAS Cairns had identified certain requirements for the construction work that would be incorporated into the project’s Construction and Environmental Management Plan (CEMP). Defence added that in addition to the project-specific CEMP, HMAS Cairns already has a Base Environmental Management Plan which is currently under review. The Committee recommends that the Department of Defence supply it with an updated copy of the HMAS Cairns Base Environmental Management Plan which has will be amended to include the new works.
Having given detailed consideration to the proposal, the Committee recommends that the proposed HMAS Cairns Redevelopment proceed at the estimated cost of $76.3 million.

Construction of Housing for Defence at Fairview Rise, Ipswich, Queensland

The Committee’s tenth report of 2006 presents findings in relation to the proposed construction of housing for Defence at Fairview Rise, Ipswich, Queensland, with the Defence Housing Authority as the proponent agency for the work.
The purpose of the proposed work is to provide modern community standard housing to meet the operational needs of the Australian Defence Force and the requirements of Defence in south-east Queensland, particularly for Australian Defence Force members located at RAAF Base Amberley.
The long term Defence planning for RAAF Base Amberley has contributed to the increase in the Australian Defence Force housing requirement forecast for the Ipswich area. The site of Fairview Rise is located close to community facilities, shops and schools, and is approximately six kilometres from Ipswich and eight kilometres from RAAF Base Amberley.
All proposed 162 DHA residences will be four-bedroom detached housing with ensuite, family room, double garage and at least 18 square metres of covered outdoor living area.
The Committee inspected the site of the proposed development and conducted a public hearing in Ipswich on 16 May 2006. Issues explored at the hearing included house design, project delivery, traffic considerations, consultation and a range of environmental issues.
At the public hearing, the Committee sought assurance from DHA that adequate water, electricity, gas and telecommunications connectivity would be provided to the site. Whilst DHA were able to confirm the provision of these sites services, however could not at the time confirm broadband internet facilitation for the site. Given the growing demand and importance of this service, the Committee recommends that DHA advise it on the provision of broadband connectivity within the Fairview Rise estate.
DHA stated in its statement of evidence that an extended bus route could be introduced to the site bringing the majority of residents to within 400 metres of the nearest bus stop. After further questioning DHA confirmed that the main arteries are sufficient to accommodate a bus route, however are still in discussion with the Ipswich City Council for an extended bus route. In this regard the Committee recommends that DHA advise it on the provision of an extended bus route for the site.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2006-06-14,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I wish to take note of this report, because I think it is a subject which is of critical importance to the wellbeing of most of Australia’s vulnerable citizens. Sadly, I think there are few areas of public policy which have suffered more under the 10 years of the Howard government than their neglect of housing and urban development. Public housing, funded under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement, has borne the brunt of this neglect.
This report that we have here today highlights the need in the opinion of the ANAO to improve the level of accountability and transparency of the reporting for the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement performance against agreed outcomes. Despite the fact that we have had Commonwealth-state agreements since 1945, a proposition is being advanced by this government that, essentially, questions of housing are matters of state responsibility and, if they are not matters of state responsibility, they are matters for the market. Despite the fact that we have had a Commonwealth-state agreement on housing for 61 years, this government claims that it knows nothing about it and that it has no responsibility for it. There is no minister for housing, no housing programs to speak of and no sense of the government’s responsibility to ensure that there is adequate equality of opportunity for all Australians. Particularly with regard to public housing, which is funded under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement, we see that this government has overseen a savage record of neglect.
The ANAO report talks a lot about risks and risk management. It notes that FaCSIA did undertake a risk assessment in response to its previous report in 1999-2000. It also notes that the current department that assumes responsibility for housing matters consulted only one stakeholder in its response. In other words, of the eight states and territories, only one was consulted. This is despite the vastly different issues and pressures that are faced by the states and territories with regard to the question of housing. I strongly endorse the ANAO’s suggestion that the department undertake a comprehensive risk assessment and that it broaden its consultation during the risk assessment process to encompass the full range of state and non-government stakeholders.
The Australian National Audit Office suggests that the risk assessment take place as part of the development of future agreements. But, at the moment, the greatest risk of all to social housing in this country is whether or not there will be future agreements. There is widespread concern amongst the stakeholders, be they state or territory governments, non-government organisations or providers of different types. Great concern has been put directly to me that there are constant rumours that the Howard government intends to walk away from public housing altogether when the current Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement expires. So this may be the last Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement if the government has its way.
Those fears are based on a rational assessment of the government’s performance to date. They are rational assessments based on what the government has actually done. Under the existing Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement, over the last 10 years real dollar support has declined by 30 per cent. There has been a 30 per cent cut in the level of funding support for public housing by this government. That is particularly shocking when we understand that secure, affordable housing is square one when we are talking about the opportunity for all Australians to get a fair go in this country. Having a decent place to live is the building block for almost everything else in life, whether it be finding a job, accessing education and training, or maintaining your health, social connections, friends and family. It is square one in terms of your social wellbeing.
Few areas of government policy hold a clearer mirror to a government’s values than its attitude to housing. The Howard government attitude is that the market is king with regard to the interests of housing, and provision of the housing needs of our most vulnerable citizens is, at best, perfunctory. Poor services for poor people are what this government can be characterised as standing for. It does not see that it actually has any obligations in this regard. Its reduction in funding to the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement by almost a third has left the state housing authorities basically broke. Around Australia, it is the same story.
One particular example which I think is characteristic of the current situation is that of South Australia. In South Australia, the state authority receives $67 million a year in Commonwealth funding under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. The CSHA has to repay $65 million per year for debt on loan repayments. So, in effect, the net Commonwealth contribution to South Australia for public housing is $2 million a year. That is the situation. The average age of existing housing stock in South Australia is 44 years. Fifty-four per cent of that stock has at least three bedrooms. All but 67 per cent of new applicants, however, are single people. So there is very old, obsolete stock being put in place and quite significant changes in the way in which people are seeking to use that stock. This is at a time when the Commonwealth has reduced its contribution to the provision of new stock by 30 per cent.
As a consequence of that policy, over the last 10 years the number of dwelling units available under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement arrangements has fallen from 372,134 in 1996 to 345,000 units as at the last available figures in 2003-04. That is a drop of 27,000 units in a 10-year period, at a time when the demand for housing has grown dramatically and when the cost of housing has risen to extraordinary levels. As a result of the reduction in stock and the availability of accommodation, the government policy has forced upon the states changes in the sorts of people who are able to use that stock. The number of new people getting assistance under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement has fallen from 50,000 in 1996 to 25,000 this year. There has been a drop of half in the number of new people. As a result, only half as many people have access to the moneys provided by this parliament. It is expected that by 2009 there will only be 15,000 each year who will access that stock.
So we have a reduction in funding, a change in the people who are getting access to it and a situation where people are poorer, their needs are greater and their opportunities to get into the private housing market are more limited. This is at a time when the housing market in the private sector is becoming increasingly expensive. The Commonwealth says: ‘We now have Commonwealth rent assistance arrangements.’ It is a disingenuous claim because the government uses figures based on the situation after its massive cuts to the programs in 1996. It claims that from 1997 rent assistance can be compared to current figures. In 1996, there was a reduction of some $200 million in Commonwealth assistance. If we take that into account and compare like with like, we see that rent assistance over this period has increased by 0.3 per cent. So we have increasing needs but no increase in the level of support from the Commonwealth. If we combine the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement funds and the Commonwealth rent assistance funds in the period from 1996 to 2004 in constant dollars, we see a reduction in the level of funding by some $310 million. The Howard government spent over $300 million less on housing assistance in 2003-04 than it did in the period from 1996, when it came into office. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>AUDITOR-GENERAL’S REPORTS</title>,<title>Report No. 46 of 2005-06</title>,Auditor-General's Reports,21,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-06-14,"—This Audit Office report is into the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. It is a follow-up audit on an earlier audit of the operation of that very, very important agreement between the Commonwealth and the states—and indeed the territories as well—on funding for the provision of public and community housing.
Let me first note the positive, which is that the Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs has made significant progress in implementing the recommendations from the previous National Audit Office report into this area. But there are a couple of aspects that I do think need highlighting from this current report, most notably the finding that the timeliness and performance reporting, particularly through the Housing Assistance Act annual report, needs improvement.
This is something I have commented on myself in this chamber a number of times so I am pleased to see that the Audit Office agrees with me. As the report states here, throughout the 1999 Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement the annual report was tabled in parliament between 16 and 32 months after the associated reporting year. This improves slightly for the first report provided under the 2003 CSHA which was tabled 15 months after the end of the associated reporting year. That is still, in my view, grossly inadequate. We are talking about reporting on the data, on the performance of all the states and territories in conjunction with the Commonwealth, in fulfilling the components of the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement, which is a significant amount of money—more than $1 billion a year—and also the data about how that money is being spent and delivered with regard to housing.
The department has suggested that it will endeavour to have the annual report—only endeavour, I might say—tabled by June of the year following the end of the grant reporting year. Whilst that is an improvement, I again agree with the Audit Office that it would be of benefit for it to be tabled earlier. I realise that there are limitations because data needs to be provided from the states and territories before it can be collated and presented to this parliament, but it is a crucial area where there have been significant failures, and obviously the blame for those failures needs to also rest with some of the state and territory governments.
The Audit Office also believes there is further scope for improvement of the information on the CSHA contained in the annual report and in the family and community services annual report as well. That is not a view that should be dismissed lightly. We have reports on this provision of public money into this very important area of public and community housing around the country. The reports are presented about 16 months after the appropriate reporting year and, even when they are presented, the amount of data is still inadequate. That is unacceptable and, in my view, it signals an attitude at federal level—and I fear at state level as well in some areas—that this area of public and community housing is really not that important any more. It has been turned into a residual housing area, it is seen as a welfare issue, an afterthought or a bottom end of the market view, and it really does not get the attention it deserves.
I remind all senators and the public in general that there have been studies conducted, including by very dry economic evaluating institutes such as the Productivity Commission and, more significantly, the former Industry Commission, which showed that using public money to provide public housing was the most efficient way of using public money to deliver housing outcomes. It is certainly more efficient than the huge amount of money that is spent at federal level now on rent assistance. I am not saying that rent assistance should be cut but I do say that if more focus was put on providing public and community housing it would actually produce a better outcome than just propping up the profits of private property investors—landlords—through giving extra rent assistance to their tenants.
It is also more efficient than providing, in effect, tax breaks and the cost of tax expenditures to people through things like negative gearing. The best value for money for the taxpayer is actually to spend money—more money—through the provision of public and community housing. The continual, gradual decline in the focus on this area at federal level, but also at state level in many areas and including Labor state governments, is a cause for great concern. I fear that the damage done in this area—the continual decline in public housing stock and the continual decline in the attention given to this area by governments, state and federal—may soon be irreversible and that is a great shame.
I draw senators’ attention to an article from the Guardian in the UK which I am sure you have already read today, Madam Acting Deputy President Moore. It talks about the property market in the UK but I think it is equally apt for Australia—and, in fact, I suspect it is even more applicable to Australia—and it refers to the obsession with property as a form of investment. To paraphrase this article by Mr Lionel Shriver and what he calls the property psychosis, there is a yearly increase in property values that keeps going up and is widening the gap between the haves and the have-nots, so more and more people at the bottom cannot afford to buy anything.
As I said earlier in the debate on the Welfare to Work legislation, there is a growing wealth gap between the haves and the have-nots in Australia and the cause of that wealth gap—if you like, the underlying earthquakes that are shifting the plates and causing those different groups in society to move further and further apart—is increasing property prices.
That gap was significantly enhanced and increased by the decision back in the year 2000 to provide a massive windfall to the highest income earners and the highest wealth individuals in this country through the discounting of the capital gains tax—a decision supported by the Labor Party on the grounds that the government would then close the loopholes regarding the tax treatments of trusts. The government never acted on that and the Labor Party was complicit in providing a massive tax break for the highest income earners. However much people want to beat up those Democrats who supported the GST, that particular decision by the ALP provided a far greater windfall to higher income earners and a far greater problem in its impact on those who are less well-off than any negative aspect that people might have perceived about the GST.
There is an extraordinary attitude towards housing in Australia—and I am not criticising people who invest in property. In fact, in many respects, it is an incredibly rational thing to do if you are able to do it. But it is about the only good in Australia which is regularly reported as positive if the price goes up. The more the price goes up, the more that is portrayed as a good thing. It is obviously a good thing if you are a property investor, but it is a bad thing if you are somebody who wants to access the housing market—a first-home buyer, a young couple, a young family or anybody who wants to have a property of their own. That is the source of the greatest gap, the growing gap, in wealth in Australia, which is becoming so large that it will soon be unbridgeable.
The Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement on its own cannot bridge that gap, but the lack of attention at federal level given to the crisis in housing affordability is a major indictment of this government. I have asked questions of the government about this area from time to time over the years. Their only response is: ‘Housing is a state issue. Our job at federal level is to keep interest rates low.’ It is good that interest rates are kept lower than they might otherwise be, although it depends on how you assess them in relative terms. But, in many ways, in combination with other factors—let me stress that—such as negative gearing tax breaks and capital gains tax breaks, keeping interest rates low may perversely make housing more expensive by people using it as an investment.
There is more that should be done there. The federal government have failed. The federal Treasurer specifically dodged this issue by sending it off to a Productivity Commission inquiry and then ignoring the recommendations that applied to the federal government to do something to address the crisis in housing affordability. It may be something that the government do not care about, as long as their mates are getting richer on the property investment market. Maybe they do not care, but millions of Australians are falling further behind, either by their inability to get into the housing market or by having to mortgage themselves up to their eyeballs and beyond to try and get into it. The lack of policy attention at a national level is a major problem, and it is inexcusable. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. (Time expired)

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2006-06-14,"—by leave—I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum and to Papua New Guinea, which took place from 15 to 25 January 2006. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
The delegation to the APPF and Papua New Guinea included the member for Mitchell as leader, Senator McEwen and the member for Kingston. I was deputy leader of the delegation. In preparing for the APPF, the delegation was conscious of the substantial contributions of previous Australian delegations to the annual APPF meetings. For this reason, and because the APPF is important for us as an assembly of members of national parliaments in this region, the delegation was keen to ensure it participated as actively as possible at the meeting. As the report shows, the delegation did continue that substantial contribution to the work of the APPF.
Chapter 1 of the delegation’s report contains a general discussion of the role and operations of the APPF, and chapter 2 provides a detailed review of our participation at the January meeting and that meeting’s outcomes. The agenda for the meeting covered a range of subject matters that are relevant to our region. Broadly, these were political and security issues, economic and trade issues and cooperation to address regional issues of common interest.
In preparation for the meeting, the delegation proposed resolutions on three of the agenda items. These were international terrorism, on which I spoke, poverty alleviation and the Millennium Development Goals, on which Senator McEwen spoke, and pandemic disease, on which the member for Mitchell spoke. The member for Kingston spoke on cooperation on empowering the economies of developing and least developed countries.
As well as speaking in the plenary forum, the delegation participated in the work of the drafting committee throughout the meeting. The drafting committee had an extensive meeting program, often running in parallel to the plenary forum. At its meetings, the drafts of all proposed resolutions were negotiated until it was agreed they were in a state that could be put to the plenary forum for final consideration and endorsement.
Although there was a very full formal program for the APPF, the delegation was able to participate in several other meetings in Jakarta. Chapter 3 of the report discusses these parts of the delegation’s program. One particularly interesting meeting was a visit, arranged with the help of the embassy and staff of the World Food Program, to a program project in East Jakarta. AusAID supports this project, which provides nutritionally enriched biscuits each day to young children at school. Without these biscuits, the children are likely to be malnourished.
It was a great experience to visit this project. The children seem to enjoy the biscuits and the discussions that their teachers have with them about nutrition and health. The delegation found the visit to be rewarding, as we were able to speak to the children, teachers and other members of their community as well as to the WFP staff. The dedication and optimism of the teachers and the WFP staff was extremely impressive. After we visited the school, we spent some time walking around the community. Meetings such as this provide a unique opportunity to gain an understanding of the lives of ordinary people and to express to them our goodwill and interest in their future.
At the conclusion of the APPF meeting, we travelled to Papua New Guinea, where we began our program with a visit to the Bomana War Cemetery near Port Moresby. The sight of so many Australian war graves brought home to us the historic links between our country and Papua New Guinea. We had a number of valuable meetings in Port Moresby and were fortunate to visit Goroka, Kundiawa and Mount Hagen. It was important for us to see something of the provinces and go beyond Port Moresby. To see first-hand the difficulties faced by the local people—for example, in transport and infrastructure—was very valuable for us. To see the natural beauty of the highlands landscape was also a great experience.
Although our visit to Papua New Guinea was brief, we met a diverse range of people. These people included patients and their families at regional hospitals, businesspeople, workers in a coffee factory and their families, medical researchers, staff of NGOs and colleagues from provincial parliaments and the national parliament. We were fortunate to have discussions with a number of Australians who choose to live and work in Papua New Guinea. Their understanding of their adopted home and respect for its people and culture left a strong impression on us.
Chapter 4 of the report outlines the meetings in which the delegation participated in Papua New Guinea. I would like to emphasise that at each of those meetings—whether they were formal parts of the program or otherwise—we were welcomed with friendliness and openness. Certainly we heard about some of the difficulties facing our neighbours there; but we were also left with the impression that there are leaders and members of communities with sufficient capacity, energy and motivation to ensure a more secure, prosperous future for the people of Papua New Guinea.
Before I conclude my remarks, I want to acknowledge a number of people who contributed so much to the delegation’s visits. None of us will forget the hospitality we received in Jakarta from the President, the Speaker, and the Governor of Jakarta, as well as the friendliness of people we met informally around Jakarta. Nor will we forget the welcomes we enjoyed at each stage of our visit to Papua New Guinea.
The delegation was ably assisted by the Australian Embassy in Jakarta, in particular by the ambassador, Mr Bill Farmer, and by Steven Barraclough. We appreciated very much the comprehensive briefings and assistance that were provided. In Papua New Guinea we received great assistance from the high commissioner, Mr Michael Potts, and from Tim Paterson and Solstice Middleby. They gave close attention to our program and arrangements to ensure that we were well informed and able to observe and discuss the impact of some of the current issues in Papua New Guinea and its relationship with Australia.
I also want to acknowledge and thank the staff of the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Parliamentary Library and the Parliamentary Relations Office, who gave us great assistance with briefing material, advice and travel arrangements. During both our visits the delegation was accompanied by Mr Phil McDonald of the Australian Federal Police. His presence and advice were welcomed by all of us. I wish to thank my fellow members of the delegation. Throughout a demanding program we worked cooperatively. We are grateful for the opportunity to establish links with our colleagues from parliaments around the region, particularly those from Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. We are equally grateful for the opportunity to exchange views with ordinary members of communities in both places.
Finally, on behalf of the delegation I wish to extend a sincere and heartfelt thank you to Ms Catherine Cornish, the delegation secretary. She was absolutely worth her weight in gold; she was a diamond, and we thank her very much for her efforts.",SENATE,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,<title>Parliamentary Delegation to the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum and to Papua New Guinea</title>,Delegation Reports,22,1
"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2006-06-14,"—I also wish to speak to the report of the parliamentary delegation to the 14th annual meeting of the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum in Jakarta and the bilateral visit to Papua New Guinea. Like Senator Sterle, I would like to extend my thanks to all the people who assisted with preparation for the trip, including the staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Parliamentary Library and the Parliamentary Relations Office. I echo his sentiments about the delegation secretary, Catherine Cornish. She worked tirelessly throughout our program, kept us entertained with her endless good humour and made sure the delegation was always well briefed and ready for anything.
I also acknowledge the dedication and patience of our Australian Federal Police officer, Mr Phil McDonald. He is currently serving in Timor Leste, and I am sure Senator Sterle will join me in wishing him a safe and speedy return. While in Indonesia, we were also greatly assisted by Mr Nando of the APPF liaison office in the Indonesian house of representatives.
It was indeed a privilege to be able to travel to Indonesia and Papua New Guinea as a member of the Parliament of Australia. It was my first occasion to travel overseas in that capacity, and I believe it was very appropriate that my first trip overseas was to the nations of the Asia-Pacific region—all countries that are close to Australia’s history and integral to our future.
The visit was particularly timely, as it occurred just prior to the release of the government’s aid white paper, and many of the issues discussed with representatives of the governments that we met during our visit are dealt with in the white paper. We were given the opportunity to visit AusAID-supported projects in both Jakarta and Papua New Guinea. To witness first-hand Australia’s aid program in both countries and to hear the sometimes frank views of parliamentarians and local officials from countries that receive Australian aid was very useful in terms of ensuring that, as politicians, we have a realistic and practical view of our aid relationships with our near neighbours.
As Senator Sterle said, the objectives of the APPF are, broadly, to promote better regional cohesion and cooperation between the 27 member nations of the forum. The report outlines the contributions made at the forum and in the drafting and plenary sessions by the Australian delegation, so I will not reiterate those, but I certainly call those matters to your attention. I note that during the APPF meeting the representatives of Chile were very pleased to be able to announce that, on 15 January 2006, Michelle Bachelet was elected as President of Chile. She is the first woman elected as president of that nation, and she is a single mother with three children. Given that women’s participation in politics was one of the matters for discussion at the forum, this was welcome news, and Australian delegates offered their congratulations to the Chilean delegation.
I acknowledge the hard work of the other members of the delegation: Mr Alan Cadman, who was leader; Mr Kym Richardson, the member for Kingston, in my own state; and Senator Sterle, who was deputy leader of the delegation. Compared with some other nations, Australia sends a relatively small delegation to this important forum. Given the leading role we take in assisting with negotiations and finalisation of resolutions, there was much work to be done.
As Senator Sterle has said, apart from the formal business of the forum, the delegation visited a World Food Program in a Jakarta school. We also met with young Australian and Indonesian Islamic activists, who were participating in the Australian Muslim exchange program, at a function hosted by the Australian Ambassador to Indonesia, His Excellency Mr Bill Farmer, and Mrs Farmer. The support provided by the ambassador and the embassy staff was exemplary. They ensured that we had plenty of opportunities to broaden our understanding of the very important relationship between Australia and Indonesia. The less formal opportunities to engage with other member countries at the APPF were many, and I am sure none of us will forget the singing entertainment provided by the President of Indonesia, the Speaker of the house of representatives of Indonesia and the Governor of Jakarta at the salubrious functions they hosted for all the delegates.
In Papua New Guinea the delegation made the most of its short time. The high commissioner, His Excellency Mr Michael Potts, and the staff of the high commission—particularly Ms Solstice Middleby and Mr Tim Paterson—ensured that we met a wide range of political and community leaders both in Port Moresby and, as Senator Sterle said, in the regional areas of Goroka, Mount Hagen and Kundiawa. Travelling by car along Papua New Guinea’s major ‘highway’ from Goroka to Mount Hagen brought home to us the enormous problems faced by our neighbours, whose economic and social wellbeing is frustrated by not having basic infrastructure—like navigable roads.
Our visit to the AusAID part sponsored AT Projects facility near Goroka showcased some examples of provision of basic services using low-cost, local and innovative solutions. One example we saw was the utilisation of the talents of a young Indigenous woman architect, who had designed a respite facility for people suffering from AIDS. This facility, using traditional design and local materials, was able to be constructed with local labour and would provide comfortable and warm accommodation for one or two AIDS sufferers and their carers in a village setting.
As we know, Papua New Guinea is facing a crisis with the highest incidence of HIV-AIDS in the Pacific region, and some estimates indicate that the rate of infection will increase by between 15 and 30 per cent annually. Assisting Papua New Guinea to acknowledge, confront and respond to the potential HIV-AIDS epidemic is one of the great challenges facing our two countries. And, of course, the people of Papua New Guinea are disproportionately affected by easily preventable diseases such as tuberculosis and malaria, a fact that was highlighted by our visit to the hospital in Mount Hagen, where those two diseases are major reasons for hospitalisation. As Senator Sterle said, we were fortunate to visit other places in Papua New Guinea, including the Coffee Industry Corporation and a coffee processing plant where the differences in health and safety standards between our two countries were, unfortunately, patently obvious.
It was particularly pleasing to meet on her own turf Dame Carol Kidu, the only female member of the National Parliament of Papua New Guinea and, I know, a friend of many in this parliament. It was a privilege to visit her home in Port Moresby and to meet the participants in a project she sponsors where young offenders learn how to propagate and sell garden plants at a local market, thereby earning a legitimate income through employment which offers them hope and respect.
The opportunity to meet with representatives of the Australia business council and local politicians gave our delegation an insight into the future prospects for Papua New Guinea’s economic future, particularly in the areas of mining, gas export and tourism development. There was hope and optimism from all those people for the future of Papua New Guinea, although the need for political stability was echoed by everyone we met.
Finally, like Senator Sterle I would like to make mention of the fact that we did visit the Bomana War Cemetery. I had been there before but it is always a salutary place to visit, to remind oneself of the cooperation of the people of Papua New Guinea and the assistance that they gave to our troops during World War II. I commend the report to the Senate.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,<title>Parliamentary Delegation to the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum and to Papua New Guinea</title>,Delegation Reports,22,1
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2006-06-14,"—I move:
That the Workplace Relations Regulations 2006, as contained in Select Legislative Instrument 2006 No. 52 and made under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 and the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005, be disallowed.
It will come as no surprise that Labor opposes these regulations just as we oppose the legislation that they sit under. These regulations give effect to much of the government’s extreme industrial relations changes. Over the weeks and months since the government’s extreme changes have been in place, we have started to see the effect on Australian workers and their families. These regulations followed the proclamation of the government’s legislation. They were dropped late in the afternoon of Friday, 17 March. It was only later over the course of that weekend that the government sneakily published these regulations with the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations finally publicly drawing attention to them on the Sunday, which happened to be the same afternoon that the Commonwealth Games women’s marathon was determined.
Those regulations and their related explanatory materials bring the government’s so-called single system and simplified legislation to a total of more than 1,800 pages—1,252 pages of legislation and explanatory materials and 592 pages of regulations and supplementary materials. This is their so-called single, simplified system. It is more than 1,800 pages of complexity and complication that Australian business, Australian industry, small business and employees had to come to grips with with less than a week before it came into effect on 27 March. Like everything with this government and industrial relations, the devil is in the detail, and with more than 1,800 pages of complexity and complication there is a lot of detail—and there is a lot that Labor opposes.
I want to first talk about the issue of prohibited content. This is probably the area where the extent to which the government is willing to go to impose its extreme and radical agenda on Australian workers and their families is most clearly shown. The prohibited content provisions, apart from their philosophy being problematic, are extraordinarily complex. They alone are enough to make a sick joke of the claimed simpler, fairer tag line that this government continues to use to promote its radical changes in industrial relations. The regulations in relation to prohibited content are nothing but a crass and overt reduction of the bargaining power of employees in the workplace.
Given that this government trumpets the freedom of the individual and the freedom of contract as the basis of the way they wish to move forward in industrial relations, it is extraordinary that they are imposing through legislation and regulations such powers on a single person, the minister for workplace relations, to intervene in the negotiations between employees and employers so as to ensure certain things cannot be discussed, cannot be included, and that certain rights cannot be agreed to be given to employees. The prohibited content regulations severely restrict legitimate workplace-bargaining activity. They severely restrict what can legitimately be negotiated between employees and employers. In particular, they limit the capacity of trade unions in the workplace to act as the legitimate and chosen representative of employees, even if those employees wish that to be the case.
Let us go through some of the prohibited content in agreements which will be defined as such as a result of the regulations: deductions from wages of union dues or the provision of payroll deduction facilities for union dues; leave to attend training provided by a trade union, even if it is occupational health and safety training; paid leave to attend meetings conducted by or made up of trade union members; the renegotiation of a workplace agreement; the rights of an organisation of employers or employees to participate in or represent an employer or employee bound by the agreement in whole or part of a dispute-settling procedure unless the organisation is the representative of the employer’s or employee’s choice; right of entry; and the provision of information about employees bound by the agreement to a trade union or a member acting in a representative capacity unless provision of that information is required or authorised by law.
However, the prohibited content provisions do not just limit themselves to restricting the activities of unions as representatives in the workplace. They also extend to ensuring that workers in this country do not have access, if they are with an employer of less than 100 employees, to remedies for unfair dismissal, even if, as I indicated, this is agreed between employer and employee. This government is so worried about employees in this country being able to challenge a dismissal that is unfair that not only are they content to remove it from the legislation but they actually want to prohibit such rights being included in an agreement.
Regulation 2.8.5 contains the following:
A term of a workplace agreement is prohibited content to the extent that it confers a right or remedy in relation to the termination of employment of an employee bound by the agreement for a reason that is harsh, unjust or unreasonable.
Just to make sure employers and employees do not seek to have these matters included in an agreement, this government is imposing a penalty for breaching the prohibited content regulations. In effect this means that, if an employer or employee seeks to have an unfair dismissal provision in the agreement, they can be hit with a $6,000 fine. If a union seeks a similar provision, the union can be hit with a $33,000 fine. If this is not bad enough, schedules 4 and 5 of the regulations ensure that the minister will now have a direct role in the oversight of every agreement made in the country. Through schedule 4, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission is required to provide to the minister detailed information, including relevant documents, names of parties, individuals and organisations et cetera, in relation to agreements.
Schedule 5 is similarly heavy-handed. It provides that the Office of the Employment Advocate provide to the minister information and copies of documents that relate to employment relationships. According to schedule 5, the minister is now to receive copies of agreements, variations to agreements and orders terminating agreements, all within three weeks of the making of the variation or the making of the agreement. As well, detailed information about agreements, including the title, number of the agreement, date of lodgment, description of the work undertaken and the names and addresses of the business to which the agreement applies, are now all to be supplied to the minister. Just what this is trying to achieve on a practical level is unclear. But one thing is clear—that is, that the government wants a direct and interventionist role by the minister in the operation of each and every workplace across the nation. This is direct interference by the minister and his office, and such direct interference by the minister and his office into the content of individual agreements is an appallingly bad example of public policy. The decision to give this minister or any minister executive power over what can and cannot be included in the agreements through prohibited content is extraordinarily bad policy.
I want to return to the issue of transitional arrangements. This is an area where the complexity of the government’s legislation, frankly, is quite breathtaking. This government has made a complete jurisdictional dog’s breakfast of its so-called single industrial relations system. Whilst the High Court will clearly determine the jurisdictional coverage of Work Choices, even by the government’s own admission only up to 85 per cent of the country’s workforce will potentially be covered by the government’s changes. That will mean that around 1.5 million employees will remain outside the jurisdictional coverage of the government’s changes. Irrespective of the High Court’s outcome, which could in fact reduce the number of people potentially covered by the government’s changes, all this will mean is more incomplete and more inconsistent coverage across the nation’s workplaces. The process of moving state awards and agreements to the federal jurisdiction is so complex that, frankly, many employers and employees will be unsure precisely what their rights and responsibilities are. But that is not stopping this government. The regulations confirm this government is intent on overturning the states’ recent attempts to preserve the pay and conditions of employees under state industrial relations systems.
The issue of part heard matters, which was an issue raised by Labor on a number of occasions in the committee discussion on this bill, is no clearer either. The transitional provisions provide that part heard dispute matters before the commission either lapse entirely or at least lapse in relation to employers defined under the act as corporations. However, appeals against awards and orders can continue as per the old state industrial system, while part heard equal remuneration applications are to be heard under the government’s new provisions. This will be a field day for the lawyers.
Despite all this complexity and confusion, the government simply keeps claiming that all these changes—all 1,800 pages of complete legislation and associated explanations—are necessary for the continued economic health of our nation. Let us look at precisely what we do know about Work Choices. Let us look at what the Office of the Employment Advocate has told us. Of the 6,263 Australian workplace agreements lodged since Work Choices commenced on 27 March, this is what it can tell us about what is contained in them: 100 per cent excluded at least one protected award condition, 64 per cent removed leave loadings, 63 per cent removed penalty rates, 52 per cent removed shift work loadings, 40 per cent lost gazetted public holidays and 16 per cent excluded all award conditions and replaced them with the government’s legislated minimum standards. We already know what the impact of Work Choices is. It is clear from the government’s own figures and its own data from the Office of the Employment Advocate. These are figures and statistics which confirm exactly what Labor has been saying all along: that the agenda behind this so-called Work Choices, this radical industrial relations agenda, is the driving down of the wages and conditions of Australian workers and their families.
Sixty-three per cent of AWAs removed penalty rates. This government may be so out of touch it does not realise this: there are a great many families which rely on penalty rates, overtime and shift loadings in order to meet their financial requirements. That is what many people rely on to make sure ends meet. Under your system, the vast majority so far of Australian workplace agreements exclude penalty rates and remove leave loadings. We heard the minister today in question time using some very dodgy statistics in which he included managerial employees. I invite him to correct the record and tell us what the ABS actually says about the experience of non-managerial employees. Take managerial employees out of the equation and have a look at what the AWAs deliver. Have a look at what Australian workplace agreements deliver for women. Women on AWAs will receive 11 per cent less than those women on registered agreements. That is how much less Australian women are going to be paid as a result of this government’s extreme agenda.
You do not have to believe me and you do not have to believe your own figures from the Office of the Employment Advocate. Let us look at what Freehills have said. Anybody who has hung around the Senate estimates knows that this is a law firm that this government uses a lot. It is certainly not a law firm you would regard as a Labor law firm. What do Freehills say? This is their snapshot of the current arrangements: average annual wage increases in June 2004-05 in agreements generally, four per cent; union collective agreements, 4.3 per cent; and AWAs, 2.5 per cent. Looking at the 2004-05 figures, which is before this government’s extreme agenda actually got going, you will see that even Freehills say that essentially workers are better off when they are on collective agreements, much better off when they are on union collective agreements and far worse off when they are on AWAs.
What we know about this government’s extreme agenda is this: workers in Australia are being asked to trade away shift penalties, overtime rates and rostering certainty for the princely sum of 2c an hour. That is this government’s great economic contribution through the Work Choices legislation. The choice for Australian workers is that they have to give up their penalty rates, their overtime, their shift loadings and rostering certainty for the princely sum of 2c an hour. We will see between now and the next election how many more Australian workers will be put in that position and will face the fate of the Spotlight employees, which has been publicised in recent times.
The fact is this government has long held an ambition to reduce the minimum wage. It appears to be the government’s view—and this is consistent with the position that the Prime Minister and his ministers have been taking—that, if you reduce the minimum wage in real terms, this will lead to an increase in employment, particularly at the lower end of the scale. The reality is, had the government got its way and had each of its submissions to the Industrial Relations Commission from 1997 to 2005 accepted, there would have been a cut in real terms of over 1½ per cent to the minimum wage: $50 a week, or over $2,500 a year, less than the current minimum wage. That is the government’s actual position when it comes to those Australians who struggle on minimum wages.
The government has not been content with simply making submissions to the Industrial Relations Commission. Through its Work Choices legislation, it is imposing the so-called Fair Pay Commission—probably better known as the low-pay commission—which will have legislative parameters that are clearly designed to keep downward pressure on the minimum wage. Unlike the Industrial Relations Commission, this new unfair pay commission is not required to take into account ‘the need to provide fair minimum standards for employees in the context of living standards generally prevailing in the Australian community’. Who can forget the government voting against an amendment moved by the opposition during the Work Choices debate because they did not want the word ‘fair’ in the legislative parameters for the Fair Pay Commission. They voted against making sure that the Fair Pay Commission’s job was governed, at least in part, by a notion of fairness.
How can you have a Fair Pay Commission when you do not even have the courage to include fairness in the legislative parameters? You voted against Work Choices having fairness in the legislative parameters because you do not want a fair minimum wage—that is not what you want. If you did want it, you would not have voted against fairness being one of the criteria that this commission has to have regard to when setting the minimum wage. Essentially, the principle of fairness has been stripped from consideration of the level of the minimum wage, as has the question of living standards generally.
I want to briefly talk, in the time remaining, about the government’s assertion that this is the way forward for the Australian economy. The way forward is the 2c an hour that a number of Australians have already faced. The way forward is no rights with regard to unfair dismissal for many millions of Australian workers. The government’s assertion that higher minimum wage levels inevitably lead to higher levels of unemployment simply does not stack up.
Let us have a look at some of the overseas examples: Denmark, Iceland, Norway and Sweden all have lower levels of unemployment than Australia despite the fact they have so-called high levels of employment protection. They are also ranked as more competitive than Australia by the World Economic Forum’s global competitiveness ranking and, on OECD figures, they all have higher productivity levels compared to Australia. And in the United States, the economic pin-up model of the government, the experience over the past five years has seen jobs growth rise by only 2.9 per cent while the minimum wage, in real terms, has fallen by 12 per cent.
If we now look to the budget papers, it is pretty clear that the government is even expecting employment growth to fall over the forward estimates period. These regulations are just more bad news for Australian employees and Australian workplaces. The government’s approach underlines the true nature of its agenda and its legislation—an ideological removal of choice. The government simply does not trust employers and employees to reach the most appropriate agreement for their circumstances. The government only wants them to reach an agreement with which the government is happy. That is what this legislation does: it is all about ministerial intervention; it is all about prohibited content; and it is all about the government imposing its view and its will on Australian employees and Australian workplaces. The government only wants people to reach the agreement that the government is happy with.
The government’s assertion that these changes will fix all the economic problems Australia faces is not just simplistic; it ignores the real drivers of productivity in our economy: the knowledge and skills of our workforce, the adequacy of our infrastructure and the ability of industry to meet emerging pressures through innovation. As a nation, we will not be internationally competitive and achieve sustained high levels of growth off the back of reducing wages and stripping conditions. Two cents an hour is not the way forward for the Australian economy. Unfortunately, the government simply does not get this. The government simply does not comprehend that down the path they choose lies a low-skill, low-pay and low-productivity economy that ignores the long-term requirements for a prosperous Australia.
What Australia needs is policies which are about building an economy that is productive and internationally competitive. And Australia needs a government that will do that while ensuring that the working conditions of Australian employees are fair. Everybody knows what this government wants. It wants Australian employers to be able to require their employees to give away all of their entitlements: give away your leave loading, give away your rostering certainty, give away your penalty rates, give away your overtime for 2c an hour.

",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS REGULATIONS 2006</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,27,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2006-06-14,"—The government opposes the motion. We were just told that the government is seeking to impose its will in relation to these matters and what the government wants in this debate. Let me confess right up front that the government does want to impose its will—its will that there be more people in jobs, that people have higher wages, that people have more flexibility in their employment situation and that there be more family-friendly provisions in workplace agreements that are entered into.
As with every significant reform that has been undertaken over the past decade, the Australian Labor Party have stood in the way. Each and every time they have said: ‘It will create an economic Armageddon. People will be thrown onto the unemployment scrap heap. People will be worse off.’ They said it about GST. They said it about our first wave of industrial relations reform. They said it about waterfront reform. They said it about welfare reform.
But of course, each and every time, the exact opposite has occurred. Unemployment has decreased. Real wages have increased. Unlike the situation under Labor which had one million of our fellow Australians on the unemployment scrap heap, we are now down below five per cent unemployment for the first time in three decades. Also over Labor’s 13 years in government real wages increased by—what was it?—1.2 or 1.3 per cent, compared to our 10-year period where real wages have increased by well over 10 per cent. In fact, 16 to 17 per cent is the figure. The workers of Australia know this, and that is why the workers of Australia have continued, very kindly, to support the Howard government: they realise and understand that our policies are designed to assist them in their aspirational approach to life.
Nowadays, not even one-quarter of the workforce are members of the trade union movement; it is about 20 per cent. The Labor Party are still stuck in the rut of representing those workers who are members of trade unions, as they should, and we of course seek to represent those workers as well. But we also listen to the other 80 per cent of workers who have made a conscious choice not to be members of the trade union movement. Unlike the Labor Party, who exclude the 80 per cent of workers who are not members of a trade union, we actually embrace them, we listen to them and we encourage them to fulfil their aspirations.
Yes, there are 1,800 pages to these regulations and yes, there is some complexity in this legislation. But Senator Wong knows full well and the Australian Labor Party know full well that under the former regime, with all the different state government legislation on top of the federal legislation, together with all the awards, you would have had hundreds of thousands of pages to deal with, not the hundreds of pages that we are dealing with now.
Mr Acting Deputy President, you will recall, as will others in this chamber, that when the Work Choices bill was being debated in this place—for 23 hours, I think, in the House of Representatives and for 32 hours in the Senate chamber; hours and hours of debate—there were these gross predictions that, as of 27 March, when the Work Choices legislation came into being, there would be wholesale sackings all around the country, the unemployment rate would go up and we would have a veritable economic Armageddon. Well, what has happened in the two months since Work Choices came in? After having hovered between five and 5.3 per cent for 20 months, the unemployment rate, according to Labor and union predictions, should have spiked up to 5.5 or six per cent. What did the unemployment figures do? They in fact went down to 4.9 per cent. The reason the unemployment rate actually went down was that, in the month of April, 22,000 new full-time jobs were created and, in the month of May, 55,000 new full-time jobs were created. Their predictions were wrong. Will they apologise to the Australian people and the workers that they sought to spook? Of course they will not. They did not do it on waterfront reform, they did not do it on industrial reform, they did not do it on GST reform, so why should they do it on this occasion?
Senator Wong told us that the minister could ‘interfere’ in relation to certain aspects of workplace relations. That is quite right: he can under this legislation. But this is where the dishonesty comes into this debate, because the power of intervention that is part of sections 102 and 103 of the Workplace Relations Act as amended is a replication of sections 43 and 44 as they used to be. There was no mention of that—no mention that this was simply a replication of that which existed before. It is another case of the Australian Labor Party being willing to say anything and do anything to run a scare campaign.
We are also told about prohibited content in agreements. This is very dangerous ground, I would have thought, for Senator Wong to traverse. She was humiliated at the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee budget estimates hearing when she asserted as fact that occupational health and safety training by trade unions would be banned. Mr Smythe, senior legal counsel—who is now off to the International Labour Organisation because he is so highly regarded—had to disabuse her of that view time and again until she finally got it, and then she said, ‘Well, can you understand why workers are confused?’ I will tell you why some workers in the community are confused: because people like Senator Wong have gone around the community peddling the misinformation that she has now unwittingly put on the Hansard record for all to see and read, when of course she was wrong. That is why she did not pursue that line today in this debate. She was very foolish to have even reminded me and others of it.
In relation to occupational health and safety, a matter of great concern to every Australian, whose jurisdiction is it? Everybody knows, or should know, that it falls fairly and squarely within the jurisdiction of the states and territories. Yet it did not stop the flip-flopping Mr Beazley from trying to make cheap political capital from the Beaconsfield mine tragedy when he was in Brisbane by suggesting that it might not have occurred if trade union training had been allowed, knowing full well that—well, chances are he did not know. I do not think he knew. And that is the problem with Mr Beazley: he will say anything at any time if it suits him. Having said that, just to make the point, let us have a look at what he has been saying about Australian workplace agreements. Here you see Mr Flip-flop in action, par excellence. On 4 July 2005, the Age newspaper reported that Mr Beazley said:
I dislike AWAs but—
listen to this—
there’s always been individual contracts ... and huge numbers of Australian workers have signed up to that.
Well, I can understand he dislikes AWAs, but I fully agree with him that there have always been individual contracts and a huge number of Australian workers have signed up to them—in fact, over 500,000 have.
Some 26 days later, on 30 July, he told another newspaper, the Australian:
We are going to abolish the capacity of AWAs to undermine collective awards. We are going to weight the balance of this in favour of collective agreements …
Then, on 2 August, to the Australian Financial Review, there was another version:
What I’m saying on AWAs is that nobody is going to bother with them once they are not in a position to.
Then, three days later:
But Mr Beazley argued that while unions wanted to ‘destroy’ AWAs, he wanted to ‘strangle’ them.
How hairy chested can you get? He wanted to strangle them! But then on 9 October, on the Sunday program, Mr Oakes asked Mr Beazley:
So you no longer subscribe to the policy Labor took to the last election, which was effectively to abolish AWAs?
Mr Beazley replied:
I subscribe to what I just said. There’ll be a million of those things in place when we come into office, and you can’t wander round cancelling contracts.
I would say ‘amen’ to that. It was one of those rare, lucid moments in Mr Beazley’s involvement in the IR debate. ‘You can’t wander around cancelling contracts’—I fully agree with him. Yet what did he say on 11 June to the New South Wales state Labor conference, without consultation with the caucus or with his shadow minister? He said:
So today delegates I announce that a Beazley Labor government will abolish John Howard’s Australian Workplace Agreements.
Remember those contracts that you could not go around the country ripping up? All of a sudden you can go around ripping them up. Why is that? Because Mr Beazley did yet another flip-flop.
We were told by Senator Wong about penalty rates, and how evil it was that penalty rates could be removed. Can I say this: they can only be removed by agreement with the workers.

Senator Marshall interjecting—

—And some old union official across the chamber laughs and scoffs! Allow me to quote this to the honourable senator:
The result is that most employees in Australia are not paid penalty rates, but are paid more than the base wage. Even though unions don’t like to admit it, many have been involved in these agreements.
I remind honourable senators of the date here: 1991, which was some five years—half a decade—before John Howard was elected to government. It continues:
In 1991 I helped negotiate an agreement with—
wait for it!—
the Shop Assistants Union in South Australia to get rid of the 25 per cent late night penalty rate, the 30 per cent night shift penalty rate, the 25 per cent Saturday morning penalty rate and the 50 per cent Saturday afternoon overtime rate, in exchange for a payment of 5.25 per cent on the weekly wage. It was an agreement that worked well …
In other words, if unions can negotiate away penalty rates that is okay; but how dare individual workers ever think about doing that without the imprimatur of the paternalistic trade union movement!
—That was enterprise bargaining. It was the union, not some hapless shop assistant. I bet it was for more than 2c an hour.
 (Senator Brandis)—Order! Senator Hurley, you are out of order. The minister will be heard in silence.
—And the person goes on to say:
It was an agreement that worked well even though some casual employees at the time lost more money in penalty rates than they gained in base salary.
Some workers were even worse off, and the trade union movement sanctioned it, five years before John Howard was elected to government. And yet they run around this country suggesting that this is somehow an extreme agenda, when the trade union movement itself negotiated these sorts of agreements because it knew that the workplace was changing and people’s habits were changing. The article continues:
So long as penalty rates can’t be taken off people against their will, the fact that penalty rates don’t have to be paid or equivalently cashed out in every situation is fair, and will help create more jobs.
Why did they do this? Because in this day and age employing people on Saturday afternoons or on late-night trading is hardly strange or unsociable, especially where the employee is, say, a university student for whom those hours are actually preferred.
So a case is made out that Australian workplace agreements trade off penalty rates—and they may well do. Of course, what Senator Wong told us about aspects of the Australian workplace agreements was only half the story. Yes, conditions were traded off, but she did not tell us about the increase in wages, the increase in family-friendly provisions and all the other benefits in those agreements.
—I sat in Senate estimates and I did not hear much about the benefits.
—Order! Senator Sterle, you are out of order. The minister will be heard in silence.
—On these statistics, I will repeat what I said at Senate estimates: statistics are a bit like skimpy bathers—what they show is interesting; what they hide is vital. But might I say that in Senator Sterle’s case I doubt whether it would be either interesting or vital. But, that aside, you can make the statistics say what you want and you can say penalty rates were taken away. But there were wage increases in lieu, and to only paint half the picture is to tell a falsehood to the Australian people.
We also got the hoary old argument that we had removed fairness from the legislation—that the word ‘fair’ used to be in the preamble and its removal meant that we no longer believed in fairness. The old preamble did not have the word ‘harmonious’ in it; the new preamble does. So, if you accept the Australian Labor Party logic, the old act did not seek to create harmonious workplaces and the new one does. That sort of immature use of semantics is, unfortunately, the depths to which the Labor Party has had to sink to try to get an argument to fly with in this debate.
If you were to ask a worker, ‘Do you want a fair workplace?’ they would say yes. If you asked, ‘Do you want a harmonious workplace?’ they would say yes. Then if you asked the worker, ‘What do you think the difference is between a fair and a harmonious workplace?’ I reckon they would be left, like me, scratching their head wondering what the difference was. Of course, it is the same terminology to express the same sort of thing. We are about harmonious workplaces, and it is clear that is what we are delivering because industrial disputation under the Howard government is now at the lowest rate it has ever been since records were first kept. If workers are so much worse off under the Howard government, why is it that the rate of industrial disputation has fallen, like unemployment has fallen, and the only thing that has risen has been real wages, something that 13 years of Labor could never deliver?
There are other people in this debate. They will undoubtedly continue and follow the line of their leader, Mr Beazley, and Senator Wong and mislead and misrepresent this legislation. But at the end of the day these regulations are designed to put in place the Work Choices legislation—legislation that will ensure that the Australian economy and the people of Australia can prosper. Without the economy prospering, individual Australians cannot and will not prosper. We do not pursue economic reform because we are committed to economic reform per se; it is what economic reform can do for our fellow individual Australians, and that is to make a better life for them. The best social welfare policy a government can deliver is to ensure that every one of our fellow Australians that is capable of undertaking a job actually has one.
Mr Beazley said that the reform lemon of industrial relations had been squeezed dry and no more could be done. In other words, he was happy to have long-term losers on the unemployment benefit, and he admitted as much on TV. We say that is not good enough. Every single Australian deserves a job. We are very pleased that unemployment has now fallen below 4.9 per cent and we look forward to many more of our fellow Australians getting jobs as a result of Work Choices.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS REGULATIONS 2006</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,27,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-06-14,"—The regulations being debated before us today, while containing little different than what was foreshadowed late last year, do confirm the Democrats’ worst fears—that is, that the Liberal and National parties’ industrial relations changes are extreme, complex and unfair and will detrimentally impact on vulnerable or disadvantaged employees and job seekers over time.
Of course, the minister is both right and wrong. He is wrong in thinking that the Work Choices legislation is some kind of economic nirvana and that there will be no social effects. But he is right in believing that the sky has not yet fallen in. It has not yet fallen in for the very reason that many agreements that were struck under the old legislation have a long time to run. The other point is that anyone who is in an advantaged position in the job market is not going to be impacted negatively whilst there is a shortage of labour in certain sectors.
The regulations coupled with the Work Choices legislation are highly interventionist and one-sided, and our belief is that in the end they will hurt Australian society and the economy. Because of that, we think it inevitable that this government, if it remains in power, will have to amend them, and amend them significantly. Of course, if Labor achieve power, they will be thrown out altogether and a new system will be put in.
The sky might not have fallen in yet, although for those who are unfairly sacked or lose penalty rates or public holidays for the famous extra 2c a week I am sure it will feel like it. But these changes overall over time will radically alter our work and systems values and may end up creating a dog-eat-dog environment for those with low bargaining power, and they will suffer accordingly.
I am not deliberately exaggerating the impact of these reforms. In fact, it is not my style to do so. It must be remembered that these are fundamental reforms. These changes are nothing like those in the 1996 act that was produced, even before it was amended by the Democrats, because that 1996 act was the second wave of legislation built on the same foundations as the first wave, which was the 1993 act. These changes, in contrast, assault the cultural, economic, social, institutional, legal, political and constitutional underpinnings of work arrangements in Australia. Since the legislation and the regulations came into force, there have been cases that have received media attention of employees sacked for smirking, for restructuring purposes or for being too ill and of 60-year-olds being offered individual contracts that cut wages by $40 a shift, and so on and so forth.
In the Senate budget estimates committee hearing last month, federal Employment Advocate Peter McIlwain revealed that of the 6,263 individual contracts, known as AWAs, lodged with his office since the Work Choices legislation began, every one of the 250 analysed by his office did exclude at least one award condition. Sixteen per cent of Australian workplace agreements lodged under the new laws had dropped all award conditions and replaced them with the government’s five minimum conditions. They had gone down from 20 to five, if you looked at the maximum. Forty per cent of those AWAs dropped gazetted public holidays. Leave loading was erased in 64 per cent of agreements while penalty rates disappeared in 63 per cent. Fifty-two per cent of AWAs got rid of shift allowances.
These are major social impacts. These are things which affect how families live their lives, for example, when children are able to play sport or be with their families. It very much affects the social fabric. Pay increases over the life of the AWAs were provided for in 78 per cent of agreements, while 22 per cent had no change in pay. While a large percentage of the AWAs may have provided a pay increase, the actual level of increase commensurate with other benefits lost needs to be taken into account. In the recent and infamous case of Spotlight, Spotlight offered 2c more an hour to new employees to enter workplace agreements which were without penalty rates, without public holidays or without leave loadings. This is why the Prime Minister refused to guarantee before the legislation was passed that no worker or set of workers would be worse off. He knew he could not guarantee it, because large numbers of workers would be worse off and are worse off.
The Spotlight case highlights that these changes will have a disproportionate effect on women. Because women are in and out of the workforce as a result of caring responsibilities, women are a large proportion of low-income earners in Australia and are disproportionately employed in industries such as retail, clerical and community services and in part-time and casual work. When the Western Australian industrial relations system was deregulated during the Court government, which provided the template for these changes, those changes resulted in a decrease in wages, increased inequality and saw women in particular worse off. In February 1992, the Western Australian gender pay gap was 22.5 per cent. By May 1995, it had widened to 27.8 per cent. As HREOC noted during the Senate’s inquiry into Work Choices, the capacity for more vulnerable employees to bargain effectively and to choose their employment arrangements is impinged upon by the existence of so-called take it or leave it individual bargaining arrangements. The consequences are felt not only by workers but also by their children and families. It is the social effect which is very damaging from this legislation.
Under the new Work Choices legislation, these AWAs are unacceptable. Under the old Workplace Relations Act, while AWAs needed improvement and greater protections built into the system, they were workable. It is at that level that we parted company with the Labor Party, because we supported AWAs under the old federal act. We do not support the new AWAs under the Work Choices legislation. They are almost always take it or leave it contracts. Duress is not policed. There is no global no disadvantage test. There is no requirement to bargain in good faith, and the minimum conditions underpinning the contract are derisory. While it is unlikely that all Australians will be detrimentally affected by these changes, we do believe they will erode conditions for significant numbers of Australians over time. Because of that, we are hopeful that the government will take a step back from its very strong defence of these unfair laws and move to amend them before the community endures too much pain.
The Prime Minister and his ministers have successfully used doublespeak to conceal the true nature of these changes. Progressive words like ‘choice’, ‘flexibility’ and ‘freedom’ disguise the heavy authoritarian micromanagement and restrictions on collective labour—namely, the unions—and the dismantling of the architecture and infrastructure of our former workplace relations system. While the Prime Minister is correct that most of what is contained in these regulations does not change the intent and direction outlined in the Work Choices bill, the regulations do reveal just how interventionist and dictatorial this government will be. Unwisely, unprecedented ministerial intervention will replace the former sensitively balanced federal system where politicians were kept at arm’s length from work arrangements and disputes. This central planning model has alarmed some of the government’s backers, such as the HR Nicholls Society, who are reported as expressing concern that the new laws are too government-centric. In fact, they have likened the federal government’s new industrial relations laws to the former Soviet system of command and control. That is coming from the friends of the government!
The Industrial Relations Commission is required to report on a weekly basis to the minister on the number and details of applications for protected action ballots, suspension and termination of bargaining periods and applications for right of entry. The OEA must send the minister every workplace agreement within three weeks of it being made. This level of ministerial intervention is unheard of. Surely a senior minister would have better things to do with their time than interfere in the day-to-day workings of business, unless they are in command and control mode. It is quite mind-boggling that part of the justification for the government’s IR changes was to reduce third-party interference—that is, union involvement—yet what has happened is third-party interference in the form of the minister has reached levels which could be dangerous and are certainly unprecedented. This is doublespeak of the like we have never seen before. The now well-entrenched coalition executive style is also likely to mean that bias and secret agendas will contaminate what should be open public processes.
The regulations also appear to have raised more questions than they have answered and, rather than reduce the need for lawyers and third-party intervention, the complexity is in fact likely to result in the opposite. All up, the legislation and the regulations total about 1,500 pages of text to explain, compared to the law in New Zealand, which I am told does it in 20 pages. We are concerned that, in attempting to cover every angle with the intention of hamstringing unions, the government have created an overly complex system with the likelihood of many unintended consequences. I assure you that, if the Democrats had retained the balance of power, this Work Choices legislation would not have been law, although I can also assure you—probably to the consternation of some of my Labor colleagues—that this would have been a national system, because we agree with one system. When Labor reach power in due course, we do hope that you will at least retain that as a centrepiece of your workplace law. Of course, it does need to be agreed with the states. We have always acknowledged that.
We are concerned that, in attempting to cover all these angles, the regulations are creating real problems. For instance, the Australian Medical Association—hardly a hotbed of socialist activists—are concerned that the regulations do not clarify who can legally issue medical certificates for employees’ sick leave. This is an excellent example of how an unnecessary change of requiring employees to provide a certificate after one day of leave compared to two days leave is now having unintended consequences. From the viewpoint of an ordinary person, not leaving that whole bureaucratic function to the integrity and the ethics of the medical profession to decide on is really a great mistake.
There is uncertainty about cashing out annual leave, about whether employees can be paid under the minimum wage if it is averaged over a 12-month period. Rather than help small business, the government have made it more difficult. Many small businesses preferred the previous award system because it enabled them to bargain on a level playing field with other small business competitors, and much of the work in negotiating terms and conditions was done for them. It is self-evident that individual small business employers do not have the human resource capacities required to bargain in these ways themselves.
Not only has the government taken away the certainty and ease, but through the regulations before us it requires small business to keep time and wage records, making personal record-keeping requirements broader and more onerous. It has been reported that a MYOB survey in December last year found that small and medium business owners were more confused than ever about the industrial relations package. They do not know whether they are in or out and they do not know how the systems have affected their legal obligations to their employees. They were familiar with and happy with the previous system.
The mining association have expressed concern about the reforms and the impact it will have on their industry. One major mining company publicly said that they are concerned the changes could wind back the clock 30 years. As journalist Laura Tingle said a couple of months ago in the Australian Financial Review:
It makes you wonder—whatever your ideological position might be on industrial relations—what the government is thinking will unfold politically from these changes, or whether, in the haze of a long-cherished ideological ambition finally realised, it has thought about it at all.
I agree with Ms Tingle. I think these changes, and those likely to come, are too much based on ideology and have not had enough regard to the economic and social aspects. In that respect, they are irresponsible.
When I hear the government ask: ‘Why would we risk power? Why would we risk our seats? Why would we risk our government on a reform which is going to put the back of the Australian people up?’ I sometimes think that we forget that this is a radical government. It is not a conservative government; it is a radical government. It wants to change the Australian economy and society radically. And to do so, it is prepared to take very significant risks with those things that we know have underpinned our society for decades, for generations—those things which have ensured a fair go and fair dealings between employers and employees, backed by a working, flexible and maturing system of workplace law and regulation.
I am not pretending for a moment—and no-one who has been in my situation for the last decade could—that the previous system was perfect. I am not pretending for a moment that it did not need reform and further change. But what I have seen is such a holistic, radical change that I can only think that those who have driven it are prepared to sacrifice the government to try and secure a change which they hope will be permanent and from which the country can never resile. I do not know if that will be the result of it all. The other point that is very clear to me is that many, many Australians who will be affected by the Work Choice regulations and laws will only feel those effects after the next election. That really does need to be understood by many people. Of the agreements that are extant and operating now, many of them will only end after the next election, so those people will not be affected by these laws at present.
As I have said many times in the many debates we have had on this matter, unless an economy is genuinely in dire straits and unless a society is genuinely in dire straits, and both need radical surgery, risky economic and social change like this is dangerous. It is not more important than social cohesion and a fair progressive society. As a migrant, I came to Australia because of its reputation for fairness and for looking out for the everyman and the everywoman in our society. I am disturbed by legislation and regulations like these because I feel that they attack things which go right to the heart of society as it has been for many decades. And those were hard-won gains that people enjoyed: fair, First World wages and conditions that allowed Australia to grow to be competitive, to be wealthy and to become a country of note in the world. Now they have been overturned.
It is absolute nonsense to say that the latest employment figures or the latest economic figures have anything to do with this legislation at all. It is absolute nonsense to think that law which came into place at the end of March has already had an effect on the national indices that we measure. I think we are yet to see the true effects of this legislation, and we are certainly in the early days of it. The great failure of the federal government is that even to this very day, in my view, it has failed to provide any empirical persuasive economic case for these changes. If my memory is correct—and I hope I get the number of pages right—the total economic case that the Treasury advised us that they put forward to support these changes was four pages long. It is just assumed that this is good for the economy.
I am an economist, and hopefully I have a reasonable understanding of it. It is perfectly true that if you take away people’s wages and conditions, alter them completely and their wages fall, profits will grow because you will get a straight shift into the hands of others. It may be true that an additional worker may be employed on occasions because there is now more money to do that. But the whole purpose of a civilised, First World democracy is not to race people down to the bottom. It is not to compete with the poorest or the least advanced nations. It is to maximise their wages and conditions.
I urge anyone who thinks that that is false economics to look at how wonderful the economies of Scandinavia are. They are built on exactly that proposition. They are high-wage, high-skill, highly competitive, globalised countries. The government’s economic argument is faith based and boils down to this: lower wages, far fewer conditions and more power to employers will equal more jobs. I am not convinced and I do not think the country will be convinced, but we will see.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS REGULATIONS 2006</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,27,1
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2006-06-14,"—I also rise to support the motion to disallow these regulations which underpin the Work Choices legislation which Labor vehemently opposes. It is indeed evil and pernicious legislation that will wreck the lives of millions of Australian families. It is the government’s blind ideology systematically destroying the rights and working conditions that generations of Australians have worked and fought for. It is un-Australian and it removes justice and fairness from the workplace.
Senator Murray was dead right in his contribution when he indicated that we have not seen the full effect of this legislation as yet. It will be something that develops over time, but we can certainly see the indicators now. And throughout the Work Choices inquiry we were able to point to examples where similar legislation has in fact been put in place—certainly in Victoria and Western Australia—and we actually saw the race to the bottom happen. We actually saw that—it was presented to the committee in evidence—so it is no surprise to us that already the indicators, only a number of months after the legislation came into force, show that the wages and conditions of working Australians are being stripped away.
Again, Senator Murray was right—we are talking about thousands of workers at this point in time, but we will see hundreds of thousands and millions of workers lose wages and conditions because of this ideological, extreme legislation which this government is putting in place. Labor said during the debate on the Work Choices legislation that this legislation and these regulations will lead to a race to the bottom for the Australian worker. These laws will slowly and insidiously eat away at the family lives and aspirations of millions of Australian workers.
We were not the only ones to say so. The Democrats said so—in fact all parties, apart from the government parties, said so in this chamber. One hundred and fifty-one leading academics in the field of workplace relations also said so. In fact, during the Work Choices inquiry not a single person or organisation apart from employers and employer associations supported this legislation—no-one else. Every other submission opposed the legislation and told us that this will lead to an imbalance in the power relationship in the workplace that will tip that balance, those scales, so far to the power of employers that workers will have no choice but to accept what is put in front to them, or simply not have the opportunity to take a job.
It was not only 151 academics and the Labor Party and the minor parties in this place that said these things—these points were also made by the President of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission Mr Geoffrey Guidice. I probably need to put on record for the Senate that he is in fact an appointee of this government. When speaking at the AMMA national conference on 16 March, Justice Guidice said that the new Fair Pay Commission would undoubtedly slow the rate of growth of minimum wages and that, combined with other income-cutting elements of the new Work Choices, would lead to pressure to cut welfare payments so that incentives to work were not reduced as the rate of wage growth subsided. To quote Justice Guidice specifically, he said:
I think one of the most important issues involved with Work Choices is the reduction of the safety net for the purpose of the no disadvantage test for collective and individual agreements.
That could have a significant effect on incomes of the lowest paid in our community.
I can assure you it’s going to affect our society.
People with low skill levels, low bargaining power, are heading for the Fair Pay and Conditions Standard, which will have an effect on their incomes.
This will be accompanied by a slowdown in the rate of growth of minimum wages—that’s what the Fair Pay Commission is for.
Debate interrupted.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS REGULATIONS 2006</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,27,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-06-14,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
This is the report for the period from 1 November last year to the end of February this year of the conduct of the Refugee Review Tribunal and reviews that they did not manage to complete within 90 days. It is a very apt time to be considering this report, because, as we have heard in this place particularly in question time over the last couple of days but also in wider public debate, there is legislation before the parliament which seeks to enable the government to send a wider range of asylum seekers outside of the rule of Australian law and outside the reach and the review of the Refugee Review Tribunal completely. It makes a mockery of reports such as this.
This report is a direct consequence of amendments made to the Migration Act by this parliament as a consequence of changes announced by the government towards the middle of last year to improve the time for processing and review of people claiming asylum in Australia. That followed a lot of political pressure, particularly from Liberal backbenchers, most notably Mr Georgiou but also others. As Mr Georgiou would acknowledge, that pressure was the culmination of a wider range of public pressure over a long period of time which was sufficient for the government and the Prime Minister to acknowledge that they needed to make some changes that at least made some effort to improve the processing time of asylum claims.
As with the next report, which deals with protection visa processing by the department itself, both the Refugee Review Tribunal and the department are required to assess claims and appeals within 90 days and provide a report to the parliament indicating those cases that have not met that requirement and state the reasons why. It is not a sufficient requirement, as I said at the time, but it is still an improvement. It is certainly an accountability improvement. It is a regular reminder of the need to keep a focus on this area and keep a spotlight on the performance of the department and the tribunal. It is also a particularly strong reminder at this point in time of how massive a backward step it is for this government to now seek to totally subvert the intent of the parliament and the commitments the government made in the middle of last year by deliberately and knowingly attempting to add a new group of people to those who can be removed from Australia and put outside the reach of Australian law, outside the provisions of the Migration Act, including those under section 440A that lead to this report, and outside the scope of any mechanism for public or independent scrutiny, let alone review.
This report details the performance of the RRT and it provides some useful information that I think will enable those who follow this in detail to measure performance, particularly over a period of time, to see whether we continue to improve the trends and the assessment times, to look at the reasons why some of them go beyond the 90-day period and to seek to remedy that wherever possible. It is a useful mechanism. It is not sufficient, but it is useful—but the government are attempting to toss that usefulness out of the window with their latest piece of legislation.
I know there is a lot of focus and pressure at the moment about whether or not that current piece of legislation will be passed. It is no secret that I hope it is not passed, but I hope that senators and the wider community remember that that legislation does not actually introduce a brand new power. It expands the group of people who will be caught under a provision that already exists in the Migration Act and sent outside the rule and reach of law in Australia.
As we all know, many people have already been taken from Australian territory to Nauru and kept there for many years. I remind senators that there are still two people there who have had no independent review of the reason why they have been refused eligibility for a visa in Australia. They have been there for 4½ years and, for all they know, they may be there for another 4½ years. There are still people who can be caught under that provision. If people recognise that this new piece of legislation should be rejected, to be consistent we should be seeking to reverse the provisions that are already in the Migration Act that allow this travesty to happen. I seek leave to continue my remarks. (Time expired)

"Trood, Sen Russell",LP,2006-06-14,"—I rise tonight to draw attention to the alarming downturn in mineral exploration in Australia and particularly in Queensland. It has often been said that Australia’s wealth grew from the sheep’s back. That is true, but it is also true that since early colonial times our mineral resources have also contributed to the wealth of this nation. The sheep has been shorn, as it were, but fortunately mining continues—at least for the moment. We have indeed been a lucky country. Since the gold rushes of the 1850s, Australia has prospered from the country’s varied and vast mineral deposits. In the last 20 years, the minerals industry has contributed something in the vicinity of $500 billion to our wealth. Today, Australia is benefiting from a robust minerals industry and mining, representing eight per cent of GDP. No wonder the standard of living in Australia ranks among the world’s highest.
That is not all. Mining has also played a key role in the development of regional prosperity. Since 1967, an estimated 26 towns, 12 ports, 25 airfields and more than 2,000 kilometres of railway line owe their creation and continued existence to mining. If I may be parochial for a moment, much of Queensland’s pre-eminence as Australia’s leading export state comes from its mineral wealth. Cities such as Mount Isa, Charters Towers and Cairns were all initially established as mining centres or mining support centres. Queensland’s mining sector today is worth more than $16 billion per annum—more than twice the value in the 1990s. About 95,000 Queenslanders owe their livelihoods to the mining industry. It is the biggest employer in regional Queensland. It contributes around $965 million in royalties to the Queensland Treasury. Without this income stream, Queensland’s Labor government’s fiscal incompetence would be more fully exposed than it is.
These figures underscore the fact that we have a substantial resources base—the third largest in the world after the United States and South Africa. We have the world’s largest reserves in zinc, lead, nickel and uranium, and Australia is in the top six for gold and copper. Queensland’s north-west is ranked as one of Australia’s most prospective exploration provinces. It has 28 per cent of known lead and zinc deposits—the richest in the world—five per cent of the world’s silver and 1.5 per cent of the world’s copper. Weipa, in the north of the state, has the world’s largest bauxite resource.
However, Queenslanders—and indeed all Australians—should not be complacent about this treasure chest. The mining industry is in danger of catastrophic decline. In the last financial year, just over $1 billion was spent on exploration. That is 25 per cent less than in 1996. In real terms, exploration expenditure throughout Australia is at its lowest level in almost 30 years.
These statistics reflect a very substantial downturn in activity. Mining companies are not fully exploiting Australia’s immense potential reserves. This country is underexplored. There have not been enough significant mine discoveries in the last six years, and there is a danger that the Olympic Dam mine in South Australia will be the only metallic mine in Australia by 2030. That is barely 24 years away. Currently, we are living off the capital of mines discovered many years ago. Even if a substantial deposit were to be found in the next few years, it would take up to 15 years for that mine to become operational. In the meantime, Australia’s share of investment in global exploration—12.6 per cent—is at a 20-year low and is down 30 per cent on the historical average. Australia has slipped from second to fifth in global mining exploration expenditure.
The unpalatable fact is that we now lag at the back of the exploration queue. Canada dominates the exploration race, but countries such as Chile and Peru in South America attract more attention. Today there are 152 mines in Queensland but, by 2030, only those digging coal and bauxite are likely to remain—unless exploration for base metals and gold is accelerated. No world-class deposit has been discovered in Queensland in 15 years. Only eight small mines have been established since 2000, and these have a life span of only about 15 years.
I have spoken before in this place about the vast resources of uranium in Queensland, which have so far, sadly, gone unexploited. The simple reality is that we need a great deal more investment to rekindle the minerals exploration sector. In 2003, the Prosser report found three major impediments to the exploration industry. First, the globalisation of the minerals industry has resulted in countries other than Australia being preferred for mining development. Second, regulatory constraints imposed by native title, cultural heritage, environmental and operational requirements add to costs and are disincentives. Third, exploration is usually left to the smaller or junior mining companies that have limited investment resources. I think it is also useful to add that the obvious resources, in accessible places, may well have been discovered, but it is the little-known areas in risky places which remain to be explored. The major mining companies, however, seem to be reluctant to spend millions of dollars on risky areas. Junior mining companies find it difficult to access capital from investors seeking higher, less risky returns for their capital.
There is an irony in our current situation. In general, the mining industry is enjoying buoyant times. It is experiencing a significant worldwide boom, and prices for mineral commodities are at 20-year highs. It is true that there is some global exploration expenditure, but Australia is attracting too few of those exploration dollars. Instead, mining companies in Australia have been relying on brownfield exploration to meet the demand of the resources boom rather than taking advantage of high commodity prices to explore more widely afield. This lacks foresight. It will not sustain us into the future.
We need to encourage mining companies to look outside the brown circle and search for sizeable exploitable deposits known to exist in the green zones. The challenge—and it is not a challenge just for Queensland but for the whole country—is to find the next generation of mines by finding new ore bodies that will supplement and replace the finite reserves of existing mines.
Australia’s position as a supplier is not under threat in the short term at least, but in the longer term the situation is more worrying. We have the opportunity to ensure Australia’s prosperity by providing incentives to go out and discover new deposits. I believe that part of the answer is to look anew at the introduction of flow-through shares schemes as an incentive. It is a simple equation: mining companies raise capital for exploration by passing on their tax deductions to the individual investors. It has proved to be of immense value to Canada, which now attracts 19 per cent of the world’s exploration capital. To obviate the challenges, Ottawa legislated a new scheme which will continue until 2007.
Flow-through shares make it easier for junior mining companies to access much-needed capital for exploration. In Australia, governments should also encourage mining companies to invest in the higher-risk greenfield exploration by providing high-quality geoscience information.
It is always something of a challenge to return to an activity which has been important in the past but which has been neglected, but the potential advantage of doing so here is clear. There is a huge danger that the cost of not doing so in these circumstances will be surely felt by every Australian. This is a tragedy that we need to avert. (Time expired)
