"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2004-08-03,"—My question is to Senator Coonan, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. Can the minister confirm that, under the Howard government's price control arrangements, Telstra's standard line rental charges have risen from $11.65 per month in January 2000 to between $26.95 and $29.95 per month today? That is almost triple, Minister. How can the minister justify these massive increases under the Howard government's price control arrangements, when even Telstra admits that this financial year it stands to make $180 million from the latest increases alone? ",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Telstra: Line Rental Charges</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,question
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2004-08-03,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. The minister talks about the shocks of line rental increases, but tripling them in four years is a major shock to consumers. Is the minister aware of Prime Minister Howard's statement on the Neil Mitchell program on 30 April that Telstra's massive line rental increases were a matter for Telstra? John Howard said: 
... I can't control the micro-economic policy decisions of the company ...
On the contrary, isn't it a fact that the Howard government initiated, negotiated and implemented the very price controls in 2002 which have allowed Telstra to massively increase its phone line rental fees? Minister, why did the Prime Minister attempt to deceive Australians in his statement of 30 April? Will the minister now correct the record for the Prime Minister?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Telstra: Line Rental Charges</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,question
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2004-08-03,"—Thank you, Senator Mackay, for the question. It is going to be nice to have a whole new range of people asking questions, much as I enjoyed Senator Conroy and—
—You are still representing the Assistant Treasurer, I note. Don't worry, we won't forget you.
—Thank you. Senator Mackay raised an issue about Telstra's line rental increases. Telstra's ability to raise line rentals is constrained by the price control arrangements that are imposed upon Telstra. The government imposes retail price controls on Telstra to drive efficiency improvements and to lower overall prices for consumers in markets where competition is not yet fully developed. Within these constraints, Telstra, like any other company, may vary its prices as it considers appropriate. Telstra's compliance with the price controls is assessed annually by the ACCC. A breach of the price controls is a breach of Telstra's licence condition, and Telstra can be penalised with a $10 million fine.
The government has accepted the ACCC's and the Productivity Commission's advice that gradually increasing the line rental charges to reflect the costs of providing telephone lines is in the long-term interests of consumers. Labor, of course, dismisses this argument—and I expect Senator Mackay does—thereby showing little regard for the views of independent experts. The government is very conscious of the need to protect low-income consumers from what you might call the shocks of line rental increases. To protect low-income consumers, the government has imposed a licence condition on Telstra that requires it to offer an annual $170 million package of assistance measures for low-income consumers. The package of measures is assessed by the Low Income Measures Assessment Committee, made up of representatives from peak bodies.
Looking to the future, the government has directed the ACCC to review the existing price control arrangements, and the scope for further line rental increases will be considered as part of this review. The Low Income Measures Assessment Committee's assessment of the low-income protection arrangement was that Telstra has responded genuinely and comprehensively to the licence requirement to provide a program to assist low-income Australians to access telecommunications services.
It is interesting to note that this is an area—one of the few, I think, since I have been looking at what the opposition has been saying about telecommunications policy—where Labor has said it would freeze line rental increases and continue to call for price decreases. It is obviously simplistic to force Telstra to lower prices, and it would probably have fairly adverse consequences. Telstra accepts the impact on its revenue and profitability will be passed through to shareholders in the form of lower dividends. The other possibility is that Telstra will look to make up the revenue shortfall by increasing prices for other services, thereby affecting consumers. The point about this policy on line rentals is that it delivers an appropriate outcome for consumers and particularly for low-income consumers.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Telstra: Line Rental Charges</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,answer
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2004-08-03,"—I thought that I had outlined in fairly serious detail, in an attempt to answer Senator Mackay's question, the policy and that the price controls do allow a regime to be delivered that takes into account the needs of consumers, particularly low-income consumers. It is perfectly true—and I agree with the Prime Minister—that the government is not there to micro manage Telstra. The government is there to ensure that there is a regulatory regime that delivers for consumers proper outcomes and that will allow Telstra to operate within a commercial framework in such a way that it is not so constrained that it cannot actually operate. Obviously there is a balance to be struck and that has in fact been done with the benefits for consumers.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Telstra: Line Rental Charges</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,answer
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2004-08-03,"—My question is to Senator Coonan, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. Is the minister aware of comments by the Chairman of the ACCC, Graeme Samuel, on 22 July that Telstra's 50 per cent ownership of Foxtel stifles competition in the communications sector? This flows from the ACCC's Emerging market structures in the communications sectorreport last year which recommended that Telstra divest itself of its Foxtel interest. In light of these statements, does she still hold the view, which she expressed on ABC TV last week, that there was not a case for Telstra divesting itself of its Foxtel interest? How could the minister rule out Telstra divesting itself of its Foxtel interest just one day into the minister's new job? Did the minister actually read the ACCC's 132-page report entitled Emerging market structures in the communications sector, which recommended Telstra get out of Foxtel, or was the minister just parroting the government line?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Telstra: Foxtel</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,question
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2004-08-03,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Speaking of flirting with ideas and policy backflips, I also refer to the minister's further comments in the Age this morning regarding structurally separating Telstra. Can the minister confirm that the government is now considering splitting Telstra into wholesale and retail companies? If so, for the benefit of all Australians, will the minister outline the full details of this policy prior to the election?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Telstra: Foxtel</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,question
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2004-08-03,"—Talking about parroting lines, I am surprised that Senator Lundy is at all interested in what jobs might be created if there was divestiture of Foxtel when she has openly opposed the free trade agreement—a position that would destroy thousands of jobs for Australians, and many of them to do with the information economy that she espouses. On the issue of the potential divestiture of Foxtel, my view is that at this stage it is difficult to see that there is any compelling case that would warrant Telstra divesting itself of its interest in Foxtel. However, it is true to say that there are many people around who do advocate structural separation, vertical separation, spin-offs from Telstra and hollowing out of Telstra. None of that really addresses what kind of industry you would have if you actually did that.
So far as I have been able to tell, there is no cost-benefit analysis that indicates that there would be any net benefit if Telstra were required to divest itself of its interest in Foxtel. From the government's perspective, you would have to ask yourself: what would the industry look like if Foxtel were divested? Who would buy it? Would you have any increase in competition? Would it look any different to the way it does now? Would you simply be setting yourself up for a situation where once again Telstra might enter the market and build another network? What would happen to Optus? It seems to me that there are a number of issues that have not been thought out. The ACCC referred to the advisability of looking at whether there would be any benefit but, as I understand it, there certainly was not any conclusion that the ACCC had come to a view that this should happen.  
On the other hand, the government has always appreciated the costs and risks associated with any kind of vertical separation of Telstra or the spin-off of Foxtel. In fact, the government's position is supported by an OECD report, which I am sure Senator Lundy has read, which found that the benefits are likely to be limited and outweighed by the costs. Obviously, before you consider something as drastic as requiring a divestiture of a business you need to know what impact it is going to have on consumers, the cost to industry and whether or not you are going to end up with a more competitive environment. I understand that the Labor Party is really the only party to have flirted seriously with this idea in recent times when it was included in their `Reforming Telstra' paper, which I have read. As we all remember, it was one of the great policy backflips that characterise the Labor Party. Labor was forced to change its position and concede that in fact it was a flawed policy idea in the long run. The long and short of this issue to do with Foxtel is that it is a leap in the dark. No-one knows whether or not that would benefit the industry and I am very surprised that Senator Lundy would espouse it.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Telstra: Foxtel</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,answer
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2004-08-03,"—Obviously, the government is not in the business of regulating the structure of industries. The government is in the business of regulating the industry so that there can be appropriate access to other players. Indeed, that falls to me as part of my responsibilities in this portfolio and Senator Minchin has a different position, which means that the Labor Party should be agreeing to sell the whole of Telstra and not be worrying about slicing and dicing Telstra so that it is of not much advantage or value to anyone.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Telstra: Foxtel</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,answer
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2004-08-03,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (Senator Coonan) to questions without notice asked by Senators Mackay, Lundy and Stephens today relating to the provision of services by Telstra.
Today the opposition asked a number of questions in relation to the gamut of telecommunications in Australia, hoping for a different response from the government and from a new and, hopefully, more proactive minister. We appear to be sadly disappointed with respect to that. I know that Senator Coonan is new to the portfolio; it is something that some of us have tracked for probably too many years, I would say. The reality with respect to line rentals in particular, which relates to the question I asked, is that since March 2000 line rentals have tripled under this government. The minister says, `Okay, that's fine; we have put appropriate mechanisms in place to assist low-income people.' That is simply not the case.
It is not good enough for the Prime Minister, John Howard, to say, `I can't control the microeconomic policy decisions of the company.' That is a total cop-out on the face of it. To compound that absolute cop-out, the reality is that the government initiated, negotiated with the assistance of the Democrats and implemented the very changes that have allowed Telstra to triple line rentals in the last four years. In fact, Telstra admitted at the last round of estimates hearings that the latest increase alone will reap them $180 million. This is the same outfit that, when asked questions by me and others with respect to credit card fees and why they were charging people for paying their Telstra bills by credit card, effectively said, `Because we can.' It is that level of corporate arrogance that I was hoping the new minister would give some indication that the government was prepared to tackle. But if you are the government of the day, you simply cannot say, `It's nothing to do with us,' which is what the Prime Minister has said. If you are the government of the day, you simply cannot say, `We can't control the microeconomic policy decisions of the company.' If you are the Prime Minister of the day and you cannot control what is happening in a company of which the people of Australia are the majority shareholder, how on earth can you purport to manage the country? That is the reality. 
The cost of line rentals has in fact tripled. The reality is, again, that there has been very slow progress at the other end of the spectrum with respect to assisting people on low incomes. The minister herself made comments with respect to the `shock'. She used that term when she said, `There are processes in place to absorb the shocks of line rental increases'—out of the mouths of babes and government ministers. To the average Australian a tripling of the cost of line rentals is a shock, which is why Labor have said—and we are unabashed about this—we will freeze line rental increases. Telstra were not particularly thrilled about that when they heard that statement at estimates or wherever. We say: `Too bad for them.' We are not elected as individuals and, if we are elected at the next election, we are not elected to represent Telstra. We are elected to represent the people of Australia and that is what Labor will do: we will freeze line rentals. We do not believe that a tripling of line rentals over a very short period is good enough. We know that Australian consumers do not believe it is good enough either. 
The other thing of interest I noticed today, with respect to the comments of the new minister, is that she bluntly admitted there was a difference of position between herself and Senator Minchin. There is a difference of position between a lot of people and Senator Minchin. What is the minister's position? In the time she has been minister, 10 days into the new job, she has gone from announcing that she would continue the previous minister's policy and the government's policy of legislating to sell Telstra before the election to saying that she would legislate to sell Telstra after the election. Then today in the papers we read that she is proposing to split Telstra up—the very thing that Richard Alston vowed and declared he would never, ever do.
In terms of where this government's policy is, we have Senator Minchin saying, `Sell at all costs, we don't care about consumers.' We have Senator Coonan, who is not sufficiently across the matter, saying three different things in the first 10 days into the new job. The only party that is consistent is the Labor Party. We will not sell the remainder of Telstra; we will keep it in the hands of the shareholders of Australia. The way to keep Telstra in public hands is to vote Labor at the next election.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Telstra: Services</title>,Questions Without Notice,8,1,speech
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2004-08-03,"—I rise to speak on the motion to take note of the responses given by Senator Coonan to questions asked of her today. Senator Mackay of course is taking the fixed Labor Party view about Telstra—that is, in order to provide a reasonable level of telephone services and other communication services to the Australian community the government must own that service. Of course, that is absolute nonsense. You do not need to own a service to regulate a service and that is the government's position. We believe, quite emphatically and without any doubt whatsoever, that the basket of regulatory regime factors surrounding Telstra is such that the public of Australia is guaranteed an excellent telephone service, regardless of who owns Telstra. 
It is a shame, I think, for the people of Australia that Senator Mackay, and other members of the ALP, are so ideologically committed to the socialist concept of state ownership and thereby the people of Australia are suffering. I am bound to call the attention of the Senate—since Senator Mackay talked about higher line charges—to what the practical impact has been of the government deregulating the telecommunication service. The government deregulated the tele-ommunication services and, as a result, we now have over 100 telecommunications companies in Australia providing services to the Australian people. The most important outcome of that competition has been a dramatic drop in the cost of telephone charges. The Australian people have benefited enormously from deregulation of the telecommunications system brought in by the Howard government. It would be a genuine tragedy no less for the people of Australia if we were to go back to the regime which existed under the Labor government, where there was a single provider and no competition whatsoever. That meant poor service, slow action in putting on new services, slow action in undertaking repairs and that technological innovation and variety in those kinds of services was never implemented in Australia, whereas it was in other countries.  
For many reasons, the ideological position that we on this side of the house have adopted—that is, a belief in the benefit of competition and that it is good for the customer—has been more than adequately proven, proven in spades in fact, by the experience we have had in the telecommunications industry. As I said, there are over 100 telcos these days, prices have dropped and Australians around this country, not only in the big cities but also in rural areas, have access to the most sophisticated telecommunications in the world.
The fact that we held a Senate inquiry last year into the sale of Telstra seems to have escaped Senator Mackay's mind, even though she participated in that inquiry. We found during the inquiry that people around Australia, and in rural areas in particular, were quite happy with their basic telephone service and they wanted more sophisticated services. They did not want just a basic telephone service anymore; they wanted access to broadband, fast fax and the Internet. Again, competition will bring those services. It is the competition to Telstra, from Optus in particular—who are offering very sophisticated communication services via satellite—which has no doubt led Telstra to introduce the concept of Telstra Country Wide, which has had a very dramatic effect on improving services in country areas and which has brought a great benefit overall to the people of rural Australia. Again, I state that were we locked into the socialist policies of the ALP and a single telecommunications provider in this country, the people of Australia would be much worse off than they have been under the competitive regime introduced to the telecommunications industry by the Howard government.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Telstra: Services</title>,Questions Without Notice,8,1,speech
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2004-08-03,"—I too rise to speak on this motion to take note of the responses given by Senator Coonan to questions asked of her today. I would like to focus my attention on her responses to my questions about regional services and the comments made by the government's appointee as the chair of the regional telecommunications inquiry in 2002, Mr Dick Estens, who only a week ago made the statement that many telecommunications services in the bush remain a shemozzle. This was a bit of plain speaking about what is actually happening in rural Australia in telecommunications services. In a media report, Mr Estens was cited as saying that he was having difficulties having some telephone lines connected in Dubbo. For those people who are not from New South Wales, Dubbo is a major regional hub and a centre that would be expected to have reasonable telecommunications services. The fact that Mr Estens was having difficulty in getting those telephone lines connected is an indication of just how difficult it is in the bush to have some kind of equity of access to telecommunications services. 
But we still hear stories, even in the media this week, that the minister will consider quite soon another attempt to sell off Telstra, despite the government's expert saying that regional telecommunications are not up to scratch. Of course, there is also the obvious absence of any comment or defence of that position by any Nationals representatives in this place. We are also very aware that the two internal documents leaked by Labor earlier this year show that fixed line and mobile networks are going backwards after years of Telstra staff and investment cutbacks. So we have a situation in all of regional Australia where the Telstra network is an unreliable mix of the technology superhighway and what I would describe as bush tracks or gravel tracks. The minister needs to get her head around what the facilities are for regional telecommunications. We have a motley collection of old, copper-wire technology. We have a series of quite soggy cables and underpowered exchanges which, as soon as there is any rain, are flooded and the services become unworkable. We have overlooked lines, we have temporary patches where pair gains are being connected and used as some kind of second-rate service delivery. We have a guarantee from Telstra of an Internet connection speed of 19.2 kilobits per second, which in many areas of regional Australia is a complete joke. Even where I live, only 15 kilometres out of Goulburn, the Internet connection speed on a good day is sometimes only 14 kilobits per second, which means it can take hours to download a simple virus protection program, for example.
So regional telecommunications services are still a joke for many people. The minister talked today about the move to use telecommunications services to deliver services for health and education. I have to say to the minister that she needs to take a bit of a reality check on how effective that can be when we do not have access to those kinds of services in many of our communities. We have a big push to take on satellite connections but, even so, we have the situation that Mr Estens commented on, which is that the combination of service providers and the deregulation of service providers mean that it can take weeks to get a technician to come to either install or repair any of those kinds of services. So regional Australia has been seriously let down by The Nationals and by the Liberal Party regional representation in this place. As Senator Mackay said, Labor are committed to ensuring that we maintain Telstra in public ownership for all Australians.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Telstra: Services</title>,Questions Without Notice,8,1,speech
"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2004-08-03,"—The contributions of senators opposite has given us a fairly clear indication today of just how the Labor Party would operate should they be given a chance to govern, which I suspect they will not be given for quite a long time.
—To use Senator Mackay's words, what they are interested in is microeconomic management. Unlike you, Senator Mackay, through you, Mr Deputy President, this government has confidence in the boards that it appoints, it has confidence in the management that those boards oversee and it goes about the business of government by not interfering. We do not interfere, we do not intervene and we do not go about the business of distorting the good work that government appointed boards do. If we are not confident in them we will replace the chairman or replace the personnel and we will move on with business. Telstra goes about servicing the legitimate telecommunications needs of Australians, particularly in rural and regional Australia, and it earns dividends for the government—dividends that the Labor Party would like to get their hands on to squander. What we have done in government, for example, is reduce the huge amount of debt that the Labor Party, the now discredited Hawke-Keating government, left behind for us to clean up. 
We unashamedly support competition and we unashamedly support the operation of the market, but we also acknowledge that the competitor market does have some limitations. To overcome the limitations of the market the Howard government is supporting competitive outcomes with regulated consumer safeguards and targeted government funding. In a speech to a CEDA conference in May, the former minister said that the government believed this would achieve the best outcomes not only for the industry but also for all Australians. It is perfectly plain, and it should be to those opposite, that the Howard government is not going to divert from this basic policy framework. 
The Australian telecommunications market has dramatically changed since it was opened up in 1997, and we heard that throughout the recent inquiry. A study conducted by the Allen Consulting Group on behalf of the Australian Government Communications Authority found that `competition resulted in consumer benefits of between $330 and $1,028 per household in 2002-02'. There you have real and sustainable consumer benefits. The consultants also found that the introduction of competition accounted for increased small business profits of $1.7 billion. Presumably senators opposite would want those particular benefits to remain with small businesses. The study found that that had resulted in 54,000 additional jobs and $12 billion worth of growth in the Australian economy. Again, these are very real and quantifiable benefits that we do not hear senators opposite acknowledge.
Only this month the government announced that telecommunications consumers will have stronger representation as a result of grants totalling $700,000 to 28 consumer organisations. The grants will ensure that the needs and interests of consumers are represented in the development of telecommunications industry codes and practices. A new feature of the grants for 2004-05 is the allocation of sitting fees to all members of the Australian Communications Industry Forum Consumer Advisory Council and the ACIF Disability Advisory Board. This funding means that consumer bodies who want to participate in the self-regulatory process in telecommunications have sufficient and appropriate financial support. Funds are also to be allocated for the representation of consumers in regional areas and consumers with disabilities. The peak representative organisations for residential and small business consumers, the Consumers Telecommunication Network, and small enterprise telecommunications centres will also receive funding. This will help them to employ staff with expertise and experience in telecommunications and representation for the long-term benefit of consumers. Organisations representing consumers with disabilities, including the Telecommunications and Disability Consumers Representation, Australian Association of the Deaf, Deafness Forum Australia and Women with Disabilities Australia, have also been allocated funds.
Under the Telecommunications Act 1997 the Howard government has allocated $4.6 million to consumer bodies for representation since 1998. What these particular figures and the government initiatives clearly show is that the Howard government is very committed to taking on the concerns of consumers and of the organisations that represent consumers, particularly those organisations that represent consumers with disabilities and those who may be disadvantaged by the tyranny of distance as a result of the size of our country. What really worries me during these debates is that you hear senators opposite and opposition members in the other place simply refusing to acknowledge the great benefit that has resulted from the deregulation of the telecommunications market as well as the great work that Telstra does. We are not into microeconomic management of the way Telstra goes about its business; we are all about delivering real benefits.

"Buckland, Sen Geoffrey",ALP,2004-08-03,"—I too rise to speak on the answers given by Senator Coonan to questions today. One thing that really does stand out about the difference between Labor and the government in relation to Telstra is that Labor will absolutely never sell Telstra. We will keep Telstra as a majority public owned company delivering decent services to all Australians—not the services that are provided by this government through Telstra. Labor is committed to serving the outback and to serving people in remote and isolated areas on the same basis that it serves city dwellers. We believe that Telstra should go back to the real basics—providing jobs and services to all Australians. I was interested in Senator Coonan's comment that Telstra was protecting charges for the long-term benefit of all consumers. There was a $180 million profit from the last increase alone, yet not all consumers have easy or good access to Telstra services. We talk about travel and we talk about mobile phone linkages between major centres. I can tell you that there is not clear access for mobile phones between Adelaide and Whyalla, Adelaide and Port Augusta, Whyalla and Port Augusta and Whyalla and Port Lincoln. Certainly, on the west coast, when you leave the confines of Port Augusta you cannot pick up a mobile phone signal again until you get to Ceduna, some 400-plus kilometres away.
The same goes for the south-east of the state. If you go off the main highway you lose phone contact for many hours at a time. If you go north towards Alice Springs, Coober Pedy, Marla or Glendambo, you will get coverage between Port Augusta and Coober Pedy for 25 kilometres, if you are lucky, as you go past Woomera. That is the total service that you have for your mobile phone. Then you talk to the people who live in those remote outback areas, to the graziers in the areas of Oodnadatta, William Creek, Marla, Maree and the station country. They have difficulty getting landline access to their Internet services. In fact, in some locations they can wait two hours for simple emails to open—two hours to open an email because the service is so poor.
I am interested too in the attitude of The Nationals, particularly the Queensland Nationals. I thought at one stage that they were going to go to the wire on this and that it could have caused a bit of a revolt within the coalition. They were going to stick by Telstra forever and a day. But of course they say one thing in Queensland and another here. John Anderson stated at the Queensland Nationals conference on the weekend that he opposed the sale of Telstra until regional services were up to scratch. But the Deputy Prime Minister has voted twice in this parliament to sell Telstra, with no strings attached. John Anderson says one thing in Queensland but he comes to Canberra and he has a totally different attitude. But that is not all. The Nationals really do not know where they are going with this. They know that if Telstra is privatised services will get worse and prices will rise. Telstra will leave town faster than the banks, and The Nationals know it.

"Hill, Robert (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",LP,2004-08-03,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate records its deep regret at the death, on 27 July 2004, of the Honourable Dr Henry Alfred Jenkins, former Speaker of the House of Representatives and member for Scullin, and places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. 
Harry Jenkins, as he was known, was born on 24 September 1925 in Caulfield, Victoria. He was educated at Ivanhoe Church of England Grammar School, going on to study medicine at the University of Melbourne. Dr Jenkins worked as a general medical practitioner until 1961, when he entered Victorian state parliament as a member of the Legislative Assembly for the seat of Reservoir, holding the seat until his resignation in 1969. He also served two terms on the Victorian State Executive of the ALP from 1958 to 1961 and from 1964 to 1968.
Dr Jenkins entered federal parliament in 1969 after successfully standing as the ALP candidate for the electorate of Scullin, holding the seat until his resignation in 1985. In May 1983 Dr Jenkins was elected as Speaker of the House of Representatives, a position he held until his retirement. Dr Jenkins once said that a sense of humour, tolerance and a good knowledge of standing orders were necessary attributes for a Speaker to retain the respect and control of both sides of the parliament. He had those attributes.
During his time in parliament, Dr Jenkins was a member of the House of Representatives standing committees on standing orders and privileges, on the environment and conservation, on expenditure and on the Library, the House of Representatives Select Committee on Wildlife Conservation, the Joint Statutory Committee on Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings and the joint standing committees on the parliamentary committee system and the new Parliament House. He travelled overseas with several parliamentary delegations to conferences in Europe, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
A major innovation during Dr Jenkins's term as Speaker was reviewing the rules governing the televising and broadcasting of parliament, allowing the film library to build up, the televising of budgets and responses accessed by news services. Dr Jenkins said that he would like to see `a unit which continuously televised both houses with various media outlets able to use what they wanted, when they wanted'. 
After leaving politics, Dr Jenkins was appointed Ambassador to Spain where he served until 1998. In the 1991 Australia Day honours list, Dr Jenkins was appointed as a member of the Order of Australia for services to the Australian parliament and to the community. As a former Speaker of the House of Representatives, he was a recipient of the recent Centenary Medal.
On behalf of the government, I extend to his wife, Wendy, and to his children, Harry—the current member for Scullin and Second Deputy Speaker—Tim, Mark and Jane and to other family members and friends our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Jenkins, Hon.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2004-08-03,"—On behalf of the opposition, I support this condolence motion on the death of the former Speaker of the House of Representatives and member for Scullin, Harry Jenkins. Harry Jenkins's career spanned some of Labor's most tumultuous times. He joined the Labor Party in Victoria in 1955 at the time of the split, which certainly showed he had bottle. From 1958 to 1961 and from 1964 to 1968, he was a member of the Victorian central executive of the ALP—a ringside seat to that state party's self-destructive internal conflicts and external feuds. In 1961 he became the member for Reservoir in the Victorian Legislative Assembly, gaining a parliamentary as well as a machinery perspective on Victorian Labor's troubles.
He became Labor's spokesman on health, but his leadership ambitions foundered on the rock of the parliamentary party's deep hostility to the state central executive. Harry contested the leadership against Clyde Holding in May 1967, but lost by what the Age newspaper reported as a clear majority. A central executive loyalist, Harry had no chance of overcoming the Victorian state parliamentary party's prejudices against him. As Gough Whitlam was struggling to reform the Victorian branch to restore its ability to compete electorally and contribute positively to Labor's federal fortunes, Harry Jenkins made the move to the federal parliament. He became the member for Scullin as part of Whitlam's class of 1969. Then, three years later, he was part of the first federal Labor government for 23 years.
Such a rapid change in political fortunes—from the dispiriting vista of a divided and electorally incompetent state party to the excitement of a new era in federal politics—few politicians experience. But Harry's roller-coaster ride was not over. In 1975 the government of which he was a part was dismissed—an event which Harry described as `the most disgusting and shocking thing he'd ever seen in politics'—in my view, a very fair and sound judgment. After 1975 two more dispiriting electoral defeats followed, until Labor's 1983 election victory when Harry became the first Speaker of the House of Representatives in the Hawke government.
As we have heard, Harry Jenkins was born in 1925 and grew up knowing first-hand the hardships that could confront workers and their families. His father, a storeman and packer, was on `rationed work' during the Depression and, in their Melbourne neighbourhood, having one week's work in two made him one of the lucky few. Harry got his first part-time job aged 11 and worked his way through secondary school and a science and then a medical degree at Melbourne University. He married his life-long partner, Hazel Winter, always known as Wendy, in 1951. His political views were shaped by his own early experience, but he did not become politically active until his thirties. 
In 1961 he won the seat of Reservoir for Labor in the Victorian parliament and, suitably for a doctor, eventually became the state opposition spokesman on health. Like many of us, Harry was drawn to the Australian Labor Party by his belief in fairness and decency. The promise of hope and opportunity—hope and opportunity for all—that has drawn Australians to Labor for the past century was a promise Harry fervently believed in.
He made his greatest contribution to the federal parliamentary Labor Party and to the federal parliament in the last years of his career. He became caucus secretary in January 1976, and he was a very good one. His minutes were extensive and accurate. And this is a classic case of an MP's interests and community involvement fitting him to the role he played in caucus and in parliament because the great involvement Harry had in the Lions Club had given him years of experience in taking minutes and chairing meetings—skills he applied first as caucus secretary, then when he became chair of caucus in 1981, and then as Speaker of House of Representatives in 1983.
As Speaker, Harry Jenkins was fair and balanced. He gave notice when he assumed the office that, while a Labor man, he was not a government stooge. He told the House and the government, `The answers by ministers should not be totally irrelevant to the questions or be ministerial statements.'
As Speaker, Harry defended the dignity of the House where he felt it was genuinely under threat—cracking down on unparliamentary language and inappropriate clothing—but he was always aware of the need for parliament to be accessible as well as orderly. He discarded the old-fashioned wig and gown garb of the Speaker and he did not insist that MPs wear ties. Harry also saw the need for parliament to embrace new ways of reaching its constituents. His time as Speaker saw the rules governing the televising of parliament relax considerably, and he looked forward to the days of continual broadcasting of both the House of Representatives and the Senate—I am not sure that he spoke of the likely ratings of those broadcasts.
Harry was famously even tempered. He was willing to take action to suspend unruly MPs and once suspended the unruly Alan Cadman, as well as Wilson Tuckey and then Deputy Leader of the Opposition John Howard, all in one day. But on the whole, Harry did not throw his weight around. During one stormy sitting then Prime Minister Hawke tried to have action taken against opposition leader Andrew Peacock, pointing out to Harry that Peacock's comments had reflected badly on the Speaker. `My skin is thick enough to cop that,' Harry retorted.
That was not the only occasion on which Bob Hawke tried to direct Harry's rulings. On one occasion Harry found it necessary to remind Ralph Willis to make his answer relevant to the question he had been asked. `That's exactly what he's doing!' snapped Hawke. He was no more successful in steering the Speaker than before. `I'm quite capable of understanding plain English!' retorted the Speaker.
Of course that was not the only occasion on which Harry clashed with Bob Hawke. After the 1975 election, in which Labor did so very badly, there was some movement to prompt Hawke to come into the federal parliament, which of course would have required a newly elected or re-elected sitting member to resign from politics. The story goes that the future Prime Minister first approached Harry, already suffering the early effects of the motor neurone disease which took his life, and proposed that Harry retire to give Hawke the safe Labor seat of Scullin. In no uncertain terms, Harry refused. He told journalists that while he certainly thought Hawke would have `something to offer' if elected, `a Labor leader is not selected from outside the caucus and that's that'. Harry did not retire until 1986, and then it was his son, Harry Jenkins, who succeeded him in the seat of Scullin. Bob Hawke, of course, some years after Harry had refused to make way for him, became the member for Wills. 
Harry's long career in the ALP, in state and federal parliaments, as Ambassador to Spain and in community work—which he listed as one of his two recreations for Who's Who—was supported by the devotion of his wife, Wendy, to whom he was in turn deeply devoted. Wendy was extremely active politically, and served her time on the Victorian state executive. For 53 years, Wendy and Harry were a team in all aspects of their lives. Today, our thoughts and sympathies are with Wendy in her grief and also with Wendy and Harry's children, Tim, Mark, Jane and our colleague in the House of Representatives, Harry Jenkins. Knowing the younger Harry Jenkins as we do, a Labor colleague in the lower house, this loss is more personally felt for many of us on this side of politics.
In his final speech to the House of Representatives, Harry quoted the words of Jim Scullin, the Labor Prime Minister whose name is given to the federal seat that Harry held and his son holds today:
Justice and humanity demand interference whenever the weak are being crushed by the strong.
Harry chose to end his parliamentary career with that statement of the ideals he had aspired to as a boy and young man and as a loyal member of the Australian Labor Party and a respected member of state and federal parliaments. In his long career, those ideals were most completely expressed in his dedication to the institutions of parliamentary democracy. Harry had great faith in the capacity of democratic institutions: in their capacity to bring about change, to deliver justice and to protect the vulnerable in our society. This was the foundation of his defence of those institutions, of his determined but never unreasonable commitment to the effective operation of parliament. And he served our parliament and our democracy well.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Jenkins, Hon. Dr Henry Alfred, AM</title>",Condolences,9,1,speech
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2004-08-03,"—I join in supporting the condolence motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill, and supported by the Labor Party. I remember Dr Harry Jenkins when I first came into parliament. He was the Speaker and, although we did not have a lot to do with each other, I met him on a number of occasions. He was a man who obviously put a lot into the ALP, not only in his role as the Speaker but also in the Victorian Legislative Assembly from 1961 to 1969. He had a long haul in federal parliament and was the 18th Speaker of the House of Representatives. He is said by his friends and colleagues in the ALP to have had a great sense of humour and dignity. He was firm as a Speaker. Any position he held, he held well and he was respected by all. He also was the Australian Ambassador to Spain from 1986 to 1988. He leaves behind a wife and family. I wish them well in their grief. I acknowledge a stalwart of the Labor Party who gave most of his life to that cause.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2004-08-03,"—I present the 119th report of the Committee of Privileges entitled Possible false or misleading evidence before the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate:
(a)	endorse the finding contained at paragraph 1.23; and  
(b)	adopt the recommendation at paragraph 1.30,
of the 119th report of the Committee of Privileges.
On 24 March 2004, on the motion of Senator Mackay, the Senate referred to the Committee of Privileges the following matter:
Whether any false or misleading evidence was given by witnesses representing Telstra in relation to the matter of the network fault rate and deterioration of the network, and whether any contempt was committed in that regard.
This matter arose from the evidence given by officers of Telstra at additional estimates hearings on 16 February 2004. Some weeks later a document was tabled in the House of Representatives which was claimed to be an internal Telstra briefing about the state of the network. On the basis of apparent contradictions between the evidence and the briefing, Senator Mackay raised this as a matter of privilege and the President granted it precedence.
The committee received further material from Senator Mackay and provided details of allegations to the Telstra officers concerned, who submitted a joint response to the committee. The Telstra officers provided the committee with a substantial and detailed explanation, which sought to distinguish the evidence they had given at the estimates hearing from the circumstances covered by the internal Telstra briefing. In accordance with its usual practice, the committee provided a copy of the response to Senator Mackay and invited further comment.
Having received further comment and having analysed all of the material before it, the committee applied the criteria in privilege resolution 3, which, amongst other things, requires that it takes into account whether a person who committed an act which may be a contempt did so knowingly. The committee was unable to conclude that the officers had knowingly misled the legislation committee and agreed that no contempt should be found.
Unfortunately, this is not the first allegation of misleading evidence investigated by the committee, nor is it the first time that officers of Telstra have been the subject of an inquiry of this nature. Some time ago, after investigating a number of these cases, the committee arranged for a reminder to be given to witnesses appearing before Senate committees and joint committees administered by the Senate that false or misleading evidence may constitute a contempt of the Senate. Concerned at the apparently widespread ignorance of parliamentary privilege within the Public Service, the committee recommended, and the Senate resolved, that senior public servants should study parliamentary principles to avoid committing offences through ignorance. The committee included a requirement of all departments and agencies to report on their compliance with the resolution. The committee reported on the outcome of the resolution in its 89th report.
In concluding its examination of this case the Committee of Privileges is recommending that Telstra, an organisation that appears frequently before Senate committees, be required to report to the Senate on measures it has taken to ensure that its senior officers are appropriately trained in their obligations to parliament. I commend the report to the Senate and seek leave to continue my remarks.

"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2004-08-03,"—Earlier in my speech, I was discussing multilateral versus bilateral trading arrangements and I was making the point that a number of witnesses to our inquiry raised the issue of whether or not the bilateral free trade agreement with the United States would undermine our capacity to successfully negotiate multilateral trade arrangements in the future. I posed two questions: does the negotiation of this free trade agreement with the United States—and others with Singapore and Thailand—help or hinder our position within the current round of WTO multilateral trade negotiations; and what would be the impact of this agreement on Australia's position in the Cairns Group of fair trading agricultural exporting economies? I am proud to say that the Cairns Group was formed when I was working at the National Farmers Federation, which has always been a very strong supporter of the Cairns Group.
This was a very interesting academic debate and one that I was pleased to take part in, but by far the most compelling evidence presented to the committee came not from academics or theorists but from those with direct experience at the coalface of international trade negotiations. Mr Bruce Gosper, First Assistant Secretary of Australia's Office of Trade Negotiations, told the committee:
I cannot think off the top of my head of any Cairns Group member that is not part of a preferential trade arrangement or negotiating one—most of them are negotiating several. The Cairns Group continues to operate very effectively. It had a very successful meeting in February this year in Costa Rica at which this issue was not raised, either directly or indirectly.
The highly respected trade analyst Mr Alan Oxley, who has extensive experience in international trade negotiations, provided another compelling statement to the committee in response to a question from Senator Cook. He said: 
You asked ... what would be the downside for Australia if we rejected the agreement. We would probably be regarded as the most bizarre country in the world for having rejected a free trade agreement with the world's biggest economy—an agreement that would actually give us access in agriculture, which is one of the most difficult areas, notwithstanding the fact that it is not perfect—when many other countries are lining up to have an agreement with them. I honestly do not know how any serious Australian government could justify that to the world at large.
Mr Peter Corish, the president of the National Farmers Federation, told the committee:
As I said in my opening comments, we have not seen any evidence of a negative reaction to either the reputation or the credibility of the Cairns Group or to Australia's general credibility and reputation in the WTO process. I say that because, since the conclusion of the FTA negotiations, there has been a Cairns Group ministerial meeting also attended by a number of Cairns Group farm leaders in Costa Rica. Certainly no negative comments were made to any of our farm leaders there nor, as we understand it, to the ministerial group about our negotiated agreement between Australia and the United States.
There we have it: three highly respected individuals representing specific areas of expertise commenting positively on the operation of a bilateral agreement in relation to criticism about multilateral arrangements and how they might be affected by the signing of this agreement.
I turn to quarantine, an issue which was very significant in the inquiry carried out by the Senate committee and the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. There were some quite irresponsible assertions presented to the committee which claimed that in some way Australia's strict science-based quarantine system would be compromised by the agreement. Having thoroughly examined these assertions, I can clearly and unambiguously inform the Senate that it is now clear that they were nothing more than that—simply assertions. They were not based on fact, and they were not supported by any empirical evidence.
On this issue, Ms Virginia Greville, Special International Agricultural Adviser from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, told the committee on May 18:
The best evidence is the text that has been negotiated. It explicitly preserves and protects the quarantine processes of each jurisdiction. Our import risk analysis process is well documented and, as you know, transparent and challengeable at a variety of points along the way.
Mr Acting Deputy President Cherry, I think that you and I—as members of the Senate committee that is hearing some of these challenges for apples, bananas and pork—can attest to that transparent and contestable process. Ms Greville went on to say:
That has been explicitly preserved, as has the US's system, and all that the text deals with is enhanced technical cooperation and exchange during that process ... At no point have we changed the outcome, sped up or fast-tracked any IRA process ... 
I thank Ms Greville for her quite substantial expertise that was made available to the committee during its inquiry. In relation to the Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Matters and the Standing Technical Working Group on Animal and Plant Health Matters that will be created under chapter 7 of the FTA, Ms Greville advised:
What it will not do is have any impact on our level of protection or our conservative quarantine regime or our standards, no matter what they say.
These statements were reinforced by Mr Andy Stoler, the Executive Director of the Institute for International Business, Economics and Law at the University of Adelaide—a very skilled and experienced trade negotiator. He said:
There is nothing that one can find anywhere in the text of this agreement that suggests that either side has the slightest intention of moving away from scientifically based risk assessment procedures as the basis for quarantine actions. You will not find anything in the text. You will find references to facilitating trade to the greatest extent possible while preserving the rights of the parties to protect animal and plant life or health but nowhere will you find the suggestion that we are going to abandon that concept. 
In conclusion, the FTA will benefit all sections of the Australian economy. I have focused my remarks today on what it will mean for Australia's primary industries because this is a focus of interest for me. Trade liberalisation, both multilateral and bilateral, has served Australian industry very well, increasing productivity and competitiveness across all sectors. The FTA will deliver real economic benefits and will secure for Australia greater access to the world's largest and most powerful economy. It will ensure Australia has the capacity to compete against other suppliers from Canada, Mexico and other countries which currently enjoy preferential access to the US market. All major sectors of the Australian economy stand to benefit from the free trade agreement.
I state clearly and unambiguously to the Senate that assertions that this agreement will impact on Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme prices are simply groundless. These claims are not supported by the text of the agreement and are not supported by any genuine evidence. When examined by the select committee—and, incidentally, the treaties committee—they did not stand up to scrutiny. Furthermore, many of the claims that have been made in relation to intellectual property law changes introduced by this agreement are, in fact, baseless and wrong. Far from being detrimental, the intellectual property provisions of the agreement will provide substantial benefit to Australia's creative industries, which must compete within a global entertainment market.
Greater symmetry between Australian and US laws will provide the certainty needed to produce greater investment in Australia's creative talents and will deliver substantially improved growth and employment. I urge all senators who believe in trade, who believe in promoting export opportunities for our very valuable primary and secondary industries, and who believe in creating—ultimately—a wealthier and more economically secure Australia to support this legislation.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-08-03,"—The Greens will oppose the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004 and the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff) Bill 2004. This legislation is not about a free trade agreement at all—there is nothing free about this agreement; it is a restricted, pointed, biased agreement which favours our giant but friendly neighbour across the ocean, the United States, against the interests of this nation. We oppose the legislation because it is not in Australia's interests—albeit that it is in the interests of the United States, and in particular the corporate sector in the United States, which stands to gain most from it.
I will move that further debate on these bills be adjourned until after the US-Australia free trade agreement has been subject to a review of the environmental impacts arising from the agreement. I want to say up front that there is no environmental impact assessment. Extraordinarily enough, if you look at chapter 21 of the agreement, you will find that under this section—which deals with institutional arrangements and administration—there is a tack-on at the end which says:
 ... At its first meeting, the Joint Committee shall consider each Party's review of the environmental effects of this Agreement and shall provide the public an opportunity to provide views on those effects. 
I understand that the US is undertaking a legislative environmental review, which started in March this year. I want to pose a few questions at the outset, because the environment has been left out of this debate. Where is the environmental review by the Australian government? How was it set up? How does the public feed into that? What are the parameters of that environmental review? When is it going to be brought to bear on the free trade agreement and how? These are some questions, amongst many others, that the Greens will be asking in the committee stages.
Here we have a bilateral agreement, in a world of some 200 nations, between Australia and the US. We live in a world, in the 21st century, where we have six billion people living diverse lives under diverse cultures, histories and economic circumstances. Our world is troubled by a breakdown between the haves and the have-nots. We live in an age where there is both mass communication and instant reportage about what is happening in communities in any section of the planet to communities in any other section of the planet. We have seen the inevitable spread of technology, used both for the good and the bad.
If we are going to aim for a secure future for what will be nine billion people on the planet by mid-century—before, hopefully, the population begins to decline to a more sustainable level—we have to ensure that fairness and a fair go are at the social forefront, that there is environmental protection and that there is democratic input into the way that the world works.
This free trade agreement stands against all those things. It does not foster the idea of a multinational trading arrangement which takes into account environmental, social and democratic imperatives in order to raise the level of fairness on the planet, to close the gap somewhat between the haves and have-nots, and to ensure that we bequeath to following generations a fairer and therefore more secure planet, instead of a more unfair and therefore less secure planet, which is the prescription that comes out of agreements such as this one.
However, when it is taken into a narrower focus, we have to ask: where is the democracy in this so-called free trade agreement? It was devised by the Howard and Bush administrations in order to fulfil the political goal of both of these conservative administrations, without reference to parliament. We get that now, at the tail end of proceedings and without the public input and discussion which should have been inherent in what is such a massively important and binding agreement for our great nation, not just for the next five years or 50 years, but, so far as we may judge as we sit here today, forever. 
The agreement binds not only many of the processes in our society but also this parliament. It does so in a way that is out of the reach of this parliament, because once the parliament gives assent to this agreement—and that essentially means, on this side of the ocean, the Senate—changing it becomes conditional on the American interest being fostered. If you do not have that, it will not be changed in the future. Being able to alter the agreement will be out of the question unless the American interest is served. The only option would be to repudiate it further down the line. That, of course, is unconscionable when the option now is to repudiate it before it comes into force, with many fewer consequences for this nation—a nation which has an economy and population less than one-tenth the size of those of the United States.
It is very important to understand that the agreement is outside the reach of our democracy in both its formulation and its future impact on this country. This agreement is not subject to parliamentary scrutiny; it is not subject to parliamentary accountability; it is not subject to parliamentary alteration. It is another manifestation of the increasing wish by executive governments in this country, which has been refined and strengthened by the Howard government, to act as extra-parliamentary governing authorities, outside the ability of parliament to review and make alterations in the future. 
We know that, in the Senate, the government is in favour of this free trade agreement and, in the main, the crossbench is against it. That has left the opposition, the Labor Party, holding the balance of power. What the Labor Party does in these circumstances is extraordinarily important. I would have expected that it would have stuck with what it felt about the legislation from the outset. That was: no sugar, no deal. That was: no control over and safeguard of our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, no deal. That was: no protection for manufacturing industries in this country, as against the bigger manufacturing clout of the US corporations, no deal. And it ought to have included: no protection for the Australian environment, no deal. But on all counts the opposition has collapsed. On all counts it is left to the Greens and the crossbench to defend this national interest from the impact of a much greater economy, a much greater corporate sector and, I believe, a much less responsive parliamentary system in Washington.
The question is: what is the Labor Party going to do about it? We have heard from Senator O'Brien that it will move two measly amendments which are at the margins as far as the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and cultural integrity are concerned. They are two minor amendments which go no way towards plugging the enormous holes that are created when you look at this agreement from the point of view of the Australian national interest.
One must ask: what does that add up to? It adds up essentially to the Labor Party saying: `We're going with Prime Minister John Howard. We're going with President George W. Bush.' They are saying they want a thin veneer of cover from two of the most outspoken groups within our community—those in the cultural sector of our community, who are outraged by this agreement, and those who are concerned about the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. It must be remembered that Labor did a backflip just two months ago in this place when they agreed, at the Howard government's behest, to add a cost of $4.90 per prescription for families when they go to pharmacies. In the wake of the tax cuts for the rich, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme now becomes vulnerable to future appeal action by the gigantic multinational corporations, which have enormous clout in the United States, in ways that are unspecified but real.
We have had from the ANU one estimate that it may add as much as $1.1 billion per annum onto the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme five years out from now. All of those who saw Four Corners last night will know that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme becomes vulnerable to an extraordinarily powerful US drugs manufacturing sector, which lobbies enormously and has great power within the halls of congress. Advocates have already been in this country—witness Republican senator Jon Kyl—trying to promote the interests of these corporations. An active Republican senator says on that program—I am paraphrasing here, but the sentiment is correct—that, yes, he does expect that people like Australians should be paying more for what he alleges is the development costs of pharmaceuticals but which the program showed very clearly was for helping the profit line and the advertising impact of the drug corporations, which have left the United States with a delivery system for the sick and the ill far, far inferior to this country's. 
This agreement will help line the pockets of pharmaceutical corporations in the United States. It inevitably moves us a step towards a far inferior system in the United States where the sick, the aged, the retired and the poor not only cannot afford many of the pharmaceuticals available but, as we know, cannot access hospital care in a country which is far worse served by the unrestrained market and the division between rich and poor than this country is.
Look at the manufacturing industries. What is the outcome there? The government predicts it may create 30,000 jobs. Much closer to the mark is the AMWU's prediction that there will be 40,000-plus jobs potentially lost out of the manufacturing industries in Australia, not least the car components industry.
—They support the free trade agreement!
—Where is the amendment to safeguard that? Where is the support for this industry that is going to stop that happening? I hear an interjecting Liberal senator from Tasmania opposite who is amenable to a manufacturing arrangement which says, `Open the door to Australia to all manufactured goods, remove the barriers,' but when it comes the other way it allows a restriction by the United States on the import from Australia of fast ferries. That is an industry that is very important to our home state and to this nation generally. There is a blockage put there because it did not suit the American negotiators. The Howard government collapsed and that senator opposite did not speak up for it. The opposition has not put an amendment in here to fix that either. 
The reality is that any amendment coming into this place on this agreement, whether it be on manufacturing jobs, pharmaceuticals, the environment or the proper transparencies and processes overlooking this legislation, cannot be inserted into the free trade agreement, because it is signed outside this parliament. It is an agreement between Mr Howard and President Bush; it is extramural—it is outside the reach of this parliament. Labor has two amendments here which are at the margins and are acceptable, it says—we will see what the government says—within the free trade agreement. It dare not move outside the free trade agreement. It cannot. You accept it or you reject it. Labor accepts it. The Greens reject it because we do not believe it is in the national interest.
Look at water. We are in an age where governments, including this government, are moving to privatise water in this country—to give the God-given rains into the hands of the corporate sector. We know that US corporations are greatly interested in that. They have invested billions of dollars already into water rights in other countries like Mexico and Bolivia. Put down Australia next. What happens when you have a US corporation which owns water rights to a river system in this country and it is determined, as we are finding now time and time again, that we need a natural environmental flow to ensure that river's biodiversity and ecological health? That corporation will be able to overcome any legislation brought through this parliament and demand compensation for its ownership of God's rain falling on this country. It takes the money for something which it does not create and it should not own.
We have expropriation clauses right through this agreement blurring the time-honoured legal situation in this country of governments compensating for appropriation of property. But when it comes to wider rights, that is a different matter—it is not so here. The expropriation clauses enable American corporations in the future to sue governments here who want to implement the public right to a healthy environment, to a better social future and to a whole range of cultural amenity. The so-called expropriation right will end up being expropriation by American corporations of taxpayers' dollars in this country under this agreement. There is no caveat—there is no let-out clause.  
What happens when you say, `Who is going to adjudicate on this, for goodness sake?' You will find in chapter 21 that there is a joint committee. It oversees no fewer than eight other working groups, which it sets up. Does the parliament appoint this joint committee? Is there a democratic vote in here as to who will be appointing the judge, jury and executioner if disputes arise between this country and another? No, there is no say whatever. It is the minister for trade of the day and his American counterpart—again, it is the executive government outside the reach of this parliament who appoints those persons.
What are the rules? The committee sets the rules itself. There are no rules set by this parliament or agreed to by the US Congress. There are no rules under this Bush-Howard agreement—aren't they the great advocates of democracy and liberty?—which will allow the elected representatives of the parliament to determine such a matter. When the joint committee makes its findings, do we know about it? Is it open to the public? Will there be parliamentary debate? The answer is no for all those questions. What is this committee's bailiwick? It sets up a whole stack of other committees. It has committees looking at manufacturing and at intellectual property rights, which are going to go up for universities. The US patent rules rule, not the Australian patent rules. We are subservient. There is what is called a mickey mouse clause. It will not be mickey mouse for this country. It will add to costs right across the tertiary sector as well as the business sector. On and on it goes.
This is a sell-out of Australia's right to democratically determine its own future. It gives that to the White House under an agreement this parliament has had no input to. It should be rejected. I would expect the Labor Party to reject it and not just leave it to the Greens to argue for this nation's interests for ever and a day about an agreement that locks down and straitjackets the members of this parliament into the future. We will have none of it. We will be opposing it.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2004-08-03,"—I rise to speak this evening on the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004 and the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff) Bill 2004. Free trade is one means of generating the growth necessary for enhancing the living standards of all Australians. In the past, Australia has directly benefited from trade liberalisation. Reducing trade barriers boosts our economic growth, creates a more competitive industry environment, provides benefits to consumers and builds stronger relationships with our trading partners. Labor has always fought strongly to ensure that the benefits of such economic growth are equally shared. The US-Australia free trade agreement promises all of this for Australia. 
The free trade agreement is designed to more closely integrate Australia with the United States, the world's most dynamic and largest economy, by reducing tariffs and improving market access. But it has also raised a number of concerns. Throughout this year, the position of the Australian Labor Party has been that we would judge the government's trade agreement with the United States on the evidence and ask whether it is a net plus or net minus for Australia. Labor members and senators have participated in a number of inquiries into the US-Australia free trade agreement. The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, of which I am a member, conducted an inquiry into the agreement. Our report was tabled during the last session. The report released yesterday contains the recommendations of Labor senators on the Senate Select Committee on the Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States of America. Rather than stalling implementation of the agreement, the committee process has enabled the Senate to thoroughly examine all the facts, hear the arguments from those who stand to lose or stand to gain from the agreement and reach a conclusion as to whether the free trade agreement is in Australia's national interest. 
The Australia-US free trade agreement has generated considerable debate in our community, which is evident both in the number of submissions to the inquiries and in the number of emails, letters and faxes that have been received by members of parliament. It is strongly supported by business and by state and territory governments. But there is also strong opposition to parts of the free trade agreement, and this has been voiced by some unions, community organisations and other interested parties. In particular, the sugar industry was bitterly disappointed at being left out of the deal. Concern has been expressed about the impact on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, local content in future audiovisual mechanisms, intellectual property and possible job losses. These are some of the matters I will be addressing in my remarks today.
Labor has listened to all the concerns of all those persons who have raised issues with the free trade agreement. From the very beginning, Labor's position has been that it will only support this agreement if the agreement can be shown to be in the national interest. This is not a decision it has taken lightly. The two committee inquiries into this free trade agreement have allowed for all the parties—both those for and those against the agreement—to submit their views. On consideration, both inquiries—the Senate select committee and the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties—found that, on balance, it is in the national interest to support this deal. Labor will support the government's free trade agreement legislation through the parliament but only if the government addresses key concerns in some very important areas, including protecting the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and maintaining Australian content in the media.
Labor does not want Australia to pass up the chance to achieve freer trade arrangements with the world's largest and most dynamic economy. But the facts of the matter are that this government has failed to negotiate the best deal possible for Australia and in a couple of areas there are serious flaws. The government no doubt could have achieved a better deal for Australia if it had pushed harder at the negotiating table, especially on behalf of our farmers. The government sold out many important Australian industries that were counting on the Prime Minister and his government to look after their interests. This free trade agreement has been incompetently negotiated. In particular, the government's uneven-handed pursuit of bilateral trade deals has meant a lack of focus on where Australia stands to gain the most. The biggest gains for Australia are in expanding opportunities for our agricultural sector, and the biggest hurdles to this require participation in the World Trade Organisation to negotiate down the levels of export subsidies and other types of agricultural support in parallel with all major subsidisers. The WTO is the only place where this can happen. Labor's policy preference is for multilateral trade liberalisation via the World Trade Organisation. 
This bilateral agreement before us today will increase access to US manufacturing, agricultural, services and government procurement markets, although the gains will be far smaller than the figures that have been bandied around by the government. Bilateral agreements should not be at the cost of Australia's position at the World Trade Organisation. A consultant to the Senate select committee, the expert economist Dr Philippa Dee of the Australian National University, has estimated the benefits to Australia at $53 million a year. Over time, the free trade agreement will allow Australia to establish closer economic relations and integration with the world's largest economy, with increased two-way investment flow. Undoubtedly, this will be of long-term benefit to Australia. 
Throughout the examination and debate surrounding the free trade agreement, Labor has raised a number of concerns about its social impact. Some of these matters have been addressed as more information has become available. The free trade agreement is a living agreement and it will continue to develop over time. Labor senators on the Senate free trade agreement inquiry made a number of recommendations to improve the implementation of this agreement. Drawing on these recommendations, Labor will put forward safeguard amendments to the enabling legislation, here in the Senate, to ensure that the free trade agreement does not undermine the PBS and the existing local content rules. The Senate inquiry into the FTA has put together a package of more than 40 recommendations that should be considered as complementary to the free trade agreement to ensure that Australia's national interest is maximised through this agreement.
The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, of which I am a member, made 23 recommendations in its report. Most of them related to action that could be taken at Australia's initiative or within Australia to ensure that the free trade agreement is a better deal. Labor members of that committee supported the recommendations of chapters 1 to 17, but we opposed taking binding treaty action at the time of the report's writing. In our dissenting report, Labor members stated they:
1. Believe an extension of time should have been sought from the Minister for consideration of the Treaty to allow adequate time to review the evidence presented and to prepare the Report of the Committee.
2. Consider that given the interdependency of the consideration of the Treaty and the legislative, regulatory and administrative measures which must be taken to implement the various terms of the Treaty, it is not possible to determine if it is in the national interest for binding treaty action to be taken, without first considering the terms of such measures as 
	the appeal mechanism to be established with respect to the PBS and the implications for generic medications
	access by universities, educational institutions and libraries to copyright material under the proposed arrangements
	an environmental impact review of the Treaty
	legislative safeguards for local content rules subject to ratchet provisions of the Treaty.
These were the concerns that were outlined by dissenting members of the treaties committee. Following this, of course, we now have the report of the Senate select committee into the free trade agreement. A number of the concerns that we, as dissenting members on the treaties committee, had in relation to the free trade agreement have now been allayed by the Senate select committee's report. It has made more than 40 recommendations to ensure that Australia's national interest is maximised through this treaty. The Senate select committee inquiry found that the overall package is marginally in Australia's national interest. But, as it stands now, the deal puts at risk the PBS and also existing levels of Australian content on Australian media. We believe that, instead of rushing this ahead of an election for political gain, this government should have taken the time to negotiate a better deal for Australia and for Australians. Consequently, as has been foreshadowed here today, Labor will be proposing amendments which we consider are key and must be passed to safeguard Australia's interests. 
Firstly, we consider that it is necessary to protect the PBS by preventing and penalising drug companies that try to stop cheaper generic drugs from coming onto the market by lodging spurious patent claims. Labor has said that it will require all documentation submitted to the independent review mechanism, which will be established to examine unsuccessful drug listing applications on the PBS, to be published on the Internet within 48 hours. The Productivity Commission will be required to monitor and report annually on the impact of the free trade agreement on the PBS, including the impact of the independent review mechanism. If the differential between US and Australian drug prices is seen to be narrowing, then a Labor government will change the independent review mechanism. If the independent review mechanism is used, each acceptance by PBAC and the Minister for Health and Ageing of the recommendations of the independent review will be reported to parliament in a ministerial statement.
The terms of reference of the medicines working group will include a commitment to the principle of universal access to affordable medicines, which currently underpins the PBS. This working group will not consider any policy issues that could be seen to undermine the principle of universal access to affordable medicine. This working group will operate with appropriate transparency in regard to its agenda items, minutes and recommendations. 
Secondly, Labor has said that it will allay concerns about any future reductions in local content for free-to-air television, pay television and radio, through an amendment which will legislate the current local content standards. Of course, currently those content standards are determined by the ABA. Labor has said that it will ensure that Australians continue to see and hear Australian faces and voices through their popular media by ensuring that the free trade agreement provides flexibility to regulate local content on future media. Labor has said it will legislate to ensure the free trade agreement definition of `interactive audio and/or video services' includes, but is not limited to, future media already identified and it will announce a policy package to encourage further investment in Australia's film and television industry before the upcoming election.
Labor will not pass this free trade agreement enabling legislation without the two amendments I have just referred to, namely, the amendments that will protect the PBS and, secondly, those that will protect local content. Labor has also indicated that when it wins government at the next election it will put in place a package of additional measures to address a range of other community concerns that have been raised in relation to the free trade agreement. These include a commitment that prior to entering into any future free trade agreement negotiations a Labor government will table in both houses of parliament a document setting out its priorities and objectives in the negotiation of a free trade agreement. This document will include an assessment of the costs and benefits of any proposals that may be negotiated. The assessment will also consider the economic, regional, social, cultural, regulatory and environmental aspects which are expected to arise under the agreement. Once the negotiation is completed, a Labor government will then table in the parliament the proposed treaty together with any implementing legislation. These two stages that Labor will be putting in place preceding the formal consideration of a treaty will improve the process considerably and make the process more transparent. The process Labor is proposing is in stark contrast to the way that this free trade agreement was negotiated by the government. This free trade agreement was negotiated behind closed doors, with only minimal consultation with stakeholders and the Australian public. 
Thirdly, in relation to copyright and intellectual property laws, a number of concerns have been raised about those aspects of the agreement. Labor has said that it will continue to provide a fair balance between the interests of creators, owners and users under copyright and intellectual property laws. Currently, in the United States there is a much more generous definition of fair use than in Australia, affecting access by libraries and researchers. Under the agreement, Australia has not been required to adopt the United States definition. The United States has a much higher standard of originality for copyright protection than Australia, requiring `creative spark', not just `skill and labour'. The changes made by the free trade agreement therefore are far more restrictive in the Australian legislative context, including a more prescriptive regime in creating limited liability for Internet service providers, allowing the transfer of copyright by contract, and an extension of copyright protection by an additional 20 years.
In Australia, the existing legislation provides for four categories for fair dealing purposes: research or study, criticism or review, reporting of news, and professional advice given by a legal practitioner or patent attorney. The United States legislation provides also for four, but four different, fair use aspects: the purpose of the use, the type of the work, the amount of the work used, and the impact on the market. It is clear that the United States legislation allows for a much broader application than the limited Australian legislation, where it is restricted to specific activities. Labor would address this by establishing a Senate select committee on intellectual property. The role of this committee would be to comprehensively investigate and make recommendations for an appropriate intellectual property regime for Australia in light of the significant changes required to Australian intellectual property law by the agreement.
Implementing the Australia-US free trade agreement without paying attention to how Australian legislation can be altered to maintain a balance between users and owners of copyright would result in significant costs, in particular for educational institutions. Labor would require that the Attorney-General report annually to parliament on changes to the Copyright Act affecting universities, libraries, educational and public research institutions, particularly with regard to any increased costs they may bear.
The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, of which I am a member, in recommendations 17 and 18 provides for the government to replace the Australian doctrine of fair dealing with one that resembles the US open-ended defence of fair use, and also that the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts review the standard of originality applied to copyrighted material with a view to adopting a higher standard such as that in the United States.
In conclusion, Labor have looked at the facts. We have waited until we have all the information at hand to enable us to make a decision in relation to the free trade agreement. The fact is that the government failed to negotiate the best deal possible for Australia, and in a couple of areas there are serious flaws. However, we do not want Australia to pass up the chance to deal with the world's largest and most dynamic economy, the United States of America. Labor will therefore support this legislation, subject to the passage of our amendments in the Senate. ",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-08-03,"—I rise to speak on the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004 and the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff) Bill 2004. I cannot think of any more politically motivated bill that the Senate has had to deal with than the ones that are before us today. The Prime Minister wants to shore up his `man of steel' reputation with the President of the United States, and persuade voters that the free trade agreement is good for us and that the United States alliance depends on it. The ALP has capitulated against all of the evidence that this deal is not a good one for Australia, but it needs to make up for its new leader's gaff in calling President Bush an incompetent. And that, I think, is what this is all about. All Australians will pay for these political motivations.
The ALP are not fooling anyone. They are folding on the FTA because they think that the voters they are chasing are worried that the ALP will mess up our relations with the United States. I think it is as simple as that. I look forward to seeing the ALP's amendments to these bills. Senator O'Brien gave us a summary of what they might look like. They sounded pretty minimal. We will probably support them but we are waiting to see the detail. In fact as I understand it the drafting has not even begun.
This is yet another swindle in this whole sorry affair. We all know that the ALP will not insist on those amendments. It might pacify the Labor Left somewhat. They were willing to be rolled on the 30 per cent copayment increase. So who knows? They may be happy with this small gesture. But we all know that those amendments are not a serious attempt to fix the bills. They are not fixable, and the government will not in any case entertain changes. Publishing decisions on the Internet, Productivity Commission reports annually on the impact—and of course we know there will be one—are all very minor changes to what is a very damaging agreement. The ALP will not insist on their amendments. We know in this place that they rarely do. I think that people can see through that, just as people know that the government did not have the courage to walk away from the table when it became absolutely obvious that the free trade agreement was not about free trade and not about the overall benefits to Australia. I think that Australians have been misled on this issue since day one. The government said that it would walk away unless sugar was in. We all know that sugar is not in. It did not walk away, but we have got an agreement.
—A $40 million package!
—Senator Boswell says that we have got a package. Of course we have got a package. We had to assuage the sugar growers—
—They are very happy with it too.
—They may be very happy with it but it has cost taxpayers a great deal of money in order to make them happy. It has nothing to do with a free trade agreement except that it is another signal that it is a total failure.
The government said that the PBS was not on the table. Again and again I asked the question of Senator Patterson almost 12 months ago: is the PBS part of the free trade agreement negotiations? No, she assured the Senate. Not only was it on the table but it has become the sacrificial lamb. The PBS is what is going to make this so-called free trade agreement a total dud. Now the government says, `Sure, we have agreed to some transparency improvements on the PBS but of course they will not cost anything.' The evidence brought to the committee—indeed, the text if not the recommendations of the committee's report—says otherwise.  
The PBS is a world recognised scheme that provides equitable and affordable access to essential medicines for all Australians, and it is threatened by this legislation. It is a central pillar of our health system. Spending on pharmaceuticals saves us money by improving health and delaying the need for more expensive acute hospital based treatment. Access to pharmaceuticals also improves the quality of life for many Australians. The PBS covered around 161 million prescriptions in 2003. The PBS has been spectacularly successful in controlling the costs of these drugs, so successful in fact that it has been copied by other countries. And this is the rub. We are dealing with this legislation because the United States pharmaceutical companies do not want to see Australia's success repeated elsewhere.
So, despite the success of this system, the government has decided to open up the PBS to attack by the big pharmaceutical companies. These companies will not have keeping the cost of drugs down as their primary interest. They will not have keeping open future options for increasing competition within the pharmaceutical industry as their primary interest. Like any other corporation their interest is maximising profits, and no-one would blame them for doing that. That is a simple fact of life. Why, otherwise, would people in the United States be paying three to four times more for their drugs than Australians do at the moment? Why, otherwise, would Americans be going across the border into Mexico or into Canada to buy drugs that they cannot afford to buy in their own country? Australia's health care system and policy should never have been part of the trade negotiation. In fact that is what the ALP chair says in his report. Health and the products and services that contribute to our health are not something that should be traded away for elusive gains in beef or cotton or dairy. 
The Australian government misled Australians on the FTA and the PBS. They told us that the PBS was not on the table. They are now telling us that the prices of drugs on the PBS will not increase as a result of the FTA and that any changes are purely cosmetic. If that is the case, then why bother? Why did Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and Medicines Australia lobby for these provisions within the FTA? If there is to be no real impact, why can we not remove any reference to the pharmaceuticals from the agreement? Labor's report has clearly outlined the myriad ways in which the FTA can and will impact on the PBS and the costs of medicines in this country. The report identifies point by point four major problems with the agreement as it relates to the PBS. These concerns were raised by consumer groups, professional bodies, industry groups and academics. The Doctors Reform Society said today:
The ALP's acquiescence to the Howard government's capitulation to the power of the already hugely profitable US drug industry will see the cost of the PBS rise unnecessarily over the next few years. Our government's response will be to increase copayments to patients. More of our patients will simply not be able to afford the life-saving drug treatments that are available, and some will die.
Labor is clearly aware of all of the problems and all of the risks contained within this FTA and acknowledges in the report that the agreement could have `unforeseen and unintended consequences down the track'. The FTA is in a sense a living agreement. Further work will take place in forums such as the working group set up under it. Many of the details of what it means and how it will be implemented will be sorted out later—trust us—possibly with the help of the dispute resolution mechanism. We cannot predict the actions of the United States or the dispute resolution mechanism into the future. The chair's report says: 
The PBS's capacity to contain drug prices affects all Australians and should not be traded off for the potential economic gains in certain areas of the economy.
However, Labor is prepared to trade away the health of Australians and it limply says that it is `most unfortunate that the Australian government has allowed provisions affecting the PBS to be included in the trade agreement'.
Most unfortunate? Why don't we simply say that we are going to stop this? It is not only unfortunate; it is unwise. While it is true that the free trade agreement does not directly undermine the PBS, it still requires subtle and not so subtle modifications to the PBS which place at risk the effectiveness of the PBS in containing the costs of drugs. The Democrats accept that drug prices will not automatically rise, but there is ample evidence that this is highly probable. It would therefore be irresponsible to support the agreement and just hope for the best. The FTA will link Australia's health policy to the nation with arguably the most inefficient and inequitable health and pharmaceutical system in the developed world and one which has the highest health care and pharmaceutical costs in the developed world. It will give the US, and the US pharmaceutical companies in particular, a greater role in determining the shape and the cost of Australia's pharmaceuticals scheme.
There are many concerns in this agreement. Firstly, the FTA principles are about protecting the rights of the pharmaceutical companies. They do not take into account the principles of the rights of the consumer to equitable access to affordable drugs. The third principle contained in annex 2-C—the section on the FTA that explicitly relates to pharmaceuticals—emphasises the value of innovative pharmaceuticals, while the fourth is concerned with the importance of research and development. These principles will be used to guide changes to the PBS. However, annex 2-C contains no corresponding commitment to the importance and value of protecting public health and protecting universal and affordable access to necessary medicines. The rights of the pharmaceutical companies are explicitly documented, yet the rights of the Australian public are not—they are missing. Our PBS and national medicines policy are both founded on the rights of equitable and affordable access to necessary drugs, and yet these do not get a mention in the agreement.
When disagreements arise in relation to the FTA and the pharmaceuticals policy—and arise they will—a three-member panel appointed to adjudicate will use the principles set out in annex 2-C to interpret the agreement and to resolve disputes. These principles, which emphasise innovation and research and development, will be used to decide whether Australia is meeting its obligation in relation to the FTA. Therefore, whenever these are in dispute, under the terms of this agreement the rights of drug companies will be favoured over the rights of Australians to access drugs. The report of Labor's chair says:
... it would seem that the principles set out in Annex 2-C do indeed reflect the agenda of the US pharmaceutical lobby. 
The report also states:
... it must note with some concern the possibility that this part of the agreement could have unintended consequences should a dispute ever arise.
Secondly, the pharmaceutical industry has made much of the need for greater transparency within the PBS process. It has been on about that for a long time. However, in this agreement there would seem to be a substantial imbalance in the provision regarding transparency within the FTA. Under the provisions of the agreement, pharmaceutical companies will be able to request a review of negative decisions to list their product. The Australian negotiators say that this is not an appeals process and will not be able to overturn decisions. But, of course, this begs the question: if this process does not have any influence on the decisions, then why bother to have the process? At the very least, it will introduce another layer of complexity into a listing process and will incur administration costs for the PBS, all in the name of satisfying the demands of the US pharmaceutical industry. At the very least, it provides yet another opportunity to put pressure on the PBAC to reward innovation and research and development. Rather than continuing to make decisions on the public's interest, the PBAC will face yet more pressure to give in to industry demands. A decision not to list a drug already places the committee under pressure from a range of interests, such as consumer groups, medical specialists and the media, and yet more processes can only fast-track the way to higher drug prices.
The pharmaceutical industry's call for greater transparency only goes so far. When it comes to greater transparency regarding the results of clinical trials on a particular drug, the drug companies are very reluctant for this to be publicly released. As many commentators have noted, the commercial-in-confidence rights of pharmaceutical companies are guaranteed within the FTA, yet the public are denied access to drug company data despite evidence that drug companies withhold information that could impact on decisions about the use of drugs. In the United States, Pfizer, the world's largest drug maker, pleaded guilty on 13 May this year to numerous civil and criminal charges for illegally promoting the off-label use of gabapentin, or Neurontin. Evidence provided in this case detailed how the company suppressed study results and promoted the use of this drug for at least 11 off-label uses—that is, uses for which it was not approved. I ask: are the pharmaceutical companies happy for this kind of transparency to be applied to them? The answer is obviously no.
In addition to the review process, the agreement sets up a special medicines working group which will contain health officials from the US as well as from Australia. Unfortunately, there is no role for consumers or public health organisations in this group, and we have no information on what the terms of reference for the group are or what processes they will use to meet the terms of reference. It is essentially a closed shop which allows another country to play a role in the design and implementation of Australia's medicines policy. Again, there is no evidence for this increased transparency that the industry is so keen on.
The Labor report says that it is unacceptable that the government has provided them with so little information on the workings of this group and that they are being asked to take on trust that the government will be able to look after the best interests of Australian consumers in the face of intense pressure from our most powerful trading partner—and pressure there will definitely be. There will not be a lot of trust, I imagine, when things start to go pear shaped, however. Deputy US Trade Representative Josette Sheeran Shiner recently declared in testimony to the US Senate Finance Committee that this group will: 
... provide a forum for ongoing dialogue on Australia's system of comparing generics to innovative medicines and other emerging health care policy issues.
Senator Kyl told the US Senate:
During our meetings in Australia we suggested such a working group as a way to guarantee that, if our pricing concerns could not be resolved in the FTA, we could continue to discuss the issue. The subject matters that the group might consider are not limited by the agreement, and therefore can be expected to include the importance of market-based pricing.
So it is quite obvious that United States officials believe that this special working group will influence Australian pharmaceutical policy.
Thirdly, the FTA also contains proposals to put drug advertising on the Internet. This will facilitate direct to consumer advertising, known as DTCA, which is currently banned in Australia. Of course the aim of direct to consumer advertising is obviously to increase consumer demand, which it does very well. DTCA is frequently aimed at increasing the use of more expensive, but not necessarily therapeutically superior, brand name medicines. Already drug companies are getting around the restriction on advertising of medicines in Australia by producing infomercials about obesity, impotence et cetera that direct you to your doctor, and are using current affairs and lifestyle programs. Why should we be handing them a free pass? DTCA is legal in the United States but it is not here in Australia. It has led to a substantial increase in patient demand for, and use of, products that are often at odds with best clinical practice. Relaxation of advertising restrictions in the US resulted in a 41.7 per cent increase in sales of heavily promoted medicines compared with 14.4 per cent increases for other medicines. The other consequence of this advertising is the use of pharmaceutical approaches in the treatment of illness rather than the use of more appropriate lifestyle change and other therapies for conditions such as obesity.
Finally, the FTA increases barriers to generic drugs entering the market. The generic versions of drugs play a vital role in keeping drug prices down—and therefore the costs of the PBS down—through providing greater competition. Research at the Australia Institute estimates that, if changes such as those that will result from the FTA succeed in delaying by 24 months market entry of generic versions of just the top five PBS expenditure drugs due to come off patent, this could increase the cost of the PBS by $1.5 billion between 2006 and 2009. I remind the Senate that the stated gains to be made by the free trade agreement overall are $53 million. So we are prepared to give up $1.5 billion in this very small aspect of the PBS part of this legislation for a return of $53 million for farmers. The inquiry summary of the Senate Select Committee on the Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States of America goes into great detail regarding the FTA provisions relating to generic drugs and concludes:
The new notification requirement may dissuade generic manufacturers from taking a risk in bringing generics to market before the patent claim is settled. This would be to the detriment of the PBS, which benefits from accessing cheaper generic drugs before litigation is settled.
Yet they are still prepared to pass this legislation.
There are many downsides with this FTA. The impact on the PBS is one. The FTA will open up the PBS to more pressure from pharmaceutical companies, less generic competition and more promotion of pharmaceutical use. All of these will ultimately result in higher drug prices. Will we see the copayment increased to pay for this? That remains to be seen. The government and Labor know of these problems and yet they have decided to trade our pharmaceutical scheme for the possibility of unlikely economic gains in some areas. The PBS will become just another example of collateral damage. The health of Australians is the real loser from the free trade agreement. ",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2004-08-03,"—That was certainly a Jeremiah type speech—a prophecy of doom. The Nationals are quite excited about the prospect of our being a major trading nation. We believe this is an absolutely historic achievement—a free trade agreement with the largest economy in the world, getting us into a $300 million market. It is an agreement under which, for example, from day one agriculture tariffs in the US go from 66 per cent to zero. Specifically, in horticulture 99 per cent of current fresh produce exports will immediately be tariff free, up from the two per cent that applies now.
There will also be greater access for two of Australia's key agricultural exports, beef and dairy, including immediate elimination of in-quota tariffs. Importantly, all single-desk arrangements for export marketing of Australian commodities are preserved. For sugar, rice, wheat and barley the single desk remains, and our quarantine and food safety regimes are preserved. The benefit to Australia is estimated to boost the Australian economy by over $6 billion a year a decade after coming into force, with more than 30,000 extra jobs created. You can see why The Nationals are excited at these prospects.
In the words of my Queensland Labor Premier, Peter Beattie, `The free trade agreement is our best once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get jobs for Queensland—the best opportunity we've have for more than 100 years to expand into new markets.' His research shows improved export values for Queensland across beef, peanuts, sheepmeat and some horticultural products; improved demand for manufactured goods and light metals; and new market access for a range of sectors to supply the multibillion-dollar US government procurement market. Victorian Labor Premier Steve Bracks said: `We believe it is in Victoria's and Australia's interests to link ourselves with the biggest and most dynamic economy. We welcome the passage of the FTA through the US Congress and await its ratification in Australia.' Those two Labor premiers can see the obvious benefits of growth and jobs for a nation of 20 million people entering a free trade agreement with a market of 280 million people—unlike their federal leader, Mark Latham, who could not see the ladder of opportunity for all Australians at all and even today is making his approval conditional.
The trade agreement is broad ranging. It eliminates virtually all tariffs on Australian industrial products and it opens large markets for our efficient Australian exporters. To start with agriculture, despite the varying final outcomes all industries—including sugar, which unfortunately was not included in the agreement—praise the Australian government's efforts on their behalf. I take this opportunity to congratulate Mark Vaile for pulling this together and getting an achievement. Cane growers who were there for the negotiations said: `At no stage did we adopt a dog-in-the-manger, “if not sugar then no-one”, approach to the negotiations. We accept that, on balance, the FTA will deliver economic benefits to the nation. As a major foreign income-earning industry exposed to all sorts of distortions of the world market, we believe we are entitled to participate in those gains one way or another.' The government has understood their plight, with a $444 million reform package. Recently they have welcomed the EU announcement of a proposed radical overhaul of the sheltered EU sugar regime. 
In their submission to the Senate committee's inquiry, the Cattle Council of Australia said of their participation in Washington:
It is this insight which allows CCA to state that in its opinion, the Australian Trade Minister and the Australian negotiating team worked tirelessly to achieve the best outcome they could for Australian beef producers.
CCA take exception to anyone who would criticise their efforts during the FTA negotiations. It is interesting to note that not one of the groups criticising the FTA was present in Washington during the final round of negotiations. Therefore their comments are not based on first-hand experience, unlike such groups as the Cattle Council of Australia. While CCA remain frustrated with the outcomes of the FTA, this is entirely targeted at the US and its inability to free itself from its protectionist shackles. 
With beef, the agreement provides greater access. Our present quota of 379,214 tonnes becomes immediately free of the present 4.4c per kilogram tariff, increasing returns of around $20 million. There is access for an additional 20,000 tonnes in year 3 at the latest, which will increase to 70,000 tonnes in year 18, should we sign on to the free trade agreement. The out of quota tariff will be phased down from years 9 to 18, with an 18.5 per cent increase in quota volume over 18 years. At current prices that is valued at $245 million in the final year. Seeing that we have reached our quota only once or twice, that is a big opening for the cattle industry.
The dairy industry has also applauded the gains. In the Queensland Country Life on 22 July, Queensland Dairyfarmers Organisation President Wes Judd said:
The current US FTA can provide significant, ongoing benefits to dairy producers, manufacturers and distributors across the country.
These stem from the FTA's inclusion of significant, ongoing expansions in dairy quota access for a wide range of dairy products and accompanying duty savings and investment opportunities.
And it will help sustain Australian industry growth and income in coming years. For dairy, there is an immediate increase in annual quotas with ongoing growth at the average yearly rate of five per cent, which should amount to an extra $41 million in additional exports in year 1. I have heard it said that it is worth about $4,000 to every dairy farmer. 
Previously excluded products will gain access, such as certain cheeses, butter, milk, cream and ice-cream products. For example, that equates to 7.5 million litres of milk, cream and ice-cream, 2,000 tonnes of European type cheese and 4,000 tonnes of whole milk powder. The Australian Dairy Industry Council urge all members of parliament to support the FTA, citing the industry's export success as being $2.5 billion last year and predicting a growth of $50 million to $60 million in the first year of the US free trade agreement. They also see it as having a social benefit in creating skilled and semiskilled jobs in the regions and elsewhere across Australia. The Murray Goulburn Cooperative, a large exporter, agree with these figures and urge ratification of the agreement because, on a cost-benefit ratio, they rate it as a big step forward for the Australian dairy industry in a market that has been one of the world's most protected.
Fishing and horticulture are pleased with their gains. In fact, the fishing industry think they have won the lottery. The fishing industry will immediately benefit from the elimination of 48 separate tariffs, ranging up to 35 per cent. That is estimated to be an extra $20 million to $30 million in exports in the first year. For example, tuna boat owners in South Australia are pleased that they will see the immediate reduction of the 35 per cent tariff on Australian tuna and the removal of preferential treatment for competitors, which will deliver a level playing field into the US. 
Over 99 per cent of horticultural fresh produce exports valued currently at $71.1 million will become tariff free immediately. While pricing safeguards are there for 33 horticultural products, this only represents 2.8 per cent of all horticultural products, for many of which Australia is not a major exporter. Safeguards will only apply once the tariff reaches zero and, even if they are applied, they will be below the duty paid by our competitors who do not enjoy preferential tariff treatment.
New quotas will apply to tobacco, cotton and peanuts, increasing by three per cent per year. Avocados will receive two seasonal quotas from year 2 of 1,500 tonnes from February to mid-September and a further duty-free 2½ thousand tonnes between mid-September and the end of January. The outside quota will be eliminated over 18 years. This negotiated single tariff rate quota is seen as a huge positive for the avocado industry.
The retention of the single desk has worried every farmer who grows wheat, sugar, barley and rice. We have retained the single desk for all industries, which is what the industries wanted. The US wanted the abolition of the single desk along with extensive changes to our PBS. They did not get them—just as we also kept local content rules for Australian television.
The agricultural sector seems assured that there are no concerns with quarantine. Horticulture Australia's submission to the Senate committee said there is no alteration within the FTA to arrangements covering the negotiation of quarantine market access and that determinations will continue to be made strictly on the basis of science alone. On the two committees—the Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Matters and the Standing Working Group on Animal and Plant Health—they state: 
There appears to be nothing in this SPS chapter as likely to be of concern to horticulture. To the contrary, improved facilitation of quarantine market access processes will be welcomed by the industry.
The National Farmers Federation believe that the FTA meets the objectives of ensuring Australia's scientific based quarantine system is not undermined by the FTA negotiations. They have no concern with the formation of the two committees, seeing them as developing and formalising closer working relations on SPS related market access issues and saying that `US representation on these committees has no power to undermine Australia's scientific based system or import risk assessment process in particular'.
During the Senate committee hearings there have been concerns expressed, most particularly about our world-leading PBS system and innovative generic drugs industry and patents, local content in the arts, copyright, foreign investment and the overall benefit to our national interests through various modellings. The government and the negotiators have assured us, the members of the committee, that neither our PBS system nor our generic drug industry is under any threat from the free trade agreement. The government has already announced the independent review mechanism for applications to list drugs under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which was our commitment under the FTA. It has been developed in consultation with the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. The price of pharmaceuticals will not rise as a result and the PBAC will remain the gatekeeper of the PBS under the review process. Unsuccessful applicants will be able to specify the ground for review. An independent expert reviewer will be appointed and will make comments back to the PBAC, and at all stages information will be made publicly available to explain and justify the recommendations made. 
The Australian Medical Association has welcomed the components of the review process and the government assurance that it will not allow the PBS to be threatened by this agreement. The government and the committee have listened to this community concern. The government is confident that the commitment it has made will have no adverse impact on the sustainability of the PBS. The independent review mechanism, together with other transparency measures agreed under the free trade agreement, will deliver improvements in the transparency of the PBS which will be of benefit to the pharmaceutical industry, prescribers, consumers and taxpayers.
The Senate committee has been assured by the chief negotiator that the prices of pharmaceuticals will not increase as a result of the FTA and that those prices will not come under institutionalised pressure from the US government on behalf of the US pharmaceutical lobby. The commitment is to recognise `the value of innovative pharmaceuticals' in the PBS listing and pricing system. Also, the PBAC will remain the sole authority recommending to the Australian government which drugs will be listed. The medicines working group is simply an arena for discussion and has no operative or decision making power. Negotiators also reassured the committee that generic drugs will not be affected or delayed in their introduction, with no threat from patent evergreening. Like all Australians, I was concerned that our PBS system should not be threatened in any way by the FTA. That was given a lot of attention by our committee, which has been assured that the PBS will not be adversely affected by the FTA. In response to the opposition's proposed amendments on the PBS for their political convenience, Minister Abbott told the House today that `no drug can be listed on the PBS without a recommendation from the PBAC'. As the Prime Minister said in relation to these amendments, it is not necessary.
Like the dairy, beef, horticultural and fishing industries and many others, I see this FTA with the US to be a giant next step for our future growth and development through our entry into the largest market in the developed world. Labor has made much of the threat of the FTA to our multilateral trade commitments. This agreement in no way diminishes Australia' s commitment to agricultural trade reform. In fact, the World Trade Organisation continues to be Australia's highest trade priority through Australia's leadership of the influential Cairns Group. In the World Trade Organisation we continue to push for reform for our distorted global agricultural markets and for better access for all our farm products. The proof that the World Trade Organisation negotiations have not been affected lies in the agreement to a framework for a new world trade agreement, reached in Geneva over the weekend. Since this FTA commenced we have signed free trade agreements with Thailand and Singapore. Similar agreements with China and Malaysia are in discussion. Meanwhile, the FTA with the United States is a giant leap forward in opening up trade opportunities with a market approaching 300 million customers—and that is a big market for an ex-salesman like myself—and with the most advanced economy in the world. Many industries, all democratically elected state and territory governments and many Australians have instructed the Senate committee, in their submissions, to ratify the agreement. The United States Congress have now met their legislative requirements and ratified it from their side. These bills being debated today will allow the agreement to be implemented. They are the final step in attaining the Australia-United States free trade agreement. I have the pleasure—and I consider it an honour—to support these bills on this historic event on this historic occasion. ",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2004-08-03,"—I rise to speak on the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004 and the related bill. It seems clear, from the analysis of the Senate committee and much of the analysis that has been done over the last months, that this government has not negotiated the best deal possible for Australia in this free trade agreement. Many have said this government has been outnegotiated, and I concur with that view. Perhaps that is because the government's primary focus through these negotiations has been not so much on the national interest as on ensuring its own electoral advantage as a result of the free trade agreement. Its focus has been on its political life and on getting re-elected, and insufficiently on Australia's national interest. In that process some key deficiencies in the agreement exist for Australia, which I will return to later.
The political gamesmanship of this government over the last few weeks and months has been demonstrable and patent. There have been many occasions in the past where Australia's trade position has had bipartisan support. In a recognition that our interests are often best served by speaking with one voice there has been bipartisan support for liberalisation, for example, of trade in agriculture. As US trade representative Robert Zoellick told Congress, he wanted to make sure that the free trade agreement with Australia had bipartisan support. That was certainly his intention. That was certainly not the intention of this government. This government has played this debate in an attempt to gain electoral advantage. It has not sought genuinely to achieve bipartisan support and has resorted to quite a lot of cheap political point scoring in recent weeks. It has taken a partisan approach. It has held back key aspects of the detail of the agreement from the Senate committee and from the public—in particular the details of the review under the PBS, which is part of the free trade agreement. That was an essential part of the information needed for both Labor and the public to inform their positions.
The government has regularly been critical of Labor for requiring the scrutiny of this agreement by the Senate Select Committee on the Free Trade Agreement and has attacked us over the delay, it says, that that scrutiny has occasioned. These are actions of a government that is not interested in obtaining bipartisan support for an agreement; these are actions of a government interested in making a political point. The government has regularly berated the Labor Party and sought to use our consideration of this agreement as an element in its strategy to paint the Labor Party as being anti-American. As our leader, Mark Latham, said quite succinctly: Labor is not anti-American; we are pro-Australian. We opposed the war in Iraq—and in hindsight we were right to do so because it was clearly a decision based on a lie. In relation to the free trade agreement Labor has sought to discern the national interest and to make an assessment as to whether this agreement is of net benefit to Australia and whether the concerns raised by some groups about the agreement could be allayed or not. 
It is important to note that, unlike some of the minor parties in this chamber, Labor has not taken a position of absolute and jingoistic protectionism over the last 30 years. This is the hallmark of some parties—and that is their right—but we say that they are wrong. It is undeniable that the liberalisation of trade has assisted some developing economies to dramatically improve the incomes of their peoples. It is also undeniable that many Australians in export focused industries have benefited from trade liberalisation. China and India, where there are substantial numbers of the world's poor, have been able to lift many of the poor out of poverty—in large part due to their capacity to sell their products on world markets. As Oxfam say—and they are not noted for their extreme right wing views: 
Trade can be a powerful engine for poverty reduction.
It is also the case that many of the world's trade rules have largely benefited certain developed economies which spend far more on protecting themselves from poorer countries than they give in aid.
Labor's view is that there are benefits to be gained for Australians from trade liberalisation. I am also of the view that we can make trade work to benefit the poorer countries as well as Australia. Happily, our interests coincide in many areas, particularly in the area of the liberalisation of trade in agricultural products. Labor has consistently, over the last decades, pushed for gains through multilateral processes, not simply through bilateral processes. However, it is also the case that trade liberalisation is not some sort of magic bullet. It must always be accompanied by a transformation of the economy. There are Australian workers who are patently and potentially vulnerable to the vagaries of world markets. We cannot compete in low-skill, low-wage jobs. We must always have active industry development policies—policies that seek to create jobs for the future, that seek to enable diversification of our export base and that seek to assist people in reskilling and developing skills which will enable them to perform the jobs of the future.
Unlike the Howard government, which seems to have a hands-off industry policy, Labor governments have always sought to implement industry development policies with the recognition that trade liberalisation must be accompanied by economic transformation. And in some areas we were very successful. Look at elaborately transformed manufactures over the period of the Labor governments, let us say between 1988 and 1996. ETMs, as a share of our total merchandise exports in 1988, were 13.6 per cent. After eight years of Labor government that share had climbed to 23.7 per cent. That is a significant achievement because it demonstrates an ability to produce products which are valued added, which require a reasonable amount of labour input and which can command reasonable prices on the world markets. Unfortunately, the substantial increase in that measure of improvement under Labor governments has not been shared by the Howard government. We have seen the share of ETMs as a proportion of total merchandise exports fall under the Howard government. In fact, if the share of ETMs was now the same as in 1996 when Labor lost government, there would be almost $2 billion more in ETM exports. That is a substantial criticism of the Howard government.
Labor has also announced, consistent with this view, a new agenda for Australian manufacturing. I am sure Senator George Campbell, who is in the chamber, can tell the Senate more about this than I. We have announced a centre of excellence for advanced manufacturing, an Australian manufacturing council and a 10-year national manufacturing strategy to revitalise manufacturing. These are aspects of a view about trade that recognises that trade liberalisation can have negative consequences for certain workers and that governments have to intervene and develop industries to ensure that impact is minimised and that the benefits of liberalisation can be shared—that we can have productivity with a purpose and not simply leave people by the wayside.  
In contrast, what we see from this government is a hands-off industry policy—except, of course, when it comes to certain agricultural sectors where some National Party constituencies need to be bought off. This is a government that makes it harder rather than easier for people to reskill and upgrade their skills and that makes it more expensive for people to take on higher education. It is a government that has failed to engage in any real industry development across a range of manufacturing areas.
I return now to the free trade agreement. It is disappointing, particularly in the area of agricultural products, that there are some clear areas where Australia did not receive benefits. There are extended phasing-out periods for tariffs, the continuation of quotas in some areas and some let-out clauses which may in fact allow for the reimposition of tariffs in some areas. Notoriously, sugar has not been included in this agreement despite its non-inclusion being described as un-Australian by the Deputy Prime Minister—perhaps more evidence of the demise of the political power of the National Party.
However, there are some net benefits to the agreement. They have been wildly overstated by this government. As Ross Garnaut said, the economic modelling on which this government relied for its overblown claims regarding the benefits of the agreement failed the laugh test. Perhaps a far more accurate analysis is that done for the Senate committee by Dr Philippa Dee, which concluded that the agreement would be of some net benefit to Australia—but a substantially lower benefit than that trumpeted by the Howard government.
Labor's position, which we announced today, is that there are net economic benefits to Australia and on balance this agreement should be supported. But there are reasonable concerns which have been raised by the community, particularly before the Senate select committee, over some of the social impacts of the agreement, and we share many of these concerns. If you look closely at the announcement that Mark Latham and Senator Conroy made earlier today, you will see that Labor have taken an approach which seeks to safeguard against many of the concerns which have been raised by community groups regarding the social impacts of the agreement.
There are two primary ways in which we are seeking to do that. The first is by moving specific amendments in the Senate on two issues. The first amendment relates to the PBS and ensuring that there is protection against bodgie patent claims by drug companies—patents lodged in order to try to prevent cheaper generic drugs coming onto the market. The second amendment we will be moving will ensure that current local content standards are legislated into an act of parliament, which they are currently not. In addition to these legislative safeguards, we have announced a range of measures that, if elected, a Labor government would put in place to ensure that the implementation of this agreement did not have any unintended social consequences.
This is a test for the government in relation to our amendments. If, as the government says, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is not undermined by this agreement then the government has nothing to lose by supporting Labor's amendments. Similarly, if local content rules are not under threat then the government ought to support Labor's amendments. If it is the case, as Senator Boswell said when he preceded me, that there is no threat of evergreening of patent claims, which would of course have cost consequences for the PBS, then surely the government would support our amendments that ensure that evergreening—in terms of baseless patent claims being used to prevent generic drugs coming onto the market—does not occur. If the government opposes the amendment then I say the Australian public should be rightly suspicious of the position taken by the government and rightly suspicious of the government's claims that the PBS and local content are not under threat. 
Finally, I want to speak briefly to the minor parties—who, I understand, have a different view on the agreement from that taken by the Labor Party today. You have trumpeted your concerns regarding a number of issues, particularly the integrity of the PBS and the maintenance of local content. Given that, Labor look forward to your support for our amendments—because we are seeking to protect precisely those things about which you have stated concerns.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2004-08-03,"—I rise to speak on the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004 and the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff) Bill 2004. The Democrats oppose the implementation of the free trade agreement. I want to focus in particular on two portfolio areas in which I have an interest, those being welfare and information technology. I would like to start off by talking about welfare. In doing so, I wonder whether the government or the opposition have examined or paid any attention to the deal of criticism they have received from interested parties, particularly those in the welfare sector, regarding the decision not to seek exemption from the government procurement provisions of the FTA for essential services—including health, welfare and education.
There is no doubt that the Australia-US free trade agreement could have some significant impacts on community services such as child protection; youth services; the jobs network; telephone counselling services, such as Lifeline; emergency financial aid; aged care in all its forms, such as residential care, nursing homes and home and community care; child care; services for people with disability; accommodation services for people with special needs, such as people with mental illness; community housing; tenants services; services for homeless people; drop-in centres; family and relationship counselling; mediation; credit line; counselling for people with addictions, such as alcohol or gambling; Meals on Wheels; play groups and other support services for parents; services for recent migrants, refugees and asylum seekers; prison welfare services; services for victims of family violence; and so on.
Community services often help redress or prevent marginalisation and disadvantage. They are crucial to human wellbeing and a healthy community. The commercial sector is increasingly becoming involved in community services. Obvious examples are the jobs network, aged care and child care. Since the free trade agreement with the United States is a negative-list agreement, any area of policy that is not explicitly excluded is covered by the agreement. This means that community services provided by the commercial—that is, for-profit—sector and the community or not-for-profit sector are covered, as are any services provided by government in competition with commercial providers.
The chapters of the FTA which are likely to affect community services include the chapters on cross-border trade in services, government procurement, transparency and investment. We know that representatives of the welfare sector have been involved in some of the meetings between DFAT and the Australian Fair Trade and Investment Network, and they have raised the matter of community services in more than one discussion with them. DFAT officials seem to say that community services were not really the target of free trade negotiations on services which were more concerned with matters such as financial, legal, engineering and other mainstream services in the commercial sector. Despite this, we know that community services will be covered by this agreement. The documentation on the free trade agreement does not include any regulatory impact statement regarding community services, although it is an area where there is substantial government regulation and government procurement of services on behalf of service users. There can be no doubt that the terms of the agreement, in particular the chapters on cross-border trade in services and government procurement, have the potential to significantly limit the ability of government to regulate this area unless it is listed as an exception. 
The costs will be borne by the users of community services, community organisations and the government. Any such changes deserve careful consideration—certainly more than either the government or Labor has been prepared to give—not just incidental coverage in an agreement not tailored to these sorts of services. Any diminution of the ability of government to regulate community services would have implications for the quality of services available to service users and for the costs incurred by both the government and those users. It is doubtful that international free trade in community services is the best way forward for the sector. The normal business practice of investing for short periods in a particular business and then moving to other investments is inappropriate in many community services where people need a stable and secure situation, such as long-term accommodation. It is with some trepidation that the welfare and community sector is obliged to face the Australia-US FTA, and it is true that very few agencies in the community sector have commented on this matter. This is likely to be because the community sector, by its very nature, has never before needed to have knowledge of international trade law and because the government has failed to analyse the implications and consult with that sector regarding the changes. The relative silence of the sector comes not from accordance or acceptance but rather from the difficulty of finding the time and resources to consider the impact. It is quite appalling that Labor, in its haste to sign the agreement, equally failed to give consideration or consultation to that sector. One could cynically argue that, once the terms of the free trade agreement with the United States become available, any concerns from the welfare and community sector would be effectively moot. The substance of the agreement has been negotiated, and Labor is now demonstrating undue haste to secure its ratification.
In the nervous scurrying to conclude the agreement, many key stakeholders were not consulted. This is an agreement that, at various moments, can deprive the Australian government of the ability to enforce policy decisions that will impact on trade. The decision to abandon Australia's sovereignty should have been the subject of wider community debate and deliberation. Given the deal's likely impact on the community, the lack of opportunity to have input into the negotiations is of great concern. Despite Canberra's rhetoric that this means more jobs and freer markets, sectors of the community have expressed understandable unease about the impact of further economic liberalisation. For a particular group of Australians—that is, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities—there remains significant scepticism that any benefits will flow to them, despite some exceptions under the agreement. In particular, there is concern relating to government contracts for the health and welfare of Indigenous people and to measures for their economic and social advancement. The other concern is about an exemption that allows for: 
... the right to adopt or maintain any measure with respect to investment that accords preferences to any indigenous person or organisation or provides for the favourable treatment of any indigenous person or organisation.
These exemptions relate to goods and services; critically, they do not ensure the protection of cultural, intellectual property and other rights.
Another issue that is cause for concern is the ability for US companies to challenge prices under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and to potentially force up the price of medicines. This will have an impact on all Australians, but Indigenous people, with their plethora of health problems, will feel it acutely.
The decreased capacity to impose future local content restrictions is also a negative outcome for Australian culture in general and for Indigenous culture in particular. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities have rightly expressed concerns about the impact of free trade agreements, and this has been at least in part because of the experiences of indigenous people in North America, Mexico, the US and Canada. These countries each have significant indigenous populations, and their experiences under the North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, provide some insight. As a poorer socioeconomic group, indigenous people are vulnerable—often more vulnerable than others—to economic shifts. The creation of low-waged employment in Mexico has been heralded as one of the great achievements of NAFTA, but this is hardly a situation Indigenous communities want replicated in Australia, particularly given the prevalence of Work for the Dole schemes over real employment opportunities in Aboriginal communities.
Disadvantaged Australians had no public process to review or recommend amendments to the draft text of the Australia-US FTA. Even this parliament could not stop the agreement being signed by our Prime Minister. The sole course of action available to the parliament in support of the welfare and community sector was to block at the domestic level the enabling legislation required to implement the agreement after it was signed. Today that option has been taken away by Labor's capitulation and failure to give the agreement full consideration. We Democrats urge the government and Labor to consider our proposal that community services, no matter who provides them, must be excluded from the Australia-United States free trade agreement and from all other free trade agreements.
I would like to turn briefly to the issue of intellectual property provisions under the FTA and their impact on the open source, open format sector in Australia. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has described the intellectual property outcomes of the FTA as harmonising Australia's intellectual property laws more closely with the largest intellectual property market in the world. Given the amount of power wielded by US corporations in the field of copyright and patent protection, this prospect gives rise to some real concerns. We Democrats have already warned against allowing the free trade agreement to go down the American route of giving extraordinary power and privilege to giant software companies which can then be used to stifle competition.
Aspects of the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act, DMCA for short, have seen the major software companies in that country frustrate and block smaller companies and IT research teams by using the law to threaten and financially exhaust any competition. The prospect under this FTA of software patents, rigorously enforced anticircumvention provisions and increased liability for Internet service providers are a matter of considerable concern to the Democrats. We strongly support the development and use of open source software and a diverse and competitive IT environment in Australia. We must retain our sovereignty in this area and resist any efforts to sell out Australia's successful proliferation of small and medium sized companies to US multinational giants—while stepping on civil liberties in the process. 
The Electronic Frontier Foundation has investigated the operation of the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act and the impact it has had on the independent software industry in the United States. This investigation found that since enacted in 1998 the anticircumvention provisions of the DMCA, codified in section 1201 of the Copyright Act, have not been used as congress envisioned. The US Congress meant to stop copyright pirates from defeating antipiracy protections added to copyrighted works and to ban `black box' devices intended for that purpose. In practice, the anticircumvention provisions have been used to stifle a wide array of legitimate activities rather than to stop copyright piracy.
As a result, the DMCA has developed into a serious threat to several important public policy priorities. Firstly, experience with section 1201 demonstrates that it is being used to stifle free speech and scientific research. Lawsuits against a magazine, a research team and prosecution of Russian programmer Dmitry Skylarov have stifled the legitimate activities of journalists, publishers, scientists, students, programmers and members of the public. The Skylarov case involved a Russian programmer who had designed a program that allowed Adobe's protected eBook format to be transformed into the unprotected and more common portable document format, or PDF. The software he designed would only work on eBooks that had been legitimately purchased. The purpose of the software was to assist blind people to access eBooks and to allow eBooks to be moved from one computer to another. On a trip to the US to speak at a conference, the programmer was arrested.
Secondly, by banning all acts of circumvention and all technologies and tools that can be used for circumvention, section 1201 grants to copyright owners the power to unilaterally eliminate the public's `fair use' rights. Already the music industry has begun deploying copy-protected CDs that promise to curtail consumers' ability to make legitimate, personal copies of music they have purchased. In Australia we do not even have the `fair use' rights that exist in the US.
The DMCA also impedes competition and innovation. Rather than focusing on pirates, many copyright owners have wielded the DMCA to hinder their legitimate competitors. For example, Sony has invoked section 1201 to protect its monopoly on Playstation video game consoles as well as its regionalisation system, limiting users in one country from playing games legitimately purchased in another. Further, section 1201 has been misused as a new general-purpose prohibition on computer network access which, unlike the several federal antihacking statutes that already protect computer network owners from unauthorized intrusions, lacks any financial harm threshold. A situation where a disgruntled ex-employer, Pearl Investments, used the DMCA against a contract programmer who connected to the company's computer system through a password-protected virtual private network illustrates the potential for unscrupulous persons to misuse the DMCA to achieve what would not be possible under existing computer access regulation regimes. IT law expert Brendan Scott has written:
These are prohibitions on accessing data which has been protected by a technological measure. The explicit purpose of these provisions is to prohibit data interoperability. If open source vendors are not permitted to implement data interoperability, they will face substantial barriers to entry in many important submarkets. In essence, a vendor will be locked out of competition merely because the current incumbent uses a protected format for customers to store their data in. 
He also wrote:
These prohibitions were initially created to protect a small minority of content producers from competition from new technologies, particularly in respect of audio and video content. However these provisions have already been subject of much broader implementation in the United States. In particular they have been used to inappropriately suppress competition in respect of printer cartridges and garage doors ...
Even pressing the shift key can be a breach of the US version of these laws. He continues:
They can be used to anti-competitive effect on any article to which a computer chip can be attached—and there is every reason to suspect that if this category does not already encompass all manufactures, it will do so in the not too distant future.
While they have been characterised as applying to prevent unauthorised copying of music, it would be a grave mistake to think they will be restricted to this area in the future. The anti-circumvention provisions are a legislative imprimatur to the reduction of competition across the whole breadth of the economy. No analysis of the economic impacts of the FTA that I am aware of takes into account this extensive anti-competitive effect. At its worst it will shave percentage points off Australia's GDP. 
I will conclude with the words of Rusty Russell, a member of Australia's open source community who appeared before the Senate inquiry. He said:
Let me make this clear: people in the Open Source industry feel directly threatened by the laws required by the FTA. We have seen threats issued against Open Source developers in the United States, and we fear the same thing here. This kind of fear, and this kind of uncertainty, as I have already noted, is toxic. It drives people from the industry, and it drives people from engaging in innovative activities. And that is a real shame, because currently in Australia we have some of the most talented, and innovative, Open Source developers of any country in the world.
For those reasons and more we Democrats continue to strongly oppose the legislation before us.",SENATE,<title>US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2004-08-03,"—I rise to speak on the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004 and the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff) Bill 2004. At the end of the last session of parliament I attended a farewell dinner for the Canadian High Commissioner, who spoke of the free trade agreement the Canadians have had for many years with the United States. When asked what he thought was the greatest benefit of the free trade agreement he said that quite simply it was access to the United States market. So it will be with Australia. We will have access to the world's largest economy and a market of 300 million people under this free trade agreement. The benefits to Australian agriculture, industry and service providers are potentially immense. There is no guarantee that Americans will buy Australian goods but, by having access, we can compete in their market. That is, I believe, of great benefit to Australia.
As Senator Boswell has said, the free trade agreement will be particularly valuable to the Australian agricultural sector and, in other ways, to various aspects of our manufacturing industry. The manufacturers of utility vehicles, which are commonplace in Australia but which are quite unknown in America, will benefit. We will be able to export utes and services. We will have access to the United States federal government procurement process and also to that of some 44 states. As the United States economy grows, as it inevitably will, so will the benefit of this free trade agreement to Australia grow, or so I and the government definitely believe. 
In the very short time available to me to talk about this tonight, I would like to address two issues: the issue of the PBS, which has been raised several times, and the issue of our audiovisual and cultural productions, which other people have said will be threatened by this agreement, but I do not believe that that is the case at all.
It has been suggested that the price of medicines will be raised under the free trade agreement. As I understand it, the price of medicines under our PBS will not be affected by the free trade agreement with the United States. All that has happened is that we have agreed to a review of the process under which the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee authorises a medication to be placed on our pharmaceutical benefits list. There is no implication at all that prices will be increased. It simply gives American manufacturers a means of being informed why, if it is the case, their brand of some medication has not been authorised as a pharmaceutical benefit in Australia. It is a review process that provides information to the American pharmaceutical industry. It will not in any way provide any mechanism of appeal or challenge to the decision of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. As other people have said this afternoon, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which we have in Australia, is unique. It has provided the Australian population with quite cheap medicines by world standards. The government will in no way compromise that scheme, because it has been of great benefit to Australia. I would like to lay that particular concern to rest.
The other concern that has been consistently raised today relates to our audiovisual products. There have been claims made that local content quotas for broadcasting will be compromised by the free trade agreement. That is not the case either, in my view. The text of the agreement makes it clear that our right to ensure local content in Australian media and the capacity to regulate new and emerging media is respected and retained. Australia has successfully negotiated reservations in the services chapter that ensure that the government's continuing capacity to regulate for Australian content is preserved. There are, in fact, two reservations in two annexes to the agreement which allow Australia to maintain or adopt measures that enable us to maintain local content and ensure that our audiovisual productions are preserved. It has to be said that the US has recognised that Australia is already a very open audiovisual market. The binding commitment that Australia is making will give the United States certainty that we will not close our market in the future or introduce significant trade restrictive measures.
A lot of people have said that they would have liked to have seen in the United States free trade agreement a reservation for cultural products similar to that included in the Singapore free trade agreement—the so-called Singapore reservation. But the reality is that Singapore does not have a very big audiovisual sector—nothing, of course, like the United States movie industry, which, as everybody knows, is the biggest and most powerful movie industry in the world. So, in dealing with the United States, Australia has had to be cognisant of the fact that the United States has that great film industry. We have had to work out an agreement that allows for the interests of the American film industry.
We have had reservations built into this agreement which preserve our cultural identity and enable the government to retain the capacity to support the Australian cultural sector—including the film industry, cultural institutions and so on—through grants, subsidies and tax incentives. The regulatory capacity provided by the agreement will give the Australian government sufficient freedom to respond to changes in media technology. Specifically, it will give Australia the freedom to both retain its existing local content requirements and extend these or introduce new ones in specified circumstances to address the impact of changing technologies. Of course, the technology used in audiovisual production is changing. We are moving into the digital era. Being able to retain our rights to have defined quotas of Australian content is very important given that things are going to change very much with new technology. 
It is quite clear that the Australian free trade outcome in respect of audiovisual content clearly contains greater specificity than the Singapore free trade agreement outcome. In short, the US agreement is more targeted than the broad Singapore free trade agreement reservations. It is my belief that the negotiated outcome addresses Australia's genuine concerns while meeting the US's legitimate interests in having some certainty about the future openness of the Australian market. In particular, the key reservation in annex 2 gives Australia the right to introduce new measures as well as to maintain existing measures. Those are important points for the Australian public to be aware of. This government certainly is not going to abandon Australia's voice—as it is put—in the audiovisual world. This government will preserve the Australian film industry and ensure that it is strong and vibrant in the future.

"McGauran, Sen Julian",NATS,2004-08-03,"—As the chamber is aware, we are discussing the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Bill 2004 and the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation (Customs Tariff) Bill 2004. This is a historic and significant free trade agreement with the United States. It is a significant time in the parliament because the free trade agreement we are discussing is probably the most significant and important agreement to Australia in trade and in economics since 1957, when another significant trade agreement was signed with Japan. The parallels between these two trade agreements are quite uncanny. First of all, both were negotiated by a National Party minister. The Minister for Trade in 1957 was Jack McEwen, who undertook an agreement with Japan. Mr Acting Deputy President, you can see that I am looking for my formal notes rather than trying to wing it.
Opposition senators interjecting—
 (Senator Sandy Macdonald)—Order, Senator Campbell! You are doing very well, Senator McGauran.
—Thank you. I was interrupted by the opposition, who, I should add, were against the trade agreement with Japan in 1957 just as they have been, right up to this very last moment, against this free trade agreement. You have to remember that in 1957 when negotiating that agreement it was soon after the war. So there was a lot of pressure on the then government over negotiating with a former enemy. Of course, those against it were from the same party that is against this agreement. That is of foremost significance.
Look at the result of that trade agreement that the then coalition parties pushed through the parliament. Look at how, during the 1960s and 1970s, that particular agreement underpinned the growth in the Australian economy and the many good and great years we have had in Australia. Our relationship with Japan during the decades that followed was, in fact, what established Australia as one of the top eight OECD countries.
Mr Acting Deputy President Macdonald, is there another speaker to follow me in the chamber? 
—There is not, Senator McGauran, but you have to go for only another four minutes.
—I was just trying to measure my comments. That particular agreement underpinned decades of a very healthy Australian economy. The significance of it is that it was negotiated by a National Party minister back in 1957—no less than Jack McEwen—under extreme pressure, provocation and doomsaying by the same types who are trying to pull this particular agreement down. What we have before us today, speeding forward, is of exactly the same significance: this particular agreement will underpin the growth in the Australian economy for decades to come. Why have the opposition, be it that they are now going to vote for this agreement at this eleventh hour, made it so difficult for the government to put it through? It really should have been put through months ago. Why have they made it so difficult when it is so obvious that we are signing a most significant economic link with the largest economy in the world? Quite frankly, every country in our region would envy this particular agreement. If they thought we were not going to sign it, if it ever came to that, they would be the first in the rush to have such an agreement signed.
We heard during the five months of deliberation of the opposition how the fact that we are making strong economic links with the United States is going to affect our relationships within the region. What a load of rubbish that has turned out to be. As the opposition know only too well, we have a free trade agreement with Singapore and we have a free trade agreement with Thailand all but put through the parliament. We have a trade agreement being negotiated with China, no less, and now Malaysia wants to be in on the act with a free trade agreement. So it is absolute rubbish to say that this particular agreement would affect our economic, political, social or military relationships with our Asian neighbours. It is quite the contrary; it has given us the prestige to be able to negotiate.
But you cannot get it through the likes of Senator Lundy, who happens to be in the chamber, or the likes of Senator George Campbell, who happens to be leaving the chamber at the moment. Why? It is pretty basic. We never heard them criticise the Thai free trade agreement or the Singapore free trade agreement or the pending China agreement, or the Malaysians. There is one basic and simple reason why you are against this agreement, because your criticism simply does not stack up economically. There is only one basic reason. Why don't you have the courage to come out and say it? You are anti-American in every shape and form, even to the detriment of the welfare of Australia for decades to come—and that is what this free trade agreement delivers. There is no other reason, Senator Lundy: your bias is dripping off you.
This agreement particularly brings benefits to the primary industry sector. This is something we have been waiting for for years. We have been hanging around the World Trade Organisation for a long time now waiting for a breakthrough, and perhaps in the last couple of days there has been a renewed breakthrough with the World Trade Organisation, but bilateral agreements of this sort are invaluable to the primary industry sector, and no less this one. This one absolutely champions the cause of primary industry. We have the beef industry, the wool industry, the sheepmeat industry and the dairy industry all benefiting from this agreement. Of course, we wanted better for all of those industries, and quicker access. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2004-08-03,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I wish to comment on the report of the inquiry into doping allegations at the Australian Institute of Sport facility at Del Monte, Adelaide, conducted by the Hon. Robert Anderson QC and tabled by the Minister for Sport, Senator Kemp, out of session last week. I wish tonight to direct my remarks to only a few aspects regarding this report and the circumstances surrounding the doping allegations made. I am, of course, keen to give the Minister for Sport a full opportunity while parliament is sitting over the next two weeks to put a comprehensive account on the public record.
To begin with, I would like to say tonight that the Anderson inquiry into these allegations should not have been necessary. A full, properly constituted and independent inquiry should have been instituted immediately upon the discovery of the sharps bucket on the premises of the AIS facility at Del Monte. There should have been a comprehensive inquiry with full powers—
—Indeed.
—of compulsion and protection, as Senator Lundy knows—and I am delighted, Senator Lundy, that you are going to enter this debate a little later this evening because it is very important. And, of course, the inquiry should have been able to investigate the actions of all athletes allegedly involved in either improper or illegal practices. Without doubt this was the responsibility of the minister, as the AIS is a Commonwealth agency and has a heavy duty of care to all of the athletes involved. Instead, under the totally inadequate stewardship of Senator Kemp, we actually saw a parade of errors and mistakes—pseudo inquiries by coaches and human resources bureaucrats, secretive inquiries by a lawyer contracted to the Sports Commission, ASC induced delays in the tribunal processes, and attempts to cover up the whole matter at least until after the Athens Olympic Games. This issue should have been squarely faced up to back in December of last year, but we find the Australian Olympic cycling team is still in turmoil less than two weeks before the opening ceremony of the games. Senator Kemp should have insisted on full disclosure, full investigation and full accountability back when there was time to do so. There was not enough time for the full job to be done, and the responsibility for that should be laid at Senator Kemp's door.
I also want to comment on the decision made by Minister Kemp to table only part of the Anderson report. I want to be clear on this point. The portion tabled is by far the smallest selection available. Senator Kemp made a number of statements that he intended to publicly table the full report by Mr Anderson and he told the parliament that this public release would be `subject to privacy and other legal requirements'. Senator Kemp then tabled Mr Anderson's summary report last week without any of the additional 300-odd pages of appendix material, which is referred to extensively throughout the summary report. Senator Kemp has made no attempt to justify his refusal to table even one page of the appendices. He has provided no grounds for the failure to table that extensive material. He has given no idea of legal or other advice he has sought or received on the reasonableness or otherwise of tabling that material. And, importantly, the minister has made no attempt to discuss this matter with the Senate. If indeed there are legitimate privacy or other concerns with the publication of the material, then I would have expected Senator Kemp to raise those reasonable issues with the opposition and other senators with an interest in these important matters. The minister's failure to keep his undertaking to the Senate and his abject failure to consult with the Senate on his grounds for doing so will, I believe, be seen as a grave disservice to the parliament. I will be having more to say about these matters a little later in the week. ",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Sport: Drug Testing</title>,Documents,26,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2004-08-03,"—I would like to add my comments on the Anderson report which Minister Kemp tabled in part, and in part only, last week. The issue at hand is not that this report has finally been tabled but, rather, why it took almost seven months from the discovery of used injecting materials in the Del Monte AIS residence to order an obviously much-needed independent and comprehensive investigation into this matter, why it took three weeks from the date the report was completed for it to be finally tabled in parliament and why this report has not been tabled in full.
On 24 June 2004 Minister Kemp appointed Robert Anderson QC to conduct an independent inquiry into serious allegations regarding the use of prohibited performance enhancing drugs by some Australian cyclists. That this investigation was finally ordered by Minister Kemp only as a result of pressure brought to bear by Labor senators, who questioned the cover-up of the Court of Arbitration for Sport findings which concluded that at least one athlete other than French had used eGH, or equine growth hormone, in this room, has already been noted in this chamber. The fact that this whole mess could, and should, have been avoided if the minister had acted decisively in the first instance and ordered a comprehensive independent investigation into this matter last year cannot, however, go without comment. An immediate investigation into this matter would have allowed adequate time to fully investigate these allegations, and would have ensured that the syringes, phials and swabs that were found were tested immediately rather than being left for so long and handled so many times that it was very difficult to gather DNA information that could have offered essential evidence at the time.
Unfortunately, due to the government's ineptitude in handling this matter, the issue has dragged on for so long that we are now only 11 days from the Olympics and we still have outstanding appeals, more than half a report missing and potentially more damning evidence to come. Even when the minister finally ordered a full investigation into this matter, he failed to give Mr Anderson the powers that it could be reasonably assumed would be required to uncover the full extent of just what was going on at the AIS Del Monte residence. Mr Anderson himself conceded he had no powers to compel anyone to answer his questions. He said:
I don't have coercive powers, I can't subpoena, I don't have any authority to administer oaths.
This, in combination with the fact that Mr Anderson was given little more than a week to complete his comprehensive task, clearly shows that the minister was not fully committed to catching those who were attempting to beat the system. There are already questions over the completeness of this report, given the limited time frame and powers that Mr Anderson was required to work within. To now have the minister refuse to release the appendices to this report makes the situation look even worse.
Last month Mr Mark Peters, CEO of the Australian Sports Commission, called on disgraced cyclist Mark French and his legal team to allow the release of the Anderson report, claiming that what Mr French and his team have done `is just a stunt to make sure that their publicity campaign is not derailed'. This was an outrageous statement. When Mark French agreed to release the whole 300-page report, however, the minister and the Australian Sports Commission completed such a stunning backflip they would easily have won gold in an Olympic diving competition. 
Minister Kemp said it was `clearly in the public interest' that he table this report. If it is so clearly in the public interest, why has the minister prevented the full report from being tabled? I ask: are there concerns for the safety of those people who the minister said provided detailed information, including personal information, and who voluntarily cooperated with the Anderson investigation without the expectation that their statements would be made publicly available? I also ask: is there fear of retribution against those who came forward and provided information in an effort to get to the bottom of this matter? We do not know. Or, as I am left to speculate, is it the fact that these appendices may contain further information that may be condemning in nature?
I note that Dick Pound, head of the World Anti Doping Agency, condemned the politicians and sports officials who loudly profess to be against doping in sport and in favour of transparency but who go quiet when it comes to action against top local athletes who are alleged to have broken the rules. Even members of the international sports community are questioning Senator Kemp's commitment to stamping out the use of prohibited substances in sport. So, enough of hiding behind privacy laws in government guarantees. There have now been five separate investigations into this matter. At every stage we have been asked to accept the verdict placed before us, only to find each time that the truth has not been fully disclosed.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Sport: Drug Testing</title>,Documents,26,1,speech
"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2004-08-03,"—Two contrasting views on the decision of the ABC to hire the monitoring organisation Rehame to keep its news and current affairs broadcasting honest leading up to this year's election have recently appeared in the press. I recommend both articles to honourable senators. The first appeared in the Melbourne Age newspaper on 23 June 2004 and was written by Brian Walters, a barrister who is vice-president of the organisation Free Speech Victoria. According to Mr Walters, the circumstances surrounding the appointment of Rehame to conduct this work and of this decision by the ABC board becoming publicly known through the medium of the ABC television show Media Watch raise fundamental questions about free speech.
The second article was by the veteran journalist, sometime editor and current commentator Frank Devine. It appeared in the Australian newspaper on 2 July 2004 and provided a wonderfully light-hearted but, in fact, deadly serious critique of the ABC and the propensity of its broadcasters to editorialise. Devine's article was headed `ABC news gives equal time to speculation and comment'. His view is that the people who actually run the ABC are:
MoT (nicknamed in honour of Orwell's Ministry of Truth), the shadowy, much-feared sub-committee of the ABC Staff Association ... 
The committee, Mr Devine asserts as he argues the case for peer review of the ABC, is `adept with stopwatches' and `will be able to demonstrate to the millisecond how even-handed it was in distributing coverage among the parties'. Now Mr Devine is having a laugh, of course—it is always the best medicine. But it is not election campaign coverage that is of concern, certainly not in terms of stopwatch performance. Even-handedness is a quality that includes, but is not limited to, equal time. 
The problem that many people have with ABC news and current affairs broadcasting is not that it is unprofessional—it is very professional indeed—or that it is too narrow. Its coverage is extensive and very, very broad. The problem is the systemic—if not systematic—presentation of information in ways that will result in subliminal skewing of opinion in listeners and viewers. As one example, take this instance—picked up by Mr Devine in his Australian article—from the ABC's seven o'clock television news on 19 and 20 June:
“Russian President has revealed new intelligence claiming that Saddam Hussein's regime was planning to strike the United States ... For President George Bush the revelation may come as a relief.”
Mr Devine, who kindly offers to act in a `fill-in' capacity before the peer review monitoring group is in place, makes this devastating rejoinder:
Delete second sentence. Unsupported, not to say air-head, speculation.
In a further instance, the ABC ran a quote from President Bush:
`This is a regime that sheltered terrorist groups. This is a regime that hated America. And so we saw a threat and it was a real threat.'
Then it added as its own comment:
That claim is being disputed by the commission into the September 11 attacks.
Mr Devine writes in response:
Delete last sentence. The commission disputes nothing in this Bush statement. An ABC concoction.
That is the problem. Somehow, ABC news and current affairs people just cannot help injecting unsupported—indeed, insupportable—commentary into news and analysis. It does anger people—people in Queensland and elsewhere around the country who let me know in very forthright terms just what they think about this business of skewing the news.
Nor is this disquiet confined to the ABC audience. Albeit this sprang from a different set of difficulties, it is very worrying that the Chairman of the Australian Stock Exchange, Mr Maurice Newman, felt constrained to resign from the ABC board because of the actions of the staff elected director, Ms Ramona Koval. Ms Koval's objections to the ABC appointing Rehame to monitor its political coverage found their way onto the ABC program Media Watch. Whatever the merits of the ABC appointing a monitor to monitor its own monitors, the issue of board confidentiality is crucial. It should not be broken because Ms Koval is concerned about what she views as continual political interference at board level. Her action validates the very point made by commentator Frank Devine to which I referred earlier: the ABC staff should not presume to run the organisation. If there are staff concerns—and there is an industrial problem in Queensland at present, of which I have been advised, relating to a low salary cap being imposed on regional journalists there—they should be dealt with, but they should be dealt with in an employer-employee environment.
But, of course, the problems at the ABC are far wider than that. I inform the Senate that I have added my voice to that of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, in complaining about the politicising of the Bali bombing and South-East Asian terrorist issues by the managing director of the ABC, Mr Russell Balding. Mr Balding has referred my complaint to the complaints review executive, as I requested, and I thank him for that. The ABC's decision to run an episode of its series The Third World War—a British documentary—that referred to Bali and failed to take account of evidence available to this parliament on intelligence issues was reprehensible. Mr Balding issued a statement on 2 July 2004 in which he said of these events: 
There is a fundamental difference between dealing appropriately with complaints and bowing to pressure.
	...	...	...
This is a crucial period for the ABC. In the heightened atmosphere of a looming Federal election the public can be assured that the ABC will stand firm and protect its editorial independence.
There was no threat to that independence. All the foreign minister sought was to have the ABC ensure that those elements of the British documentary that had been overtaken by events here in Australia be put in context—that is, that they be illuminated by material that became available after the documentary was made. These matters are now being considered, so I will not canvass them further at this time; but they need to be resolved.
On a happier note, as honourable senators know, I am very far from being implacably opposed to absolutely everything that the ABC does or says. I am an avid watcher of, and listener to, the ABC. In particular, I am a dedicated fan of NewsRadio. As my friend and colleague the Minister for the Arts and Sport, Senator Rod Kemp, observed at the June estimates hearings, it is an excellent service. I believe in paying tribute where it is due, and it certainly is in relation to NewsRadio. The 24-hour news service has recently celebrated its 10th birthday.
In another area of the ABC's operations, the government and the ABC are working together to support the highly successful Backing Australia's Ability program. The ABC will help promote innovation in the community through the National Innovation Awareness Strategy by producing a range of exciting new projects in partnership with the government. These include ACE Day Jobs, a series of 36 five-minute episodes showcasing young Australians who are passionate and enthusiastic innovators and entrepreneurs. The series will be available on broadband video and via the ABC web site. Another project is Start!, a radio and online initiative supporting young people who have an idea they would like to turn into a business.
I close by saying that it was good to see the ABC recruiting from within for its new director of news and current affairs. I wish John Cameron all the best in that position. I know from people connected with the ABC with whom I have enjoyed a glass or two of wine from time to time that he is highly thought of. I wish him the very best in that position and hope that he manages to perform, certainly from the point of view of balance and bias within the ABC, better than some of his predecessors.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Australian Broadcasting Corporation: Monitoring</title>,Adjournment,27,1,speech

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2004-08-03,"—The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
(1)	The Australian Government has undertaken significant reform of the telecommunications sector since 1996, most notably the development of an open and competitive market, supported by a responsible regulatory safety net. 
For those areas where the competitive environment has not adequately delivered improved infrastructure and services, the Government has been providing direct targeted funding support through grants programs, tenders and subsidies. Funding is being delivered via a number of mechanisms, including the Networking the Nation community grants program; the Social Bonus community grants programs and targeted funding initiatives; the Telecommunications Service Inquiry tenders and grants programs; and the Regional Telecommunications Inquiry initiatives.
More than $1 billion has been allocated to these and other communications initiatives aimed at improving telecommunications services in regional, rural and remote areas of Australia. 
Telstra was successful in winning a number of the tenders noted above, including those for mobile phone services in towns with populations above 500 people, towns with populations below 500 people, and for selected regional highways. The resulting contracts amounted to $21.8m, $18.8m and $19.1m respectively. Telstra also won the tender to upgrade services in the most remote parts of the country (the “Extended Zones”). This contract amounted to $150m. 
Data is also available on certain other mobile phone tenders that Telstra was successful in winning, including individual tenders through the Networking the Nation program and the Wireless West program. In total Telstra received subsidies under these programs of $48.6m. 
However, given the structure of the funding arrangements for many of the initiatives it is not readily possible to state the total level of funding that Telstra has received. For example, under the Networking the Nation program and some of the Social Bonus initiatives, funds were allocated by the independent NTN Board to not-for-profit bodies who may have subsequently entered into a commercial partnership with Telstra (or another carrier) to complete the project. Data has not been captured on the funds that Telstra may have received from these processes.
(2)	The objective for the provision of Government funding support is to help bridge the gaps between urban and non-urban Australia in terms of the range, availability and cost of telecommunications services.
In circumstances where Telstra received Government funding as the result of, for example, competitive tender processes, fee for service or matching funding arrangements, there would have been some benefits to all shareholders in the organisation. In this regard, it is also worth noting that a number of fully privatised companies have been successful tenderers and the recipients of Government funding support for communications initiatives.
