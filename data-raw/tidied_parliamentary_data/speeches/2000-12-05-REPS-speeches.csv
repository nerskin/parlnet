"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2000-12-05,"—My question is to the Treasurer. Do you recall writing me this letter, dated 24 November, on behalf of the government giving your personal commitment that:
The Government will introduce all the business tax changes announced in full.
This includes the proposal to tax trusts the same as companies. Treasurer, will you guarantee to deliver on this commitment in full and with no less revenue? If you cannot keep your word on this important matter, will you resign?",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Taxation: Trusts</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1,question
"Costello, Peter, MP",LP,2000-12-05,"—I will ignore the last polemic from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. That is the kind of tactic that we have come to expect from him as a substitute for serious policy, which is something that you would never hear from the member for Hotham.
The government has substantially reformed the Australian taxation system. We have reformed the indirect taxation system; we have reformed the personal income tax system; we are now reforming the business taxation system. I well recall that the Labor Party, at the time that we put our business taxation changes to the parliament, said that it was opposing cuts in capital gains tax and opposing cuts in company tax. I made it entirely clear that cutting capital gains tax—
—You are a fraud. This is the letter.
—Deputy Leader of the Opposition! Deputy Leader of the Opposition for the second time!
—The Labor Party said it was opposed to cuts in capital gains tax and it was opposed to cuts in company tax. It said that if we reformed the whole of the business taxation system then, grudgingly, it would vote for it. In relation to those matters, what have we done? We have enacted the alienation of personal service income measures. Do you recall those? Something that the Labor Party never got around to doing in 13 years. We then enacted the non-commercial losses provisions—something that the Labor Party—
Honourable members interjecting—
—The Treasurer will resume his seat. As the Leader of the Opposition is well aware, I am only waiting on silence, not silence from him. The Leader of the Opposition.
—Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order in relation to relevance. He was asked a specific question about the government's intentions in taxing trusts as companies. He has been speaking now, I think, for about two minutes and he has not got to it.
—The Leader of the Opposition is aware that the Treasurer has an obligation to be relevant. He has been asked a question about business tax changes and his answer has been entirely focused on the matter of tax changes.
—What I said would happen is as follows: cuts in capital gains tax, done; cuts in company tax, done; introduction of alienation of personal service income, done; introduction of non-commercial losses—never done in 13 years of Labor government—done. In relation to entity taxation, the legislation is out for comment. The last leg is out for comment. We invited comments about it; we are taking those comments in, so we can proceed with those measures. I said to the Treasury on entity taxation, `Why don't you go and get Labor's model so that we can put that out for discussion.' And do you know what? After 13 years of being in government, do you know what these people, who are now allegedly interested in tax measures, had done? Actually, their policy looked a bit like their roll-back policy—a blank sheet of paper. We had to work it up from the beginning. We produced an exposure draft, and we put the exposure draft—the last piece of the jigsaw—out for discussion. After we have fully consulted in relation to these measures, we will proceed with our business taxation reform.

Leave granted.

"Howard, John, MP",LP,2000-12-05,"— Can I add to an answer that I gave?
—The Prime Minister may proceed.
—The Leader of the Opposition asked me a question about Senator Ellison. I can inform the House that I have received an early return on this issue. The early return is to the effect that there was a complaint made about this preselection—I think it was for the upper house—and it was made by the aggrieved candidate. I understand the complaint went to the party's appeals and disciplinary committee, which comprises six people—two of whom are Queen's Counsel. They found that there was no case to answer. Peter Collier did not refuse to give evidence before the committee, as I think has been suggested.

"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2000-12-05,"—This matter of public importance is directed fairly and squarely at the Treasurer, and I will be interested to see whether he comes in to defend himself in this House. This is not just a question of trusts; it is a question of trust. It was an agreement entered into with the Labor Party to get bipartisan support for business tax reform, an agreement signed on behalf of the whole government and now which he will not reaffirm today despite being questioned about it. This is a person who is about to be rolled or censured by the National Party, but he has still got the numbers. He has got the numbers because Labor is prepared to support the original proposal. So he has the numbers, but has he got the guts? That is, in essence, what is involved in this issue today. I see him in the chamber and I hope he takes part in the debate. He wants to come into this House and brag about the fact that he could get the GST through even though Labor opposed it, and now we are offering support and he is walking away from the proposition. 
This is a government, though, that is soft on tax avoidance. It slugs ordinary Australians with its deceitful GST, most recently demonstrated by its broken promise on petrol, by the pensioners who were not compensated and also by the `never ever' claim. While on the one hand he is slugging ordinary Australians with it, he slip slides on the top end of town. The latest is this trusts issue. We have asked the question before as to whether there is not a conflict of interest in this problem that he is confronted with on trusts within the coalition party because a number of members of his frontbench have and own family trusts. Tony Abbott, John Anderson, Alexander Downer, Peter McGauran, Bruce Scott, Peter Slipper, who is a parliamentary secretary, Wilson Tuckey, Chris Ellison, John Herron and Ian Macdonald are all owners of family trusts. Yet here we have a government tearing itself apart within the coalition about whether it can proceed with what it undertook to proceed with. You would have to say there is a strong supposition of a conflict of interest. This goes to a position in which the National Party is reported last night to have voted unanimously to withdraw support for the government in its attempts to crack down on trusts. But the government does not need the National Party because it knows that it has got support from this side of the House. Costello has the numbers, but has he got the guts?
 (Mr Nehl)—The Treasurer has the numbers.
—The Treasurer has the numbers, but has the Treasurer got the guts? That is the question. He has also committed to it in writing. The other question that has to be asked of him is: will he honour his agreement, an agreement not just on his behalf but on behalf of the whole government? I tabled earlier today a letter dated 24 November 1999. This was the agreement that we reached on business tax reform in which he said: 
As I have indicated to you I expect legislation on trusts to be prepared by 30 June next year and legislated in time to apply from 1 July 2001.
Of course he did not meet that; he has put it back a year. But he then went on to say:  
The Government will introduce all the business tax changes announced in full.
So will he stand up to the Prime Minister when he comes under pressure from the National Party? We know he was not able to stand up to the pressure from the Prime Minister when he rolled him on exempting food from the GST, something the Treasurer said he would never condone. We know that the Treasurer got rolled on tariffs. Is this another example of where he will be rolled again? Will he allow himself to be rolled in circumstances in which he has a clear commitment from us and the numbers in the House? If he does not honour the agreement that he signed underpinning the business tax reform and put in writing on behalf of the government, he must resign. It is as simple as that. This is not just a question of trusts; it is a question of trust. It is a commitment that you made to us in the interests of getting a bipartisan outcome.
This is an important integrity measure so far as fairness is concerned and so far as the budget is concerned. Trusts can be used to minimise taxation. That is the truth of it. But we also know, from the quote from page 115 of the ANTS package of August 1998, the government's own attestation as to why something needed to be done on this:
Achieving consistency of treatment across companies and trusts under these redesigned company tax arrangements would provide simplicity, clarity and fairness in treatment. It would also address techniques that have come to light through the High Wealth Individuals project which take advantage of highly complex structures.
So this was the position that the Treasurer was saying was guiding him and directing him in terms of clamping down on them—his words, and we endorse them because we believe it is an important integrity measure. But it is also a measure that is $2 billion worth in the budget. I will be interested to hear what the Treasurer says on this point, because we understand that he has had Niki over there up in the gallery telling them that—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, he hardly comes in to take a debate. Does he have to consistently interject?
—I am trying to keep him quiet.
—The AWU would—
—Order! Treasurer, you will have your turn soon.
—We want him here, but we want him to defend. But just get him to shut up for the purposes of this part of it.
—I just wanted to hear what the AWU has to say—
—I will tell you. You can have all the chance you want later, my friend, to answer this. We know that Niki Savva has been up in the gallery saying this is not $2 billion worth, if it goes; she is talking about a significantly less figure. But what does page 127 of the ANTS package show? It shows that the revenue gained from this measure is $900 million in the first year, $760 million in the second year and $430 million in the third year.
—That sounds like $2 billion to me!
—That sounds like $2 billion to me, and not only is it the basis upon which you went public in defending this; it is $2 billion factored into the ANTS package and therefore the revenue neutrality test. So, if this is watered down or not proceeded with, not only is it a hit to the budget; it undermines the whole revenue neutrality dimension of the business tax reform, which formed the basis of bipartisanship on business tax reform. We all know that these areas are difficult, and the alienation of personal services income was one that he referred to before, which we actually insisted on as part of the business tax package, as part of the revenue—
—You didn't!
—Yes, we did. You know it, because you walked out on the negotiations. You got in a huff and walked out on your negotiations, and it was your advisers who brought you back in to cement the deal on business tax reform.
—The Treasurer will be silent and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition will address his remarks through the chair. 
—That is what led to the letter of 24 November. But we offered bipartisanship to get business tax reform up. We disagreed on the GST but we said that business tax reform was important to give business certainty beyond one electoral cycle and we were prepared to reach agreement. We honoured it. We were the ones who had to go into our caucus room and argue for a reduction in capital gains tax.
—Oh, so you were against it!
—This was no mean feat on our part. I was not against it. I undertook to do it. I did and I delivered. All I want you to do, my friend, is deliver your side of the bargain. We have delivered. Can you? Let us get that smirk off your face, and just get a commitment that you will do what I did.
—No, no! There is no smirk on the chair's face. Address your remarks through the chair.
—If we were prepared, and I was prepared, to go into our caucus and argue to deliver our side of the bargain, that is all we ask of you. But can you do it? Will you do it? Can you deliver? Have you got the guts to do it? That is the question that we are posing to you—and, if you have not, you have to resign. You signed an agreement that said you would do it, that you would honour it in full.
We have the Prime Minister running around the country saying that he cannot give relief to Australian motorists because the cost would affect the budget. He reiterated that today. He said any cut to revenue or any dip into the surplus is going to put upward pressure on interest rates. That is his point. If the government does not proceed with this measure, it is a $2 billion hit over three years. You cannot have it both ways. You cannot say that you cannot afford to do it for Australian motorists because that is going to put upward pressure on interest rates but cave into the National Party and have people believe that will not. This is a government that has to have some consistency in this regard—let alone honour the agreement that was entered into.
What was the commitment? This is important to go through. It is not just the letter he signed off to me. Back in June of 1999, he said in answer to a question from me, `The government's policy as announced in A New Tax System, ANTS, stands.' The question was: would he confirm the full implementation of the proposal to tax trusts? So there he was back on 7 June 1999 saying it stands. In answer to a question from me on 12 October 1999 about what Rob Bastian was saying, `Given that you have already put this measure off for a year, costing up to $900 million, will you guarantee not to water it down further?' he said, `We remain committed to introducing it.' We then have the press release of 11 November in which they make the same commitment, and then we have the letter to me which I have already referred to. The Treasurer gave his word to me in writing in that letter of 24 November 2000 and then he gave his word to the House in similar terms. The time was 4.21 p.m, the Hansard reference is page 12546 and the Treasurer promised:
The Government will introduce all the business tax changes announced in full.
These same business tax changes were announced in the Treasurer's first press release, which states:
The key changes to business taxes are ... Implementing the entity tax arrangements outlined in A New Tax System (including the taxation of trusts like companies ...
In his second press release—No. 74 of 11 November—the Treasurer states:
As outlined in the Government's 21 September announcement on business tax reform, the consistent treatment of trusts and companies will commence from 1 July 2001.
So the Treasurer said consistently that he will do it in full. We asked him today whether he stands by it, but he did not respond in the categorical way in which he has made that statement to date or in the same manner in which he wrote the letter to me to secure our support on the other business tax reform measures that he is now under pressure from the National Party to move away from.
I have heard the argument and we have some degree of sympathy for the argument about trusts being a vehicle for farmers. However, partnerships are the usual farming business entity. Tax statistics show that there are 140,000 primary production partnerships but only 25,000 trusts operating in primary production. The National Party is not speaking for all farmers; it is speaking for the top end. Is it speaking from self-interest because it has trust arrangements as well? 
This is not the first time that the government has gone soft on tax avoidance. The member for Kingston will outline how the government has failed to act on recommendations associated with high-wealth individuals. But this Treasurer is also a serial offender in going soft on tax avoiders in the area of superannuation and employee share schemes. Before he came to office, he promised to support root and branch Labor measures designed to close these loopholes. He has been in government for almost five years and we are still waiting to see that. The Treasurer is a serial offender on tax avoidance and he ought to be condemned for it. If the Treasurer does not honour his promise, he should resign. ",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Business Tax Reform</title>,Matters of Public Importance,9,1,speech
"Costello, Peter, MP",LP,2000-12-05,"—The speech that we have just heard from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on this matter of public importance shows why a union official can be trusted to misrepresent the facts but not to run the Australian taxation system. It is the kind of speech that the union official would have given down on the waterfront as ACTU president, attacking the rich and saying that the workers demanded nothing but the best. It is the kind of speech that he would have given at an AWU conference when he read out a list of people who might have trusts. Perhaps it is the kind of speech that would be made down at the ALP branch meeting, when he would say, `Trusts: the following people have them, ipso facto they are bad,' and then he would call for somebody's resignation. But it bears no analysis. 
Was there any hint of understanding from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition about what entity taxation is? Did he say, `Entity taxation is a proposal to do the following,' or, `It ought to be done for the following reasons,' or, `The disparity between taxation treatment in companies and trusts is the following: these are illegitimate and those are legitimate, and this is why the Labor Party never did anything about it'? 
—You have had five years.
—Order! The member for Rankin!
—Let me ask one simple question because I think the proposition is that it is an important integrity measure. It is apparently so important that the Labor Party produced no legislation in 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995 or in 1996. This important integrity measure not only was not legislated for 13 years but was not announced or developed. No exposure draft was prepared and there was no public discussion of the issue—not once. 
—Yes, there was.
—Okay. We will go back to the Treasury; I will do it again. I asked the Treasury to produce Labor's entity tax measures, and I was given a blank sheet of paper. But apparently it was developed. If it was, I will make those opposite this offer: we will legislate the legislation that they prepared.
—How about we legislate—
—The member for Rankin will be silent.
—Hang on. If it was developed, I will make this offer now: we will legislate the Labor Party's legislation. The thing is that this important integrity measure was so important to the Australian Labor Party that, firstly, they never produced any legislation; secondly, they never had any exposure draft; thirdly, they never thought of the concept; fourthly, they never engaged in any discussion about it; and, fifthly, to this day, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition cannot even explain what entity taxation is because it was never thought up by the Australian Labor Party. 
The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that entity taxation is a means of achieving consistency and simplicity in clarifying the law across different entities. But which entities? Has there been any deliberation in his mind about different entities and why those differences arose, what the taxation differences should be, what the policy bases should be and how we compare a trust that does not have paid up capital with a company that does? Has he ever turned his mind to that proposition? A company has paid-up capital; a trust does not have paid-up capital. That is one of the principal reasons why there is a difference. When trying to apply unified taxation to two entirely different legal structures that are based on entirely different common law principles, it might actually be a good idea to initiate a discussion so that experts could come and give evidence. Is there any concept at all of what Labor would want to do or why it would want to have that kind of discussion? No. To the ACTU president, this is just another political opportunity. 
The ALP were so interested in this question today that they asked me just one question and then moved on to who was living in the house of the Minister for Sport and Tourism, who was giving out how-to-vote cards in the electorate of Cook and—another one of the great smears of the Labor Party—the residences where Senator Hill's children should have been registered. That was the interest that the Australian Labor Party showed in this particular issue. It bespeaks of just another MPI, of their sitting around, working out tactics and saying, `What can we do today? Well, we can't go on rorts again today, so we'll put Simon up to give the old branch member's speech.' You might get away with that down at the branch members meeting at Albert Park or, if you go to your electorate, in Oakleigh, but you do not get away with that here in the House of Representatives.
The second thing he said—this I think was a really telling admission—was, `The reason why we need entity tax is that the Labor Party had to do something it did not want to do, and this is the price.' What did the Labor Party have to do that it did not want to do? He said, `I had to go into my party room and argue for a cut in the capital gains tax.' I thought that was a very interesting admission. The Labor Party had to do something it did not want to do: cut capital gains tax.
If you do not want to cut capital gains tax—here is an offer—you can move laws to reinstitute a 48½ per cent capital gains tax rate. You can do that; you can announce it as part of your policy. Here you are, you run around and you say, `Look at us. We are absolutely virtuous. We actually voted to cut capital gains tax.' If it harmed you so much, here is an offer: announce at the next election that you have a policy if elected of doubling the capital gains tax rate. If that is your point—`We had to do something that really hurt us and that we really disagreed with'— then go out and say that you will reinstitute it.
This is like the GST. I watched this parliament since probably August 1998, on a daily basis, argue GST. I used to get up here and come to the dispatch box on a daily basis and I would be taking questions about GST. How does GST apply here? How does GST apply there? How many people will the GST put out of work? What will the inflation rate go to under GST? How will the poor be worse off under GST? We do all of that work, we put the GST into place—and what is their principle? Blow me down, their principle is to keep it. That is their principle. We apparently argued for three years over something that was a bipartisan policy—not because there was any principle but because, when you have no policy, when you stand for nothing, if you are the career type ALP member that represents your party now, every political issue just becomes an opportunistic attempt to score a political point.
When you were in government, was there any serious thought about reforming the business taxation system? Did you ever think of the concept of entity taxation? We also heard you say, `Because we had to do something we really did not want to do, we had to cut capital gains tax, and what we needed were all these important integrity measures.' What was the first one you said? The alienation of personal services income. Who introduced that? Thirteen years in government, and did the Australian Labor Party introduce measures on the alienation of personal services income? Not once. What was the other important integrity measure you spoke of? Non-commercial losses. Thirteen years in government, and you never produced legislation on non-commercial losses. 
Here we are, we come into office and we have to do all of the hard yards. And these people, who were nothing but lazy when they were in office, now say, `Hang on, you've run a marathon. When's your second coming up?' That is the sort of attack: `You've run a marathon. When are you going to do your second? Okay, you only did alienation of personal service income, which we did not do. You only did non-commercial losses, which we did not do. You only closed down the R&D syndicates, which we did not do. You only closed down the infrastructure borrowing scheme, which we did not do. You put in place the trafficking in trust loss measures, which we did not do. You did the measures to address the tax avoidance through overseas charities, which we did not do. You went into taxing distributions disguised as loans from private companies, which we did not do. You dealt with the artificially capital created losses, which we did not do. You put in place the measures to prevent trading in franking credits and dividend streaming, which we did not do. You spoke about the superannuation surcharge, which you opposed'. And do you know what they say? They say, `You've run a marathon. When's your next one coming up?' These are the people who sat around for 13 years and did nothing, and then we came in and did all of the things that eluded them.
I would love to have the right of reply when the member for Kingston gets up, because the member for Kingston was one of the famous advisers of my predecessor as Treasurer, Mr Willis. I know that the member for Kingston advised the then Treasurer, Mr Willis, to publish forged letters. That is what I know. He advised the then Treasurer to put them out.During his speech he can tell us the following: why was it when he was advising the Treasurer, the then member for Gellibrand, Mr Willis, that they did not do anything about R&D syndicates? Mr Deputy Speaker, I will tell you why: because there was a whole clientele with which the member for Hotham is very familiar that was using those schemes. When we dealt with them, who opposed closing down the R&D syndicates more than anybody else? The old member for Hotham. He had a whole clientele.
He could advise us why they did nothing about luxury car leasing. He could advise us why they did nothing about closing the infrastructure borrowings scheme, which amounted to $4 billion of tax avoidance, which I had to close. Not only did you not close it down but you actually opened it up. They actually opened it; they created it. He can tell us why they did not do thin capitalisation, why they did not do charitable trusts, why they did not do trafficking in trust losses, why they did not do loans from private companies, why they did not do streaming of franking credits and why they did not do superannuation. He can tell us why the biggest anti-tax avoidance measure that this economy has ever seen—the biggest single measure against the cash economy and tax avoidance that this economy has ever seen—was totally opposed by Labor: the goods and services tax. The one measure that completely clamped down on the black economy, the Labor Party opposed hook, line and sinker.
We are not going to take these ACTU like speeches from the old ACTU president here. We have done all of these measures. We have put the entity taxation draft exposure bill out for discussion. We are certainly not going to take any of these confected smears and slurs from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I should just correct him on another thing, Mr Deputy Speaker—the absurd claim that this has a $2 billion cost. This is an absolutely absurd claim. He referred to page 127 of ANTS. This is a total measure. It includes PAYG, which has already been implemented, and was also costed on an entity tax rate of 36c, which has now been reduced to 30c. Absent the measures which have already been put in place—namely the reduction in the entity tax rate from 36c to 30c and the bringing forward of PAYG, which produces a particular bonus in the year 2000-01—and the measures which the government has in its bill for implementation are of the order of, in a full year, $350 million.
I want to come to another claim that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has made. He said, `Oh, we are very worried about the $350 million'—which we have out for discussion, for legislation once we have got agreement on the principles—`because interest rates could go up if that is not enacted.' Yet at the moment he is voting against $410 million per annum in relation to beer excise. He says, `Well, I'll vote against $410 million on beer excise'—he had his little stunt the other day with all of his things—`but, oh, gee, this $350 million, which you have got out for discussion and which you are going to enact once you have agreement on the principles, if you do not enact that, interest rates will go up.' Let me conclude by saying that the one thing I would regard you as something of an authority on would be raising interest rates, because, when you were part of the ACTU leadership and part of the government, you had the home mortgage interest rate at 17 per cent, you had the overdraft rates at 21 per cent and 22 per cent, you defended the falling of real wages and your greatest policy boast was that you had put the Australian economy into recession. Ten years later, they still boast about it. This is the government which has done tax reform. We have a record which you could only envy and the best news about it is that we intend to continue to deliver good policy to Australia. (Time expired)

"Cox, David, MP",ALP,2000-12-05,"—The coalition has a long tradition of supporting tax avoidance and evasion. Under the Howard government, paying tax remains optional for those who have money and therefore access to advice about how to structure their own affairs. This conservative tradition no doubt goes back a long way, but the coalition's reluctance to deal with it was brought to light in the last term of the Fraser government—when our present Prime Minister was Treasurer—by the Costigan royal commission. Peter Durack, the Fraser government Attorney-General, had left the prosecution file for the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes in his bottom drawer for seven years.
Today, it is not bottom-of-the-harbour schemes that are the tax avoiders' and evaders' preferred method of operation; it is the abuse of trust structures. The speed with which the coalition are dealing with this problem is starting to rival Durack's seven-year inaction on the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. The key player then, as now, was John Winston Howard. If he was at all interested in the integrity of the Australian taxation system he would have legislated to put an end to the abuse of trusts in his first year in office. It is obvious to anyone with an understanding of tax policy that the present laws relating to trusts offer significant opportunities for avoidance and evasion.
Throughout 1994 and 1995, the previous Labor government pressed Treasury for advice on the extent of the problem and possible remedies. Nothing was forthcoming until 9 November 1995, when the Australian Taxation Office advised that they had uncovered a significant problem using multiple trust structures. They had found that large numbers of seemingly unrelated trusts were in fact related and that a range of techniques were being used by high wealth individuals to reduce tax liabilities to low or negligible levels; by that I mean taxable incomes of around $30,000, with some of these people accessing social security benefits. At least $800 million a year was at stake from a small number of high wealth individuals. Treasury and the tax office worked on the issue over the next three months, eventually advising the then Treasurer that it would be appropriate to make a public announcement that the government would act to end these practices. That announcement was made on 11 February 1996, the Secretary to the Treasury and the Commissioner of Taxation having been instructed on 29 January to develop a legislative response to cover income from the 1996-97 financial year as a matter of urgency. During the 1996 election campaign Labor announced it would act, because we were seeking a mandate to deal with this area of tax avoidance. Despite a briefing from the tax commissioner to the present Treasurer, the Liberal response was sceptical. They said they would act if abuses were found. When they were elected, to publicly manage the issue, as opposed to stamping out the abuse, they established the High Wealth Individuals Taskforce in the tax office—and I will have a bit more to say about that later. 
Two weeks before the 1998 election, when it needed money to fund tax cuts, the coalition announced that it would tax trusts as companies. It claimed significant revenue increases from the package of measures it called `consistent treatment of entities'. The positive budgetary impact was to be $1.67 billion in 2000-01, declining to $650 million in 2002-03. Yet we did not see those bills when the government introduced the GST legislation. Instead, we were told that this problem would be dealt with in the Ralph Review of Business Taxation. But when the business tax concessions were legislated there was no legislation to pay for them by curtailing the abuse of trusts. That was put off until stage 2 of the business tax reforms.
The remedies on trusts were clearly set out in the ANTS package by the Treasurer. Labor wanted them implemented as quickly as possible. It was not a matter of any significant conflict between the parties; it was a matter of conflict within the coalition. Successive National Party leaders Fischer and Anderson have waged a war of resistance against it within the government. Immediately after the Treasurer and the shadow Treasurer had made their agreement on the business tax reforms, I had a brief conversation in the corridor outside the chamber with the member for Farrer. I asked him how his farmers were going to like having their trusts taxed as companies. He replied that the National Party had been intending to knock that proposition off until the Treasurer signed his letter to the member for Hotham. I did not take that as an assurance that the National Party would cease their resistance to this legislation—and it is clear from reading this morning's Sydney Morning Herald that they have not. The member for New England apparently had a stand-up argument about it with the Treasurer last night at the PM's Christmas party. He told him, `I've spoken to some members of the Liberal Party and I know that they are concerned.' The article also revealed that the Leader of the National Party had established a task force to examine their concerns about the issue and he had also raised them with the Prime Minister last night. The Nationals' intention to oppose the measure is clear, and they are going to round up those Liberals who normally support the tax avoidance industry to support them. For the government, there is only the academic question: who leaked the story last night? I wonder whether it was the Prime Minister's office or the Leader of the National Party's office. I expect that the Prime Minister will remain true to form and intervene on behalf of the tax avoidance industry.
Meanwhile, what has been happening over at the Taxation Office? The High Wealth Individuals Taskforce has now been operating long enough for the Auditor-General to do a performance audit, which is very instructive. The Auditor found that, as Labor Treasurer Ralph Willis said in 1996, there is $800 million of revenue at risk because of the tax avoidance activities of high wealth individuals. However, most of that revenue will only be forthcoming—and I quote the Auditor's summary—`from the downstream impact of effective and timely changes to remedy deficiencies in the law'. It would be a triumph of hope over experience to believe, with this Prime Minister and this coalition, that those legislative changes will ever be forthcoming. The Auditor found that the High Wealth Individuals Taskforce is achieving its revenue targets. But those revenue targets are based on what can be achieved by auditing under the present legislation and they are quite modest—around $100 million per annum—by comparison with the revenue that would be available if the government were prepared to legislate.
Those revenue targets are set down in a resource agreement with the Department of Finance and Administration. When the task force was set up, the government gave the Taxation Office an extra $9 million, provided it agreed to get an extra $100 million through audit activity in that area. In my experience, that is a realistic return on additional compliance activity. But what is unusual is having an outside agency directly involved in setting the tax office's audit priorities. The government knows it is politically exposed by its failure to crack down on tax cheats. The Treasurer does not want to legislate, so he redefines the revenue objective from achieving fairness to something much less and uses the High Wealth Individuals Taskforce as a political device to be seen to be doing something. He provides a limited amount of money to increase audit activity under existing legislation, but the government refuses to enact the legislation that, according to the Auditor-General, will be required to deal with the overwhelming majority of the revenue risk. 
The Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit has not finished its report on the High Wealth Individuals Taskforce performance audit, but I can refer to the public evidence given by the ATO and the Australian National Audit Office. I asked the Audit Office: 
Did you look at the advice to the previous government about the $800 million and did you find any reason to dispute that advice? 
It said:
Yes, we looked at the advice that was provided, and no, there was not anything to suggest that it was different from the way we reported.
I asked: 
Did the Audit Office look at the specific advice that the task force had given to the government in relation to the need for tax reform and legislative changes? 
It said:
We looked at a number of submissions that were made by the task force which were then coordinated through the tax office to Treasury. We did not itemise those and check them against things that were made. But, yes, we saw evidence of advice that was being provided on an as-you-go basis.
I asked:
And it was a very substantial volume of advice? 
The Audit Office said:
It was.
Through the Public Accounts Committee, I have asked the Treasurer to release all of that advice so we can have a look at it. I also asked the Taxation Office—quoting page 58 of the Auditor's report:
On the basis of evidence gathered by the taskforce to date, the taskforce considers that the most significant systemic generators of tax planning by HWIs are the use of trusts and related party or intragroup transactions. The ATO expects that the Government's proposed business tax reforms, including the taxation of trusts through the new entity tax system, will address major deficiencies in the current tax system. Can you confirm that is the ATO's view? 
The tax office confirmed that that was its view. I said: 
But the new entity taxation system has not been legislated yet, has it? 
It said: 
No, that is correct. 
Unfortunately for the rest of the Australian taxpayers who pay their tax, it will not be. The difference in this area of taxation will continue to be not the $800 million that is there but the $100 million the Treasurer chooses to collect.

"Cadman, Alan, MP",LP,2000-12-05,"—I believe this government has kept its promises and will continue to do so. I believe that one of the reasons that the Australian Labor Party cannot make promises is that they have no policies to base those promises on—and if they had policies and promises they would not keep them. Mr Deputy Speaker, I know you will remember this document I am holding. Do you remember the money tree, Mr Deputy Speaker? I am sure members on this side of the House remember the money tree, one of the many promises never fulfilled by the Australian Labor Party.
Today we heard the member for Kingston, the previous speaker, admit that, coming into the 1996 election, there was a searching around within the ranks of the then government to establish some areas of compliance, some areas of integrity, on which the Australian Labor Party could go out with a policy that identified a tax problem, seeking to have a mandate to attack tax avoidance. They left it to the third last month of the 13th year of government to take this step, to inquire of the Taxation Office: is there any area in which we can act on tax avoidance? The Australian Taxation Office came back three months later, one month before the election, in February 1996 to say, `Yes, there is one area that we can think of and we are going to identify it and you can run on it.' So after 13 years the ALP found, coming into their 13th year of government, one area of tax avoidance on which they thought there might be a policy to propose. 
I notice that the Australian Labor Party are not making any commitments or promises or announcing any policies today about what their anti-avoidance measures may be. They are waving around a sheet of paper saying, `If you have signed this, you have got to deliver on it.' I would like to indicate that this government has made commitments to the Australian people and it has delivered. We went to the 1996 election saying that we were going to make the economy better, solve some of the unemployment problems and fix up the tax system. I refer the House to the annual report of the Reserve Bank of Australia, the top economic measurer in Australia, and the governor's first four lines:
Domestically it was a good year for the economy, with strong growth and falling unemployment.
What a great opening sentence from the Governor of the Reserve Bank. The Australian Labor Party had never been able to establish a report like that. I refer the House not to government rhetoric but to Westpac Australia's Market Insight of September 2000:
The export sector is providing a powerful stimulus to the Australian economy likely to override any GST effects on activity.
Following the commitment to make things easier and better, we have been living up to our commitments to small business. I refer to the press release of this terrific Treasurer of 12 October this year referring to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 8), where the Treasurer in fact refers to some of the measures to assist small business. Some of the hundreds of measures to assist small business include increased flexibility to revoke monthly tax period elections for the GST, a change to the way in which debts are offset against the business activity statement and increased flexibility to cancel GST registration. The Treasurer has been listening to people, taking action, taking initiatives and delivering on our promises.
—He is not going to do anything about trusts.
—We will come to trusts; do not worry about trusts. The Howard government is sticking up for small businesses. There is a capacity for small business to take unconscionable conduct to the ACCC. It is done. The ACCC had its result last month, but it was lost on the Australian Labor Party. We funded that. The unemployment figures are the best results for the last 10 years—and it takes a coalition government to do that—6.3 per cent; what great figures. Agricultural exports were breaking records for the third month in a row. What great results on promises made and promises kept.
The Australian Labor Party, on the other hand, has got some very interesting ways of approaching things. I refer to a statement earlier this month by Simon Crean concerning the shadow Treasurer's commitment about the roll-back of the GST, backing up his leader. An interviewer said, `You have put up a proposition to roll back the GST but the Morgan and Banks survey says that business doesn't want that.' The shadow Treasurer said, `They asked the wrong question. That wasn't the question they were supposed to ask.' So he says, `Don't worry about the facts; let's reinvent the question.' 
—What is happening about roll-back now?
—You do not hear about roll-back now, and what a strange thing that is. John Della Bosca had it right in New South Wales. He said, `Forget all this carry-on, because it is a negative campaign and you will never win it by running that sort of campaign.' He said he believed that Australians had said that the GST was complicated enough and any Labor changes would make it worse.
Let us have a look at some of the tax measures. I have only got a few minutes, but the list of what this government has done is quite amazing. There are integrity measures and incentive measures, and you have just got to weigh one up against the other. There has been business tax reform for individuals, and capital gains tax reform completely changed that taxa tax that was brought in by the Australian Labor Party and reformed by a reforming Treasurer. The scrip for scrip rollover relief is another measure of relief coming straight out of the business tax reform. Refund of imputation credits is another excellent tax initiative. Small businesses are big winners with the whole of the tax reform, the simplified tax system I have already mentioned. Lower corporate tax rates are part of this whole reform process. The company tax rate will fall from 36 per cent to 34 per cent and then to 30 per cent thereafter. Seventy-five per cent of any capital gain on active assets will be exempt from the GST. These are real reforms. This is a government with vision, commitment and policies. Nothing of that type has come from the opposition. Even in the area of reform where they want to attack those people who they claim are avoiding taxation, they have got no proposal at all. There is no scope and there is no understanding of a comprehensive approach. All the opposition do is wave a bit of paper and say to the Treasurer, `What is next? You have made a commitment—keep it.' Of course he will keep it. 
—Run another marathon.
—Yes. They say, `We will not say what is written on it but we will wave this bit of paper. If you don't keep what we think your commitments are, you can retire.' What a policy that is. That is sheer brilliance. That really bites with the business community! Our policy is that, where a small business has sold off active assets held for 15 years or more and the taxpayer is at least 55 years of age and intends to retire, there is no GST at all.
What about the Ralph Review of Business Taxation? The government has introduced legislation and it is going to be out there for consultation. Whoever heard of a government putting the draft legislation out there so that we can hear what the community wants, and hear from the Australian Labor Party, if they have got any ideas. I think we have heard all of their ideas in 15 minutes today, so the Treasurer will not be wasting much time on reading their submission. But submissions will be coming from the whole of the business community and from the workers. It will be coming from the union movement too; it will be coming from all sections of the Australian community telling this government what they think of this draft legislation.
That is the legislation with trusts in. The Treasurer outlined it today—there is $350 million to be gained from changing the taxation system for trusts. That is the path the government are going down. When we come into the session next year consultation will be finished. I know the Treasurer will carefully discuss it with his colleagues the Deputy Prime Minister and the Prime Minister, and they will come into this place and present something that is workable and that will achieve the results. We have kept the promises; I have indicated that to you. But what about the whole of the integrity areas and compliance? We have heard nothing today from the Australian Labor Party about the abuse of the research and development grants.
—Oh, no.
—We have heard not a thing on the luxury car tax. We have heard not a thing on the closure of the infrastructure borrowing scheme. The Labor Party invented it and thought it was the best thing since sliced bread but did not realise how it was being rorted. What about the tightening of the thin capitalisation to address tax minimisation by foreign companies? We have heard not a word about that. They had 13 years to fix that. Those on the other side did not do a thing. Then there are the measures to address tax avoidance through overseas charitable trusts. All of these things this government has delivered, and it will continue to deliver on its commitments.

"SPEAKER, Mr",N/A,2000-12-05,"—On 28 November I advised the House of Senate message No. 496, in which the House was advised that the Senate had returned the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2000 and resolved to press its requests for amendments previously rejected by the House. I advised the House of the constitutional questions that message involved, as successive Speakers have done in similar circumstances. In the message just reported, the House is advised of the Senate resolution to press its requests further. I understand that there has not been a case of the Senate further pressing its requests since 1906. Consideration by the House of this message also has constitutional implications.
—Absolutely deluded!
—I would remind the member for Mitchell and the member for Corangamite that the Speaker is on his feet. As I indicated on 28 November, the House has never accepted that the Senate has a right to repeat its requests for an amendment to a bill when the House has rejected the request. There are no House standing orders covering a situation for consideration of pressed requests, suggesting a belief, in the minds of those framing the standing orders, that the House would not, in the normal transaction of business, require procedural rules of this kind. In 1983, the action of the Senate in pressing requests was taken as failure to pass proposed legislation and included as the basis for a simultaneous dissolution of both houses. However, there have been occasions in the past when the House has refrained from determining its constitutional rights. The message has subsequently been considered. 
There are, of course, situations where negotiations between the houses concerning amendments to bills—that is, proposed changes to bills which the Constitution permits the Senate to make—are unresolved. The standing orders of the House provide for situations of this kind. They provide for a stage at which, if the requirements of the House are not met, the bill in question must be laid aside or a conference with the Senate sought. Standing orders would need to be suspended to enable acceptance of the Senate amendments or alternative amendments. It has been considered to be inappropriate to suspend standing orders to continue the process of disagreement.
It is important that the House has regard to the constitutional implications and is not taken to have determined its privileges simply by the act of consideration of a Senate message. However, it should be open to the House to take whatever course it thinks appropriate in situations where the Senate purports to press its requests for amendments to proposed legislation. This could involve a range of options extending from declining to consider the message to considering the message and making the amendments requested by the Senate by one means or another. It rests with the House as to whether it will consider the Senate message containing requested amendments which the Senate has purported to press further.",REPS,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Kemp, Dr David, MP",LP,2000-12-05,"—I move:
That:
(1)	the House:
(a) 	endorses the statement of the Speaker in relation to the constitutional questions raised by message No. 504 transmitted by the Senate in relation to the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2000;
(b)	refrains from any determination of its constitutional rights in respect of Senate message No. 504;
(c)	declines to consider further the requested amendments which the Senate has purported to press further; 
(d)	calls on the Senate to agree to the Bill as transmitted to it by the House of Representatives without requests, amendments or further delay; and
(2)	the message returning the Bill to the Senate convey the terms of this resolution.
There are three days now before parliament rises for the year, and the opposition is still playing games with the future of Australian schools, Australian school students and their families. There are some 10,000 schools in Australia. Every one of these schools is affected by this legislation. The opposition is showing complete contempt for the need of these schools to plan for the future. Normally, schools would have the opportunity for some weeks or months to plan ahead for their financial business for next year. At present, they are unable to do this, because the Labor Party in the Senate is seeking to use this bill to garner support from the Australian Education Union for its campaign in the next election. Let us be quite clear that the Labor Party's handling of this bill has nothing to do with any alternative policy for education or schools funding which the Labor Party has, because the Labor Party has no alternative policy for funding Australian schools. The Labor Party has not developed an education policy. Its knowledge nation committee has barely met. Its shadow minister for education is not even a member of that committee. It is not serious about education policy.
We have here in the Senate a set of three amendments cobbled together by the opposition on an ad hoc basis in order to curry favour with the left wing of the party and the Australian Education Union. It is a pathetic exhibition of the policy bankruptcy of the Labor Party and its unwillingness to give any credence or consideration to the circumstances of those who have to manage Australian schools. This is a disgrace, and the fact that it has referred the request of the Senate back to this House three times is evidence not only that it has no respect for Australian schools, Australian schoolchildren, their parents, their need for certainty and their need to plan for the future but that it has precious little respect for the Constitution of this country, as the Speaker's statement has made clear. Continuing to press these requests is not something that the Senate should be doing. It does so because it knows that, if the House does not accept these requests, its amendments have no meaning and no sense.
This bill has had almost 12 hours of debate in this House. It has had some 12 hours of debate in the Senate. There has been a Senate inquiry into this bill. There has been every chance to explore all the implications of the legislation, and yet we still have the opposition seeking to delay the passage of the legislation until the last minute for shabby, shallow and hollow political purposes. It has been an extraordinary episode of mishandling. The opposition's case on this bill rests entirely on false and fallacious statements about the impact of this legislation on Australian schools. Undoubtedly, it set off on this course to try to whip up the class hatred that it knows it can always evoke on the Left, because the Left cares for little else except class. The Left always needs an enemy. That is why the Left is never successful in its politics, why no Left policies have ever worked. It is because they are just policies based on anger and envy, not on rationality. There has never been a really sensible policy put forward. But the Labor Party is out there stirring up its own extremists because it wants their votes and then it lands itself in a situation where they do not understand what the Labor Party's position is. Within the Labor Party itself, its tactic has managed to generate massive confusion about what the Labor Party stands for.
The extraordinary thing is that this bill, which is vilified by the Labor Party, is the most generous funding bill for government and non-government schools in Australia which has ever been introduced into the federal parliament. It is a bill which will appropriate some $22 billion for Australian schools over the next four years. It lifts funding for government schools by 21 per cent over that period. This follows very substantial increases in funding for government schools over the last four years. Over the last four years, funding for government schools directly through the schools funding provisions of the federal budget has increased by some $402 million—a 26 per cent increase. It is a bill, therefore, which in sheer resource terms is the most beneficial bill for public education ever to come before this parliament. 
In relation to non-government schools, this is a bill which puts in place a fair and equitable funding system which recognises the sacrifices that parents are making to give their children their best possible education opportunity, taking into account the values and beliefs of Australian families. Parents who exercise this choice make a very substantial financial sacrifice to do so. They sacrifice first of all the taxes that they have paid in full to support Australian public education. On top of those taxes, they pay additional fees to the schools to which they send their children in the non-government sector. By choosing what, from the taxpayers' point of view, is a cheaper form of education, they thereby save the budget, taxpayers and families some $2.2 billion a year. Yet these are the people who are being vilified by the Labor Party, who are being outrageously and dishonestly charged with draining resources out of government schools when, if they put their children into government schools, there would be an enormous, extra, colossal drain on families, taxpayers and the budget, and it is very unlikely that government schools would be able to enjoy the resources that they now enjoy as a result of public support.
And yet these parents, who put education very high on their list of basic values, who are in many cases making a very substantial financial sacrifice, who are saving the taxpayer billions of dollars, are being vilified dishonestly by the Labor Party in its efforts to attract the support of its extremist wing. It is a matter of great disappointment to me and to the government to see that, in a number of communities throughout Australia, perfectly decent and honest people in the government sector have been misled by this outrageous political campaign on behalf of the Labor Party. Many of them genuinely believe what the Labor Party has told them: not that this is a bill which increases funding for government schools and provides the largest funding ever to government schools, but that it is a bill which takes money from government schools. Nothing is more dishonest and despicable than a political party which deliberately sets out to generate discontent and disharmony in the community for its own shabby, hypocritical, political purposes. The Labor Party is now prepared, as we are seeing, to twist the constitutional processes of this country to justify to its supporters the stand that it is making on this legislation, even though it has admitted that it will, in the end, pass this legislation.
In the course of this debate the Labor Party has argued from time to time the extraordinary proposition that this legislation and the SES funding system that it puts in place for non-government schools is somehow unfair to sections of the non-government sector, and that the funding arrangements in this legislation for Catholic parish schools are inadequate. In other words, it has not only sought to divide the government and the non-government sector but also even attempted the tactic of dividing the non-government sector and the various elements of it against themselves by suggesting that the allocation of resources within that sector is unfair. Those who are not expert in this matter and who do not follow the details of this legislation hear this message from this supposedly responsible political party, the Australian Labor Party, and they wonder whether there is any truth in it and who they should believe. For those who ask that question, I put before them this simple and indisputable fact: every element of the non-government sector affected by this legislation, every element of the non-government sector which will be subject to the new SES funding model, supports this bill. They have been urging the Labor Party and Labor Party members week after week to pass this legislation, because they know that it is fair. Statements have been made by the leaders of the non-government sector, and I quote, for example, the Reverend Tom Doyle, the Deputy Chair of the National Catholic Education Commission. He made the statement:
The Senate should pass the State's Grants Bill intact. This is a very good and equitable package. The new system is fair, it is open to scrutiny, yet does not drain resources away from government schools. In a caring and democratic Australia, it is vital that we recognise every person's right to choice.
Anybody who listens to the Labor Party and hears them say that this bill is not fair to Catholic parish schools has to believe, if they want to follow the Labor Party, that the Labor Party knows better than does the National Catholic Education Commission itself what will be beneficial for Catholic parish schools—and not just the National Catholic Education Commission but all the Australian Catholic bishops. This bill has the united support of the Catholic Church in Australia, and the Labor Party still have the nerve to say that they do not know what is good for them and that the Labor Party will do better by them. What arrogance! What hypocrisy we are seeing from the Labor Party at the present time. 
The needy, independent schools, which are the great beneficiaries of this legislation—the Aboriginal community controlled schools, the new low fee schools that are coming into existence as the result of our abolition of the Labor Party's union generated attempt to deprive lower income families of educational choice—all strongly support this legislation. They do not believe the rubbish coming from the Labor Party about how this bill is particularly favourable to schools serving high income communities. They know that it is not. They know that schools serving the highest income communities are only funded at between 13.7 and 30 per cent or thereabouts of the amount that they would get if parents sent their children to government schools. This is not legislation which favours the well-to-do; this is legislation which gives the biggest increases, the most money, in the non-government sector to the schools serving the neediest families. What could possibly justify the Labor Party conducting a debate against this bill by focusing on the aggregate funding given to about half a dozen very large schools out of the 10,000 schools in Australia, out of the almost 3,000 schools in the non-government sector?
The Labor Party treats the public with such contempt that it thinks that it does not have to answer any of these arguments. You will never hear them answered by the Labor Party spokespeople when they get to their feet to speak in this debate; they will never be answered. All they will ever talk about is the half a dozen schools that they think they can misrepresent the funding situation of and gain some credibility. I can tell the shadow minister for education and the Labor Party that they have destroyed their credibility with the whole of the non-government sector. When the Prime Minister visited an Islamic school in Sydney only a couple of weeks ago, he was hailed by the parents at the school because he had put in place a funding system. That school would not exist if it were not for the policies of this government, and the parents at that school know that.
Nobody believes the Labor Party, except its union mates for whom this whole argument is mounted. This is not an argument about school funding—the Labor Party has no policy on school funding; this is an argument about internal Labor Party politics. The Labor Party is prepared to sacrifice Australian schools and their certainty of funding and is prepared to treat any participant in this debate with contempt by ignoring their arguments. All it is there to do is to generate this support and, in the end, it has got itself into a situation where it is doubtful whether it can even do that. If it had come up with an education policy over the last three years, it might have some credibility and some respect. There is no mystery about this legislation: this legislation is based on public reports and extensive consultation throughout the Australian schools sector. It has been coming down the track for three years, and the Labor Party has never once attempted to develop a policy to provide some credibility for itself in the public domain.
We have people such as Peter Crimmins, the Executive Officer of the Australian Association of Christian Schools, saying, on the basis of this bill, `choice in schooling is now a reality for working-class families'. Although it may seem paradoxical to say so, in the end that is what the Labor Party does not like. The Australian Education Union does not want working-class families to have choice. It wants them to be locked into the government school sector regardless of whether they think that is the sector which best serves their children. When in office, the Labor Party did its bidding—it did precisely that and tried to lock the gate. What the Labor Party and the Australian Education Union really hate is that we have opened the gate to choice and we have said to the government schools and to the non-government schools, `You be accountable for your performance; you show what you can deliver and you attract the parents.' We are doing everything possible to help the government schools become more attractive to parents through our literacy and numeracy policies, our open and transparent accountability and our vocational education for the 70 per cent of students who do not go to university direct from school, which is pumping up retention rates within the government sector. We are doing everything possible to make school attractive to parents, but the Labor Party does not like that, so it opposes this bill. The Labor Party should stop the humbug: it should give schools the certainty and the funding they need for 2001; it should stop this disgraceful exploitation of Australian schoolchildren and parents for its own shallow political purposes; and it should deliver what government and non-government schools have wanted for a long time.

"Lee, Michael, MP",ALP,2000-12-05,"—On behalf of the opposition, I indicate that we will be opposing the motion moved by the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs. Mr Speaker, without wanting in any way to reflect on the statement that you have made, we cannot under any circumstances give effect to the position the minister has outlined, particularly in paragraph 1(c) of his motion. That paragraph, if carried, would indicate that this House, in the words of the minister `declines to consider further the requested amendments which the Senate has purported to press further'.
During this debate, this minister has accused the opposition of having `precious little respect for the Constitution of Australia'. This from the party that blocked supply in 1975; this from the party that ruthlessly used its numbers in the Senate during the 13 years that Labor was in office; this from the man who worked for Malcolm Fraser both in government and in opposition. He accuses us of having precious little respect for the Constitution of Australia, and he moves a motion saying that the government refuses to consider amendments that have been moved by the Senate. His party is allowed to block the budget; our party is not allowed to move a motion increasing funding for special education for kids with disabilities by $145 million. That is how this minister bases his claim that we have `precious little respect for the Constitution of Australia'. He can block the budget in 1975; we cannot increase funding for special education by $145 million. The arguments that have been put here this afternoon are just a joke.
The minister also claimed during his contribution that the government has provided 12 hours of debate in this House for the schools funding legislation. He forgot to mention that we have not had 12 hours of debate in this House since he released the detailed funding figures for each of the schools. We have not had 12 hours of debate in this House since this minister was forced to reveal how much each non-government school was getting as a result of this bill. In May 1999 this minister announced that funding was to be changed for non-government schools. It was a further 416 days before the minister got off his hands and bothered to introduce the legislation to this House. It was a further three months—a total of 507 days after the government made the announcement—before the figures were released; before he told us how much funding was going into each of the non-government schools. The minister claims that this has been `coming down the track for three years'. It is like a railway crossing: the arms are down, the bells are ringing, the lights are flashing—they were flashing for 507 days. We did not get the figures to work out how much extra was going to each of the non-government schools until 507 days after the arms dropped, the lights started flashing and the bells started ringing.
The truth is that the only reason we found out about how much extra money was going to each of these category 1 schools was that the opposition day after day were asking questions in this House, and the opposition day after day adjourned and extended the time that was allowed for the Senate committee to consider this legislation. It was our actions that forced this minister to release the information on how much extra was going to each of these non-government schools. We were not surprised that he chose to release the information three days before the Sydney Olympics ended, when everyone's attention was diverted elsewhere. We were not surprised, for example, that the government were not prepared to bring this debate on yesterday when it was a broadcast day for this House but chose to bring it on on a non-broadcast day. The reason the government are running scared on this debate is that those on their backbench—and I am sure many of those on their frontbench—are embarrassed about the way the extra funding is distributed to non-government schools through this legislation. 
Let me make a few comments about this legislation. First of all, the minister has on many occasions claimed that the previous formula—the ERI formula—has failed and is flawed, and that his new system, the socioeconomic status index—the SES index—is in his words `open and transparent'. The basic problem the minister has with that argument is that his new system uses the old ERI formula to determine the funding level for 70 per cent of non-government schools including all of the Catholic systemic schools. The 272 other non-government schools that otherwise would have been worse off under the new formula have had their funding maintained at their current level, which is determined by ERI. Minister, you might turn your back on me and you might turn around every now and then to interject, but you cannot deny the fact that the formula that you say has failed and is discredited determines the funding level for 70 per cent of non-government schools.
The only way the minister could get his new funding system up was to guarantee that the ERI category 11 funding for systemic schools would be maintained and indexed by AGSRC in real terms. The only way he could get the 272 non-government schools that would have been worse off under this formula to support his legislation was if he agreed to keep them funded at their current level, indexed by AGSRC. The point we make is that if his new system is so good why is it that 70 per cent of non-government schools have their funding levels determined by the old ERI formula?
When the legislation was finally introduced and the true details of the extra funding for each school were finally announced, we moved amendments to make the bill fairer. Our opportunity came in the Senate, given that the legislation had been rammed through this House without us having a fair opportunity to discuss it.
—The minister interjects and says that we had 12 hours. Minister, you know as well as we do that, since the funding details for each school have been released, until today the Labor Party has had a grand total of 25 minutes to discuss a bill that spends $22 billion. It is hardly enough time to allow legislation of this importance to be dealt with in a proper way. We have fought for our amendments and we will continue to fight for them for as long as we can. The reason we will do that is that we believe that our amendments—and I will say more about them in a minute—make this bill fairer. But we recognise that we cannot block the whole bill because that would be the education equivalent of blocking supply—and we are not the only people who subscribe to that view. Senator Lyn Allison, the Democrat spokesman on education matters, told the Senate inquiry back in August, `This legislation clearly needs to be passed, given that it is a money bill.' Whatever she says today, Senator Lyn Allison, even back in August, said that the bill clearly needs to be passed. It clearly needs to be passed because it contains all federal funding for all government and all non-government schools for the next four years.
The Labor Party has used every weapon in its armoury to increase community pressure on the government to accept our amendments. The reason we argue this bill is unfair is that it gives $700 million extra to private schools but no matching increase to public schools, which educate 70 per cent of Australian children. It is even unfair in the way it distributes the funding increases among the private schools. Our platform makes it clear that we believe all Australian schools—government and non-government—should be funded on the basis of need, taking into account the various learning capabilities of children and the socioeconomic disadvantage of the regions they live in. 
The new school funding bill does not meet this needs based principle. It gives an extra $145 million over four years to the 61 wealthy category 1 private schools, such as Geelong Grammar in Victoria, St Peters College in South Australia and the Kings School in New South Wales. By contrast, it gives real increases in funding to state schools of only $4,000 per school. In the debate the minister repeated his misleading claim that this bill contains an increase in funding for government schools of 21 per cent—increases which, he says, total $1.4 million. His own department has admitted that, once you discount that for inflation, once you discount that for changes in school enrolments, the average increase for government schools is $4,000 per school.
So to address this gross unfairness, we have moved three amendments to the bill. Our first amendment seeks to abolish the Howard government's unfair enrolment benchmark adjustment. The EBA has already taken $60 million away from government schools in the last four years, even though they have an extra 26,000 students at government schools throughout the country. Our amendment abolishes the EBA and reinvests this money in government schools. Our second amendment keeps the 61 category 1 schools at their current level of funding—that is, we treat them the same way as 70 per cent of other non-government schools, all of the Catholic systemic schools and the 272 non-government schools that would have been worse off under the new SES scheme. Our third amendment increases the funding for special education by the same amount—that is, by $145 million. Our amendment would have quadrupled the special education payment for special education students in government schools and doubled it for those students in non-government schools. 
The government has indicated that it will not accept our amendments. We have had the bill before this House on three occasions, and we have indicated that we will keep trying to amend the bill during the current parliamentary session to put maximum community pressure on the government to accept those amendments. Unfortunately, if the government refuses to back down, we acknowledge that the bill must pass the parliament before the end of the year because it contains not only the new funding formula for non-government schools but all Commonwealth funding for all schools—government and non-government—for the next four years. If it does not pass, there would be no Commonwealth funding for any schools for the start of the school year. To block this bill would be the education equivalent of blocking supply. As a result, many schools would start the new school year with insufficient funds to pay teacher salaries, electricity bills and administration costs. To those people who were so upset about this legislation that they wanted us to block the bill, I ask them to consider not just the Catholic systemic schools that perhaps could get through to Easter, and not just the Lutheran and Anglican schools that might get through to March; what about the Montessori schools, the Steiner schools and the Aboriginal community schools that do not have any money behind them and that would, if this bill were blocked, be unable to open in the new school year and not be able to pay their teachers? They are the schools we also have to consider. So those non-government schools that are poorer and also the government schools that would be worse off because this bill allocates 12 per cent of total funding for government schools also need to be considered. Instead of getting on with the job of educating our kids, schools would be worrying about how they could make ends meet. 
By refusing to accept Labor's amendments, the government is saying in effect, `Give us the money for the 61 wealthiest category 1 schools or we will cut off the flow of Commonwealth money for all schools.' The opposition wants to make this school funding system fairer, but we will not risk a national education crisis to do it. We understand the anger that this unfair funding proposal has raised in the community, especially for parents and teachers at government schools, but many people are concerned that, if the legislation passes, it can never be changed. If we are not able to amend this bill before the end of the year, as far as Labor is concerned that is not the end of the matter. These three amendments are not just amendments for a Senate debate; they are policy for a Labor government. Our amendments reflect Labor policy. We want the government to accept our amendments now, but if they do not we will take them to the Australian people next year and one of the first acts of a Beazley Labor government will be to introduce these amendments to abolish the enrolment benchmark adjustment and to keep the category 1 schools at their current level of funding. 
The government should accept these amendments. It is an outrage that this minister and this government are seeking to move a motion that the House not even consider the amendments that have been moved in the Senate. We believe that our amendments make this bill much fairer. By abolishing the enrolment benchmark adjustment, by keeping the category 1 schools at their current level of funding and by increasing special education funding, we will make more than 100,000 Australian students much better off. If we are to ensure that Australia becomes a knowledge nation, we need to ensure that there is a balancing increase in funding for public schools to match the $700 million extra that this bill delivers to non-government schools. It will only be by ending the Howard government's bias against public education and it will only be by ending the declining percentage level of funding to public schools that we can address these concerns that we have raised and that we will continue to raise both in the Senate and in the broader community not just up until the end of this year but every day, day after day, as we seek to deliver a fairer level of funding for Australian schools, government and non-government, right throughout this country.

"Ellis, Annette, MP",ALP,2000-12-05,"—I am extremely grateful to have even just five minutes to speak about the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2000, particularly as it is the third attempt I have made to speak on this legislation in this House. On the two previous occasions, the government have moved a gag and I have been unable to contribute. I am extremely concerned—very, very seriously concerned—about the implications of this bill. One of the greatest injustices that we risk in the future should the government remain steadfast in their refusal to accept our amendments, and therefore the bill would pass through very much against the grain from our point of view, would be to hear the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs or any representative of the government represent that vote as support from this side of the House for their actions within this bill. They have been known to do that in the past on other bills, and I would deplore such misleading behaviour on their part in the future should they do so.
One of my major concerns in relation to this piece of legislation is the government's refusal to accept our amendments as they would affect special needs children in our education system. There is no doubt at all from the evidence that I have within my community and communities around the country that the funding that is going to those 61 elite schools would be very well spent in the area of special need. I have a school in my electorate which currently runs an autism specific learning support unit with enormous success; it is in fact turning around the lives of children and families who have access to it. That very unit is under threat in the school year coming because of their inability to get an absolute guarantee that the staffing levels required for that unit will be supplied. That is the very thing that this money should be going to.
I have a family who live not very far from me in my electorate with a child of 13 years of age. She is a Down syndrome girl and has been going to a special unit in a primary school in a semi-integrated fashion, again, with enormous success. She is now of the age where she can progress, one would like to think, to secondary school. The problem is that the family is under unbelievable pressure to find a place for her other than within a special school. I have my fingers crossed, as do that family, that that place will be found, but they should not have to go through what they are going through to find a place for her. There should be a guarantee that that special need requirement is met through the education processes. It is absolutely unfair and inequitable and something that I would deplore this government for in terms of this legislation. 
A third point I want to make very quickly is in relation to a non-government school. We have a non-government school here in Canberra called the Blue Gum School. I am fairly familiar with this school and have met with the principal of the school—as, I believe, have staff members of the minister's office. I understand that this school will be forced to become a high fee, elite school and not a low income open access private school as it is, if in fact the government's policy in relation to funding for non-government schools as it affects the ACT is retained. This school is in fact a low fee non-government school of a fairly unique nature and should in fact be supported—as I know I do and we do on this side of the House. But this school is receiving approximately half of the funding of similar schools around it and, to add insult to injury, I understand that DETYA refuses to tell the school the exact funding they will receive until after term 1 starts next year. How chaotic could one system become?
I and we on this side have absolutely no objection to funding going into non-government schools—none whatsoever. My position is very strong on this, as is ours: that is, funding ought to be going into the education system, government or non-government, on a basis of absolute need and not on a basis of the skewed formula that this minister is standing behind. I absolutely deplore the money that is going into those 61 elite schools while I know that there are genuine needs in other levels around our country and in my electorate that ought to be serviced.",REPS,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Andren, Peter, MP",IND,2000-12-05,"—I cannot support this motion, because I believe the Senate request is indeed very reasonable. What these amendments seek to do is to use the extra funding, which the government proposed SES model will give to the 61 category 1 schools under the education resources index—some $145 million over four years—and give that money to students with disabilities in both the government and non-government sector.
If the opposition were serious about opposing the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2000 in the absence of substantial amendments, I could believe this was something more than a stunt. When the bill that these requests seek to amend came before this place in September, I outlined in detail the reasons I was opposed to it as it then stood. At that point I could not support the bill's passage, because I considered there were major problems with the socioeconomic status formula as a method for calculating non-government schools funding. I considered the SES formula inherently flawed on any objective test of equity. That is not to say I thought the education resources index was not without its problems and inconsistencies, but I could see ways of amending the proposed bill to make it a fairer way of allocating funding.
The SES model at the heart of the bill that this request seeks to amend proposes to assess non-government schools funding on the basis of the relative socioeconomic status of the communities from which schools draw. The problem is that it will do this not by any assessment of the families with children actually attending the school but by an assessment of the relative overall affluence of the census collection districts from which each school draws. That might be fine, if everyone in a given area happens to have the same relative wealth, but clearly that does not always happen, especially in rural areas such as those which I represent. Students attending a school might live in an area with a very low socioeconomic status score but come from a very affluent family, a family in the top five per cent or higher of families in that area. Yet a school drawing students from families all living in low socioeconomic areas will get a massive funding boost.
I note the repeated quoting by the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs of people such as the Reverend Tom Doyle, Deputy Chair of the National Catholic Education Commission. How many times have these words been quoted in the House:
... it is a very good and equitable package ... The new system is fair, open to scrutiny, yet doesn't drain resources away from government schools. In a caring and democratic Australia, it is vital that we recognise everyone's right to choice. 
Given that the proposed SES model will not even apply to schools in the Catholic system, at least in this quadrennium, one really has to wonder what relevance or weight such statements of support can have. More to the point, one has to ask: if the proposed system is so good, why will it not apply to Reverend Doyle's Catholic schools? And why did the Catholic system fight so hard to stay outside the SES net?
Today I received a letter from Blayney Public School in my electorate, a letter similar to many I have received in recent times. Tracey Nelson, who is the secretary of the Blayney Public School Parent Club, writes:
Blayney Public School provides quality educational experience for members of a diverse community. As parents, we endorse the inclusive nature of our school and support the Principal and Staff in their endeavours to meet the varied needs of all the children within our community.
We believe the values of tolerance and equality are the foundation stone of our Australian democracy. These are the very values fostered by public education.
	...	...	...
Under the new funding, three nearby schools, Kinross Wolaroi—
which, incidentally, my two boys went to—
All Saints College and the Orange Christian School will receive a staggering $4,039,422.00 just in 2001. How much will Blayney Public School receive?
I realise that they are subject to state funding arrangements essentially, but she makes the point of an injection of a significant amount of money into the independent schools sector in that area next year while Blayney Public School, like many in country areas, is struggling to provide any sort of additional resources from a parent base which is certainly not affluent by any means. She goes on to mention some other points:
As parents we want the best education for our children. Both these ideals are best served by a well funded public education system.
I must point out, as I did, that Blayney Public School is largely funded, first and foremost, by the state system—which the independent system is not. However, a fundamental flaw in the SES model is that it does not reflect the actual income of the households from which its students are drawn. That is why when the bill was before this place I argued that what was needed was a second-tier test that looked at the proportion of a school's students in receipt of youth allowance. The youth allowance, with the actual means test, now gives an accurate picture of an individual's family income. The same test should have had some bearing in determining a non-government school's funding. A school with proportionately fewer students on youth allowance in the communities from which it draws should not be allowed additional funding until its student population accurately reflects the population of the broader community from which it draws.
—Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The honourable member for Calare may not be aware of the arrangement between the government and the opposition that, following the speeches by the minister and the shadow minister, honourable members will speak for five minutes. I ask him to consider that arrangement with regard to the length of his speech.
—The Chief Government Whip will resume his seat. The member for Calare has the call.
—I will certainly try to draw my speech to a close as quickly as I can. After making such a song and dance about this bill in this and the other place for the last three months, I cannot believe the Labor Party has gone to the bargaining table, saying to the government, `We'd like you to make some amendments to your bill but, if you do not like them, don't worry because we'll pass it for you by the end of the year anyway.' The question I know that many parents, ALP, coalition and independent voters are asking is: what sort of a bargaining position is that? ALP voters are saying, `Why did the party I voted for show its hand so early?' It makes the amendments a hollow gesture. Why did Labor members not hold their position and not show their cards in the hope that the government would come to the bargaining table? It makes the rhetoric that we have heard in this place in recent months—question after question, MPIs and whatever—all puff and bluster. 
I sacrificed $100,000 plus of after tax income to send my two boys to an independent school—Kinross Wolaroi, in fact—after a state school early primary education. I have said in the House before that I come from a family of state school teachers, but I saw opportunities in the independent school system that were about positive peer pressure and opportunities in sport and other activities that I thought were very valuable. I was prepared to pay for that. I appreciate the minister's point about the enormous strain that the 25 per cent of Catholic schools and the 15 per cent or more of independents would place on the system if they were to close their doors tomorrow. But I am convinced that, without the application of a means test—such as the youth allowance—this bill provides assistance to the richer portion of the independent sector to the cost of equality of education. That is why I will not support the motion and why I will certainly scrutinise the bill when it returns to this place—if, in fact, it does—to make sure that it is amended.",REPS,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"O'Connor, Gavan, MP",ALP,2000-12-05,"—The States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2000 that we are debating incorporates  amendments that have been passed and supported by Labor and the minor parties in the Senate. They attempt to inject some equity into the government's current funding arrangements. The amended legislation from the Senate allocates an additional $145 million over four years for special education purposes.
In its original form, the bill contained a modest increase in funding for students with disabilities in non-government schools but did not increase the overall level of funding for those students in government schools. We are considering an amended bill from the Senate that relates specifically to an area of urgent educational need in our communities. Children with disabilities—whether they attend government or non-government schools—deserve the maximum opportunities that our educational system can provide to develop their individual talents and take their place as productive members of our society. Such aspirations are no different from those of any other Australian. Indeed, the parents and relatives of children with disabilities share a passionate desire to give their children the opportunity to obtain a quality education and take their place fully as productive members of society.
The opposition has proposed that students with special educational needs be funded to the extent of $145 million over four years and that those resources should come from the largess that the government intends to dole out to Australia's most wealthy schools. Indeed, under the government's new funding formula, category 1 schools in my electorate of Corio—Geelong College and Geelong Grammar, which have been the subject of debate in this House on several occasions in the context of this bill—will receive an extra $4.18 million.
I challenge the member for Corangamite, who shares my interest in schools in the Geelong region, to support the allocation of this $4.18 million to meet the special educational needs of students with disabilities in both public and private schools in the Geelong region. Is the member for Corangamite going to stand up in this House and support our amendments and this amended bill that will see a substantial amount of money reallocated from Geelong College and Geelong Grammar to hard-pressed government and non-government schools in the Geelong area? I know that the member for Corangamite was educated at Geelong College, but I ask him today to put aside his old school tie and his loyalty to his alma mater and support the opposition's amendments that will see more than $4 million that is currently earmarked to go to Geelong Grammar and to Geelong College reallocated to meet the needs of students with special disabilities and special disadvantages in other Geelong schools.
The charge is often made against the opposition in debates such as this that we do not have policy in the public arena for debate and scrutiny. I say this to the electors of Corio and to the House: we have released several policy propositions related to education that I think my electors will find very attractive. We have given a commitment that we will abolish the enrolment benchmark adjustment that has penalised government schools in my area in particular. We are going to keep category 1 schools at their present funding levels and we will take from those schools $145 million over four years and reallocate it to meet the special educational needs of young people with disabilities. We have outlined a policy of education priority zones. I know that many schools in the electorate of Corio would receive special consideration from the new Labor minister for education because many of them are experiencing severe educational disadvantage.  
We have indicated that we will allocate more funds for teachers' professional development to help them to perform their educating task in a most professional way for the benefit of students of the Corio electorate and throughout Australia. I urge the House to support the amendments that have been passed by the Senate. They are sensible amendments and they should be considered very favourably by this House.

"Horne, Bob, MP",ALP,2000-12-05,"—I rise to support the amendments and to oppose the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2000. This is a shameful piece of legislation, by a shameless minister—a practice in elitism, put forward by an elitist government. We have a minister here who comes forward and talks about choice—and that statement alone shows just how much out of touch he is with education in rural and regional Australia. Only last week we had the Prime Minister visiting flood-torn north-western New South Wales, saying that he realised now how glad he was that additional funding was going to King's School because the students of that area who were going to King's School would benefit from it. I wonder whether he talked about the schools at Gunnedah, at Narrabri, at Wee Waa, in Tamworth itself and all the families there that were directly affected by flood? The majority of kids in those communities go to the local schools. They do not go off to the elitist schools that this government is pandering to.
In my own electorate of Paterson, the people that I represent do not have a single secondary private school where they can send their kids. Talk about choice! I would invite the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs to listen to this. I can tell him that for kids from families in towns like Dungog and Gloucester, where there is only a single secondary state run school, where they probably have reduced face-to-face teaching, where they probably have reduced subject choices, there will never be a private secondary school to go to—and nor should there be. I say that there should not be, because it would fragment educational resources and it would reduce the educational opportunities of those kids even more.
But we have a minister with the audacity to come in here and talk about choice. What is the choice of the parents of these kids? There will be no choice. They will have to send their children to a local school that will be robbed of funds because of the EBA. Most rural towns, particularly coastal rural towns where there is a significant dairying industry, are declining now because of other policies by this same government. Enrolments will drop and funds will be taken away because of this ridiculous EBA. Again, as I say, that indicates that this minister is not even remotely aware of what is happening in mainstream schools throughout Australia.
I come in here and get insulted by this minister all the time. I do not mind admitting that I am a career teacher. I taught in the public system and I am a member of the teachers union, and I am proud of it. I am proud of the fact that I also sent my children to a public school. They were educated completely in public schools and they got access to the university courses at the best universities that Australia has to offer. I know what public education can do. Unfortunately, the minister in this government today is not aware of that at all. He believes that the only quality education comes from elitist schools—and he continues to put teachers down and to drive down the morale of teachers, denigrating perhaps the noblest profession of the lot. 
I will give you an example of an experience that I had during the Paralympics. Everyone knows that the Olympic Games and the Paralympics were two wonderful events that all Australia is proud of. I went to visit the Paralympics on one day because last year's school captain of Bulahdelah Central School, Heath Francis, was running. He won two gold medals and a silver medal. Heath Francis is the boy who came here and addressed parliamentarians at Old Parliament House—a product entirely of public education, a school captain in a central school at Bulahdelah. They are the sorts of schools that this minister is working against. But while I was there I noticed that there were a lot of schoolkids watching the Paralympics and being given the opportunity to experience a great event. They were from private schools and they were from public schools, too.
But who had taken these kids there? Who had accepted the responsibility for taking these kids to that wonderful event for a great excursion? The teachers of Australia had done that. The sorts of people that this minister takes great pride in coming into this House to denigrate repeatedly had accepted the responsibility—leaving home before sunrise, getting home after dark—of making sure that all those kids in that strange environment were cared for, were fed, got to the toilets and were not lost. They are the sorts of people that this minister wants to put down—and this legislation indicates just how out of touch he is with mainstream education in Australia.
Question put:
That the motion (Dr Kemp's) be agreed to.",REPS,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"SPEAKER, Mr",N/A,2000-12-05,"—It is my duty as Speaker to draw to the attention of the House the constitutional question this message involves. When similar circumstances have arisen in the past—including the recent case of the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2000—successive Speakers have advised the House of the constitutional principles involved, and the House has invariably endorsed their statements. 
The message purports to repeat the request for an amendment contained in message No. 491, which the House rejected at its sitting on 29 November 2000. The House of Representatives has never accepted that the Senate has a right to repeat and thereby press or insist on a request for an amendment in a bill which the Senate may not amend.
It is a matter of constitutional propriety as between the Houses based on the provisions of sections 53 to 57 of the Constitution. Legal opinions supporting the argument that the Constitution does not empower the Senate to press a request have been advanced by Quick and Garran, who were intimately involved in the development of the Constitution, and by eminent constitutional lawyers, past and present. Respectfully, I agree with the opinions but do not propose to repeat the arguments which are summarised in House of Representatives Practice. It rests with the House as to whether it will consider message No. 507 insofar as it purports to press the requests that were contained in message No. 491.
Motion (by Mr Bruce Scott) agreed to:
That:
(1)	the House endorses the statement of the Speaker in relation to the constitutional questions raised by Message No. 507 transmitted by the Senate in relation to the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 2000;

(3)	the message be considered forthwith.",REPS,<title>VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Scott, Bruce, MP",NP,2000-12-05,"—I move:
That the requested amendment which the Senate has purported to press be not made.
Once again, the House is being asked to give way to an amendment that would undermine the integrity of the repatriation system and the special benefits that are provided in recognition of those Australians who have risked, and were prepared to risk, their lives in the service of our country. Once again, the House is being asked to make a special case for the group of civilian aid workers, medical teams, who were part of a 15-nation civilian aid program to South Vietnam and who are currently not eligible for veterans' benefits for the simple reason that they are not veterans. Most unfortunately, important legislation that will provide full repatriation benefits for more than 2,600 veterans, who have waited something like 45 years to be recognised for their service in South-East Asia, and that will also strengthen the support available to Vietnam veterans and their children has again been delayed because of the refusal of the opposition and the Australian Democrats to accept that this is not a veterans issue.
In the other house, Senator Bartlett has said that it is up to the government to justify why this group should not be eligible for repatriation benefits. Let me answer that the justification is there in the letter of the law and the intent of the law as spelt out in the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The SEATO medical teams are not veterans. They were employed by the Department of External Affairs to work as civilians, providing aid to South Vietnam's civilian hospitals. They were not part of the military forces. Some of these nurses have claimed that they were integrated with the Australian Defence Force. I have said repeatedly in this House, out on radio and in the media that any civilian who can provide evidence that they served in a conflict under direct military command will have their claim considered.
So far, the only evidence provided has been anecdotal evidence to the Mohr review. Since the release of that report and the government's response, there has been widespread debate and discussion about the case of the civilian nurses, but no evidence—I repeat, no evidence—that they were integrated with the Australian military effort in Vietnam. In the end, the argument comes down to the awarding of the Australian Active Service Medal. The fact is that the SEATO medical teams as well as the nurses were awarded the Vietnam Logistic Support Medal as a result of the 1993-94 committee of inquiry into defence and defence related awards. That inquiry recommended the awarding of the VLSM to a number of civilians because, to quote the inquiry, `they could be seen to have been in Vietnam in some capacity recognised by the Australian government and subject to some degree of government jurisdiction'. The Australian Active Service Medal 1945-75 was subsequently extended to all recipients of the VLSM. This does not mean that their employment was recognised as military service. Also, there is no link between medal entitlements and the repatriation benefits. There should not be a link. In fact, the very first recommendation of Mr Justice Mohr's report was that `a policy be clearly laid down to ensure that the recommendation for the award of a campaign medal and the subsequent award of such a medal does not carry with it any entitlement to repatriation benefits'. The government agrees completely with this. It is unfortunate that the latter recommendation with regard to the civilian nurses was not consistent with that overriding principle. 
But the most important question here is whether the civilian nurses should be entitled to compensation cover for their time in Vietnam. The answer, as the government has consistently stated, is yes. (Extension of time granted) The nurses should be able to access appropriate compensation for any injuries or disabilities caused by their employment in Vietnam. That compensation under the Commonwealth compensation legislation has been available to them from the day they returned from Vietnam. It is still available through Comcare. As I advised the House last week, only nine claims have been received from members of the medical and surgical teams and eight of those claims have been successful. The nurses' case cannot be considered a pressing issue. There have not been any further claims on Comcare since this matter was widely publicised. In addition, they are not pressing for an early meeting with me. I have offered on a number of occasions to meet with them to discuss the issue and assist in any way that my office can help them if they believe that they served at any stage under military command. I can now advise that the nurses' representatives have taken up my invitation and they have asked to meet with me, but not until the new year. I certainly look forward to this opportunity to discuss how the nurses' cause can be appropriately addressed. But what is pressing is the delivery of essential services to the veteran community to address the alarming findings of the Vietnam Veterans Health Study. The opposition and the Australian Democrats should not be trying to address these issues by undermining the integrity of the repatriation system, and they most certainly should not be pursuing this cause at the expense of additional benefits for the veteran community that are being delayed by this debate. As I have said before, the government cannot and will not accept these amendments.",REPS,<title>VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Edwards, Graham, MP",ALP,2000-12-05,"—I must say I find the government's position rather disappointing. I want to try to put this debate into context, and in doing that I want to refer to one of most famous Australians I have ever known and a man for whom I had an immense admiration, a fellow well known by the name of Weary Dunlop. A book written by Sue Ebury, The Life of Sir Edward (Weary) Dunlop, goes into some detail on when he was in Vietnam as a civilian leader of a medical team. Of course, Weary Dunlop had already established his credentials as an ex-serviceman. He already had his qualifying service, and that is not an issue here. I want to draw to the attention of the House some of the things that these medical teams had to do. Weary Dunlop arrived in Vietnam in 1969, and this is where he went. I quote from the book: 
Bien Hoa was a grubby town in the delta and the civilian hospital was in its centre. The Australians occupied part of the `exceedingly squalid' buildings, in which the beds were packed so close together in the concrete floored wards, one could scarcely move between them. The grounds were drab and badly drained, the water supply and the sewerage system inadequate. 
The team was housed in the heavily guarded residence as dreary and lacking in amenities as the hospital;
The book goes on to talk about some of the work that they did:
Casualties came in from all over the country. As well as cancers, abscesses and infections and `every sort of surgical problem to be solved' they dealt with a stream of injured civilians suffering from multiple fractures and head injuries from traffic accidents or grave, septic wounds inflicted by bombs and exploding mines.
Weary discovered captured Viet Cong, some of them paraplegic, others with phosphorus wounds, dumped on the concrete floor of an outhouse. After `an appalling row' about this with the Vietnamese Army administration, he admitted them to the Australian wards. Under protest, they sent soldiers `with fixed bayonets' to sit by the beds. But when Weary asked his Vietnamese nurses to attend to the VCs—many of whom were very young boys—they refused. Nursing devolved on the Australian staff. It was a battle he could not win.
There is a story later in the book where Weary, because of a previous experience, wanted to get a young lad back to his village when the young lad was dying. The book describes:
... he put a badly injured young boy, afraid of dying in hospital, in the jeep and drove him back to his village. He knew it was `very dangerous' and an ambush by the Viet Cong was a `distinct possibility' on the dark dirt road, but his desire to still the boy's misery and terror eclipsed his own fear of capture.
Weary found his months in `the awful tragedy' of Vietnam `very moving'.
It goes on to say:
... insufficient acknowledgement was given to the sacrifices many team members made in volunteering for service on their country's behalf. Whereas Casey had briefed and debriefed senior technical advisors to the Colombo Plan personally, the present Minister did not seem so interested.
It is a bit sad that, after all of those years, not much has changed. I raise that here because I am sure that much of the work that Weary Dunlop did was typical of much of the work that many members of the civilian surgical team did. It is true to say—and there will not be a digger who will deny this statement—that many of our civilian medical teams were exposed to far greater danger than some of the soldiers who served in Vietnam who were posted to rear echelon and relatively safe areas, and that is a fact.
I have corresponded with veteran groups. (Extension of time granted) I have had veteran groups approach me, asking me to give support to the civilian nurses. They are the Vietnam Veterans Federation, the Vietnam Veterans Association and members of the RSL. They convinced me, over a period of time, that I as a veteran ought to give support to these civilian nurses for a whole range of reasons. It is ironic that the same veteran groups, after being contacted by the minister's office, are now saying: `We support the nurses and we support the medical teams but we need this legislation up. We need it through.' The minister has given these veteran groups the choice of supporting the nurses or supporting their own needs. The government does not support the nurses. The veteran groups need the legislation up and they are going to look at their priorities.
I do not know what is going to happen in the Senate, but I know that Chris Schacht, the ALP spokesperson on veterans' issues, is well versed in these issues. He has spoken to a lot of veteran groups and he is a fairly reasonable and sensible sort of person. I trust Chris Schacht and other senators to make the right decision in the best interests of the veteran community, given the context of this argument. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs can take little pride in his actions. When the government is reaping a massive windfall of revenue as a result of its taxing regime on fuel, it could easily accommodate the needs of the nurses and accept these amendments. Given the recommendations of the Mohr report and given the fact that the most relevant veteran community groups in our community—the Vietnam Veterans Federation and the Vietnam Veterans Association—both support the nurses, I am sorry that the government has not found itself able to do so.

"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2000-12-05,"—I am pleased to have the opportunity to add a few remarks on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 2000 and to support the comments of my colleague the member for Cowan. Like him, I have had a number of representations, particularly from veterans in my own electorate, about the need for the additional services that the government intends to make available as a result of this budget initiative. We certainly do support the increases in services that will come about as a result of these changes.
That said, I have had representations from particular veterans. One is Paul Adams from my electorate. Similar to a remark made by the member for Cowan, Paul Adams told me about a veteran in Queensland who needed not only the services that will be made available as a result of this legislation—assuming that the government at some point sees sense—but also other services to be made available to the children of Vietnam veterans in particular. He indicated to me the dire needs of a particular veteran in Queensland, who could not get a wheelchair for his son, aged 32, who has spina bifida. So it is disappointing that we are not able to resolve all of those issues as a result of this legislation. Nevertheless, we do support what the government is doing by extending the services that are going to be made available and we certainly look forward to the services being implemented for these veterans. There is no question that they are urgently needed. I reiterate: we do support them and we want to see them implemented. I just wanted to mention the representation that had been made to me. That said, we are very disappointed that the government will not agree to the amendments that have been made by the opposition parties in the Senate. 
I just want to respond to the remarks of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. He said that the reason the surgical medical teams cannot be compensated is that they are not members of the defence forces. These surgical medical teams were of course committed by the Australian government to South Vietnam between 1964 and 1972. There were about 450 individuals: nurses, doctors, radiographers and other medical personnel. As the member for Cowan said, many of these people found themselves in considerable danger and served in many circumstances in appalling conditions. I will not go through all of those; they have been discussed before. Many of them—and this is the critical point—are now suffering from many of the same illnesses and physical complaints that are confronting our Vietnam veterans. As I say, we are very pleased that the government is responding to the needs of Vietnam veterans. But we are trying to get the government to recognise that there were other people serving in appalling conditions as a result of Australian government commitments in South Vietnam who are now suffering very similar conditions, illnesses and physical complaints. Yet the government will not see clear to properly compensate these doctors and nurses in a way that would make sure they were properly looked after.
I do not intend to call a division here this evening, but I do want to make it plain and put it on the record that, although we do support what the government is doing for both Vietnam veterans and their children, we also want to continue to press the government here this evening to extend the support to the nurses, doctors and other medical professionals who gave an enormous amount of dedicated service, both to Australians and to other people in Vietnam, for so many years. I say to the government again that these people are not being properly looked after, after having given an enormous amount of dedicated service to our country.

"Scott, Bruce, MP",NP,2000-12-05,"—I would just like to add a couple of things. I do not want to trawl over the ground that we have covered a couple of times in this debate, but I do get disturbed when I hear from the opposition that these civilian medical teams and nurses are not getting the proper care and compensation that they deserve. I repeat that Comcare accepts conditions such as the psychological PTSD condition as being related to service and work in Vietnam. I do not want the message to be out there that those conditions are not accepted. I ask the opposition to make sure that we can work with these people, as I have said to the nurses and the civilian medical teams, to make sure that they are accessing their entitlements through Comcare. 
On the weekend, I spoke with the veteran groups. I spoke with members of the Vietnam Veterans Association and the Vietnam Veterans Federation of Australia. My office have also spoken with the RSL. The peak leadership of those three groups support the government's position in relation to the civilian surgical medical teams and the position that the government has taken. But let me assure the House once more that my office stands ready to help these nurses. If they can establish a case where they were under military command, they will be entitled to a veterans' entitlement. If they are not getting the proper support through Comcare, I need to know. I have said that repeatedly in the House and I have said it in the media. I want them to know through their associations and their friends that they do deserve to get the support of Comcare. I will make sure that my office facilities are available to help them get the adequate support and compensation that they deserve. I would not like to think that we are winding this debate up with an impression that they are not getting it. If they are not getting it, I want to know why they are not getting it through Comcare, and that is the issue we can address.",REPS,<title>VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Edwards, Graham, MP",ALP,2000-12-05,"—I just want to put a couple of things into context. First of all, the Vietnam Veterans Federation and the Vietnam Veterans Association both support the extension of the Veterans' Entitlements Act to cover these nurses. However, they are concerned that, if this bill is held up and if the government does not proceed with it, those benefits which everyone wants to see the Vietnam veteran community have, particularly in relation to the children, will not go through. So do not be at odds with the facts. The facts are that the peak Vietnam community organisations support the extension of the Veterans' Entitlements Act to cover nurses, as indeed do many people within the RSL. 
The other thing is that nurses have had many problems trying to access Comcare. My understanding is that one of the differences between the Veterans' Entitlements Act and Comcare is that Comcare benefits would cut out at 65. Of course, that is the age when this post-traumatic stress disorder will have really ravaged a number of people. It is the age when people most need care. That is my understanding, and it is for those reasons that the opposition is again disappointed that the government has chosen to treat this legislation the way that it has.",REPS,<title>VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,12,1,speech

"Scott, Bruce, MP",NP,2000-12-05,"—The issue is that income support under Comcare ceases at the age of 65. The medical treatment does not cease at the age of 65. The medical treatment continues beyond 65 but, at the age of 65, they would be entitled, like all other Australians, to an age pension. However, under Comcare there is provision in the compensation arrangements for lump sum compensation, which, obviously, you cannot get under a DVA entitlement. That is why they do differ: one is lump sum compensation as well as some income support, modification to the home and medical treatment. I can supply information to you on the differences in the two acts. One is more about a lump sum and then going on to an age pension, and with the other one compensation is payable as an annuity for life. There are two differences in them in that regard. But the treatment does not cease at age 65. I have got indications that that is the case from my advisers.

"Bishop, Bronwyn, MP",LP,2000-12-05,"—I move:
That the amendments be agreed to.
I want to make just a few points. Firstly, the government wishes the House to agree to the amendments to the Aged Care Amendment Bill 2000 that were passed in the Senate. The amendments made concern basically four points. The first amendment relates to the establishment of a panel of administrators and a panel of advisers and the reduction of the time frame for the nomination and appointment of administrators and advisers. The second amendment relates to the question of unsound mind, where it is now required that a medical practitioner certify that a person is mentally incapable of performing his or her duties as a member of the approved provider's key personnel. Amendments (3) and (4) require an amendment to the sanctions principles of the act to include steps which an approved provider needs to take with regard to ensuring key personnel are not disqualified persons.
With regard to the first amendment, I simply say that the government is very comfortable with the establishment of panels in a formal sense, as this is the informal way in which panels of hospital administrators and advisers have been collected together. The time frame which is now in place is that, within five days, the proposed appointment of a would-be administrator or adviser is to be referred to the department for their consideration. The opposition moved two days, but two days would indeed have had unintended consequences. With that tight time frame, if an appointment was not forthcoming in two days then automatically the approved provider's status would lapse, with the extreme likelihood that the facility would close and residents would need to be evacuated, when, with a more reasonable time of five working days, a better outcome could be arrived at. For that reason, the Democrats agreed with the government, and five days was the allotted time. The amendment also requires that there is one day after the approval of that person has been made by the department for the approved provider to appoint either the administrator or the adviser as the sanction requires.
As I said, the second amendment requires a medical practitioner to certify with regard to unsound mind. The third and fourth amendments relate to the requirement that key personnel shall be checked. The requirement for key personnel under the new legislation is that they shall not have been convicted of an indictable offence, not be of unsound mind and not be bankrupt. There will now be amendments made to the sanctions principles which will set out some of the steps that need to be followed by an approved provider to satisfy that provision. I commend the amendments to the House.",REPS,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2000-12-05,"—It is extraordinary that this bill, the Aged Care Amendment Bill 2000, is the first and only bill introduced by the government this year to attempt to fix up what I think every Australian would know to be an enormous range of problems facing our aged care system. Even so, since the bill was introduced there has been a pretty minimal response to that very wide community concern about the standards of care that exist in our nursing homes. As indicated in the debate that has gone on so far, unfortunately this bill will do nothing to alleviate the chronic shortage of nursing home beds that exists in many regions, it will do nothing to fix what many people know to be a flawed complaints system and it will not resolve the funding crisis that now is forcing many providers to compromise care standards. Unfortunately, what the bill does demonstrate is that the government has not learnt anything from its mistakes in aged care, a situation which has now gone on for four years. The bill is focused more on imposing financial penalties on substandard nursing homes, an approach that does nothing to improve resident care and can in fact contribute to the problem. The government is focused on financial penalties, and I think the contrast is very clear: Labor is focused on the care of residents. There are a number of examples of the government's failure to ensure that residents receive proper care. One of those, about which I have asked a number of questions here—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I am happy to respond to the point that the shadow minister is making, but in this debate we are supposed to be addressing, as I understand it, the actual amendments that have come back from the Senate, not readdressing the whole second reading debate that was engaged in at the time the bill was first amended. I am happy to respond to all those points, as I have done on many occasions before, but this is the place where we are supposed to be debating the amendments. 
 (Mr Quick)—I ask the honourable member for Jagajaga to come back to the amendments.
—The point about the amendments is that what the opposition have sought to do, and which the government is accepting, is put pressure on the government to change the way an administrator is appointed. The government wanted to have the length of time for the appointment of administrators to be up to 12 days. They gave no indication or rationale for the extension of the time frame to 12 days from our original much shorter time frame. The Minister for Aged Care, who is at the table, has just indicated that she has accepted that 12 days is too long and has brought the time frame back to five working days. That move has been supported by the Democrats. We still think it would have been better to have had a shorter period of time, and that is why I want to take a minute to go to the problems that exist in the system. 
The reason we want as short a time frame as possible is illustrated by the example of the Kenilworth nursing home in my electorate. The government has had report after report identifying problems in that nursing home. It has not at any time sought to put in an administrator, and has in fact left residents very much exposed in that nursing home. The care of the residents should be of the highest priority. It is not good enough to leave residents in accommodation that is not of the highest standard, as has been shown in report after report done by the government's own investigators. The delays have not done any good whatsoever for the residents of that nursing home or any others; we have certainly seen plenty of examples.
As I say, the government's response to our amendments has been, unfortunately, to attempt to water them down. They proposed extensions to the time frame for the appointment of an administrator from our three days to a possible 12 days. (Extension of time granted) The compromise that has been reached with the Democrats of five working days is certainly much better than the current four or even more weeks. The question to the minister still remains: why did it fall to Labor to introduce these amendments to fix up the government's flawed system? The government has had many years to introduce this improvement but it has taken until now. It has been left to the opposition to move these amendments to ensure that administrators are placed in nursing homes where substandard care has been found. They should be put in quickly; it should not take a considerable period of time. In her response, the minister might also like to explain what is going to happen to nursing homes that have currently failed accreditation and are facing a loss of Commonwealth funding in just a few short weeks. What we would like to know, particularly the families of nursing home residents, is: will exceptions be made to this deadline; if so, when will the required principles be tabled? The community is very anxious to know the answer to that question.",REPS,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Bishop, Bronwyn, MP",LP,2000-12-05,"—Very briefly, as I have said many times before in answer to the points the shadow minister made originally, the Auditor-General found that we had been left 10,000 places short. In the last two years I have issued 22,000 places to make up for the shortfall left by Labor not meeting its own benchmark and to make up for growth and dependency. 
Turning specifically to the amendments to the bill, the important thing about the bill is that it now gives the department two extra tools that it can use in ensuring that good care is given. With regard to accreditation, the system is working and is working well. We have seen something like 173 facilities close or relocate in the time that we have been implementing the accreditation system. We are seeing that the bad providers who were left there under Labor for years are simply being got rid of. The fact of the matter is that we are dealing with important residents, and by way of example all my focus will be on Kenilworth, which the shadow minister mentioned, a home that was registered for 30 residents. Over time we have seen 25 of them move. Sanctions have been put in place; we have daily teams and the advocacy group in there to look after these people. For the present time those people are happy to remain there, but we have people going in there to ensure that their care is foremost and is being delivered. I commend the amendments to the House; with the bill they will give the department additional tools.

In passing the Horticulture Marketing and Research and Development Services Bill 2000 last week, the opposition moved five amendments to the bill, which the government is agreeable to. These amendments relate to the tabling of documents in parliament concerning declarations, revocations and directions by the minister to the industry services body or export control body. The amendments to clauses 9 and 10 mean that in declaring a body to be, or cease to be, the industry services body or the export control body, in addition to the conditions listed in the original bill, the minister will also be required to provide to each house of parliament, or, if a house is not sitting, the Presiding Officers of the houses for the circulation to the members, a copy of each declaration within five sitting days after the declaration is made.
The amendment that has been made by the Senate to clause 29 effectively means that, where the minister gives a direction to the industry services body or to the industry export control body that is in the national interest because of exceptional or urgent circumstances, the minister causes a copy of the direction to be published in the Gazette as soon as practicable after giving the direction; and also to be tabled in each house of parliament within five sitting days of that house after giving the direction.

That amendments Nos 5, 6, 8 and 9 insisted by the Senate be agreed to.
For the sake of passing this bill so as to improve the protection provided to consumers of superannuation services, the government has reluctantly accepted some of the amendments of the Labor Party. These amendments will lower some penalties for trustees who do not comply with the legislated prudential requirements of the SI(S) Act. This decision has been reached after weighing the substantial benefits that will flow from the introduction of strict liability offences for noncompliance with the most fundamental obligations under the SI(S) Act. Strict liability will significantly increase the effectiveness of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority as the prudential regulator of superannuation.
Reluctantly the government must allow this bill to proceed with the changes insisted by the Labor Party on behalf of their mates in the superannuation industry. However, the point must be made that the ALP changes are against the best interests of superannuation beneficiaries. The same ALP superannuation mates are against the introduction of a choice of super for the workers, which is to the advantage of the industry but not to the consumer. It is important to remind the House that superannuation is designed to provide employees with a secure retirement income for their futures and that this money is entrusted to trustees to protect the workers until their retirement.
Superannuation does not exist solely as an alternative career choice for washed-out Labor Party or union officials. This government will put consumers in the protection of investors first every time, not just when it suits us. While the government would have preferred not to accept any of the amendments moved by the opposition and the Democrats in the Senate, we consider the overall bill will substantially increase the integrity of the financial services sector, especially those measures aimed at strengthening the prudential framework for superannuation. The measures in this bill will assist in maintaining Australia's position at the forefront of world's best practice in the regulation of the financial system. The passage of this bill serves to highlight once again how the Howard government governs for all of us and not just for one section of the community, like the Labor Party does.

That the bill be now read a second time.
This bill will make several minor amendments to the ACIS Administration Act 1999 which came into effect on 30 December 1999. The Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme, ACIS, will commence from 1 January 2001 and is scheduled to end on 31 December 2005. The scheme will encourage the development of internationally competitive firms in the Australian automotive industry through rewarding eligible production, strategic investment and research and development.
ACIS will provide capped benefits of $2 billion over the five years of the scheme. Benefits will be provided in the form of duty credits which can be used to offset customs duty on eligible automotive imports, or can be sold.
The administrative framework for delivering the scheme to the Australian automotive industry is now well developed, and the minor amendments set out in this bill will enable the efficient delivery of the program. The amendments will streamline the operation of the scheme and reduce the administrative burden on both participants and the government.
The main change to the act will be an increased capacity for regulations to define what is approved plant and equipment and approved research and development for the purposes of calculating benefits under the scheme. The regulations will be able to clarify exactly what is the maximum claimable value of investment in different kinds of plant and equipment and research and development. This will assist participants to determine what is and is not eligible expenditure, in what is largely a self-assessed scheme. 
The regulations will also be able to provide for investment loadings to cover all those incidental costs of investment which are extremely difficult to substantiate from a participant's point of view, and almost impossible to audit from an administrator's point of view. It is intended that these loadings will substitute for the labour costs of repairs and maintenance associated with investment in plant and equipment, and those low cost or short life items that are normally fully depreciated in the year of purchase.
The loadings will also substitute for overhead costs associated with research and development, removing the need for participants to substantiate and pro-rate costs where R&D activities occur in the same building as, for example, production activities.
As well as clarifying terms and phrases used in the legislation, this bill will also introduce provisions to protect the scheme from `artificial' companies set up to take advantage of ACIS, that are not going to contribute to the sustainable growth of the Australian automotive industry. This will permit the benefits of the $2 billion scheme to be directed at those firms that are working to improve their competitiveness.

"Lawrence, Dr Carmen, MP",ALP,2000-12-05,"—The ACIS Administration Act 1999, which the ACIS Administration Amendment Bill 2000 before us seeks to amend, was assented to on 3 November 1999, so it is not long ago that we had that original bill before us. The Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme, otherwise known as ACIS, provides for industry specific assistance to the automotive industry and will operate for five years from 1 January 2001. The scheme provides assistance in the form of import duty credits to producers of motor vehicles, components and automotive services for both domestic and export markets. The level of this assistance is capped by the legislation at $2 billion over the duration of the five-year program. The scheme will operate in two areas. Eligible applicants will earn import credits on the basis of, firstly, their production of motor vehicles, engines or engine components—motor producers only; and, secondly, their investment in certain plant and equipment and research and development.
The proposed amendments in this bill were described by Senator Ian Campbell in his second reading speech in the other place as minor amendments to enable the efficient delivery of the program and to reduce the administrative burden on both participants and the government. Labor is supportive of this general objective; however, we are mindful that changes to such schemes must not be made without due regard to the potential of such change to damage an industry or sector. The proposed administrative changes made by this bill are directed at achieving a number of things: firstly, a clearer definition of approved plant and equipment and approved research and development for use in identifying which expenditures will be eligible for the assistance benefits; secondly, clarification of the methods for calculating investment, including the use of assistance loadings to cover the incidental costs of investment which are difficult to quantify; and, thirdly, protection from artificial companies set up to take advantage of ACIS that are not going to contribute to the sustainable growth of the Australian automotive industry.
In introducing this bill, the government and the minister have stressed that ACIS is to provide transitional assistance over the next five years. The government intends that the tariff on passenger motor vehicles and certain parts will be reduced from 15 per cent to 10 per cent on 1 January 2005. Labor believes that the structure of this transition creates a great deal of uncertainty for members of the automotive industry, and we have had representations to that effect. The government is proposing an inquiry into the operation of the scheme at some unspecified time in 2005 into the possible impact of a tariff reduction that will have already occurred on 1 January 2005; frankly, that will not help the industry very much. The government's position has been vague on this point from the outset. In a joint statement by the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the then minister for industry dated 5 June 1997, they set out in their dot point No. 3 the proposition that `there will be a review in 2005'. Too late, ministers. There was no indication in that statement of when in that year, there was no reference to the cessation of the scheme prior to that time and there was no reference to any form of evaluation or public and industry consultation about the effectiveness of the scheme in advance of its cessation, let alone the effects of the tariff reduction.  
Many firms that are involved in the design, manufacture and distribution of automotive parts and products are continually making complex investment decisions over the long term. This does not enable them to plan. These firms will be faced at the end of the operation of the ACIS scheme with wondering whether further changes will be made to tariff arrangements and whether industry development funds will still be available and, if so, in what amount and in what form. The government needs to look at the recent experience of Mitsubishi Australia in Adelaide to see a demonstration of just how complicated and long term the decision making of these firms can be. I might say that the minister was missing in action on that front. That is why we are moving an amendment later to address what we regard as the very unworkable circumstances that have been created by the government in this legislation. This is the second opportunity we have given the government to change its mind. What we have consistently argued is that an unspecified date in 2005 is an inappropriate time to have the review. Commonsense surely dictates that the review must occur before the tariff cuts occur and before the program runs out. 
When we originally raised this point in this place during the debate on the ACIS bill in 1999, the government gave an entirely unsatisfactory response—which it has, by the way, repeated in the other place. They said at the time that they do not need an amendment about the inquiry because the government `might have an inquiry anyway'. Might? That is simply not good enough and provides no certainty to industry. There is no stability, so important to long-term planning in an approach such as this: they `might' have a review. It is simply a sign of either lazy or incompetent administration by the Liberal-National coalition. They do not appear to really care about the automotive industry.
Under such an approach, we do not actually know that the government will ever hold an inquiry. There is no certainty about what sort of inquiry it may be and there is no guarantee that the parliament would ever receive a report from any inquiry that might occur. The government's attitude to date has simply been to refuse to allow the industry and the community in general to offer their opinion on the question of automotive tariffs. Under the current bill, there is no guarantee that the public will ever get a chance to make submissions, that the industry will get a chance to make submissions, that the affected communities for this very important regionally based industry will get a chance to make submissions or that the state governments, particularly of South Australia and Victoria, will get a chance to make submissions to any inquiry that may occur. They are simply, apparently, not going to be asked their opinion.
That is why we think that a far more reasonable approach is to legislate for a formal inquiry to be incorporated into the bill being debated now so that all of those bodies know in advance that they can ask questions and make a contribution and that the industry will be able to plan. Otherwise the investment will deteriorate, will disappear. We will therefore seek to amend the ACIS Administration Amendment Bill to the extent that will require an inquiry to be held at a time before the tariff changes take place so that all those participants in the car industry can be certain that they will have the opportunity to put their views to parliament before an informed decision is made on any subsequent tariff changes. That is surely a very reasonable position to adopt.
I am very concerned that the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources has shown very little interest in this—which is surprising, given the fact that he represents the state of South Australia. We all know that members of that community became very agitated recently when it appeared that Mitsubishi might withdraw. The effects of the reduction or the collapse of this industry on that community would be catastrophic. I simply fail to understand why the minister and the government will not adopt this very reasonable course of action. 
If we do not have an inquiry of this kind well in advance of the cut-off of tariffs, we will not know what is going on to follow these transitional arrangements and, if any change does occur, precisely how the transitional arrangements are going to operate beyond 2005. The government is simply silent on this point. This is not 50 years out; this is in the foreseeable future, within the time frame of industry planning and investment. We do not want $2 billion worth of support to potentially become, after just five years, zero support. That would be irrational. But that is exactly what the government is asking the parliament to vote for at this moment—from $2 billion worth of support over five years to nothing, without an inquiry until after it is concluded. This is clearly an entirely unreasonable proposition.
The amendment we are proposing is one that the government could accept, if they were not being so pig-headed about this—and, frankly, I fail to understand it. Their negative response to our proposed amendment in the past has simply been a symptom of their `if we didn't write it, it can't be accepted' attitude. This parliament is surely a place where good ideas can be accommodated, no matter where they come from. This is coming from the communities, from the companies, from the unions and from other political parties. Why won't the government embrace it? Simply because the Labor Party are proposing this very reasonable amendment, the government are apparently now saying, `We don't need anything in this bill about an inquiry, or in the former bill for that matter. We might have one or we might not. Either way, we will tell you about it at the time.' That is really not good enough for industry planning. `The form of it,' they say, `if we do have one, will be a form that we will decide when we are good and ready.' Again, that is simply not good enough.
This is a very dangerous road for the government to take. At this stage I would have to say that apparently it is their foolish pride that is preventing them from supporting this very reasonable amendment. Everyone would breathe a sigh of relief and get on with it. As it is, they are very anxious about the government's resistance. Why are they resisting it? Maybe they do not want to know what the facts are before they cut off the tariffs and cut off this assistance scheme. It signals an intention to go all the way to zero without consultation. It is preventing people in the industry from making plans. It is preventing communities from understanding what their fate might be.
The road the government are taking is even preventing them from supporting an early inquiry that they know the automotive industry also supports—and, I might say, all the associated industries. Sadly, be it on their own heads. We are apparently not able to get this through to the minister and to the government. I will move the relevant amendment in the consideration in detail stage of the bill. But let me point out strongly in closing: when at the next election there is a change of government, there will be an inquiry into this issue and it will be a public inquiry. The parliament and particular members of this place will have the opportunity during this debate to ensure that, irrespective of whether there is a change of government, the inquiry takes place for the good of Australia's automotive industry and the people who work within it. Surely we can expect that of the government. Surely they have the interests of the people in Victoria and South Australia, in particular, at the centre of their concern. This amendment is very important to the industry, to the unions, to the communities, to the governments of South Australia and Victoria and, given the size of this industry, to the people of Australia. I cannot understand why the government will not embrace it. I commend the ALP amendment to the House and will move it in due course.",REPS,<title>ACIS ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Cox, David, MP",ALP,2000-12-05,"—The ACIS Administration Amendment Bill 2000 amends the Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme to remove a number of legislative difficulties before it becomes effective on 1 January 2001. The scheme will replace assistance provided under the previous arrangements which were directed at promoting exports but which were found to be contrary to World Trade Organisation rules. ACIS is focused more widely on sales, investment, and research and development. ACIS provides duty credits which may be used to pay customs duty on eligible imports or transferred. 
The scheme has two parts: one for car makers and one for component manufacturers. Car makers will be able to claim two types of duty credits. The first is a duty credit equal to 15 per cent uncapped and 10 per cent capped of the value of cars sold in Australia and New Zealand, multiplied by the relevant tariff rate—currently 15 per cent. The second is a duty credit equal to 25 per cent of the value of production of motor vehicles other than those sold in Australia and New Zealand, engines and engine components, multiplied by the relevant tariff rate. The third is a duty credit equal to 10 per cent of their investment in plant and equipment, averaged over the preceding three years.
Automotive component producers, automotive machine tool and tooling producers and automotive service providers can claim two types of export credits. The first is a duty credit equal to 25 per cent of the value of their investment in plant and equipment averaged over the preceding three years. The second is a duty credit equal to 45 per cent of the value of their investment in research and development averaged over the preceding three years. When motor vehicle producers provide components, tooling or services for a third party, as Mitsubishi does, they can access credits from the component tooling and services section of the scheme. A fiscal cap of $2 billion will apply to all benefits paid over the five years of the ACIS arrangement. These arrangements had the full support of the Labor Party when they were given passage last year. I am particularly supportive of them because they will be worth between $40 million and $50 million a year to Mitsubishi. 
The amendments in this bill are here today at least in part because of requests put by Mitsubishi to the government to make the original legislation more workable. The main points of the bill are to provide greater flexibility using regulations to determine what is allowable expenditure for the assessment of eligibility for duty credits. The bill also deals with the continuing eligibility of investment assets when they are transferred between entities. It broadens the definition of automotive machine tooling to automotive tooling. It allows for assistance in respect of investment in automotive services as well as tooling and allows for sales of services to be taken into consideration in calculating the cap for assistance at five per cent of sales. It provides for guidelines for registration and deregistration of eligible companies as a disallowable instrument rather than prescribing them in legislation.
Since the calculation of investment in plant and equipment is averaged over three years, the bill allows for the calculation of such investment from 1 January 1999. It tightens the requirements for the provision of business plans under the scheme to better facilitate the determination of the modulation rate to apply in the next period. It allows for the deregistration of a company set up artificially for the purposes of obtaining ACIS credits when it will not contribute to the sustainable growth of the Australian automotive industry. It also broadens to criminal convictions in another country the criteria for determining whether an applicant for assistance is not a fit and proper person under the act.
None of these amendments represents a policy change and Labor intends to support them. However, there is a significant difference between Labor and the government with regard to this bill. The fact that ACIS expires after five years—at the same time as the government's proposed tariff reduction—and the fact that the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources referred to ACIS as a `transitional assistance package' make it necessary to give the car industry a commitment to consider what assistance arrangements are appropriate for the future. The amendment Labor will move would insert a new part 14, `Review of Automotive Industry', into the legislation.  
The amendment requires that, first, after 30 June 2002 and before 1 January 2003 the minister must issue terms of reference and establish an independent public inquiry into the automotive industry. Secondly, the independent public inquiry must examine the need for assistance to promote competitiveness and encourage investment in the automotive industry after the arrangements set out in the ACIS Administration Act 1999 expire and consider the appropriate level of import tariffs for vehicles and components. Thirdly, the independent public inquiry must call for submissions, hold public hearings and commission research to inform its deliberations. Fourthly, the independent public inquiry may take evidence in private on matters that are commercially sensitive. Fifthly, the independent public inquiry must deliver its report to the minister before 31 March 2004. Sixthly, the minister must cause a copy of the report to be laid before each house of the parliament as soon as practicable after receiving it.
The amendment follows a request in a resolution moved by me and carried by the state convention of the South Australian branch of the ALP asking the federal parliamentary Labor Party to seek this amendment to the bill. It followed extensive discussions I had at the convention with Paul McMahon of the AMWU. This is not the first time that Labor has sought a full review of the car industry before the scheduled reduction in tariffs and completion of the ACIS assistance arrangements in 2005. We did so when parliament dealt with the original ACIS bill last year. Since then, it has become a tenet of Labor's industry policy, which was carried by our national conference last September. That resolution was written by me and moved by the South Australian Labor leader, Mike Rann.
This amendment would be welcomed by a broad cross-section of the car industry and provide reassurance that there will be a timely evaluation of the state of that industry before the scheduled reduction in tariffs and the expiry of the ACIS arrangements. It must be remembered that there is a significant gap between when the scheduled one-step five per cent phase down in car tariffs was determined by the Howard government and when it will come into effect. It is clear that the Howard government had absolutely no idea at that time what conditions might prevail in 2005 in the Australian economy and in the car industry. It may turn out to be a very bad year to be having such a dramatic five per cent phase down; if we are lucky, it may turn out to be a good year. We simply do not know, and it seems entirely prudent to make an assessment much closer to the date when the decision will take effect.
Conditions can change in the car industry and, over the past 12 months, we have watched Mitsubishi fight for its survival. At the beginning of the year it was told by its parent company that it had to attain profitability by the end of this year if it was to continue to manufacture. It took some very serious action to restructure in order to achieve that objective. It reduced its work force—largely its salaried work force rather than its production line workers—by about 600 at the beginning of the year. On then prevailing production levels and exchange rates, that should have been sufficient for the company to break even. Increases in production after the GST buyers strike ended when the GST came into effect should have seen the company move into a profitable trading position.
However, the company has had to contend with a declining Australian dollar, particularly in relation to the yen. Every depreciation of the dollar by the equivalent of one yen over the course of a full year has cost Mitsubishi $13 million. We have seen that exchange rate problem cause the company to be in a situation where it will again record substantial losses this calendar year.
There has been substantial restructuring, there has been a model upgrade and there has been a considerable amount of work done at the operation. The new CEO has, with great relief, convinced the parent company to provide ¥10 billion as a capital injection. This is the first capital injection, I understand, that Mitsubishi Australia has received from the parent company since 1980, and it is a significant demonstration that Mitsubishi sees its Australian operation as having a long-term future. Finally, more than any other decision, it lays to rest any conjecture about Mitsubishi's imminent closure, no matter what other commentators in the industry might say or what its competitors might say. I must say that Mitsubishi's competitors in Australia have welcomed this decision because they rely on the economies of scale that are achieved by having four automotive manufacturers operating in this country. Providing them with enough throughput also helps justify research and development. 
But in the long term we all know that the future of Australian car making will be dependent on exports, and we know that it will involve substantial further investment. The industry needs a government that is totally committed to an automotive industry with a long-term future. That means making timely assessments of what sort of assistance arrangements are necessary to be provided to the industry for its long-term future and growth. That is something that this Howard government has been remarkably reluctant to do.
We have been utterly amazed by the lack of activity of the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, Senator Minchin, in relation to the car industry's future. With his total disregard of the need to give the industry a continuing time horizon for assistance and for tariff protection and his wont of activity in that area, an opportunity has been missed; it has gone absolutely begging. It would have been of no real cost to the Commonwealth taxpayer for the government—unless it was contemplating a situation where there would not be any industry assistance for the car industry after 2005—to have given a clear indication that it would be making that timely evaluation and that it would be standing behind the industry in the long term.
I look forward over the next couple of years, with the help of this ¥10 billion, $172 million, to seeing a significant expansion in Mitsubishi's export operations. Tom Phillips, who is a marketer by occupation, is targeting two overseas markets: the Middle East and North America. He is looking at substantial expansions in Mitsubishi sales to those two markets. We also look forward to the conclusion of the parent company's evaluation of what it may best be able to do with the plant. There is some possibility of an additional model being put down that production line and more exclusive marketing arrangements for the Diamante in those North American and Middle East markets.
I was so pleased that Tom was able to make that announcement last week. There was absolute jubilation on the production line. The workers were bussed into Tonsley from the Lonsdale engine plant. They certainly received the message and understood it very clearly. It has been an absolutely dramatic turnaround for the local community. People who were extremely concerned because of recent media speculation about their futures are looking forward to a long-term future, and they are looking forward to working for a company where there is every potential for substantial growth—and I think that every South Australian would welcome that. This is something that the Labor Party has been praying for for some time.
I know that the government will oppose the amendment, as it did in the Senate. But I would call on the government, in the fullness of time, to reconsider its position. If it is not prepared to vote for our amendment, I would call on it to make a timely announcement about when it is going to do a full public inquiry into the car industry—which should be well in advance of the phase-down in tariffs. If the government does not do that, it will be one of the contributing factors to it losing government. It can be absolutely assured that we will not need legislation to force us to do it. It is a tenet of the Labor Party's industry policy. We will be establishing such an inquiry very soon after we are returned to the treasury bench.",REPS,<title>ACIS ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,2000-12-05,"—The ACIS Administration Amendment Bill 2000, before the House this evening, is a further piece of legislation in the rather tortured decision making and legislative path which provides the foundation for the Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme—ACIS. Before turning to the details of this bill, I would like to outline briefly the importance of the motor vehicle industry to Australia generally and more particularly to my electorate of Lalor. As I think we are all aware, the automotive industry is a very important one. It currently generates gross turnover in Australia of $14.5 billion and accounts for 7.4 per cent of total manufacturing turnover. It exports over $3.2 billion worth of vehicles, and it provides employment to over 51,000 Australians. 
The industry has worked hard to become internationally competitive and its exports have increased by a staggering 213.2 per cent since 1990. My electorate is home to Toyota, which does all of its manufacturing at the plant located at Altona. Toyota has recently launched the Avalon model, the latest vehicle in its range, which is selling very well indeed. The plant in my electorate located at Altona is worth some $420 million and Toyota consolidated its manufacturing operations there in 1994 and 1995. The plant at Altona is one of world class in the efficiency with which it manufactures and the technology and processes which it uses. It is very important to note that it is also a leader in environmental technology in terms of the technology that it actually uses to make the motor vehicles. The most recent contribution to the environmental performance of Toyota was the opening of a waterborne paint system which reduces the emissions to the atmosphere as paint is applied to the motor vehicles.
Toyota is a major employer in Australia generally and in my electorate. The livelihood of some 4,083 Australians depends upon Toyota and 2,372 of those work at the Altona plant. Many of them live locally. Toyota, with a market share of 19.7 per cent, is currently Australia's No. 1 in market ranking, a ranking Toyota is justifiably proud of. It continues to be the market leader in Australia. This year, it will export just under $1 billion worth of motor vehicles. I think it is important when you use a statistic like that to put it in some context, because it is a very impressive achievement but the figure can roll easily off the tongue. I think it needs to be recognised that that export performance, almost equal to the billion dollar mark, comes off a base of $47 million of exports in 1990. So here we are 10 years later and we have seen Toyota's exports escalate to near the billion dollar mark. 
I think it is also very important to talk about other industries that are debated back and forth in this House—for example, the wine industry. The wine industry in total across Australia exports $1.2 billion worth of product per year. Some of the members in this House would be very familiar with the wine industry, having wineries located in their electorates. If we look across and say that, to Australia, that industry is worth $1.2 billion in exports in total and Toyota, in and of itself as a component of the motor vehicle industry in Australia, is worth almost $1 billion worth of exports, I think we get some idea of the importance of this industry and the importance of Toyota to our manufacturing industry and to Australia's capacity to earn export dollars.
I met as recently as Friday with representatives of Toyota to discuss with them the way in which the plant is progressing and the way in which their business is going. Basically they say that business is good and that they are striving for further exports and further production. But they do say that there are a number of impediments in their way, one of which is the value of the Australian dollar. That might seem a little bit of an odd thing to say in respect of a company which exports so much of its product, but of course a variety of the components are actually imported, much of the contracting for that importing is done in American dollars and some of it needs to be done by way of spot purchasing in American dollars. Consequently, the depreciation that our currency has experienced actually has caused a problem in that regard when Toyota and other motor vehicle manufacturers are importing and purchasing source product. 
They also say that the uneven trade arena which they face continues to be a problem, and I think they rightly wonder whether we, under the current government, have the capacity to try and knock over some of the tariff regimes that Toyota experiences when it seeks to export to many of our trading partners. The feeling that Toyota has and that I have, having had a look at these issues, is that, as we are increasingly locked out of multilateral trade forums in our region and as we increasingly seem to struggle with securing appropriate bilateral relationships, our products—like the Toyota motor vehicles manufactured here—face increased difficulties in getting the sort of penetration into overseas markets that they ought to have. Just to do a very quick run round of some of our potential trading partners in this area, Brunei continues to have tariffs in the range of 40 per cent to 200 per cent, Malaysia 140 per cent to 300 per cent, Saudi Arabia 25 per cent, South Africa 61 per cent, Taiwan 30 per cent to 42 per cent and has quotas applying, Thailand 80 per cent, and so on. Our inability to make progress in knocking through some of the trade barriers of our potential trading partners is a real impediment for major exporters like Toyota. 
Having talked, by way of backdrop, about the importance of Toyota to my electorate and the importance of this industry to Australia generally, I now turn to consider in particular the provisions of the ACIS Administration Amendment Bill 2000. I think we do need to note that this bill has had a very tortuous path to this House. One could really write a book about the whole Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme, although I am not sure it would make the most interesting page turner of all time. I would not be recommending that to any honourable members in the House. But, as we know, this House dealt with the ACIS Administration Bill 1999 in the middle of last year and the act came into effect on 30 December. But that was not the first time that ACIS style legislation had been before this House and it certainly was not the first step in the decision making process which led to this scheme. As I think we are all aware, the very first step in the decision making process was an Industry Commission inquiry and report on the automotive industry, and that final report was given to the Treasurer on 26 May 1997. I am not sure if he still has a copy on his shelf, but if he does I hope he takes it down and dusts it regularly—otherwise, it would be accruing a great deal of dust.
Prior to the publication of the final report, a draft report was issued for public comment and debate. The report was actually divided into a minority report and a majority report. The majority report, by Presiding Commissioner Scales and Commissioner Rae, recommended that tariffs be reduced on passenger motor vehicles and components from 1 January 2001 at the rate of 2.5 percentage points per annum until 2004, when the tariff would reach five per cent. The minority report, by Associate Commissioner Webber, recommended the maintenance of tariffs on passenger motor vehicles, original equipment and replacement components at 15 per cent until 2005, with a review—and I emphasise those words—to be held in, say, 2003 to consider post-2005 assistance arrangements for the industry.
As I am sure we in this place all recall and as I am sure the Australian community recalls generally, the publication of the Industry Commission's draft report in late 1996 caused a huge reaction, a furore, involving the industry, the relevant trade union and communities like mine in the electorate of Lalor, which very clearly identify the motor vehicle industry as being the key to providing jobs and any form of prosperity for the region. There was a great deal of community campaigning in response to the release of that draft report. I think we would remember that, in response to that community campaigning, the Howard government did not come out with a clearly articulated vision for the motor vehicle industry. It did not come out with a vision for the future where the industry would be secure. It did not even come out in the public domain with a transparent decision making process that people could engage in.
No, instead of that, we had a variety of press reports about who was lining up which way on the tariff debate. So press reports at the time told us that Senate leader Robert Hill and the then industry minister, John Moore, did not see themselves as wedded to the majority Industry Commission report. However, the press were telling us that internally the then contenders for the leadership, the Federal Treasurer, who remains a contender of course, and the workplace relations minister, who no longer does, were seen to be favouring tariff reductions. This debate was played out through internal leaks in the pages of our newspapers. As fascinating as that might be for those of us who like to follow politics and see cabinet leaks in the newspaper, in terms of the Australian community that does not equal a vision for the industry. At no point, while we had this engaging byplay between Howard government ministers, did we get a clear vision for the industry in Australia. Finally, the government made the announcement of what the arrangements for post-2003 were going to be, legislation was presented to this House but lapsed on the calling of the election and then of course we finally processed the ACIS bill last year. 
The government has this component of the scheme back before us because it seeks to make some fine-tuning changes to the scheme and it basically says that these amendments are required to enable a more efficient delivery of the program, to streamline the operation of the scheme and to reduce the administrative burden on both participants and the government. This bill deals with a number of matters, including increasing the capacity for regulations to define what is approved plant and equipment and approved research and development for the purpose of calculating benefits under the scheme. The bill deals with regulations which will deal with the maximum claimable value of investment in different kinds of plant and equipment and research and development. It also deals with the question of investment loadings.
All of those things are well and good but what this bill fails to do—and what the last ACIS piece of legislation that we dealt with failed to do—is to give us in any way an indication of what the plan is, what the vision is and what is going to happen after 2005. So should this bill pass in this form, the community will be no wiser about what happens after 2005. The scheme of arrangements that the Howard government has adopted is to say, let us have this regulatory environment, let us have this scheme, let us have these tariff arrangements and let us have that all come to an end and, after that has come to an end, then let us have a review and let us make up our mind about what we are going to do next.
Of course, the Labor Party thought that was an insufficient approach last time the ACIS legislation was before this House and we think it is an insufficient approach now. We actually think that it is an act of public policy madness, an act of public policy vandalism, to allow yourself, as a government, to get into a situation where, in respect of a major industry, you go into a regulatory and industry assistance black hole for a period: you find yourself out there in the void not knowing what is going to happen next and then sometime later, presumably—or maybe you just stay in the void forever; maybe that is the plan—you then try to struggle your way out of the void by adopting a new scheme.
The Labor amendment says, let us not do it that way because that is clearly an irrational way to do it; let us do it the rational way, and the rational way is obviously to review the situation of the industry prior to the end of the arrangements contemplated in this bill and the end of the current tariff arrangements and then make some decisions about what should happen next and allow for a seamless transition from the regime then applying to whatever the next regime may be. I do not think that we sitting here today can be prescriptive about what that regime may be. Obviously, there would be a variety of factors that you would take into account in calculating what that regime would be. There might be progress in the construction of and effective usage of a multilateral trading forum—we might take that into account. We might have secured a series of bilateral trade agreements which affect this industry—we might take that into account. There might have been major technological advances in the way in which motor vehicles are produced—we might take that into account. We might have made sufficient investment—and certainly one would hope this was true when Labor was in government—in R&D and in our Knowledge Nation agenda that, in terms of skills and capacity to support the industry, things have changed there, and you might take that into account. We do not want to be too prescriptive about all of the factors, but you would have an open, transparent review where everybody gets to have a say, everybody gets to have a go and then government makes some decisions and we move from this tariff and this industry assistance regime to whatever the next regime is going to be. 
When the ACIS Administration Act was before this House last year, Labor moved a similar amendment and I spoke during that debate. I have had cause to have a look at the Senate Hansard for the debate on this bill in the Senate, and I have to say, having been a participant in the debate last time and having seen the Senate Hansard in relation to the debate this time, that I am yet to really see a government member put forward an argument that says there is something wrong with the chain of reasoning that says you have the review before the end of the scheme and you work out what you are going to do next. It just seems to me unarguable, and it must be unarguable because nobody from the other side has argued against it. So, if there is some fatal flaw in that as a decision making process, I think we would all be enlightened to hear it. But it is now the best part of 18 months since we were debating the ACIS Administration Act 1999. No-one in that debate explained why the review amendment which Labor moved was a flawed amendment. No-one in this debate, here or in the other place, has explained why it is a flawed amendment. One is driven to the conclusion that it is not flawed, that it is actually a really good idea, and that the only thing that is really happening here is that the government does not want to concede that the opposition has had a good idea. Rather than steer itself towards the correct public policy course, it would rather save a bit of face and stick with its agenda, even though it is clearly not the right agenda.
I conclude this speech by saying what I said when Labor moved a similar amendment in respect of the ACIS Administration Act 1999, which is that I would really ask government members not to just go through the trite arguments that sometimes get exchanged in these circumstances when no-one is really answering anybody else. Rather than going through that sort of ritual, I ask them to actually have a think about the proposition Labor is putting forward, to think about whether it is the best public policy course to go into a policy vacuum and then work out what you are going to do or whether it is the best public policy course to have a review, work out what you are going to do and move from one scheme of arrangements to another scheme of arrangements with no vacuum in the middle. I really do think that, if government members have a clear think about that, they will be voting for Labor's amendment, not opposing it. If that happens, we will end up with a better public policy regime. So I would urge members on the other side to think about what is a rational way forward in relation to our automotive industry. As I said at the start of this speech, for Australia generally and for electorates like mine it is too important an industry to muck around with. We really want a rational, secure, transparent and understandable regime. Labor's amendment secures that, and I urge all members to vote for it.",REPS,<title>ACIS ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Thompson, Cameron, MP",LP,2000-12-05,"—At the outset, I would like to thank members opposite for accommodating me and other events going on around the place tonight in this debate and allowing me to speak as it has been scheduled. It winds up being very effective, in my view. I will begin by saying that what we are talking about tonight in the ACIS Administration Amendment Bill 2000 is the Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme, which is worth $2 billion. I want to compare it with the scheme that was in place beforehand. Going to the AusIndustry web site, I note that the scheme which terminates on 31 December 2000 has the following key elements: a reduction in the automotive tariff by 2.5 percentage points annually to 15 per cent in 2000; a duty-free allowance which allowed passenger motor vehicle manufacturers to import up to 15 per cent of the value of production of each car duty free; and the Export Facilitation Scheme, which encouraged export of automotive products. That was replaced by the scheme we are discussing tonight, the Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme. That scheme, which will begin on 1 January and continue till 31 January 2005, has three main elements. The automotive tariff will remain at 15 per cent until 31 December 2004, after which it will be reduced to 10 per cent; motor vehicle producers will earn benefits for eligible production investment and research and development; and automotive component manufacturers, automotive machine tooling and tooling producers and automotive service providers will earn benefits for eligible investment and research and development. Those are the comparisons between the two schemes. 
This Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme was proclaimed on 30 December 1999. We now have this amendment bill, which looks to identify a range of issues. Firstly, it clearly identifies what can be claimed by the various companies seeking to access funding under ACIS. That includes plant and equipment and research and development funding. There is also a definition provided in relation to mergers and acquisitions. For example, it enables the investment being made by one company to be considered as being the investment of another in the case of a merger or acquisition. That is obviously very logical, and without that kind of provision I doubt we would have the kind of encouragement for investment in the Australian automotive industry that we would like to see. It also provides for the better identification of contrivances. For example, the case which has been given is that, if there is a finance company in effect posing as a component manufacturer under the legislation, then that is obviously something that would be regarded as being not appropriate and something which needs to be identified so that we get the money being directed in the most effective way for the development of industry. There are also several provisions for better administration, for example, providing for early payment on the receipt of a quarterly return from one of the claiming companies.
The Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme does seek to encourage investment, innovation and production in a range of automotive pursuits. Vehicle producers, car component producers, machine tool and tooling producers for those involved with car production and auto service providers are to be encouraged by it. If we look at what is going on in Australia today, we find many worthwhile Australian companies engaging in exporting, using the kinds of incentives that will come forward under ACIS. Their locally developed products will also encourage export earnings.
I would like to list a few of them and their achievements: PBR Automotive has been exporting braking systems to the United States since 1983; Pilkington has been exporting glass to Japan since 1983; Henderson's Automotive has been exporting lumbar automotive seat support mechanisms to the US; Natra has been exporting radiators to South-East Asia, Hong Kong and the US; South Pacific Tyres has been exporting tyres to the US, Europe, Japan and the UK; BTR Automotive has been exporting gearboxes to Maserati in Italy and is looking at contracts to export to the Asian market; Nissan Casting has been exporting to Japan, Spain, Mexico and the US; and Holden's component manufacturing operations have been exporting to the UK, Germany and several other countries—in fact, its export earnings exceed $1.4 million a day. Mitsubishi is engaged in these pursuits as well.
I have been through what this bill clearly identifies and what it seeks to do, but let us look at the car industry itself and what it amounts to. It is a very valuable industry within Australia. Even in my electorate, which is not directly engaged in the car industry, there is a direct acknowledgment of the importance of this industry within Australia. One-quarter of the manufacturing industry in South Australia is basically the car industry. In that state, the car industry is responsible for some 16,700 jobs—that is 16,700 people, or 16,700 potential families, being supported by the car industry. In Victoria, it is more than double that amount: some 38,800 employees earn their income as a result of the car industry. In New South Wales, 9,300 jobs come from the car industry; in Queensland, my own state, 6,800 jobs come from the car industry; in Western Australia, 1,800 jobs come from the car industry; and, in Tasmania, 400 jobs come from the car industry.
It is obviously a very important industry. If I look at the figures for the whole of Australia for the year 2000, employment within the automotive industry totals 73,800 jobs. Australian governments need to very carefully monitor this industry and maintain a careful link and communication with it. That is why it was very rewarding to see the recent decision of Mitsubishi. My electorate is not anywhere near South Australia and not directly involved with that Mitsubishi decision, but it is something that Australians all over would have welcomed. I would like to quote a Mitsubishi Motors press release headed `Mitsubishi Motors Secures Future in Australia': 
MMAL parent company, Mitsubishi Motors Corporation (MMC) announced its decision to invest the capital from Japan earlier today—
that is, 28 November—
subject to the necessary Australian Government approvals. The decision was also supported by Daimler Chrysler which has a 34% stake in MMC.
Managing Director of MMAL, Tom Phillips, said that the capital injection puts an end to continued speculation over the future of the Australian operations.
I am sure that was very welcome, and there was certainly a big sigh of relief breathed in South Australia about that. A press release of the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, Senator Nick Minchin, dated 28 November stated:
`Today's announcement that Mitsubishi Motors Corporation, with the backing of Daimler Chrysler, will inject $172 million into its Australian operations demonstrates the company is serious about the future of MMAL,' Senator Minchin said.
`This injection of funds represents a vote of confidence in the company's Australian operations.
`This decision should boost the morale of Mitsubishi employees who have in recent weeks borne the brunt of irresponsible media reporting and Labor's dodgy speculation about the company's future.
Those are Senator Nick Minchin's comments, and I do not think it was wise for anyone to have speculated about the future of the Mitsubishi plant in South Australia in any negative sense. To see the jubilation and the strong spirit of commitment of all the workers in those plants on the day of that celebration—it was a wonderful day, and I am sure they all felt very positive—and to see Tom Phillips saluting that announcement was very positive. It would have had ramifications across Australia. People would feel very proud and very pleased that we can get that kind of result. The Brisbane Courier-Mail of 29 November summed it up by stating:
Months of anxiety ended yesterday when 3200 workers at Mitsubishi Motors' two South Australian plants received an early Christmas present—a guarantee their jobs were safe, at least for the foreseeable future.
Why were those jobs safe? Because of the very positive programs being pursued by the Howard government—for example, the government's decision on tariff protection in the auto industry, which did see those tariffs frozen at 15 per cent for five years and also a light commercial vehicle tariff of five per cent. The freezing of those tariffs until 2005, when those tariffs are due to reduce again to 10 per cent, was received very positively by the auto industry and would have contributed to Mitsubishi Motors voting in support of their South Australian manufacturing plants.
Also, I do not think we should overlook the impact of tax reform in this process. We have seen from the coalition government the introduction of a new tax system that takes taxes off exports. That is a significant decision by the government. It is something which we alone have been campaigning for and which we alone have delivered. There is no person sitting opposite who can say that they were advocating a scheme to take taxes off exports. I think Mitsubishi Motors would definitely give credit to the Howard government for that. I think the jobs of those people in South Australia have in large part been protected as a result of the government's activity.
Apart from measuring the value of the auto industry to Australia in terms of jobs, let us look at just what sort of turnover is being generated. In the 1998-99 financial year, the turnover of the auto industry was $16.7 billion. That was the highest ever recorded in the auto industry—$16.7 billion is a massive industry in Australian terms, and it is something that, as I have said before, is very important to our future and must be continually monitored by the government and supported. If we look at it in value added terms, in 1998-99 the value added component being contributed by the auto industry was $4.9 billion. They are the latest figures that the Parliamentary Library has been able to get me on the issue. The highest value added assessment of the worth of the auto industry came in the year before, in 1997-98, at $5.1 billion. So it is an industry of great importance and something that Australia is very proud of. 
Something that has been raised by members opposite and must definitely be considered in this forum is what tariffs currently apply around the world in various markets. We have seen Australia reduce our tariffs from 22.5 per cent to 15 per cent by the year 2000, but overseas there are also reductions occurring. We must of course be strong in our efforts to advocate continuing reductions in other countries as we review the tariffs that apply within Australia. For example, in Brazil we have seen a reduction in the passenger motor vehicle tariff from 70 per cent to 22 per cent by the year 2000. I must say that the passenger motor vehicle market in Brazil is something like 1,445,000 units. That is the size of that market—it is obviously very big. In Canada we have seen a reduction in passenger motor vehicle tariffs from eight per cent to 6.1 per cent, and in Canada the size of the passenger motor vehicle market is 672,000 units. We have also seen reductions in Chinese Taipei and in places like the Czech Republic, where there has been a reduction in passenger motor vehicle tariffs from 19 per cent in 1995 to 17.1 per cent in 2000.
In Indonesia, which is of course a market that has been very heavily protected, there has been a reduction in tariff on completely built-up vehicles from 125 per cent with a 75 per cent surcharge to a maximum of 40 per cent with a 50 per cent surcharge by 2003. Those numbers seem incredibly high and, to Australians, it really does seem significant that Indonesia is running those kinds of tariffs. But, when you look at the proportion of the reduction there and the efforts that are going into reforming Indonesia's trade position, you can see that there has been significant improvement. Of course, around the world we are seeing this move towards tariffs. I am sure that the federal government is worthy of congratulations for the steps that it has taken. It is playing its part in providing a more competitive passenger motor vehicle market here in Australia and worldwide. What that means for average Australian consumers is cheaper motor vehicles and a better and more competitive motor vehicle market. I heard members opposite talking about the buyers strike prior to the introduction of the GST. I think those of us who are in the real world remember what happened on that occasion. We have seen a car industry that has benefited magnificently from the GST. We have seen an industry that is now so competitive in Australia, and Australians are of course continuing to reap the benefits of that.
In closing, I want to turn my attention to the amendment being proposed by the opposition. I do not really hold with this at all as a member of parliament. It is really a stunt. It is setting up a straw man to say that we can have a review, which is really just a public talkfest. It is not in the realm of this at all. There is an opportunity here for governments to produce an effective outcome for the future of Australia. If you follow what the opposition is proposing, this talkfest is going to start on 30 June 2002. Even if that continued for a year and finished on 30 June 2003, there would be no guaranteeing at all that whatever it had recommended would be effective when tariffs were again going to be reviewed in 2005. That industry is continually in a state of flux and requires governments to act effectively. There is no doubt in my mind that, no matter what the government does, the opposition will set up an inquiry in the Senate anyway. They do this all the time. I am a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Resources, and we have seen a plethora of inquiries going on into, for example, the contracting out of computer services. It does not have anything to do with the most effective outcome; it has to do with whether or not you are able to beat up concerns in the minds of the public and whether or not you are able to confect a totally inaccurate picture of the government's position and its responsibilities to the public.
The opposition and in particular the Australian Labor Party believe that they are past masters of this kind of phoney confecting. We have seen it on the GST. They wailed about it for three years and, at the end of that time, they agreed with it. We have seen it on a range of policies, and here we have it again. They do not have any policies to support themselves, so they want to create agony and concern in the minds of people associated with the automotive industries. They are waxing up their surfboards and hoping to cruise into power on the back of this community concern and grief over something which would more effectively be determined in an appropriate manner by people in government who have been elected for that purpose. This government will be assessed by people in the community on its performance; it will not be assessed on the efforts of the opposition to confect a false public talkfest to give themselves a soapbox on which to bang away at the automotive industry, as they did to the chagrin of Mitsubishi workers in the very recent past.

"O'Connor, Gavan, MP",ALP,2000-12-05,"—I think this particular piece of legislation, the ACIS Administration Amendment Bill 2000, is one of the more important bills that we have debated this year. I urge everybody in my electorate to read in Hansard the contribution of the member for Blair to this debate, because he is a walking, talking advertisement of the failure of this government to appreciate the necessity for good planning in this industry. Indeed, I will make sure that the Geelong community—the community of Corio that I represent in this parliament—fully understand that this Liberal member and others on the coalition side regard a public review of the industry's position before tariffs are lowered further as a false public talkfest. I will make sure that the City of Greater Geelong, the councillors, the union movement, all the workers, the business community and the general community that have supported this industry in my electorate are made aware that this Liberal member, reflecting the views of the coalition backbench on this important industry, regards the process of consultation with them as a phoney, confected and a false public talkfest. The honourable member for Blair has not been in this parliament very long, so I suspect he is a little wet behind the ears when he gets up to speak about matters relating to an industry which does not have particular relevance to his electorate and I can understand him coming in here and making a fool of himself in the way that he has. But for electorates like Corio—
—Get to the dairy industry.
—I will get to dairying, Minister. As far as the electorate of Corio is concerned, the car industry is the region's largest employer, and the community wants to have input into the decisions that are made that will affect thousands of families in my electorate. For the member for Blair to come in here and describe as a false public talkfest a review where those families and their community representatives would have the opportunity to put a proposition to government on the future of their industry is an indication of just how shallow his understanding is. When he wipes the water from behind his ears and gets into some real debate in this chamber, he will come to realise that this is a significant industry to regional Australia. This industry forms the heart of Australian manufacturing, and it deserves to be treated with a little more respect, a little more concern, than the member for Blair has treated it with tonight.
The importance of this industry to the Australian economy has been alluded to by previous speakers in this debate. It is an industry that has a turnover of some $14.5 billion, putting it at the forefront of manufacturing industry in this country. It is an industry whose exports have grown substantially, to the position where it now exports in excess of $3 billion. Its employment level is among the highest in Australian manufacturing, with some 51,000 people directly employed. The member for Blair, who is fairly new to the parliament, probably does not have an understanding of the restructuring that has occurred in the car industry over the past 15 years, but it is an industry that has undergone very significant restructuring over that time. As far as the economy of the Geelong region is concerned, Ford—a major car manufacturer that exists in my electorate—and its manufacturing activity forms the background of the regional economy. As I said, the company has gone through substantial restructuring over the past 15 years that has seen significant losses in employment. However, productivity in the company has improved massively over that period. That has been achieved on the back of good planning by Labor governments in the past and significant investment by the company itself, encouraged by that good planning, in new technologies. Another factor in the company's achievement of that strong productivity growth has been its significant investment in skilling the local work force. 
We must never underestimate the importance of this car and component manufacturing activity to the Geelong community. I congratulate the Ford company on its participation in the economic, cultural and social life of the region. The company is a strong participant in the affairs of the community at many levels. It is a major sponsor of the Geelong Football Club. I know, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, that you are a great fan of the national code. While the member for Fremantle may claim that Fremantle is a provincial city, I think you can say that Geelong is really the only provincial city that has a football side in the national competition. The major sponsor of that football side is the Ford company. It has been a major sponsor of our code and our football club for many years. It is a most valued sponsor. Although the club has not won grand finals over the last decade, we have certainly participated in many of them and that has, in part, been due to the interest and the sponsorship provided by the Ford Motor Co.
Ford has established the Ford Discovery Centre, which now forms an important part of the cultural precinct of Geelong. You can go to see the National Wool Museum, walk down to the waterfront and then go back up to the Ford Discovery Centre. The Geelong art gallery is in the precinct. also All of this takes an investment and a commitment by a company to its community. It is also a major corporate sponsor of the City of Greater Geelong's Boulevard project, a project to beautify the entrance to our great city. It has also established very strong links with Deakin University in the area of research and training programs. This is a partnership that was encouraged in the first instance by Labor in government and it is one which has grown to be a very productive partnership indeed. At the very local level, its employees are major contributors to local charities. Many of the volunteer work force in community organisations in Geelong, particularly at weekends, are Ford employees.
I pay tribute here tonight to those employees who have had to put up with a great degree of uncertainty through the years about their future—similar to what has been experienced by employees in the Mitsubishi company in South Australia—but they have kept their shoulders to the wheel and they have changed the culture of the workplace, cooperated with management in the new task of building a company that can compete in the global marketplace and they have done that successfully. They have been well represented by the vehicle builders union, and I pay tribute here to Russell Gardiner and the other union officials there who have negotiated on their behalf with this multinational company for very good wages and conditions. The union movement is to be congratulated on the way it has embraced change.
The company is a major contributor to the Geelong economy through the support it provides the component suppliers, and it is a major trainer of Geelong's manufacturing work force. In many other manufacturing companies around the city you will find people who have been trained in the Ford Motor Co. Of course, the company has a major wages bill and every week the work force goes into the Geelong community spending those hard earned dollars on products from a myriad of small businesses which depend very much on this company for their survival. It provides a critical mass for the employment of top level automotive engineers and researchers. The company has played a prominent role at the environmental level. It has been at the forefront of producing environmentally friendly vehicles, and the company cannot keep up with the demand for the gas powered vehicle that it recently released onto the market. Indeed, I recently went to the company to put an order in and they indicated to me that it would be several months because of the waiting list of Australian consumers for a very good car which is environmentally friendly. 
Honourable members have alluded to the fact that this is an industry that has had to compete in an international market place that has been heavily protected while tariffs in its own country have been significantly reduced. In this debate we have heard of tariffs in Malaysia of 140 to 300 per cent; in Taiwan, 42 per cent; and in Thailand, 80 per cent. These are substantial tariff barriers. If we go to the Middle East, in Saudi Arabia tariffs are 25 per cent. This is an industry that, while it has undergone restructuring and a lowering of tariffs, faces significant pressure in the international market place from other countries which impose high tariffs.
We have proposed here an eminently sensible review of the industry before a major fall in tariffs scheduled for 2005. Because of the importance of the industry to regional economies, the policy framework in which the industry operates should not be dramatically changed without careful planning. The key to any planning task is the acquisition of accurate information on the state of the industry at the time the particular changes are contemplated. We are putting a very reasonable amendment. We will support this amendment when it is put by the shadow minister in this debate tonight on behalf of the Geelong community and the electors of Corio because we believe it is prudent to conduct this review of the conditions in the car industry before any sudden drop in tariff levels in 2005. That community wants its voice heard and it wants the opportunity through a review and a public inquiry to put its view without fear or favour to the government of the day.
Labor has done this in the industry in the past and it has positioned the industry to cope with momentous changes in its production and marketing environment. I note the presence in the chamber tonight of my portfolio counterpart, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. The minister's actions are a good example of the failure of the government to pay close attention to the need for industry planning in key rural industries that are facing momentous change. Only today I met with dairy farmers from the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales who have had their incomes decimated by the failure of this government to adequately plan for that industry's future. I would like the minister, who held a gun at the head of the dairy industry in Australia and forced it to deregulate without any planning, to take a leaf from Labor's book to see how, in the past, we handled significant change in the dairy industry. Not only did we establish industry plans in the dairy industry; we did it in the car industry.
On behalf of the workers that I met today, I appeal to the minister to take their concerns on board because their incomes have been decimated by your government's failure to plan for change in the dairy industry. All you have to do is to take a leaf out of Labor's book; it is not very hard. When I mentioned Kerin and Crean to the dairy farmers out there today, they clapped; when I mentioned Vaile and Truss, they booed. I say to the minister tonight to take a leaf out of our book and plan for the changes that you force on particular rural industries. 
The car industry is very important to the Australian economy, and it was, if we go back to the 1980s, heavily protected. The member for Blair was not in the House at that particular time and nor was I—I was a candidate for the seat of Corangamite at three elections in the 1980s. Throughout the 1990s, as the industry faced declining tariff levels, it put representations to government about its future. I must comment here on the contribution to the debate by the honourable member for Corangamite, whose electorate occupies a small section of the City of Greater Geelong on the western side of the Barwon. In the debate leading up to the year 2000 and the changes that were contemplated at that time, the honourable member for Corangamite was advocating zero tariffs—not zero tariffs over 10 or 15 years; he wanted them `now'. He was a Hewson man. He wanted zero tariffs, to drop industry protection completely. If that decision had gone ahead, we would have had thousands of people in Geelong out of work overnight.
As I just mentioned, the lack of planning in the dairy industry by this government now sees us with the prospect of thousands of dairy farmers leaving the industry under circumstances that we would all regret. As far as the car industry is concerned, the government does have an opportunity to put in place some effective mechanisms for reviewing the industry assistance arrangements, doing it sensibly and doing it with community support. That is why people on this side of the House are at a loss to understand why the government might reject any amendment that indicates that the industry should be reviewed ahead of a momentous change that might occur around the years 2003 to 2005. We think that is a reasonable amendment, and one which could be accommodated by the government. 
When this particular amendment is moved, on behalf of the Geelong community here tonight I urge the government to support it, because I know our amendment has the strong support of the union movement and the workers in the Geelong community. I know it has the strong support of the City of Greater Geelong. I know it has the strong support of the business community and the Geelong Chamber of Commerce. I know it has the strong support of the Geelong community overall. This industry is absolutely critical to the economic survival of the region, and I urge the government to accept this amendment when it is moved.",REPS,<title>ACIS ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Entsch, Warren, MP",LP,2000-12-05,"—in reply—First of all, I would like to thank all of those members who contributed to this debate on the ACIS Administration Amendment Bill 2000. I thank the honourable member for Fremantle for her support for the thrust of ACIS and for the amendment bill. I appreciate the member for Kingston's support for ACIS and the amendment bill, and I certainly appreciate his interest in Mitsubishi. I stress here that Mitsubishi will certainly benefit substantially under ACIS. I noted the member for Lalor's interest in Toyota and in ACIS, although I certainly do not agree with the need for a rigid review. I also thank the member for Blair for his very positive contribution, highlighting the significant value of the Australian automotive industry to Queensland and to Australia generally. He also raised the point that the new tax system and the GST are having a very positive influence on the automotive industry and he confirmed that significant reductions in tariffs in the automotive industry are happening right around the world. The member for Corio again highlighted the importance of ACIS to the industry. He raised the value of Ford's investment and commitment to his electorate and also confirmed the positive contribution of Ford employees to Geelong. But I would have looked for a greater appreciation from him of the government's business tax incentives, and certainly their benefits to the automotive industry.
The amendment foreshadowed by the opposition, quite frankly, is really just a stunt. It has already been defeated in the other place. The government has accepted a second reading amendment moved by the Democrats to conduct a review not less than 12 months before ACIS ceases at the end of 2005. The detail of the review is really a matter for the government of the day. ACIS is part of a more general automotive package, including a trade strategy and a pause in tariffs. Formal review would encourage speculation that the commitment to tariffs was really not firm. The government is not opposed to a review. Certainly it is good practice, but the terms need to be determined closer to the conclusion of the scheme in light of circumstances that may be prevailing at that time. No automotive industry review has ever been legislated in the past, I should point out, and there have in fact been auto reviews in 1984, 1988, 1992, 1996 and 1997. I think it is interesting also to note that Labor has never legislated auto reviews. You have to ask why it has suddenly now developed such wisdom.
This bill proposes several technical amendments to the Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme. ACIS is certainly a major plank in the government's commitment to the Australian automotive industry to provide transitional support in an era of trade liberalisation. ACIS will make $2 billion available to industry over five years, making it one of the largest industry development schemes supported by government. ACIS will encourage the development of internationally competitive firms in the automotive industry through rewarding eligible production, strategic investment development and research and development. The proposed amendments will enable the scheme to be delivered more efficiently, reducing the compliance burden on participants. The amendments will also prevent contraventions against the policy intent of the scheme. 
I note that the bill was amended in the Senate by the government to enable proposed new section 6B to work as intended, and the revised explanatory memorandum reflects this change. The proposed ACIS Administration Amendment Bill 2000 has no additional financial impact and also has no impact on the scheme's compliance with our obligations under the WTO.
I would like to thank the Democrats for their second reading amendment made in the Senate under which the government has agreed to undertake that review, as I said earlier, of the scheme before 2005. The government notes that it is good practice to undertake such a review of such a significant scheme. The government is pleased that this $2 billion scheme is now ready to operate from 1 January 2001 and that the Democrats have supported the passage of the amendment bill for this very important industry.

"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,2000-12-05,"—We fully support this position. The government has accepted the Senate's amendments, which are important because they will give citizens the right to appeal the decision of a private sector privacy code adjudicator. Industry bodies will set up their own privacy codes and each code will have a privacy adjudicator. Under this legislation, citizens will have the right to appeal the decision of a privacy adjudicator to the Privacy Commissioner. This is a significant improvement because the Privacy Commissioner will have the right to make the decision afresh and literally stand in the shoes of the private sector adjudicator. The bill originally restricted citizens to a very cumbersome, expensive and inflexible judicial review proceeding, which involved going to the Federal Court of Australia to challenge a decision on technical grounds. This is a significant right for Australian citizens—particularly Australian consumers, who will most likely be affected by this decision. 
These amendments will also ensure that there is some uniformity in the interpretation of similar private sector codes. Such codes will exist throughout Australia and having appeals funnelling into the Privacy Commissioner will lend some uniformity, and indeed guidance, to the interpretation of private sector codes. We received strong submissions not only from consumer groups but also from business saying that these amendments were appropriate—indeed, business suggested the amendments to us initially—so it is good to see that the government has adopted this position. We think it will significantly improve the right of private citizens to obtain redress for any breaches of privacy. 
I think, by and large, those industry bodies in the most significant Australian industries have acted responsibly in establishing these codes, and will continue to do so. However, this legislation will ensure that Australian citizens retain their rights when there is no demonstrated goodwill. Private industry bodies will not be able to contract out of the protections that Australians will have under the Privacy Act. The opposition moved these amendments in the Senate with the support of the Australian Democrats and we are pleased that the government has accepted their validity and the rationale for them.

"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,2000-12-05,"—We will not oppose the government's motion—albeit with some disappointment. We will not press the amendments at this time, although a Labor government would tighten this privacy legislation significantly by including these amendments and by ensuring that we developed in Australia what was effectively world's best practice privacy protection. We believe privacy protection not only is an important civil right of Australian citizens but also makes good economic sense.
In particular, evidence suggests that in the next few years the potential for revenue from economic commerce is in the billions of dollars. What will happen is that citizens of other countries will look to those countries that have regimes that provide security for them—not only security for their financial transactions but also security for their private information. We think there is a significant advantage in Australia being ahead of the pace rather than behind it. Indeed, research suggests that only a very limited number or percentage of those who use the Internet engage in economic commerce and, for at least 40 per cent of those, the prime consideration is the potential for intrusion into their privacy. So we say that having a sound privacy regime is actually in the interests of Australian business, whether it be big business or small business. We hope that small business will realise that and, despite the width of the small business exemption contained in the legislation, that most small businesses—particularly those engaged in electronic commerce—will voluntarily bring themselves within the provisions of the act.
One of the other areas where we are disappointed that the government has not accepted our amendments is in the fact that the bill currently contains a complete exemption for employee records. While we readily admit that it will be necessary in the course of the normal employment relationship for subsequent employers to seek and obtain details regarding performance, disciplining, pay rates and the like, there is no justification at all for subsequent employers to obtain, off previous employers, details relating to any illness that an employee may have—for instance, diabetes or some other ailment not connected to the way in which they perform their duties—or whether they have a regular payroll deduction—for instance, for child support or by way of subscription to an organisation or even to a trade union. So we say that the width of the small business exemption is unjustified. We note that the government itself has tacitly acknowledged this by the mere fact that it proposes to have an inquiry into the width of that exemption. We hope that, within 12 months of this bill coming into operation, the government will do something about the unreasonable width of the exemption.
We are also concerned that there is no penalty for systematic and serious breaches of privacy. We are very concerned that the bill will not come into operation until at least 12 months from its being passed this week, which effectively will make it after the next election. But fundamentally this bill, we say, is certainly better than nothing. The amendments that we have succeeded in moving—and, indeed, the government accepting in part—will at least give some protection to Australians.
The area that will not be protected, however—and we note again the government's agreement to review—is in respect to special protections for information obtained from children. The basis of the current privacy principles is that there must be informed consent before a consumer provides information. Obviously that cannot be obtained from children, and there is justification for special protections for information obtained from children to ensure that parents have the ultimate control on their commercial relationships. We have proposed a model based on that which exists in the United States. We note that the government seeks more time to confer with the states and other bodies in respect of developing a special protection for children, and we welcome that. (Time expired)

Government amendment No. 1 is in response to Senate amendment No. 19, relating to political acts and practices. The amendment inserts a clarifying note into the exemption for political acts and practices in clause 7(c) of the bill. The amendment is intended to replace Senate amendment No. 19. However, to avoid any doubt, the government proposes an amendment that will insert a note at the end of clause 7(c) that confirms the way in which the exemption operates. The note makes it clear that the exemption does not extend to the use or disclosure by sale or otherwise of personal information collected by virtue of the exemption in a way not covered by the exemption.
Government amendments Nos 2 and 3 are in response to Senate amendment No. 21 relating to the application of national privacy principles to existing information. Government amendments Nos 2 and 3 relate to the application of national privacy principles 2 and 6 to personal information collected before the commencement of the bill. They are intended to replace Senate amendment No. 21. The government does not accept Senate amendment No. 21 and does that for good reason.
The Senate amendments would create unnecessary and unjustified compliance costs for organisations, in the government's view. It must be remembered that, after the legislation comes into operation, organisations that hold existing databases of personal information will need to comply with all aspects of the legislation when they update that information, including those relating to use and disclosure. In the information industry, the currency of personal information is crucial. This means that over time the complete set of principles will come to apply for that updated information. The government considers that there is merit in providing individuals with some means to access information collected before the commencement of the act when an organisation uses or discloses that information about them. This is particularly the case where the use adversely impacts upon the individual—for example, where a real estate agency relies on personal information collected prior to the commencement of the bill to deny an individual rental accommodation. The government accepts that there may be situations where it is fair that individuals have the ability to access that information and to correct it if it is wrong.
While not accepting the Senate's general application of NPP6 to all existing information, the government proposes through amendment (3) to enable individuals to access and correct information collected before the commencement of the bill, where that information is used or disclosed by the organisation after that commencement. The ability to access and correct existing information that is used or disclosed after commencement of the bill will also assist organisations to comply with their obligations under national privacy principle 3 to make sure that the information it uses or discloses is accurate, complete and up to date. However, the government remains concerned that even a limited extension of access and correction rights to existing information could impose onerous burdens for organisations. Accordingly, the government has made it clear in proposed government amendment (3) that organisations are not required to comply with national privacy principle 6 where such compliance would place an unreasonable administrative burden on the organisation or cause the organisation unreasonable expense. 
Government amendments (4), (5) and (6) are in response to Senate amendment (22) relating to privacy codes. These amendments relate to privacy codes and the matters about which the Privacy Commissioner must be satisfied before approving a privacy code. Government amendments (4) and (5) insert a new requirement in relation to complaints that have been resolved by a code adjudicator. It requires that a summary of each complaint finally dealt with by the adjudicator be included in the annual report, to be provided by a complaint body to the Privacy Commissioner. This summary should include details about the nature of the complaint, the provisions of the code applied in dealing with the complaint and the outcome of the dealing. Government amendment (6) requires the code to identify who is responsible for the annual reporting requirements—the amendment clarifies that the responsible person may be the code adjudicator or another person nominated in the code. The Privacy Commissioner needs to ensure that the privacy codes he has approved are working effectively. If they are not, he has the power under the bill to revoke his approval. Government amendments (4), (5) and (6) will mean that the Privacy Commissioner will be provided with additional information upon which he or she may base his or her assessment of the effectiveness of the codes.
Government amendment (7), in response to Senate amendment (23), relates to the review of privacy codes. It gives power to the Privacy Commissioner to review the operation of the code complaint process and is intended, as I said, to replace Senate amendment (23). Senate amendment (23) is unacceptable in its current form, as it goes beyond simply looking at code complaints processes and procedures. Government amendment (7) provides that the Privacy Commissioner may review the operation of an approved code. (Extension of time granted) The note inserted after the clause makes it clear that the review of the operation of an approved privacy code may be relevant to an exercise of the Privacy Commissioner's power to revoke the approval of an approved code. The review power will assist the Privacy Commissioner to ensure that privacy codes approved by him or her operate effectively.
Government amendment (8) relating to the review of code adjudicators' decisions by the Privacy Commissioner is in response to Senate amendments (24) and (25) and takes into account Senate amendments (34) and (35), which have been accepted and relate to removal of judicial review of code adjudicators' decisions. Government amendment (8) relates to the review of code adjudicators' determinations by the commissioner and replaces Senate amendments (24) and (25), as those amendments do not sufficiently address all necessary matters to give the amendments full effect. Amendment (8) inserts a new clause that enables a person who has agreed, by a determination made by an adjudicator under an approved privacy code, to apply to the Privacy Commissioner for a review of the adjudicator's determination. The clause confers powers of investigation on the commissioner and provides that the adjudicator's determination will continue to have effect unless and until the Privacy Commissioner makes a new determination. 
The Privacy Commission's power to review decisions made by a code adjudicator effectively replaces the judicial review mechanism in schedule 2 of the bill. The government therefore accepts Senate amendments (34) and (35), which remove the items in the bill that provide for judicial review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. Finally, government amendment (9) is in response to Senate Amendment No. 26 relating to the functions of the commissioner. It is a consequence of government amendments (7) and (8). Government amendment (9) inserts into the bill the new functions conferred on the commissioner by government amendments (7) and (8).

"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,2000-12-05,"—The Attorney-General obviously put detailed reasons to justify the amendments, which should be regarded when subsequently interpreting the legislation. I should indicate at this stage that—particularly in this area where the government has not accepted opposition amendments but has proposed substantially similar amendments—there has been a considerable amount of cooperation between the respective officers, and I express our gratitude for that. Highlighting, however, some of the more significant areas from the opposition's perspective, we regard the fact that there are additional reporting requirements for private sector code adjudicators as being particularly important. Specifically, they will be required, in respect of their adjudication of citizens' complaints, to provide a summary of the nature of the complaint, the provisions of the code which they applied in dealing with the complaint and the outcome of their particular dealing with the complaint. We say that will give the Privacy Commissioner a far better picture as to what is going on in the application of the private sector codes—again enforcing the Privacy Commissioner's overall supervisory role in respect of these private sector codes.
Amendment (7) will provide the Privacy Commissioner with power to review codes, which again we say is particularly significant. In particular, in reviewing these codes the Privacy Commissioner will be empowered to exercise his power to revoke codes if he considers that they are inappropriate or are being applied inappropriately. In considering whether or not to exercise his power to revoke a code, he will consider the process under the code for making and dealing with complaints. He has the power to inspect the records of an adjudicator for the code, to consider the outcome of complaints dealt with under the code and, importantly, to interview an adjudicator for the code to assess the competence, bona fides and balance of that private sector code adjudicator.
We also note with some disappointment that the government has not accepted our argument that there should be a prohibition against the misuse or disclosure of information contained in existing databases, but we do recognise the importance, as the government has conceded, of enabling citizens to have access to that information for the purpose of correction. In particular, while the government has not accepted our argument that it should apply to all existing databases, save for one complication that I will mention, the government has at least conceded that it will apply, post the commencement of the legislation, to information that is used or disclosed. That will give Australians a significant protection, as the Attorney-General indicated, in many areas but particularly, for instance, in real estate if there is some misunderstanding of a particular citizen's financial position or rental record. That is a very significant amendment.
We also note that the government has appropriately picked up our exemption in regard to an unreasonable administrative burden. We are not saying—nor is the government for that matter—that, in the way the legislation is framed, businesses will be required to go and search wooden boxes containing paper archive records. That would clearly impose an unreasonable impost and expense. However, if the information is contained in a digital form, that will be different.
In respect of the controversial area of political exemptions, we substantially agree with the government that, like the media exemption, there is a substantial issue regarding freedom of speech in a democracy, and by and large we have supported the government's approach. We note, however, that it has agreed to include, by way of a legislative note, a clarification indicating that this information obtained for political purposes cannot be sold or leased or misused. We accept that was not the intention of the government in originally framing the legislation. However, the legislative note will clarify that and bring certainty to the legislation. So overall the legislation is certainly a better package than that which went to the Senate, and that is as a result of cooperation.

"Williams, Daryl, MP",LP,2000-12-05,"—I will be brief. It is nearly two years since I announced the government's decision to legislate to support and strengthen self-regulatory privacy protection in the private sector. The two years will actually be up on 15 December. Since that time there has been extensive consultation, both during the development of the Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Bill 2000 and since I introduced the bill into the House in April. The bill is the result of this comprehensive consultation process and represents a well-considered balance between the need to ensure adequate privacy protection and the need to minimise compliance costs for business.
I have said previously that the bill is the most significant development in the privacy area since the Privacy Act was enacted in 1988. This bill is groundbreaking legislation. In fact, as far as I am aware, it is the first in the world in which there has been a coregulatory, light touch approach adopted rather than a fully regulatory or a completely self-regulatory approach. It seeks to introduce, as I said, a balanced coregulatory approach to privacy protection.
It is essential for the private sector that the bill ensure that full advantage be taken of the opportunities that electronic commerce presents for Australian business and consumers. It is a major part of the government's strategy to improve business and consumer confidence about transacting online, and business has already indicated a willingness to embrace this legislation because, as good businesses know, good privacy is good business. I trust that business will continue to adopt that attitude.
It is important for Australians to have greater confidence in the way that private sector organisations handle their personal information in the future; it is important for the future growth of electronic commerce in Australia. I express the government's appreciation for the support, to the extent that it has been given, of the opposition in dealing with the amendments in this House. I now urge the opposition to support passage of the bill as amended through the Senate. If the bill can be passed by the Senate in the next two days, then it will be to the credit of all concerned and to the benefit of all Australians. I commend the motion and, in due course, the bill as amended to the House.

"Bishop, Bronwyn, MP",LP,2000-12-05,"—I move:
That the bill be now read a second time.
The Commonwealth government, in its 1998 election commitment, Protecting the Sydney Harbour Foreshore, stated that it was committed to preserving the Sydney Harbour foreshore for future generations. The government announced that, as the Department of Defence relocates from certain sites around Sydney Harbour, it would establish a trust to assume management and planning responsibilities for those sites.
This bill was intended to fulfil the government's commitment, but it has been totally transformed in the Senate by the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats. The bill, as it now appears before this House, is not in a form that is acceptable to the government. I will explain in a moment why the bill is not acceptable but, firstly, I would like to state the government's intentions in establishing a Sydney Harbour Federation Trust. Over the last century, the Commonwealth has been custodian of some of the Sydney Harbour foreshore areas of greatest natural and heritage significance. Those lands have been used by the Department of Defence for the activities of both the Navy and the Army. 
Defence is relocating, or in some cases has already relocated, from North Head, Middle Head, Georges Heights, Woolwich and Cockatoo Island as part of the government's program to improve the defence of Australia. As Defence relocates, it is intended that these lands will be vested in the trust. Our bill also allows other Commonwealth foreshore sites to be vested in the trust. On 3 June 2000, Senator Robert Hill, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, announced that two other foreshore sites, Macquarie Lightstation and Snapper Island, would be transferred from the Department of Finance and Administration to the trust.
As the cradle of European settlement and the focus of Australia's most populous city, the harbour is the most powerful image in presenting our nation to the world. 
For the people of Sydney, the harbour provides an avenue for commerce and the transport of people. The harbour and its foreshores are the focus of city living and of recreational pursuits.
For these reasons the government is committed to preserving the harbour and its foreshores for future generations.
The government's intention is to establish the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust to manage the sites with the objectives of:
·	ensuring that management of trust land contributes to preserving the amenity of the Sydney Harbour region;
·	protecting and conserving the environmental and heritage values of the trust land, and establishing suitable land as a park;
·	maximising public access to trust land; and
·	cooperating with Commonwealth, New South Wales and local government bodies.
The trust is to be a transitional body to ensure that the Commonwealth's duty to rehabilitate the former Defence sites is fulfilled, and that the sites are returned to the people of Australia in good order.
The bill in its current form has introduced several concepts that are not consistent with the government's policy for protecting the Sydney Harbour foreshore. These concepts relate primarily to all trust land being designated for incorporation in the Sydney Harbour National Park, the prohibition on the sale of any land and requiring the trust to comply with certain state laws.
The purpose of our amendments is to restore the government's original intentions in establishing a Sydney Harbour Federation Trust whilst accommodating as many as possible of the positive changes that were introduced by the Senate.
Unfortunately, the bill in its current form has significant legal problems. The major concerns relate to conceptual coherence, constitutional validity and legal redundancy and inconsistency. For this reason, it has been necessary to introduce amendments to whole parts of the bill, rather than amend each clause. At first glance, the amendments appear to be a wholesale rewriting of the legislation, but this is not the case. We have managed to incorporate many of the Senate's changes, or at least the thinking behind those changes.
The Senate's bill would require all trust lands to be transferred to New South Wales for incorporation into the Sydney Harbour National Park. We do not accept that this is necessarily the best option for all the sites. The government has stated its commitment to ensuring that suitable land at North Head, Middle Head and Georges Heights is transferred for such purposes, but the future arrangements for the other lands need to be further considered. A primary consideration of the government in its decision to establish a statutory trust was to instigate a planning process, involving the local communities, to determine the best options and outcomes for the conservation and management of these lands. There is little point in establishing a trust if the outcome is predetermined. 
We have clarified the extent of the lands that are to be vested in the trust, to address any concerns that the community may have had about our intentions. There are now two schedules to the bill that include the boundary details. These sites are the initial properties that are to be transferred to the trust upon its establishment, although transfer will only be able to take place progressively as Defence relocates. It should be noted that properties listed in schedule 1 cannot be sold by the trust and must remain in public ownership.
An obvious omission from schedule 1 is the land at North Head. There is nothing sinister about this omission. Due to complexities in relation to land tenure at the site, we have not been able to include the boundary details in the schedule. I repeat, however, that the government is committed to transferring North Head to the trust with the intention that it is eventually incorporated in the Sydney Harbour National Park.
Other land that is to be vested in the trust has been listed separately in schedule 2. This land might be sold, but only if the approved plan relating to those properties has identified sale as the preferred option. It should be noted that a general restriction has been introduced in the bill to ensure that, where significant environmental and heritage values are identified in the relevant plan, trust land cannot be disposed of, other than to the Commonwealth, New South Wales or affected councils, that is, local government. 
In addition to the restrictions on any sale of land, we have also tightened up arrangements for leases. Where the trust is proposing to enter into a lease over 25 years, the proposed terms and conditions of the lease will be subject to a determination that is a disallowable instrument.
The government's original bill provided that the trust would consist of a chair and five members, appointed by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, and that the government of New South Wales would be invited to recommend two members for appointment to the trust. The Senate's amendments increased this to a chair and seven members, including representatives of local government and indigenous interests.
The government is proposing to compromise on the size and composition of the trust, but we believe that the numbers must be limited if the trust is not to become unwieldy. Our amendments now propose a chair and six members. One of the members is to represent indigenous interests and New South Wales will be asked to nominate two representatives, one of whom must be an elected councillor from one of the affected councils.
We will not accept a bill that makes the trust subject to state planning processes and gives a power of veto to the New South Wales government which, so far, does not appear to be prepared to cooperate with the Commonwealth government in this exercise.
In our amendments, we have reinstated the exemption for the trust from certain New South Wales laws.
Debate interrupted; adjournment proposed and negatived.
—If the trust were to be subject to state laws, its ability to develop and implement plans would be severely constrained. The trust is expected to work in close cooperation with the New South Wales government and local government authorities. The process in the bill, incorporating our amendments, for development of plans is similar to state processes and we have inserted an obligation for the minister to consult New South Wales on a plan. The minister must then consider these comments when deciding whether to approve a plan.
Our amendments have standardised on a two-year time frame for the trust to develop plans for the conservation and management of its lands and the trust is restricted to operating within the confines of the plans. We have also increased the provisions for public scrutiny of the trust's actions by making trust meetings open to the public, and copies of minutes and other trust documents and reports are to be publicly available.
The government has made a genuine effort to respond to as many as possible of the changes that were made in the Senate. I believe that we have made some significant compromises and have rectified the problems relating to legal coherence and inconsistency. I cannot commend the bill to the House in its present form and will be moving these amendments to reflect government policy and our discussions with the community and local council groups.

"Cox, David, MP",ALP,2000-12-05,"—The local government component of the Roads to Recovery Program is being distributed between the states under a formula based on the length of local roads and on population. The Minister for Transport and Regional Services has, however, declined to release that formula and instead has taken the extraordinary step of referring to a tabled list in the bill that sets out each local government body's entitlement. He claims this secret formula will advantage South Australia—it needs to.
In 1999-2000, South Australia received the lowest local government identified roads grant of any of the states in terms of dollars per kilometre. South Australia received less than $300 per kilometre whereas Western Australia, Queensland and Victoria each received between $400 and $600 per kilometre, New South Wales almost $800 per kilometre and Tasmania more than $1,400 per kilometre. Expressed in per capita terms, South Australia again came out worst, with less than $15 per capita, whereas New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia received between $15 and $35 per capita, while Tasmania received almost $45. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table provided to me by the Local Government Association of South Australia.
—The member for Kingston seeks to have a table incorporated in Hansard.
—Mr Speaker, I have no confirmation that this has been discussed with the relevant shadow minister, so I will decline leave.
—It may be possible, in fact, to have a look at the table and to reconsider the matter.
—I find it a particularly unusual thing to do in an adjournment debate. I decline leave.
—I understand that the division of shares between the states—by which South Australia does so badly: 5.5 per cent—was part of some piece of ancient history, the logic of which neither the Commonwealth Treasury nor the Office of Local Government is now able to explain. South Australia's share of the Roads to Recovery local government allocation is 8.3 per cent. However, the Roads to Recovery Program represents only half the Commonwealth funding that will be received for local roads and it will expire in four years, at which time South Australia's share will revert to 5.5 per cent. It would have been far better if the opportunity of this additional funding had been used to make the relativities between the states fairer on a permanent basis.
There are two local councils that cover my electorate of Kingston. The City of Onkaparinga will receive Roads to Recovery funding of $5.5 million over four years. The City of Marion will receive $2.4 million over the four years. Another component of the Roads to Recovery Program is $400 million to be spent over the four years from 2001-02 for—in the words used by the Deputy Prime Minister in his letter to me:
... developing key arterial link roads in outer metropolitan areas. The Government will provide details of this programme next year once it has assessed and prioritised potential projects.
Priority in federal road funding has always gone to the national highway system, to roads designated as of national significance and to black spots. The area where there are the largest community benefits, though, is urban arterial roads. I was therefore very interested in the Deputy Prime Minister's letter. Noting that the government has not yet `assessed and prioritised potential projects', I immediately contacted the respective mayors and city managers of the cities of Marion and Onkaparinga to discuss what suggestions we might pass on to the minister. 
Two of those suggestions are linked. The first, in the City of Onkaparinga, is Commercial Road, south of the Onkaparinga River. Commercial Road services a major outer urban growth area. It carries a very large volume of traffic and is in poor condition, and the state government's attitude has led me to doubt it will ever give it appropriate priority. Commercial Road is connected to Lonsdale Road and together they service 35 kilometres of beachside suburbs. Lonsdale Road is in the City of Marion. Intersections connecting Hallett Cove, Sheidow and Trott Park and Woodend to Lonsdale Road create a substantial traffic hazardthere have been fatalities, including one in the last monthand impede traffic flow. Lonsdale Road also divides the community, with residents of Sheidow and Trott Park and Woodend having impeded access to shops and community facilities—including churches—and also the rail line and the beach. I have asked the Marion council to look at some engineering solutions that would alleviate these problems. These two projects fit the criteria of outer metropolitan arterial roads.
There are two other projects that I discussed with the two councils: upgrading the wine roads connecting McLaren Vale to other local wine regions and upgrading Majors Road, which joins Lonsdale Road and South Road and services the Onkaparinga TAFE. I will forward these four proposals to the minister so that he can consider them in his assessment and prioritisation of potential projects. I understand that, in the Prime Minister's address to the Local Government Association conference, he referred to this funding as for roads of national significance. I hope this does not indicate a split within the government about the objectives of this part of the program. I fear that the central departments may be attempting to thwart the Commonwealth funding arterial links in outer metropolitan areas because of the precedent that would set. In my view, because of the substantial community benefits to be derived from those projects, it is time funding was shifted in that direction.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Roads: Funding</title>,Adjournment,21,1,speech
