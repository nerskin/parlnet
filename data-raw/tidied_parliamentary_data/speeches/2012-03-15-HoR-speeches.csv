Mr GRAY
 (Brand—Special Minister of State and Minister for the Public Service and Integrity) (09:02):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


This bill will implement new family law arrangements for the federal judiciary and Governors-General by amending the Judges’ Pensions Act 1968 and the Governor-General Act 1974.


The new arrangements will allow the former spouse of a judge or of a Governor-General to receive his or her share of a superannuation benefit as a separate benefit at the time of a family law split. This is consistent with family law, which aims to provide separating parties with a clean break.


Under the Family Law Act 1975, superannuation interests for part of the property of a married or de facto partner can be split between separating parties at the time of a property settlement.


However, the current family law arrangements for judges and Governors-General are inconsistent with family law policy of a clean break. The arrangements are also out of step with the other Commonwealth defined benefit superannuation schemes, which have since 2004, provided separate interest benefits to former spouses of scheme members in a family law split.


For judges, the current 'percentage only' arrangements mean that any split of the pension of a judge in a family law settlement only occurs when pension payments are made to a retired judge. Payments to a former spouse do not commence until the judge retires and cease upon the judge’s death. There is no certainty as to the overall quantum of the benefit that the former spouse is entitled to receive.


For Governors-General, there are currently no scheme specific, separate interest arrangements in place to cover the splitting of superannuation pensions.


The bill will address these issues by putting in place scheme specific arrangements for judges and Governors-General which provide a separate interest benefit in the event of a family law split of the superannuation benefit.


As well as bringing the arrangements into line with family law policy and with the other Commonwealth superannuation schemes, the new arrangements will give the parties greater control over their respective individual benefits.


The proposed changes do not mean that the Commonwealth will be determining property settlements. The Family Court or the separating parties will decide whether the superannuation benefit is to be split and, if so, the amount or percentage of the split. The arrangements in the bill will operate when a splitting order or agreement is made in relation to a superannuation interest in the scheme.


The interest of the judge or Governor-General in the superannuation scheme will be valued at the time of the family law split and a separate interest for the former spouse will also be created at this time.


If a pension is not payable to the judge or Governor-General at the time of the split, the pension for the former spouse will be deferred. The deferred pension will become payable when the former spouse reaches his or her retirement age, or before this if he or she is certified as permanently incapacitated. Once the judge or Governor-General retires and commences a pension, that pension will be adjusted to take account of the amount transferred to the former spouse.


If at the time of the family law split a pension is being paid in respect of the judge or Governor General, the pension for the former spouse will be payable immediately and the pension of the judge or Governor-General will be adjusted to take account of the amount transferred to the former spouse.


The bill also includes transitional provisions to cover existing family law cases in the Judges’ Pensions Scheme. The transitional arrangements provide the former spouse with a separate interest pension from the date the legislation comes into force, based on the splitting percentage in the court order or agreement. There are also safeguards to make sure that there would be no unintended consequences for the parties arising from the proposed new arrangements.


The reforms proposed by the bill are an important step to align the family law splitting arrangements for judges and Governors-General with family law principles, and to bring consistency to the family law arrangements across the Commonwealth defined benefit superannuation schemes.


Debate adjourned.

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (09:07):  Tertiary education brings invaluable benefits not only to those who pursue a degree but also to the nation. Our Australian universities are world class. Our top-performing institutions consistently rank in the top 50 in the world. Our Group of Eight research-intensive universities are at the forefront of research and innovation. I am proud that my electorate of Ryan is home to the University of Queensland, an institution which is world renowned. It is said that the purpose of education is to turn an empty mind into an open one. As a nation, we should and do take pride in the calibre of our universities. That is why it is important that we encourage participation in tertiary education and break down the barriers for students who want to obtain a degree. It takes commitment and dedication to complete a university degree and for young people especially that commitment and dedication may also prove to be a sacrifice. It is difficult to put a price on the many benefits a tertiary education brings: higher earning potential, increased and diverse opportunities, and perhaps most importantly the ability to analyse and to be encouraged and enthused to learn.


The Higher Education Support Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012 in items 1 to 9 is intended to 'clarify the application and operation of the indexation provisions of the Higher Education Support Act'. As a result of the government's delay, the original service and amenities amendments were not passed by the parliament. Therefore, instead of an original commencement date of 1 January 2010 with subsequent indexation, the start date will now be 1 January 2012. In line with the government's keen intent to take as much money as possible from tertiary students in Australia, the fee as at 1 January 2012 is $263 and indexation will occur from 2013.


Some might say that this is a very minor amendment, that the bill is only about some minor details. But most Australians are learning to their cost that this government is really not very good with attention to detail, especially financial ones. This is a government which still has not told Australians who the so-called top 500 companies are who will be the basis of revenue gathering under the carbon tax—another minor financial detail. And we know the Gillard Labor government was not really paying very much attention when it began to rack up more than $167 billion of accumulated deficits—more minor financial details.


Today, the government are paying a lot of attention, however, to one financial detail: making sure they increase the student amenities fee from $250 per semester to $263. And yet again there will be no choice in the matter—it is a compulsory charge for every single student. Whether you are full time or part time or perhaps only doing one subject after hours one evening a week, depending on your institution you will also pay the same.


In the past, this government under former Prime Minister Rudd demonstrated that, far from being about a fair go, it would not even allow people in this country the choice about how to improve their lives. It removed full-fee-paying places in universities. Under that program, students had the option to pay upfront for their degree. By abolishing that program, it took away a source of funding for universities to reinvest in their students—another minor financial detail.


Australians are already doing it tough and full-time students are one of the worst affected by cost-of-living pressures. And it is not always possible to work more to cover your costs when students are also supposed to be devoting 40 hours a week to their studies. If members opposite had spent more time in their classes at university and less time at their union offices, they would be aware of this. Yes, payments can be deferred through FEE-HELP, but we know that there is no such thing as a free lunch, so in the future students will then incur an interest bill from the government for their FEE-HELP debt.


So the consequence of this increase to fees is another contribution to Australia's net debt. The Labor government have already accumulated $167 billion in deficits, so I guess that their approach is, 'Well, what's a little more added to Australia's bill?'—yet another minor detail.


The coalition does care. This is why, when we form government, we will look to review this service-and-amenities fee, just as the Howard government did. The government want to maintain the proposition that this is a very minor bill, but it will cause major problems for the tertiary education system as well as the science and research industry in this nation. Reintroducing compulsory student unionism by proxy was bad enough, but the Labor government also halved the rate of upfront discounts for students from 20 per cent to 10 per cent and they halved the reduction for voluntary payments in excess of the minimum requirement. They changed the conditions under which a student is eligible to receive Centrelink benefits to make it virtually impossible for them to get a job, work hard earning money and then study knowing that they have the support of their government. Tertiary students in Australia are not supported by the Labor government.


The Labor government have abandoned their commitment to NCRIS, the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy, implemented by the Howard government in 2005. The NCRIS provided $542 million between 2005 and 2011 so that universities could actually ensure they had access to world-class technology with which to do their research. Even more importantly, this program meant that world-class professors and researchers had a reason to come to Australia to do their research and to share their knowledge with Australian scientists. In 2011, the government threatened to cut more than $200 million from medical research. In 2012, they are cutting the funding by stealth by not recommitting to this very critical scheme. Knowing the poor and reckless financial mismanagement that the government practises, I would be very concerned if even a single dollar were being taken by them from taxpayers. In a small way, it is fortunate that the money goes directly to the university. It is even more fortunate for the residents of Ryan at the University of Queensland that there is a very professional and well-organised team managing the student union who I know will spend the funds wisely and judiciously. I have spoken before in this House of their very laudable successes. Indeed, many businesspeople have commented to me after their dealings with the University of Queensland Liberal Club and Fresh team that they would be more than delighted to employ them in their own companies.


Our university sector is vital and student choice is critical to its success. Education is our children's future, but equally it is our nation's future. Every barrier we remove will be repaid countless times over. Every step we as a nation take to improve access to education will open not just minds but hope, reward and opportunity.

"Livermore, Kirsten, MP",ALP,2012-03-15,"



Ms LIVERMORE
 (Capricornia) (09:15):  I rise to support the Higher Education Support Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012. This bill is a straightforward but necessary bill to clarify some aspects of the Higher Education Support Act, which, among other things, is the vehicle by which our universities are provided with Commonwealth government funding.


To start with, the bill clears up some problems relating to indexation arrangements that arose due to the passage in 2010 of the Higher Education Support Amendment (Indexation) Act. That act had the effect of introducing some ambiguities into the application and operation of the indexation provisions of the Higher Education Support Act. Specifically, the indexation arrangements cleared up in this bill are for amounts including Commonwealth contribution amounts under the Commonwealth Grant Scheme, maximum student contribution amounts, the FEE-HELP limit, the maximum OS-HELP amount, and the maximum amount of the student services and amenities fee on 1 January 2011. The bill makes it clear that indexation should have been applied to all amounts in the act on 1 January 2011, as provided for under the previous indexation provisions. It also makes clear that the amounts that are indexed on 1 January 2012 are the 2011 indexed amounts.


As I said, the bill is technical in nature but nonetheless the changes included in it will benefit the higher education sector in Australia—and, indeed, you could say that about any bill that the government brings into the parliament relating to higher education. We have been determined as a government to undo the damage done to the sector by the Howard government—damage that started with savage cuts in 1996 and continued as that government pursued a course of chronic underinvestment in universities coupled with constant meddling in their internal administration. This government, in contrast, sees universities as important partners in an agenda that recognises education in all its forms as core to achieving our objectives for economic prosperity and social equity in this country.


Following the advice of the Bradley review we have set ambitious targets for participation in higher education in the medium term. By 2025 we want 40 per cent of Australian 25- to 34-year-olds to have a bachelor level qualification or higher degree. It was with great pleasure that I noted the announcement earlier this month by the education minister that we have achieved significant progress on that measure. Thanks to the government's investment in the higher education sector and much fairer and more generous support for students, there has been a 27 per cent increase in the number of student places at universities since 2007, or an increase of 150,000 extra university students in Australia.


There are further targets for universities to meet in terms of the participation and graduation of people from traditionally underrepresented groups, such as Indigenous people and those from low-socioeconomic backgrounds as well as those from rural areas. I just note in that regard the announcement by my local university, CQ University, just last week of its appointment of the first Pro-Vice-Chancellor, Indigenous Engagement, Dr Bronwyn Fredericks, and welcome Bronwyn back to Central Queensland to take up that very, very important position at the university and one which is going to open up incredible opportunities for Indigenous people throughout Queensland.


The targets that I have talked about are bold targets and they have been matched by equally bold reforms to help the higher education sector to meet them. Chief among those is the shift from 1 January this year to demand-driven funding. No longer will the Commonwealth government decide how many students will study what course at which university, effectively setting caps on course numbers according to how many Commonwealth funded places go to each university; instead, under the demand-driven funding model, universities are free to make their own decisions about how many students they are prepared to enrol in particular courses. Students who meet those enrolment requirements set by a university will attract Commonwealth funding to match those enrolments.


Such a big change has required universities to think about what they have to offer and what they need to do to meet the needs of students in the broader community. To help universities make that transition, the government has made available structural adjustment funding and numerous rounds of funding to boost infrastructure and to reward quality teaching. I am pleased to say that my local university, CQ University, has received a handsome share of that structural adjustment funding in a very competitive and rigorous assessment process. So the education reforms that I have talked about are evident in our region in a very tangible way.


In response to the reform agenda under way in the higher education sector and to the economic growth going on in our region, CQ University has looked closely at how it can best meet the needs of local industries and communities and provide opportunities for people wanting to fill the skills gaps that exist in so many important occupations in Central Queensland. One way the university is doing that is by greatly increasing the courses on offer in allied health disciplines. Last year the university established programs in ultrasound and sonography, nutrition, mental health nursing, paramedic science, pathology and clinical investigation, among others. These new courses have proved popular, with enrolments meeting the first year targets and continuing to demonstrate strong support from students in 2012.


I am pleased to say that these courses have now been added to. In 2012 the first students were welcomed into courses including physiotherapy, podiatry, speech pathology, chiropractic and occupational therapy. I note that one of the amendments in this bill makes a change to the definition of 'a course of study in dentistry'. Students are able to use FEE-HELP to pay their tuition fees up to the amount of the FEE-HELP limit. There is a higher amount of FEE-HELP available to students enrolled in certain courses, including dentistry. For example, the general FEE-HELP limit in 2012 is $89,706. However, the limit is higher for those students enrolled in a course of study in either veterinary science, medicine and dentistry—up to an amount of just over $112,000.


The important point in this bill is to clarify exactly what is meant by a course of study in dentistry or veterinary science. The change means that only students undertaking courses of study in dentistry or veterinary science that satisfy a minimum academic requirement for registration as a dentist or vet surgeon are eligible for that higher FEE-HELP limit. Students undertaking courses of study that lead to registration as a specialist—in other words, going beyond those minimum registration requirements—are not entitled to the higher FEE-HELP limit.


The reference in this bill to a course in dentistry caught my eye because one of the courses that CQ University has been working very hard to make available from the start of 2012 is a degree in oral health. Graduates from the oral health program will be oral health therapists, qualified to perform preventative and operative dentistry—things like examination, risk assessment, diagnosis of periodontal disease and dental caries, scaling and cleaning, and oral hygiene instruction. This is the only oral health degree program being offered in Queensland. It has shifted from Griffith University, where that university has elected to concentrate on its dentistry program and close down its oral health degree. CQ University has now picked that up.


There are 28 students enrolled in this first year of the degree at CQU. The program has strong links into the sector with clinical placements being made available within Queensland Health, including access to two dental chairs in the school dental service and access to two chairs at the community dental clinic at the base hospital. An additional 12 dental chairs will be located at the CQ University public health clinic. The public health clinic is central to the university's major investment in allied health and it is something I am pleased to say has been strongly supported by our government.


The Gillard government is funding the $20 million needed to establish the allied health clinic. That is $6 million from Health Workforce Australia and $14 million from the Structural Adjustment Fund. This facility will allow students in disciplines like physiotherapy, podiatry, speech pathology and oral health to participate in supervised clinical placements in the on-campus clinic. Members of the public will be able to access the clinic for treatment, taking pressure off waiting lists for so many allied health services at the same time as supporting our health professionals of the future.


This clinic will make a really significant contribution to health care in the Rockhampton region. It will allow us to train our own home-grown allied health professionals with a much higher chance that they will stay and practice in the region and relieve the chronic shortages that we have suffered in so many areas of health care. Those students will gain their clinical skills by treating members of the public under appropriate supervision, so the addition to our overall health services will be felt immediately.


Heading up the oral health school is someone who is no stranger to Parliament House and this chamber. I thought those members who have been around for a while—not quite the new parliamentary secretary at the table, Ms Bird, who came a bit later, but certainly the member for Lingiari, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs—might like to know that Leonie Short, the former member for Ryan, has joined Central Queensland University as an associate professor. She has guided the new course through its accreditation and now has the satisfaction of overseeing the progress of those 28 new oral health students. I know how lucky we are to have someone of Leonie's experience, not to mention her passion for education, taking the lead on this program. I welcome her to Rockhampton and wish her and her team all the best in getting the oral health degree firmly established as a top choice for students in Central Queensland.


I mentioned at the start of this speech that the bill seeks to clarify the application of indexation provisions in the act for a range of amounts relevant to the higher education sector. One of those amounts is the student services and amenities fee that we have heard so much about from our friends opposite. The fee, of up to $263 per year, can now be charged by universities to offset the cost of providing student services and amenities. I will list some of those because we did not hear any of them from the other side with their obsession with political campaigns and student unions. These fees go to things like child care, food outlets, legal services and sporting facilities on our university campuses.


The fee was reinstated with the passage last year of the Higher Education Support Amendment (Student Services and Amenities) Bill 2011. The battle over a student services fee has been a long one. In fact, it is a battle that most of the opposition MPs have been fighting since their own university days and, as evidenced by this debate, even now you just have to say the words 'student union' and you will have them in a lather. Right on cue, as classes commenced for the year at CQ University, the member for Dawson and the member for Flynn put out their template press releases having a go at their local university for asking students to pay a fee for a range of services made available to them on those campuses.


I will describe for the House what these campuses are like. In Mackay and Rockhampton, two of the relevant campuses, the campuses are on the edge of those cities. They are a reasonable distance from other services such as shops, local government offices and service providers. They are not big campuses and do not have thousands and thousands of students. You are talking about much smaller numbers of students than some of the examples that have been given by other members in this debate, like Sydney University with 30,000 students. These are campuses that are a little bit removed from those cities of Rockhampton and Mackay and they do not have a lot of students able to support provision by the private sector of some of those services.


We have heard all the usual ideological arguments from the other side, and certainly from the member for Dawson and the member for Flynn in their media comments and speeches about the evils of student unions. They reminded me that probably the most overt political activity that I can remember on the CQ campus was that engaged in by the member for Dawson with his infamous editorship of The Student Advocate which among other things said how stupid women are. If you want to talk about politics at CQU the member for Dawson is probably the person to talk to.


The fact is that, by law, this student services fee cannot be used for political purposes. It is a fee that students are not required to pay upfront; rather, it can be deferred as part of their FEE-HELP debt to be paid back when they are earning graduate salaries. It is a fee that goes towards providing health services, child care, student advocacy, sporting facilities, counsellors, career advice and accommodation support. It is a fee that drew its strongest support from regional universities that have seen the biggest reductions on campus services due to the Howard government's VSU legislation. Again, the examples were given of the big city universities. They may very well be able to go and find private providers for some of these. Someone who knows a thing or two about regional campuses is the Vice-Chancellor of James Cook University, Sandra Harding, who said: 'Regional students were especially dependent on the services that had been weakened since the abolition of compulsory student union levies. Regional students are more likely to have had to move away from their families to attend university and rely more on the welfare and support services that were provided from the previous fees.'


Our regional universities, like JCU and CQU, know what they need to do to attract students and support them while they are completing their studies. On all its campuses CQU has been investing to create an environment which gives students opportunities to get involved in activities beyond the classroom and experience all that university life has to offer. The members in electorates to my north and south, Dawson and Flynn, might want to support the university and some of its applications for funding rather than take cheap shots at it in this ideological crusade.



The SPEAKER:  The question is that this bill be now read a second time. I now give the call to the Hon. the Parliamentary Secretary for Higher Education and Skills and congratulate her on her appointment. I believe this is her maiden summing up.

Ms BIRD
 (Cunningham—Parliamentary Secretary for Higher Education and Skills) (09:30):  That would be correct, Mr Speaker, and thank you very much. I am sure my colleagues on the other side will give me lots of support in the process of doing my first summing up.



Mr Tony Smith interjecting—




Ms BIRD:
  I am sure you are here to help me. I thank those members who spoke on the Higher Education Support Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012. I have had the opportunity to hear a significant number of the contributions to the debate on this bill. The bill before the House amends the Higher Education Support Act 2003 to clarify the application and operation of indexation arrangements in the act. It updates the definitions of 'course of study in dentistry' and 'course of study in veterinary science' and updates the Melbourne College of Divinity's name in light of its approval to operate under the title MCD University of Divinity.


The bill also allows for technical amendments to the calculation of the voluntary repayment bonus to resolve rounding issues. The terms 'course of study in dentistry' and 'course of study in veterinary science' are used to determine which students are eligible for the higher FEE-HELP limit of $112,132 in 2012. The bill would amend the definitions of 'course of study in dentistry' and 'course of study in veterinary science' to clarify that only students undertaking courses of study in dentistry or veterinary science that satisfy the minimum academic requirements for registration as a dentist, veterinary surgeon or veterinary practitioner are eligible for the higher FEE-HELP limit. The Melbourne College of Divinity has been approved by the Victorian Registration and Qualifications Authority to operate under the name MCD University of Divinity until 31 December 2016.


Students can make a voluntary repayment towards their HELP debt to the tax office at any time. Voluntary repayments of $500 or more currently attract a five per cent bonus on the payment amount. When calculating the effect of a person making a voluntary repayment of his or her HELP debt, the act provides for a person to obtain a five per cent bonus and includes rounding rules in calculating whether a person has repaid their debt and the amount of debt repaid if it is only a partial repayment. Currently the effect of the rounding rule is that (a) when making a full repayment the person benefits from the rounding because the amount of payment required to pay off their debt in full is reduced because the cents are rounded down; and (b) when making a partial repayment the person is disadvantaged because the value of the reduction to the outstanding debt due to a payment is rounded down. The bill amends the act to provide that when calculating the effect of a person making a partial repayment towards his or her HELP debt the amount would be rounded up to the nearest dollar. The cents would continue to be rounded down to determine the amount required for the full repayment of a person's HELP debt amount. Effectively the rounding rules will now always benefit a person making a voluntary repayment.


Many members opposite have taken the opportunity in debate on this bill to once again state their opposition to improved student services and amenities on campus, an issue canvassed by the member for Capricornia, who spoke before me. They have rehashed old flawed arguments in opposition to this bill. This government has not reintroduced compulsory student unionism. We have created a source of funding for vital student services and amenities on campus. No university is required to give any of this funding to student controlled organisations but some of them will, because some student organisations—despite all the obstacles put in their way by members opposite—deliver excellent and important services to students.


Members opposite have also suggested in the debate that this bill represents a fee hike. It simply does not. Government members, during the passage of the original bill, were clear that the maximum fee chargeable by a university would be $263 in 2012. Given the history of the Liberal Party in introducing upfront full fees for domestic undergraduates and their hints that, if they should form a future government, they will deregulate fees, it does seem a bit hypocritical that they would express such concerns about $263 that can be put on HECS and will not need to be repaid until a student is earning a good wage.


Passage of time meant that there was ambiguity in the act about the application of the indexation provisions to amounts in the act on 1 January 2011. The government made clear its intention on the indexation of these matters in both the explanatory memorandum and the debate in the parliament. These amendments do not change the intent of the parliament in passing this legislation but do add clarity in that indexation should have been applied to amounts in the act on 1 January 2011 and that the amounts that are indexed on 1 January 2012 are the 2011 indexed amounts.


The bill reflects the government's continued commitment to improving Australia's higher education sector and expanding opportunities for Australians to obtain a higher quality higher education. I commend the bill to the House.

 (Cowper) (09:36):  by leave—I move amendments (1) and (2) circulated in the name of the member for Farrer:


(1) Schedule 1, item 2, page 3 (lines 6 and 7), omit the item.


(2) Schedule 1, item 4, page 3 (lines 10 and 11), omit the item.


These amendments would remove the proposed increase to the student services and amenities fee and references to subsequent indexation of that fee. The coalition remains opposed to the student union fee. We introduced voluntary student union fees in 2005 for the very reason that students deserve the right to choose whether they join an association and whether they wish to pay for the services on offer. Not every student is happy to help fund the orienteering club, the campaign rosters for the union president or the student newspaper. The coalition believes that, while we are not in a position to repeal the fee, this amendment would at least prevent this fee increasing and prevent future indexation of the fee.

Ms BIRD
 (Cunningham—Parliamentary Secretary for Higher Education and Skills) (09:38):  The government will not be supporting these amendments. The government's intent with the bill is to clarify indexation arrangements. The ambiguity arose as a result of amendments of the indexation provisions in the act that were made by the Higher Education Support Amendment (Indexation) Act 2010. The amendments proposed by the opposition, if passed, would substantially change arrangements for the student services and amenities fee. They would change section 19-37(5)(e) to say that a student services and amenities fee cannot be more than $250 for a calendar year, starting 1 January 2012. The government is not changing the amount of the student services and amenities fee; it is making clear that the amount of the fee is $263 in 2012. The student services and amenities fee in the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Student Services and Amenities) Act 2011 was a 2010 amount. It was always intended that this amount would be indexed on 1 January 2011 and in each subsequent year. This intention was clearly highlighted in the explanatory memorandum for the student services and amenities act. The explanatory memorandum provides that the fee will be indexed to $254 in 2011 and indexed annually thereafter. During the debate in the Senate the government explicitly indicated that, under the proposed arrangements, the fee would be $263 in 2012. Universities are already charging student services and amenities fees up to $263. The opposition's amendments would mean that universities would be breaching section 19-37. There are substantial penalties for breaching that section of the act. It is not reasonable to change these arrangements retrospectively. We do not support the amendments.



The SPEAKER:  The question before the chair is that the amendments be agreed to.


Bill agreed to.

 (Ryan) (09:07):  Tertiary education brings invaluable benefits not only to those who pursue a degree but also to the nation. Our Australian universities are world class.

I am proud that my electorate of Ryan is home to the University of Queensland, an institution which is world renowned.

It is difficult to put a price on the many benefits a tertiary education brings: higher earning potential, increased and diverse opportunities, and perhaps most importantly the ability to analyse and to be encouraged and enthused to learn.


The Higher Education Support Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012 in items 1 to 9 is intended to 'clarify the application and operation of the indexation provisions of the Higher Education Support Act'. As a result of the government's delay, the original service and amenities amendments were not passed by the parliament. Therefore, instead of an original commencement date of 1 January 2010 with subsequent indexation, the start date will now be 1 January 2012. In line with the government's keen intent to take as much money as possible from tertiary students in Australia, the fee as at 1 January 2012 is $263 and indexation will occur from 2013.


Some might say that this is a very minor amendment, that the bill is only about some minor details. But most Australians are learning to their cost that this government is really not very good with attention to detail, especially financial ones. This is a government which still has not told Australians who the so-called top 500 companies are who will be the basis of revenue gathering under the carbon tax—another minor financial detail. And we know the Gillard Labor government was not really paying very much attention when it began to rack up more than $167 billion of accumulated deficits—more minor financial details.


Today, the government are paying a lot of attention, however, to one financial detail: making sure they increase the student amenities fee from $250 per semester to $263. And yet again there will be no choice in the matter—it is a compulsory charge for every single student. Whether you are full time or part time or perhaps only doing one subject after hours one evening a week, depending on your institution you will also pay the same.


In the past, this government under former Prime Minister Rudd demonstrated that, far from being about a fair go, it would not even allow people in this country the choice about how to improve their lives. It removed full-fee-paying places in universities. Under that program, students had the option to pay upfront for their degree. By abolishing that program, it took away a source of funding for universities to reinvest in their students—another minor financial detail.


Australians are already doing it tough and full-time students are one of the worst affected by cost-of-living pressures. And it is not always possible to work more to cover your costs when students are also supposed to be devoting 40 hours a week to their studies. If members opposite had spent more time in their classes at university and less time at their union offices, they would be aware of this. Yes, payments can be deferred through FEE-HELP, but we know that there is no such thing as a free lunch, so in the future students will then incur an interest bill from the government for their FEE-HELP debt.


So the consequence of this increase to fees is another contribution to Australia's net debt. The Labor government have already accumulated $167 billion in deficits, so I guess that their approach is, 'Well, what's a little more added to Australia's bill?'—yet another minor detail.


The coalition does care. This is why, when we form government, we will look to review this service-and-amenities fee, just as the Howard government did. The government want to maintain the proposition that this is a very minor bill, but it will cause major problems for the tertiary education system as well as the science and research industry in this nation. Reintroducing compulsory student unionism by proxy was bad enough, but the Labor government also halved the rate of upfront discounts for students from 20 per cent to 10 per cent and they halved the reduction for voluntary payments in excess of the minimum requirement. They changed the conditions under which a student is eligible to receive Centrelink benefits to make it virtually impossible for them to get a job, work hard earning money and then study knowing that they have the support of their government. Tertiary students in Australia are not supported by the Labor government.


The Labor government have abandoned their commitment to NCRIS, the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy, implemented by the Howard government in 2005. The NCRIS provided $542 million between 2005 and 2011 so that universities could actually ensure they had access to world-class technology with which to do their research. Even more importantly, this program meant that world-class professors and researchers had a reason to come to Australia to do their research and to share their knowledge with Australian scientists. In 2011, the government threatened to cut more than $200 million from medical research. In 2012, they are cutting the funding by stealth by not recommitting to this very critical scheme. Knowing the poor and reckless financial mismanagement that the government practises, I would be very concerned if even a single dollar were being taken by them from taxpayers. In a small way, it is fortunate that the money goes directly to the university. It is even more fortunate for the residents of Ryan at the University of Queensland that there is a very professional and well-organised team managing the student union who I know will spend the funds wisely and judiciously. I have spoken before in this House of their very laudable successes. Indeed, many businesspeople have commented to me after their dealings with the University of Queensland Liberal Club and Fresh team that they would be more than delighted to employ them in their own companies.


Our university sector is vital and student choice is critical to its success. Education is our children's future, but equally it is our nation's future. Every barrier we remove will be repaid countless times over. Every step we as a nation take to improve access to education will open not just minds but hope, reward and opportunity.

"Livermore, Kirsten, MP",ALP,2012-03-15,"



Ms LIVERMORE
 (Capricornia) (09:15):  I rise to support the Higher Education Support Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012. This bill is a straightforward but necessary bill to clarify some aspects of the Higher Education Support Act, which, among other things, is the vehicle by which our universities are provided with Commonwealth government funding.


To start with, the bill clears up some problems relating to indexation arrangements that arose due to the passage in 2010 of the Higher Education Support Amendment (Indexation) Act. That act had the effect of introducing some ambiguities into the application and operation of the indexation provisions of the Higher Education Support Act. Specifically, the indexation arrangements cleared up in this bill are for amounts including Commonwealth contribution amounts under the Commonwealth Grant Scheme, maximum student contribution amounts, the FEE-HELP limit, the maximum OS-HELP amount, and the maximum amount of the student services and amenities fee on 1 January 2011. The bill makes it clear that indexation should have been applied to all amounts in the act on 1 January 2011, as provided for under the previous indexation provisions. It also makes clear that the amounts that are indexed on 1 January 2012 are the 2011 indexed amounts.


As I said, the bill is technical in nature but nonetheless the changes included in it will benefit the higher education sector in Australia—and, indeed, you could say that about any bill that the government brings into the parliament relating to higher education. We have been determined as a government to undo the damage done to the sector by the Howard government—damage that started with savage cuts in 1996 and continued as that government pursued a course of chronic underinvestment in universities coupled with constant meddling in their internal administration. This government, in contrast, sees universities as important partners in an agenda that recognises education in all its forms as core to achieving our objectives for economic prosperity and social equity in this country.


Following the advice of the Bradley review we have set ambitious targets for participation in higher education in the medium term. By 2025 we want 40 per cent of Australian 25- to 34-year-olds to have a bachelor level qualification or higher degree. It was with great pleasure that I noted the announcement earlier this month by the education minister that we have achieved significant progress on that measure. Thanks to the government's investment in the higher education sector and much fairer and more generous support for students, there has been a 27 per cent increase in the number of student places at universities since 2007, or an increase of 150,000 extra university students in Australia.


There are further targets for universities to meet in terms of the participation and graduation of people from traditionally underrepresented groups, such as Indigenous people and those from low-socioeconomic backgrounds as well as those from rural areas. I just note in that regard the announcement by my local university, CQ University, just last week of its appointment of the first Pro-Vice-Chancellor, Indigenous Engagement, Dr Bronwyn Fredericks, and welcome Bronwyn back to Central Queensland to take up that very, very important position at the university and one which is going to open up incredible opportunities for Indigenous people throughout Queensland.


The targets that I have talked about are bold targets and they have been matched by equally bold reforms to help the higher education sector to meet them. Chief among those is the shift from 1 January this year to demand-driven funding. No longer will the Commonwealth government decide how many students will study what course at which university, effectively setting caps on course numbers according to how many Commonwealth funded places go to each university; instead, under the demand-driven funding model, universities are free to make their own decisions about how many students they are prepared to enrol in particular courses. Students who meet those enrolment requirements set by a university will attract Commonwealth funding to match those enrolments.


Such a big change has required universities to think about what they have to offer and what they need to do to meet the needs of students in the broader community. To help universities make that transition, the government has made available structural adjustment funding and numerous rounds of funding to boost infrastructure and to reward quality teaching. I am pleased to say that my local university, CQ University, has received a handsome share of that structural adjustment funding in a very competitive and rigorous assessment process. So the education reforms that I have talked about are evident in our region in a very tangible way.


In response to the reform agenda under way in the higher education sector and to the economic growth going on in our region, CQ University has looked closely at how it can best meet the needs of local industries and communities and provide opportunities for people wanting to fill the skills gaps that exist in so many important occupations in Central Queensland. One way the university is doing that is by greatly increasing the courses on offer in allied health disciplines. Last year the university established programs in ultrasound and sonography, nutrition, mental health nursing, paramedic science, pathology and clinical investigation, among others. These new courses have proved popular, with enrolments meeting the first year targets and continuing to demonstrate strong support from students in 2012.


I am pleased to say that these courses have now been added to. In 2012 the first students were welcomed into courses including physiotherapy, podiatry, speech pathology, chiropractic and occupational therapy. I note that one of the amendments in this bill makes a change to the definition of 'a course of study in dentistry'. Students are able to use FEE-HELP to pay their tuition fees up to the amount of the FEE-HELP limit. There is a higher amount of FEE-HELP available to students enrolled in certain courses, including dentistry. For example, the general FEE-HELP limit in 2012 is $89,706. However, the limit is higher for those students enrolled in a course of study in either veterinary science, medicine and dentistry—up to an amount of just over $112,000.


The important point in this bill is to clarify exactly what is meant by a course of study in dentistry or veterinary science. The change means that only students undertaking courses of study in dentistry or veterinary science that satisfy a minimum academic requirement for registration as a dentist or vet surgeon are eligible for that higher FEE-HELP limit. Students undertaking courses of study that lead to registration as a specialist—in other words, going beyond those minimum registration requirements—are not entitled to the higher FEE-HELP limit.


The reference in this bill to a course in dentistry caught my eye because one of the courses that CQ University has been working very hard to make available from the start of 2012 is a degree in oral health. Graduates from the oral health program will be oral health therapists, qualified to perform preventative and operative dentistry—things like examination, risk assessment, diagnosis of periodontal disease and dental caries, scaling and cleaning, and oral hygiene instruction. This is the only oral health degree program being offered in Queensland. It has shifted from Griffith University, where that university has elected to concentrate on its dentistry program and close down its oral health degree. CQ University has now picked that up.


There are 28 students enrolled in this first year of the degree at CQU. The program has strong links into the sector with clinical placements being made available within Queensland Health, including access to two dental chairs in the school dental service and access to two chairs at the community dental clinic at the base hospital. An additional 12 dental chairs will be located at the CQ University public health clinic. The public health clinic is central to the university's major investment in allied health and it is something I am pleased to say has been strongly supported by our government.


The Gillard government is funding the $20 million needed to establish the allied health clinic. That is $6 million from Health Workforce Australia and $14 million from the Structural Adjustment Fund. This facility will allow students in disciplines like physiotherapy, podiatry, speech pathology and oral health to participate in supervised clinical placements in the on-campus clinic. Members of the public will be able to access the clinic for treatment, taking pressure off waiting lists for so many allied health services at the same time as supporting our health professionals of the future.


This clinic will make a really significant contribution to health care in the Rockhampton region. It will allow us to train our own home-grown allied health professionals with a much higher chance that they will stay and practice in the region and relieve the chronic shortages that we have suffered in so many areas of health care. Those students will gain their clinical skills by treating members of the public under appropriate supervision, so the addition to our overall health services will be felt immediately.


Heading up the oral health school is someone who is no stranger to Parliament House and this chamber. I thought those members who have been around for a while—not quite the new parliamentary secretary at the table, Ms Bird, who came a bit later, but certainly the member for Lingiari, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs—might like to know that Leonie Short, the former member for Ryan, has joined Central Queensland University as an associate professor. She has guided the new course through its accreditation and now has the satisfaction of overseeing the progress of those 28 new oral health students. I know how lucky we are to have someone of Leonie's experience, not to mention her passion for education, taking the lead on this program. I welcome her to Rockhampton and wish her and her team all the best in getting the oral health degree firmly established as a top choice for students in Central Queensland.


I mentioned at the start of this speech that the bill seeks to clarify the application of indexation provisions in the act for a range of amounts relevant to the higher education sector. One of those amounts is the student services and amenities fee that we have heard so much about from our friends opposite. The fee, of up to $263 per year, can now be charged by universities to offset the cost of providing student services and amenities. I will list some of those because we did not hear any of them from the other side with their obsession with political campaigns and student unions. These fees go to things like child care, food outlets, legal services and sporting facilities on our university campuses.


The fee was reinstated with the passage last year of the Higher Education Support Amendment (Student Services and Amenities) Bill 2011. The battle over a student services fee has been a long one. In fact, it is a battle that most of the opposition MPs have been fighting since their own university days and, as evidenced by this debate, even now you just have to say the words 'student union' and you will have them in a lather. Right on cue, as classes commenced for the year at CQ University, the member for Dawson and the member for Flynn put out their template press releases having a go at their local university for asking students to pay a fee for a range of services made available to them on those campuses.


I will describe for the House what these campuses are like. In Mackay and Rockhampton, two of the relevant campuses, the campuses are on the edge of those cities. They are a reasonable distance from other services such as shops, local government offices and service providers. They are not big campuses and do not have thousands and thousands of students. You are talking about much smaller numbers of students than some of the examples that have been given by other members in this debate, like Sydney University with 30,000 students. These are campuses that are a little bit removed from those cities of Rockhampton and Mackay and they do not have a lot of students able to support provision by the private sector of some of those services.


We have heard all the usual ideological arguments from the other side, and certainly from the member for Dawson and the member for Flynn in their media comments and speeches about the evils of student unions. They reminded me that probably the most overt political activity that I can remember on the CQ campus was that engaged in by the member for Dawson with his infamous editorship of The Student Advocate which among other things said how stupid women are. If you want to talk about politics at CQU the member for Dawson is probably the person to talk to.


The fact is that, by law, this student services fee cannot be used for political purposes. It is a fee that students are not required to pay upfront; rather, it can be deferred as part of their FEE-HELP debt to be paid back when they are earning graduate salaries. It is a fee that goes towards providing health services, child care, student advocacy, sporting facilities, counsellors, career advice and accommodation support. It is a fee that drew its strongest support from regional universities that have seen the biggest reductions on campus services due to the Howard government's VSU legislation. Again, the examples were given of the big city universities. They may very well be able to go and find private providers for some of these. Someone who knows a thing or two about regional campuses is the Vice-Chancellor of James Cook University, Sandra Harding, who said: 'Regional students were especially dependent on the services that had been weakened since the abolition of compulsory student union levies. Regional students are more likely to have had to move away from their families to attend university and rely more on the welfare and support services that were provided from the previous fees.'


Our regional universities, like JCU and CQU, know what they need to do to attract students and support them while they are completing their studies. On all its campuses CQU has been investing to create an environment which gives students opportunities to get involved in activities beyond the classroom and experience all that university life has to offer. The members in electorates to my north and south, Dawson and Flynn, might want to support the university and some of its applications for funding rather than take cheap shots at it in this ideological crusade.



The SPEAKER:  The question is that this bill be now read a second time. I now give the call to the Hon. the Parliamentary Secretary for Higher Education and Skills and congratulate her on her appointment. I believe this is her maiden summing up.

Ms BIRD
 (Cunningham—Parliamentary Secretary for Higher Education and Skills) (09:30):  That would be correct, Mr Speaker, and thank you very much. I am sure my colleagues on the other side will give me lots of support in the process of doing my first summing up.



Mr Tony Smith interjecting—




Ms BIRD:
  I am sure you are here to help me. I thank those members who spoke on the Higher Education Support Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012. I have had the opportunity to hear a significant number of the contributions to the debate on this bill. The bill before the House amends the Higher Education Support Act 2003 to clarify the application and operation of indexation arrangements in the act. It updates the definitions of 'course of study in dentistry' and 'course of study in veterinary science' and updates the Melbourne College of Divinity's name in light of its approval to operate under the title MCD University of Divinity.


The bill also allows for technical amendments to the calculation of the voluntary repayment bonus to resolve rounding issues. The terms 'course of study in dentistry' and 'course of study in veterinary science' are used to determine which students are eligible for the higher FEE-HELP limit of $112,132 in 2012. The bill would amend the definitions of 'course of study in dentistry' and 'course of study in veterinary science' to clarify that only students undertaking courses of study in dentistry or veterinary science that satisfy the minimum academic requirements for registration as a dentist, veterinary surgeon or veterinary practitioner are eligible for the higher FEE-HELP limit. The Melbourne College of Divinity has been approved by the Victorian Registration and Qualifications Authority to operate under the name MCD University of Divinity until 31 December 2016.


Students can make a voluntary repayment towards their HELP debt to the tax office at any time. Voluntary repayments of $500 or more currently attract a five per cent bonus on the payment amount. When calculating the effect of a person making a voluntary repayment of his or her HELP debt, the act provides for a person to obtain a five per cent bonus and includes rounding rules in calculating whether a person has repaid their debt and the amount of debt repaid if it is only a partial repayment. Currently the effect of the rounding rule is that (a) when making a full repayment the person benefits from the rounding because the amount of payment required to pay off their debt in full is reduced because the cents are rounded down; and (b) when making a partial repayment the person is disadvantaged because the value of the reduction to the outstanding debt due to a payment is rounded down. The bill amends the act to provide that when calculating the effect of a person making a partial repayment towards his or her HELP debt the amount would be rounded up to the nearest dollar. The cents would continue to be rounded down to determine the amount required for the full repayment of a person's HELP debt amount. Effectively the rounding rules will now always benefit a person making a voluntary repayment.


Many members opposite have taken the opportunity in debate on this bill to once again state their opposition to improved student services and amenities on campus, an issue canvassed by the member for Capricornia, who spoke before me. They have rehashed old flawed arguments in opposition to this bill. This government has not reintroduced compulsory student unionism. We have created a source of funding for vital student services and amenities on campus. No university is required to give any of this funding to student controlled organisations but some of them will, because some student organisations—despite all the obstacles put in their way by members opposite—deliver excellent and important services to students.


Members opposite have also suggested in the debate that this bill represents a fee hike. It simply does not. Government members, during the passage of the original bill, were clear that the maximum fee chargeable by a university would be $263 in 2012. Given the history of the Liberal Party in introducing upfront full fees for domestic undergraduates and their hints that, if they should form a future government, they will deregulate fees, it does seem a bit hypocritical that they would express such concerns about $263 that can be put on HECS and will not need to be repaid until a student is earning a good wage.


Passage of time meant that there was ambiguity in the act about the application of the indexation provisions to amounts in the act on 1 January 2011. The government made clear its intention on the indexation of these matters in both the explanatory memorandum and the debate in the parliament. These amendments do not change the intent of the parliament in passing this legislation but do add clarity in that indexation should have been applied to amounts in the act on 1 January 2011 and that the amounts that are indexed on 1 January 2012 are the 2011 indexed amounts.


The bill reflects the government's continued commitment to improving Australia's higher education sector and expanding opportunities for Australians to obtain a higher quality higher education. I commend the bill to the House.

 (Bennelong) (13:45):  On 26 March it is International Purple Day, celebrating and supporting epilepsy awareness across the world. There are more people living with epilepsy than with muscular dystrophy, cerebral palsy, Parkinson's disease and motor neurone disease combined. Close to half a million Australians will be affected by epilepsy at some point in their life. Yet, due to misconceptions and social stigma, many people do not disclose their condition, leading to a low level of community awareness.


In 2008, a nine-year-old who was suffering from epilepsy, Cassidy Megan, founded International Purple Day in a grassroots effort to increase epilepsy awareness worldwide, to encourage people to talk about their epilepsy and to inform those who live with seizures that they are not alone. Epilepsy Action Australia is Australia's national provider of education and support services for people with epilepsy, their families and the community. I am proud that their head office is located in Bennelong, directly behind my electorate office, and I strongly support their great work for epilepsy sufferers around Australia.


On 26 March, I will be joining Epilepsy Action Australia to launch a series of activities for International Purple Day. I encourage all MPs to host a fundraising event to promote plain-clothes day activities in local schools and businesses on 26 March to build awareness of one of the world's most common serious brain conditions.

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:00):  I move:


That the House records its deep regret at the death on 12 March 2012, of the Honourable Douglas Barr Scott, former Senator for New South Wales in 1970 and from 1974 to 1985, former Deputy President of the Senate from 1978 to 1979 and former Federal Minister for Special Trade Representations from 1979 to 1980, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.


Douglas was born on 12 May 1920 in Adelaide, educated at Scotch College in Adelaide and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Sydney. Before entering politics Douglas was a farmer and a grazier. During World War II he served as a member of the Royal Australian Naval Volunteer Reserve from 1941 to 1945, being discharged at the rank of lieutenant. Douglas was initially elected to the Senate for a very brief period of 3½ months in 1970 and re-entered the Senate in 1974, where he served until 1985. He held the positions of Deputy President of the Senate and Chairman of Committees from 1978 to 1979, Minister for Special Trade Representations from 1979 to 1980 and Minister Assisting the Minister for Trade and Resources from 1979 to 1980 in the Fraser government. During his time in the Senate he served on numerous committees. These included the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare and the Senate Standing Committee on Publications, to name just a few. Douglas led parliamentary delegations to South-East Asia, a resources mission to the European Economic Community countries and he attended Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conferences in Mauritius and Nairobi. He also held parliamentary positions in the Senate of Leader and Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia, formerly the National Country Party.


Douglas Barr Scott was a person held in affection and with respect on both sides of the chamber in which he served. In his valedictory from the Senate he recalled that Labor senators Don Grimes and John Button wrote to him after a week or so when he had acted as president saying that they had determined to support him because they liked the way he read the prayers. To have John Button gently tease you was one of the highest honours my party could bestow in those days, so we can take that as a mark of respect and bipartisan support.


On behalf of the government I offer condolences to his wife, Pamela, to his children, Diana and Andrew, and to their extended family and friends.

Mr TRUSS
 (Wide Bay—Leader of The Nationals) (14:04):  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for giving me this opportunity to pay tribute to one of the leaders of The Nationals in a bygone era. The former Deputy Prime Minister and Nationals leader Doug Anthony yesterday described Doug Scott as a 'thorough gentleman who was always dependable and reliable.' That sums up Doug Scott very well—solid, fair minded and decent. 


Indeed, Doug Anthony's comments coincide succinctly with those made on Doug Scott's retirement from the Senate almost 27 years ago, on 31 May 1985, when the Leader of the Government in the Senate at the time, Senator John Button, said:


… Senator Scott has always been, if I might use an old-fashioned word, a gentleman in dealing with everybody in the Senate, including us, and that has been a very nice quality about his presence here.


Those words also coincide with the words of the then Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Fred Chaney, who, in the same debate described Doug Scott as 'one of the great constants' in the Senate and a man whom he had always found utterly reliable. The Nationals historian Paul Davey said, 'Doug Scott was dedicated to his party, to the processes of the parliament and to his responsibilities, particularly as a senator representing predominantly regional New South Wales.'


Even though, as the Prime Minister mentioned, he was born in Adelaide, educated at Scotch College and then received a degree in Sydney, he was a successful farmer and grazier from the Grenfell district and he was be respected throughout the state rural industries and communities; he understood the bush. During World War II he served in the Royal Australian Naval Volunteer Reserve, as we have already heard. In 1948 he married Pamela McLean, and the couple have a son, Andrew, and a daughter, Diana. As his grazing interests grew so did his interest in rural politics and hence in the New South Wales Country Party, which he joined in June 1948. He served on the state executive from 1968 to 1974. He won the party's preselection to fill a casual vacancy caused by the death of Senator Colin McKellar in April 1970 and he took up that seat in August 1970. He failed to win re-election in the half-Senate election in November that year, but he was not deterred. In fact in the double dissolution election of May 1974 he stood again and remained a senator until June 1985, his retirement. 


As we have already heard, he was Deputy President and Chairman of Committees in the Senate and also served as Acting President in the Senate on a number of occasions. He had a particular interest in the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. He was a member for eight years in total, including four as its chairman. He was Deputy Leader of the then National Country Party in the Senate from February 1976 to February 1980, when he was elected the party's Senate leader, a position he held until his retirement. As you heard also, he served in the Fraser-Anthony ministry for just a brief period. His comment that the Leader of the Opposition referred to about having done a lot in life but none of it for very long is something of a reflection also of his parliamentary career.


Doug Scott was a keen sportsman and particularly enjoyed cricket, golf and squash. Fred Chaney remembered encountering his prowess on the squash court when he was, to use his words, 'absolutely whipped' by a man 20 years his senior who at the time was suffering from a very bad hip.


Doug Scott's life came to an end at the Jemalong Residential Village at Forbes after almost 92 years. Douglas Scott should be remembered as a true gentleman of this parliament. While it was a different era, he was certainly a fine example to us all.

Instead, so typically, we have had a Prime Minister looking shifty and evasive, looking angry and shrill in this parliament. Standing orders must be suspended, because this Prime Minister owes the country an explanation. She owes the country an explanation as to why the person she has appointed to chair the Future Fund does not think he is the person for the job. That is the truth, Mr Speaker. That is why standing orders should be suspended. She has just appointed to chair the Future Fund someone who says, 'I'm not the best person for the job.' What a classic example of incompetence and dishonesty from this government.


Standing orders must be suspended, because David Gonski, a distinguished and respected businessman, advised that Peter Costello was the clear preference of the Future Fund Board of Guardians for the chairmanship. David Gonski told the government that Peter Costello should be appointed. That was his clear recommendation. The government rejected the recommendation because, while he might have been economically competent, as far as they were concerned Peter Costello was not politically correct. They chose their version of political correctness ahead of clear economic competence. That is why standing orders should be suspended: because the government always chooses good politics over good economics. It is one of the reasons why they are so on the nose with the general public.


Standing orders should be suspended, because this government, yet again, has been dishonest in its explanations of this matter. What else can we expect from a government which never tells the truth when it would be more convenient to lie.



The SPEAKER:  Order!




Mr ABBOTT:
  I apologise; I withdraw.



The SPEAKER:  No, the leader will pause. This is not a motion of censure; this is a motion to suspend. The leader will withdraw the accusation of dishonesty.




Mr ABBOTT:
  In slavish deference—in respectful deference, Mr Speaker, I withdraw.



The SPEAKER:  Without condition.




Mr ABBOTT:
  It would be very valuable to get some facts here. Peter Costello is not just on the board of the Future Fund; he was not just appointed to the Future Fund by a previous Labor Prime Minister of more magnanimity than the current Labor Prime Minister—he created the Future Fund. The Future Fund exists only because of the good economic management of the previous government. That is why standing orders should be suspended so that these facts can be put clearly on the table.


Let us look at the record of Peter Costello: more than two million new jobs, a 20 per cent increase in real wages, a doubling of net wealth for the Australian people—every Australian man, woman and child had his or her net wealth doubled under Peter Costello. Surely, if there is one person who is eminently qualified to chair the Future Fund he created it is the former Treasurer of this country—the greatest Treasurer this country has ever had. He was good enough for Kevin Rudd, the former Prime Minister, to put on the Future Fund. Why isn't he good enough for this inadequate, unworthy, at times embarrassing Prime Minister to put into the chairmanship of the Future Fund?


Let us look at the record and see why standing orders should be suspended. This former Treasurer repaid Labor's debt. He was able to create the Future Fund because he repaid Labor's debt. He turned $96 billion worth of debt into $70 billion worth of net assets. Standing orders should be suspended, because he got Labor's reckless spending under control. He turned a $10 billion budget black hole into consistent $20-billion-a-year budget surpluses. This was a great Treasurer, and that is why he is absolutely the right person to chair the Future Fund that he created. And this is why standing orders must be suspended—so that some of the untruths that have been told by members opposite can be refuted.


Stephen Conroy, who rejoices in the position of Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, said today, 'I'd rather put my money under the control of David Gonski any day of the week ahead of Peter Costello.' The coalition is not against David Gonski, but David Gonski himself thinks Peter Costello was a better candidate, which is why standing orders must be suspended. What does it say about members opposite that they think it is their money—that they think the $70 billion of taxpayers' assets put into the Future Fund is somehow their money—to misuse for their politically correct purposes, not for the benefit of the Australian people? Peter Costello was the best Treasurer this country has ever had. That is why he is the right person to chair the Future Fund.


But it was not just Senator Conroy. Senator Cameron was also out there today, saying Peter Costello was a 'failed Treasurer'. Standing orders must be suspended, because if Senator Cameron thinks Peter Costello was a failed Treasurer then what on earth does he think about the current Treasurer? Peter Costello gave us the four biggest surpluses in history. The current Treasurer has given us the four biggest deficits in history. What does Senator Cameron think of the current Treasurer? Senator Cameron went on, in speaking about Peter Costello, to say that 'to give him any senior position would just be an absolute joke'. Hang on: what is he saying about former Prime Minister Rudd, who did give him a senior position—the senior position as a guardian of the Future Fund? Kevin Rudd, the member for Griffith, put Peter Costello on the Future Fund. Senator Cameron said that was an absolute joke, and then Senator Cameron goes around and says Kevin Rudd should be the Prime Minister again. Who is telling jokes now? This is why standing orders should be suspended: maybe Senator Cameron now agrees with the member for Bendigo that in fact the former Prime Minister is a psychopath with a big ego. What does it say about this Prime Minister that 31 people—31 members of the caucus—preferred a psychopath to her?


Let us look at what David Gonski said:


My report says that they wanted an insider. In my report it says that there is one person and I indicated to the department that there was strong endorsement for that person.


And what did the Minister for Finance and Deregulation say? She said that there was no recommendation from Mr Gonski's reports to the government for a particular person to be appointed.


There is a flat contradiction, and standing orders must be suspended, because when we have David Gonski's word on one hand and the word of the Minister for Finance and Deregulation on the other, I think we know who we can believe. Do we believe David Gonski, or do we believe the representative of a government that has been chronically untruthful?



The SPEAKER:  The leader will return to the motion.




Mr ABBOTT:
  That is why standing orders must be suspended: to get to the bottom of this. We have a government that has been dishonest with the electorate over the carbon tax and dishonest with the electorate over gambling reform. The Prime Minister was dishonest to the electorate over Bob Carr. This is a government with truth deficit disorder.



The SPEAKER:  Order!




Mr ABBOTT:
  They are telling lies now. That is why standing orders should be suspended.



The SPEAKER:  Order! The Leader of the Opposition has accused the Prime Minister of being dishonest and he has accused the government of telling lies. The Leader of the Opposition does not look remotely contrite, but if he wants to stay here he will move to the dispatch box and withdraw those two accusations.




Mr ABBOTT:
  I am delighted to withdraw, but every member in this House believes the same thing, and every member should come to the dispatch box and withdraw as I do.



The SPEAKER:  The leader will return to the dispatch box and he will say, 'I withdraw those two terms', and not do as he endeavoured to do, which was to associate members of the coalition with the disorderly terms that he used.




Mr ABBOTT:
  I did accuse the government of being dishonest, I did accuse the Prime Minister of lying and I withdraw. I withdraw unconditionally.



The SPEAKER:  Is the motion seconded?



Mr Pyne interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  I did not hear what the Manager of Opposition Business had to say, but perhaps he wants to assist the chamber by withdrawing.




Mr Pyne:
  I think it would assist the chamber, and I am embarrassed to say that I also said that the Prime Minister was telling lies and was dishonest, so I also withdraw.

Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (15:06):  I second the motion. We should suspend standing orders because there have been a number of failures that must be dealt with urgently by this House. In the first place, there has been a complete failure of good governance. David Murray, the outgoing chairman of the Future Fund, actually said:


The decision has been left late every time …


You need to give people information and you need to make decisions in a timely way. It helps to govern the organisation itself.


And the government has yet again procrastinated about the appointment of people to run the most important fund of money that Australian taxpayers have outside of the mainstream budget. But it goes further. The Minister for Finance and Deregulation and the Treasurer—



The SPEAKER:  The honourable member will return to the motion before the chair.




Mr HOCKEY:
  The Minister for Finance and Deregulation and the Treasurer have sought to engage outside consultants to appoint a chairman of the Future Fund. They went through a process—this is why standing orders must be suspended—to find the most appropriate person. They engaged an outside consulting firm and, when they were not satisfied with that, they engaged Mr Gonski to give them a recommendation on whom the guardians themselves believed to be the very best person to chair the Future Fund. Mr Gonski reported back to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation that the view of the guardians is in fact that Peter Costello is the best person to do it.


Standing orders must be suspended because the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, only a few days ago, led people to believe—and I am prepared to quote her—that there was no recommendation from anyone to appoint Peter Costello. But the fact of the matter is that, even though the Minister for Finance and Deregulation deliberately misled not only the Australian people—



The SPEAKER:  Order! The honourable member is aware that it is disorderly to reflect on members of this chamber or the other place. The member will withdraw.




Mr HOCKEY:
  I withdraw. The Minister for Finance and Deregulation has repeatedly said that Mr Gonski had made no recommendation. On the ABC's World Today yesterday, she said:


He made no recommendations.


She said that on ABC Radio yesterday. It is now revealed in today's Australian that Mr Gonski did in fact make recommendations. The article quotes Mr Gonski as saying:


My job was to advise the government on what the board thought. The board said they wanted an insider and they designated by majority that the insider was Peter.


'Peter' means Peter Costello.


This is why standing orders must be suspended. The Minister for Finance and Deregulation is running around saying that there was no recommendation from David Gonski about the chairmanship of the Future Fund, yet Mr Gonski himself, who was engaged by the government, has now declared that in fact he did make a recommendation—that recommendation being Mr Costello. Suspending standing orders is so urgent because this represents the way this government operates. We have to stop this government from more incompetence; we have to stop this government from any more acts of poor corporate governance involving taxpayers' money—and we are doing so.


Brian Watson has belled the cat. He said—



The SPEAKER:  The honourable member will return to the suspension motion.




Mr HOCKEY:
  We must suspend standing orders because Mr Watson has said that Mr Gonski interviewed the members of the Future Fund in confidence to get their views on the Future Fund and the membership of the Future Fund. Now Mr Gonski has been appointed to chair the Future Fund—such practice is widely regarded as poor corporate governance in Australia. 


This government treats Peter Costello with contempt. This government treats Australian taxpayers with contempt. Do not let the Australian government treat people with contempt in future. Get back to good corporate governance, get out of the job and let us govern. (Time expired)

Ms ROXON
 (Gellibrand—Attorney-General and Minister for Emergency Management) (15:11):  We understand that, when we get to the Thursday at the end of a parliamentary week and when we have the 46th suspension of standing orders, the only thing those opposite—



Opposition members interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  Order! There is too much of a crescendo in the chamber. I cannot hear the Attorney-General and if I cannot hear the Attorney-General then other honourable members cannot either.




Ms ROXON:
  We understand why those opposite get so agitated about this. But on the Thursday at the end of a sitting week, when any of a range of important issues could be raised, the only jobs they want to talk about are jobs for Liberal Party members. That is the only thing they want to talk about. We could have talked about the hundreds of thousands of jobs across the country, we could have talked about superannuation or we could have talked about the flood affected communities that are still under pressure. Instead, those opposite are only interested in talking about jobs for Liberal boys. Is that really the only thing that we can—



Opposition members interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  Order! The minister will be heard in silence for the balance of her contribution.




Ms ROXON:
  Obviously we disagree with the motion to suspend standing orders. We believe that there is a long list—a list that would run from here to the door—of issues that are far more important than talking about whether there should be a job for a Liberal boy who Mr Abbott thinks is better than Mr Gonski. The reason Mr Gonski was chosen for this job—




Mrs Mirabella:
  On a point of order, Mr Speaker: I ask you to direct the Attorney-General to withdraw the offensive comment. I find the term 'Liberal boys' offensive and I ask you to direct her to withdraw it.



The SPEAKER:  The offensive term, in your view, was 'Liberal boys'? I am all about civility but I think that is stretching it a little.




Ms ROXON:
  Let us be completely honest about this—everyone on this side of the House can understand why Mr Costello would be disappointed. He just cannot seem to get a leadership job, whether it is in here or whether it is anywhere else. It is absolutely understandable why he would be disappointed about it.



Ms O'Dwyer interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  Order! The honourable member for Higgins will remove herself under the provisions of standing order 94(a).




The member for Higgins then left the chamber.





Ms ROXON:
  But let us look at the issue that is being talked about here. We appointed an absolutely outstanding Australian, someone who is a leader in the business community. Not only do we think he is an outstanding Australian—he has held the chairmanships of not only boards of the biggest companies that operate in Australia but also the Australian Stock Exchange—but just one day ago, not even 24 hours ago, the shadow Treasurer and the shadow finance minister issued a press release to say that they welcomed this appointment. It is now such an outrageous thing, from yesterday at two o'clock when they issued a press release to say that this was good news and that they welcomed the appointment, that we have to suspend standing orders.



Ms Plibersek interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The honourable Minister for Health will remove herself from the chamber under the provisions of standing order 94(a). I have directed that all honourable members will listen to the Attorney-General in silence, and that includes the minister.




The member for 
Sydney
 then left the chamber.





Ms ROXON:
  It took them 24 hours to decide that they accidentally said yes to something, when they so often want to say no—that it is important that every other matter that is listed for debate in the parliament should take secondary importance. This is a nonsense. I could go through every member on this side of the House and tell you the top five issues they would think were more important to be debated in this House. I know absolutely for sure that if I went to the crossbenchers, particularly the National Party members and the Liberal Party members whose seats are still under water because they have been affected by the floods, I could pick any number of issues much more important for this House to be debating than this issue here now.



The SPEAKER:  The Attorney-General will return to the specifics of the question.




Ms ROXON:
  I am addressing the suspension, Mr Speaker, and arguing that this particular issue does not merit the suspension of standing orders. I do not think that the appointment of an outstanding Australian, welcomed across the business community and welcomed by the shadow Treasurer and the shadow finance minister only 24 hours ago, could somehow be transformed into an issue of such importance that we should suspend standing orders to debate it.


Let us also look at the history here. We have never on this side of the parliament said that being a member of the Liberal Party or being a member of the National Party was a disqualifier for a job. In fact we have been incredibly generous as a government in appointing people who have been good and skilled, and recognised in the community as such, to many different positions. We have appointed people to represent us at NATO—he was in the House just a couple of days ago—and to represent us at the World Health Organisation. We appointed Mr Fischer to be Ambassador to the Holy See. We have appointed so many different experienced people across all sides of the political spectrum.



The SPEAKER:  The Attorney-General will return to the motion.




Ms ROXON:
  Each time we have said, 'Who is the best person for the job?' On this occasion, we do not believe that it merits suspending standing orders when it is clear that it is an outstanding Australian, Mr David Gonski, who deserves the support of this chamber, who was the ASX chairman and who has chaired everything from the Sydney Theatre Company through to Coca-Cola, has been the Chancellor at the University of New South Wales and has provided advice to government on a range of different things from e-health to education. He is an absolutely outstanding individual and there can be no possible reason that we should call into question his appointment, and certainly no possible reason that we should suspend standing orders to do it.


We are not going to waste, and we ought not to waste, valuable time in this parliament when there are so many other issues in the community and a range of so many jobs in each electorate that people would happily talk about. Yet there is only one job that those opposite think is worth talking about, and that is a job for a Liberal. Why should that be the priority over any other job that should be discussed in this chamber? We know that employment is challenging. We know that in Victoria, for example, there are challenges in the manufacturing industry, and the industry minister talked about a number of those issues. We are working damn hard over this side of the House to make sure that those people get supported, but would you ever have a debate on those issues in here? Not once. Would you ever have a question on those issues in here? The only job that they can get worked up about is one for a Liberal colleague that they did not even support for the top job here. I think there has to be a bit of irony. The Leader of the Opposition—



The SPEAKER:  Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired.




A division having been called and the bells being rung—




The SPEAKER:  Because of the precipitate termination of question time, I did not have the opportunity to recognise in the gallery 16 of Australia's most talented young people, who make up our youth delegations to the G20, the Rio+20 Earth Summit, NATO and a visit to Israel. They are hosted by Global Voices. On behalf of all honourable members, I welcome those young people to the gallery.

"Billson, Bruce, MP",LP,2012-03-15,"



Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley) (15:31):  Not one Labor member of this parliament stood up to support this urgent discussion about the adverse impact of its government policy on the small business community. What a surprise! That is entirely in keeping with this Gillard-Rudd Labor government strategy of talking a good game at times but certainly not lifting its game when it comes to the impact on small business. You cannot find an example where small business has been front and centre of the federal government's mind. It is of very serious concern how poorly understood and appreciated small business is by this government. We need to support our small business and family enterprise community. They deserve our support, they warrant our encouragement and they deserve considered policy that will actually support the prosperity. The coalition knows that prosperous small businesses feed into the vitality of local communities and opportunities for Australians, something this government have never understood. They continue to show their ignorance on this topic by their inaction on the matters that really matter to the small business community. 


Remember the time when the Howard government was in office? We saw the number of people running their own small businesses exceed the number of union members. Small businesses were being developed right around our country, in every corner of our continent. There was a sound economic environment and supportive policies that, rightly, recognised that small business was the engine room of our economy. When you talk to operators of small businesses today they are almost whimsical about those past times. They look back to when the Howard government was in office and they recall vividly that it was a golden era for them and for the communities that they are so embedded in and such a part of. Now small businesses are looking at the end of a very long, dark tunnel and seeing that the only bright light is the prospect of an election. But they want to know how long they have to hang on. The economic funk and the despair that this government has driven small businesses into are very worrying for many small business people. As the government fails to act on the matters of key concern to small business, they are cannibalising the capital that people have invested in those businesses. They are not only demonising successful entrepreneurs but demoralising the entrepreneurs. The sons and daughters of people who are currently entrepreneurs of our country are looking at what mum and dad are having to go through. It is a bit like my LNP colleagues pointed to some years ago: in the rural community the sons and daughters of farmers were thinking, 'Gee, I'm not sure what I'm going to do with my life, but I'm pretty sure farming's pretty tough going.' This is now the mood that is undermining confidence in the small business community and impeding the next generation of entrepreneurs, who we really need. Boy, has the mood changed! Confidence is down, entrepreneurship is under attack. We have a federal government whose disposition is hostile to small business, a government wanting to talk a good game but never lifting its game in terms of the support small businesses deserve. 


Just have a look at what is going on. Have a look at the state of the nation through the eyes of the small business community. Have a look at why they are feeling that this government is not interested in their interests and certainly not responding to the concerns that they have. There is an urgency and a need for decisive action to try to give small businesses the support that they need. There is a need to nurture the policies that will give us growth and economic vitality to spread opportunities. Instead, all we get from this government is more new taxes. When the Howard government left office, the ABS estimated that 5,061,000 people were employed in small businesses around Australia. That was more than half the private sector workforce; in fact, it was 51.3 per cent. Just a few short years later, in June 2009, the ABS reported that job losses in small business had already totalled 300,000 and that private sector employment that small business provided had gone from 51 per cent down to 48 per cent. 


The ABS has changed its numbers and its methodology again. Rather than the government pushing off from those earlier numbers, the ABS is now saying that there are 4,747,000 people employed in small business and it is down to 47.2 per cent of the private sector economy. We are seeing jobs shrinking out of the private sector in the small business community when we should be out there trying to nurture and support growth in that area. When we look at what is going on in insolvency, we see the Dun and Bradstreet report, a very worrying report, showing that the number of small business insolvencies is up by 45 per cent and the number of new business start-ups is down by 95 per cent. This is the climate. This is the ditch that this government has driven many small businesses into. When you ask small business people what their major concerns are, they say they are worried about incompetence from a government that does not seem to understand that its actions have profound impact on the men and women in small business and they ask, 'What is the government going to do at a time when costs are punishing business?' They are just going to put costs up with the world's largest carbon tax. The Queensland Chamber of Commerce and Industry recently surveyed their members. Three out of four respondents believe that the carbon tax will have a negative impact on their business. Eighty-four per cent urge the scrapping of it in the name of their business, the jobs that they try to create and to try and stave off yet another nail in the coffin of many of those businesses. The Australian Association of Convenience Stores found that 96 per cent of their respondents in a recent survey said the Gillard Labor government's carbon tax will have a negative impact on their business and two-thirds of them said it will negatively impact on future employment levels.


You can imagine my surprise when in a recent weeks the state Labor shadow employment minister was calling on the Baillieu government to reduce taxes and charges to try and deal with the jobs losses in Victoria, a jobs crisis in Victoria, but the new minister said, 'What jobs crisis?' There is a jobs crisis. We are losing jobs because of this government's policy approach and their unwillingness and lack of preparedness to actually tackle the causes of it. That is why this matter is of such importance today.


When you look at the carbon tax, the world's largest carbon tax, you see there is barely an industry in the Australian economy that is not going to be hurt and harmed by that measure. We heard today the experience of tenants in Westfield shopping centres. The decision of Westfield to include a carbon tax clause in their latest rent agreements for shopkeepers is further proof that the Gillard Labor government's carbon tax is going to hit every Australian business. It will not just be paid by the big 500; we will all be paying and we will be paying for a long time. The Prime Minister spoke in the House today, and I do not know where she gets her information from. Shortly after, Zarraffa's Coffee House put out a press statement about recent lease negotiations. Remember that the Prime Minister is saying, 'This clause has been around for so long. What are people going on about?' What they are going on about is the punishment this carbon tax is going to inflict on small business. In this particular example Westfield is now introducing a carbon tax escalation clause in their leases to say that they will pass on carbon or greenhouse gas emission related charges and recover the same from the lessee. Zarraffa's are saying, 'We are really struggling right now.' They say the carbon tax adds insult to injury by not delivering on a long-term solution to carbon and indiscriminately weakening businesses across all industries. They point out that they cannot keep carrying increased costs and expect to survive into the future. They point to the carbon tax impact on transport, on power, on rents and so on. Now you see a major shopping centre owner putting it in as a reason to further escalate the lease costs that people face. That is the clause. The Leader of the Opposition showed the Prime Minister the clause. She retreated to the argument, 'It has been around forever; what are you going on about?' This ignores the very statement that someone with premises across a number of Westfield stores is engaged in current and recent lease negotiations where this has appeared for the first time.


But go further, even just accounting for what the impact is in the suburbs and regions across Australia. The Geelong Advertiser thought they would go and have a chat to some of the tenants in their Westfield shopping centre. Interestingly, at a time when the Prime Minister says this has been around for a long time, I will quote another Westfield tenant who said they recently signed a new lease to open another cafe in the complex and the person said it would not surprise him if Westfield included the clause in future contracts. So what he is talking about is a relatively fresh contract that was being entered into that did not have these clauses while other tenants are saying they are involved in negotiations right now where it is going to be pushed in. And the Prime Minister says, 'Look, it's nothing to worry about. It has been around for a long time.' It is very important for the Australian public to be able to separate fact from fallacy because we know this government's reputation on not giving us the full story. Remember 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead'? Small business remembers that.


The decision by Westfield to include this carbon tax clause in its latest rent agreements with shopkeepers shows that this carbon tax will impact on the prices of every Australian household, on every Australian business. This is something the retail sector is alert to. They are already doing it tough, yet now they have got further cost pressures on their very thin margins at the moment. In the case of the Geelong centre there was a proposition where the person was quoted as saying, 'There is no doubt that people cannot afford to pay any more rent. I would say about 25 per cent of businesses would be out of business in Westfield Geelong if this was included.' That was the Nextra newsagent, Wayne Crouch. Who do you believe: someone who is paying the rent, someone who is looking carefully at these lease agreements, or the glib, distracting non-answer we get from the Prime Minister saying, 'Don't worry about it, it has been around forever.' In everything you buy this will be embedded.


We have heard in recent days about the carbon tax impact in the transport sector. Just because it might not be in the government's mind a tax on what comes out of the tailpipe of cars does not mean there will not be a carbon tax impact on everything that leads to the fuel being combusted in the first place. When you talk to the Australian Convenience and Petroleum Marketing Association they say, 'Don't believe there will be no impact on us. The forecourt area lit up, the pumps running with their precision calibrations, all the supplies that are sold in the business, the refrigeration.' They are pointing to a direct impact of the carbon tax on petrol prices, not because it is on the pipe but because it is on everything that goes into making the fuel available in the first place. This is a carbon tax that will cost Australians 400 times the per capita impact of the EU scheme. That per capita impact is extraordinary.


What do we get from the government when these concerns are raised? We get a glib response from Greg Combet, the minister for carbon tax, who says a dry cleaner is not competing against dry cleaners in China. What a genius! Drivers cannot get their cars serviced in India. It would just be a whole lot more expensive. We already know for anyone who talks to a local mechanic that people are less inclined to do the routine maintenance on their vehicles. They are coming in when their car is in trouble. But there is a whole lot of demand impact already flowing through the system. You see it in the building industry, where the building industry is saying the proposed carbon tax will have a substantial adverse impact on the building and construction sector. You see how they describe the sector as one of low margins with long supply chains, how this tax will compound and impact on every step along the way. In manufacturing, the poor manufacturers—why have they deserved to get this negative tariff that is going to make an already difficult time for them extraordinarily challenging into the future?


It is not a surprise to see those Dun & Bradstreet figures. It is not surprise to have small businesses telling you about their concerns. It is a surprise when the new minister is not even aware of the crisis that small business is facing. But in an effort of unvarnished plagiarism what have we seen in the last three weeks? We have seen the Gillard government without an idea of its own lift three coalition policies in the last fortnight and claim them as their own. It is quite a remarkable thing to see, if you look at what is going on. I am sure the House will be quite interested. I am holding the coalition's policy document at the last election. Look at what the Prime Minister said when she was announcing the measure. You would have at least thought they would have come up with their own talking points rather than just lift out the concepts and ideas from the coalition.


We saw that also in the appointment of the new Minister for Small Business. And I would like to congratulate him on his appointment. So committed were the government to having this minister in cabinet that it has taken four reshuffles to get one there. They have bolted it onto homelessness and housing. I hope they are not seeing a connection between small business and homelessness as their mortgages are called in because of the failing of their businesses. I hope that is not the connection. But we still have not seen competition policy lifted. We still see that as a junior minister. At least it is up from a parliamentary secretary.


These are some of the real challenges that small business faces. If you are wondering why the Prime Minister announced 'the minister in cabinet' and the 'ombudsman', which they have called a commissioner—a bit of badge engineering—and 'our red-tape reduction', just go back to 8 July 2010, which is the date of the press release where we announced them. They picked up the coalition policy. As the government have no ideas of their own I urge the government, in the name of small business survival, to pick up the rest of our policies. Better still, why not cut out the middleman? We know there are costs and fat in the middleman. Why not just elect the coalition to implement it, because we are the ones genuinely committed to doing the right thing?


Let me look at another issue. Remember the solar rebate system for hot water, which just disappeared. Who is going to look after the small businesses that geared up with forward orders to account for the expected increase in demand and that are now left with all of this stock? I suppose they could put it in a warehouse with the fluff and foam they had from the Home Insulation Program. Why don't you look at what you are doing to independent contractors? Day after day you come in here and undermine independent contractors. They are a legitimate enterprise and they deserve to be supported.


Finally, if you really want a policy, pick up the coalition's one. Peter Strong was out there yesterday saying, 'It is a very good place to be at the moment for small business.' I would hate to tell you about the phone calls from people who were choking on their morning tea when they heard that. They are not sure what good place they are talking about. It might be a good place for people who are able to pick opportunities, but have a look at the business pressures being faced by small business. (Time expired)

"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2012-03-15,"



Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR
 (Gorton—Minister for Housing, Minister for Homelessness and Minister for Small Business) (15:47):  I thank the honourable member for his contribution. Some of the comments go to the issue of the Liberal Party's concerns about small business. The unfortunate thing is that the policies he enunciated in relation to what the Liberal Party would have done if elected were clearly those things that they were not able to do or chose not to do when they were in government. For 11½ years the Howard government was in power and in that time submissions were made by the small business community to elevate the portfolio to cabinet. For the last six years of that period there was no small business minister in cabinet. There were also calls from the small business community to have a small business commissioner, something that was not acceded to or accepted by the Howard government.


In fact, the first government that introduced a small business commissioner was the Victorian Labor government, in 2004. It did so because it wanted to provide a voice for small business. It wanted to provide independent advice and the opportunity for representation to be made directly to the small business minister in the Victorian government. The Howard government and the member for Dunkley, when he was a member of that government, had an opportunity to ensure that this office was instituted, but nothing was done by the Howard government in relation to that office.


The creation of the small business commissioner is a very important announcement. It will provide small businesses across the country with the capacity to make representations direct to me and to receive very pertinent advice about their small businesses. I think it is an excellent decision and it is one that this government made. It is something that was not done by the Howard government.


I think it is important that the government elevate this portfolio to cabinet. I feel very honoured to be in that position. It is something the previous Howard government failed to do for the last six years of its term. That says something about the Liberal Party and their relationship with small business. They say they are the party of small business but, when it comes to reform and making decisions in the interests of that very important and vital sector, they have failed when in government. It is very important that I am at the cabinet table, not only advancing the interests of small business but taking into account any potential adverse effects that may arise from other decisions; therefore making sure that small business is being considered when governments are making such very important decisions.


The member for Dunkley spoke for 15 minutes and he did not talk about the need to immediately pass on some tax cuts to small business. It is quite extraordinary. I have never before seen the Liberal Party and a Liberal Party leader, Tony Abbott, oppose tax cuts for small business. He has categorically opposed the tax cuts for small business that will commence on 1 July. This is unheard of. This shows the disregard the opposition has for the small business community.


We are looking to reduce company tax from 30 per cent to 29 per cent for incorporated companies. We are looking to provide instant asset tax write-offs of up to $6,500 for literally millions of small businesses across the country. We are also looking to have an instant tax write-off for the first $5,000 of motor vehicle use for business. All of these measures are being opposed by the opposition.


This is quite extraordinary, because the Leader of the Opposition is on the record as saying that he supports tax cuts. On 29 March this year, when talking to Lyndal Curtis on ABC News 24 he said:


… in principle we strongly support company tax cuts … and we wanted to deliver this tax cut …


On 4 October 2011 he said:


… we don’t believe in new taxes. We believe in trying to get existing taxes down.


On 12 August 2011 the Leader of the Opposition said:


The best thing I can do for business is to cut its tax …


The Leader of the Opposition has been on the record time and time again saying he wants to support tax cuts, yet, when he is provided an opportunity to make sure we pass on tax relief to literally millions of small businesses in this country, the Leader of the Opposition stands up and says, 'I refuse to support that initiative.' It is absolutely outrageous and unprecedented action by the Liberal Party. We hear this time and time again from the Liberal Party, that they are the party of small business. They say they are the party of the forgotten people. They have forgotten the forgotten people by not supporting the tax cuts for small business. It is an absolute outrage and they should hang their heads in shame.


The other thing that we know when it comes to the Liberal Party is that they never let the truth get in the way of a good scare campaign. They have sought to scare the small business community, scare the people of this country, by making up falsehood after falsehood in relation to the carbon tax. The facts are these: this government will apply a tax to the 500 biggest polluters. We will ensure that people are provided support by way of tax cuts and by way of pension payments. There is no tax imposition to be placed on small business. The small and modest increases that will arise in prices we accept will flow on to the consumer—a consumer that will be provided with tax cuts and increases in pension payments.


Compare that approach with the approach of the opposition. Their view is to impose a $1,300 per annum tax increase on every household in this country. Who lives in those households? It is sole proprietors, independent contractors, microbusinesses and small businesses. They will all have to pay a $1,300 increase because the opposition kowtow to the Gina Rineharts and the Clive Palmers in this country and choose to provide tax relief for the largest businesses in this country and impose tax burdens on the smaller businesses in this country. That is a typical response from an opposition that is taking instructions from the super-rich in this country. I have never seen the like of it in the 10 years I have been in this place: the Liberal Party so nakedly taking instruction from the super-rich and denying and depriving small businesses in this country of the tax cuts that they deserve.


We still hope that the opposition—indeed, the member for Dunkley and others—will support the tax cuts for small business, but I doubt it. I cannot see it happening. This opposition leader and this opposition are so negative that I would not be surprised if they oppose their own policies. The fact is that the member for Dunkley put up a couple of issues—




Mr Billson:
  You're pinching them.




Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR:
  You might have come up with them in opposition, but you should have made the decisions in government. Of course, you chose not to and you have failed to properly relate to the small business community because in the end—



Mr Billson interjecting—




Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR:
  Yes, there is no doubt you did make small businesses tax collectors under the GST. That is the one thing they remember about you and the Liberal Party when in government. The small business community know they have a government now that is listening to them. Peter Strong, the executive officer of COSBOA, applauded the decision to institute the Small Business Commissioner. There is no doubt that they applauded that. Indeed, other employer bodies have done likewise, supporting the creation of this position. They are also supporting the tax cuts this government is soon to enact. They understand that small businesses in this country have challenges and it is for that reason that this government is providing some support. I think it is really important that the government play a role as an enabler to create the conditions in which businesses can thrive.


If you want some proof of the way the government respond to small business, you need only look at our decision when we were confronted by the global financial crisis. There is no better way to demonstrate the difference in approach between the government and the opposition than when it came to making decisions in relation to the challenges of the global financial crisis. We chose to invest in education and housing and to provide support—



Mr Baldwin interjecting—




Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR:
  Yes, we provided support for people who needed accommodation; yes, we provided support for students across the land who wanted 21st century infrastructure—and why shouldn't they want that? Who were the other beneficiaries of that very important decision? They were the thousands and thousands of small businesses across the country that worked on 27,000 projects—tradies, sole proprietors, independent contractors and small businesses in the construction and maintenance sector, and that flowed on to other sectors of the economy. If you went to an opening of a BER initiative—and I know that many on the other side, having voted against it, turned up to some of those events—if you listened to the small businesses that built those very important amenities for those schools and if you talked to the architects and builders, as you know, Madam Deputy Speaker Burke, they said: 'Without these decisions we would have gone to the wall. Without these decisions we literally would not be here today.' That decision by government—




Dr Emerson:
  Opposed by the opposition.




Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR:
  Yes, it was opposed by the opposition. That decision provided opportunities for thousands of small businesses. It meant that so many more people were employed. That was absolutely critical. It meant that we ensured that thousands of small businesses in every one of the members' electorates in this place survived and thrived. That is what happened as a result of those decisions. Conversely, the opposition chose to oppose those very important initiatives. In the end, their heart is not there to support small business. In the end, whatever their rhetoric, the reality is that their heart is not in this at all. Ultimately, if you have to choose between a tax cut for small business or tax relief for the largest and wealthiest companies in this country, which would you normally choose? This government will always choose support for small business and, clearly, the opposition will provide relief for the super-rich. That is the problem.


I have been in the role of the Minister for Small Business for a very short time. I am very proud to be the minister and I am very proud to have the portfolio elevated to cabinet. It is the first time since I have been in this place that there has been a cabinet minister representing small business. I am happy that within that time I have been able to announce the Office of the Small Business Commissioner. I am happy, indeed, to have been able to prosecute the argument as to why we need tax relief for small businesses. I will continue to prosecute that argument to ensure that we provide such relief.


I will be speaking to as many small businesses as I can as I go around the country. They are the engine room of this economy; there is no doubt. They employ just under five million Australians. They are absolutely vital to our economy. As I said earlier, the role of government is to create the conditions in which they can thrive. We did that when we confronted the global financial crisis. Indeed, we saved and ensured that certain companies continued in a very prosperous manner. We will continue to provide new opportunities for small business because if you create the right conditions then certainly those small businesses will prosper. Why is it so important? It is important for those businesses but it is also important because of the breadth and the proportion of Australian employees that are employed by those businesses.


We will continue to listen to small business. I will be travelling around the country talking to all of the areas of small business, and, literally, they are in every sector of our economy. I will be getting direct from them their concerns and challenges so that we can continue to respond. What I hope will happen between now and when the decision is to be made in the Senate is that the opposition has a change of heart. I hope the opposition thinks about this and puts the country first, puts small business first and supports the tax cuts and the tax relief that we want to provide.


All this week the Leader of the Opposition has tried all sorts of distractions to forget about the one issue that is clear in everyone's mind: we have a Liberal Party leader who is seeking to oppose tax cuts to small business. The only thing that they wanted to talk about today is one job for a former Liberal Treasurer. They did not want to talk about the jobs in the small business sector or about relief for small business. I say to those opposite: listen to the small business community, accept the tax cut, allow the tax cut and allow that for them because they need it. (Time expired)

"Baldwin, Bob, MP",LP,2012-03-15,"



Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson) (16:02):  I rise today to speak to this MPI: 


The adverse effects of Government policy on small businesses in Australia.


I would like to start by recognising and heralding all of those positive achievements that this government has made for small business! But I actually should start to address the real issue, and that is the issue of the negative policies that have impacted on small business. I have just heard from the Minister for Small Business how he is walking amongst small business, how he is listening. Minister, take the earmuffs off! If you took the earmuffs off you would hear what they were saying to you. You would hear of the record bankruptcies that are occurring. You would hear about the struggles that people are going through because of the lack of confidence driven by an incompetent Prime Minister with a Labor Party so focused on its internal fighting that it cannot be focused on the future of this nation. This government has undermined consumer confidence and it has undermined business confidence, and therefore we are seeing a reduction in investment because there is no confidence.


In fact, this is the government that said it would do a one for one: it would repeal the red tape and regulation that business goes through—in particular, the burden on small business. Since 2007 this government has introduced or amended 16,173 new regulations. It has repealed 79. I can understand why it does not understand small business, because it does not understand simple mathematics—




Mr Billson:
  Trust me! 205 to one!




Mr BALDWIN:
  '205 to one', the shadow minister for small business says—because 16,173 does not equate to 79.


In relation to red tape, there was the industries for Australia review conducted by the member for Indi and the member for Groom. We actually did a separate one for the tourism industry. That identified a range of issues that business operators were facing. In fact, off the back of that our leader determined that we should have a special task force looking at addressing the issues of red tape. That is being headed up by Arthur Sinodinos, with a high-quality team.


How can you understand small business if you have never been there? How can you understand small business if you have never had skin in the game? I know the shadow minister, the member for Dunkley, has been in small business. He was a retailer. He has been through the tough times. He knows what it is like to have the mortgage over the family home, to worry about whether there are going to be people coming into the shop. What we have here on the other side are people who go from school to university to union to the parliament. They have not had a small business. They have never had their own money on the line; they have never had skin in the game. They have never had to address the issues of economic constraints and bad government policy. The only bad policy that they have within themselves is when they have a leadership battle and wonder whether the Left or the Right or the inside out are going to take the leadership.


When I look at the tourism industry, some 85 per cent of the players in the tourism industry are small to medium operators. They are part of the team that employs 500,000 people in the tourism industry. If I add hospitality into that, there are 500,000 people in the hospitality industry. They actually understand small business, because every morning they get up and face issues such as weather—and weather can be an impediment in the tourism industry; they face the issues of whether the dollar is going up or down; they face the issues of government confidence and whether people have disposable income in their pockets to spend on their business; and they face the issues of industrial relations reforms, which have driven a lot of businesses out of business. When I was with the member at Margaret River we were talking to restaurant and cafe owners that just shut now on Saturdays and Sundays because they cannot afford the rates, because this government has not understood what is required to keep businesses, and in particular small businesses, going. In parliament this week and in previous weeks they have been attacking Gina Rinehart and Clive Palmer. But the Minister for Small Business should have been standing up for them because a large sector of their spending is on employing or engaging or contracting small to medium enterprises. This government would rather take away from or crush those who do the employing.


When you have been only in a union and you have never been out there in the real workforce, you do not understand that without employers you do not have any employees. If you do not create an environment in which employers have the confidence to invest and grow their business, if the market conditions are not right, then guess what? You do not have employees. That is why we have seen a reduction in employment in this country. That is why we have seen a reduction in the number of businesses operating in this country. 


When the Howard government left office, the Australian Bureau of Statistics estimated there were 5,061,000 people employed by the Australian small business sector. This was 51.3 per cent of the private sector workforce. By June 2009, when that mob were in government, the ABS reported small business job losses of more than 300,000 and a decline in the private sector workforce employed in small business to 48 per cent. Under a new ABS statistical methodology, introduced in June 2010, the small business employment level was estimated at 4,747,000, representing 47.2 per cent of the total private sector workforce. Since the change of government, there are 14,500 fewer employing small businesses. So when I see this minister stand up and boast how important it is to have a minister at cabinet level, I can understand that because, under their previous arrangement, we have seen 14,500 fewer small businesses.


We have seen record bankruptcies under this government. It is not hard to understand why when the banks are calling in loans because of the competition for finance when this government is borrowing $100 million a day, competing with the very businesses that need that money to fund their overdrafts and their investments in their business.


One of the key essences of being in business is developing a business plan. You put into it all the factors, you model all the conditions and you search out the best information so you understand that you can invest with confidence, go forward and stick to your plan. When this Prime Minister was asked what modelling had been done for the tourism industry in particular and on small business, the response was, 'None.' No modelling was done. She had spoken to a couple of people. She had a handle on it, she said. She has never been in small business; how could she have a handle on it? Without modelling, without understanding all of the conditions and factors, particularly when you bring in a great big new tax—the carbon tax—you cannot understand.


This incompetent government talks about the need for tax cuts. You do not have to be Einstein to work out that you do not need tax cuts if you do not impose new taxes on people. This government is giving on one hand while they are robbing with the other. This is the equivalent of putting a bandaid on your arm after you purposely slash your wrist. You would not need the bandaid if you did not slash your wrist. This government is so incompetent that it cannot even understand the flow of direction of business decision making. In fact, the only modelling that was done was by the TTF, and TTF came out and said that in the tourism industry there would be 6,400 job losses, predominantly in regional and rural Australia. It said the impact would be $731 million off the bottom line and the only beneficiary of a carbon tax would be outbound tourism.


We are suffering a tourism deficit in this country. Back in 2001, we posted a $3.6 billion tourism surplus in Australia. This year we are heading to an $8.7 billion deficit and in part that is because of the bad policy and bad direction of this government and, after 1 July, it will only get worse when this government imposes a carbon tax the likes of which never before seen.

Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley—Government Whip) (16:12):  Madam Deputy Speaker, I am so glad you have given me the call. I am going to be upfront. I love listening to the member for Dunkley. Whenever he brings these matters of public importance into the House I love it. He has that machine-gun delivery and all that energy. There he is, trying to paint a picture of horror, backing up his claims with playdough statistics, providing us with a promise that we will see a better future if we just follow what he tells us we need to do. If I close my eyes, I am not listening to parliament; I am listening to late night TV and he is Mr ShamWow. He is there, flogging his products to us with all that energy and gusto and I almost wait, Member for Dunkley, for you to offer us a free DVD of the performance. I will take it! I will take that any day.




Mr Neumann:
  Better than steak knives.




Mr HUSIC:
  It is better than steak knives, indeed, as my colleague the member for Blair rightly points out. The member for Dunkley has directed all this energy and effort this week—it has been a supreme performance. Why have we had it? It is because opposition members are trying to mask the reality. They keep going on about how we are all from the union movement and how all we do is support the union movement. Do you know what? I have no problems supporting the union movement and union members because they are working people. I have no problem doing that. We, through our actions in this place, help working people every day.


Those opposite dress themselves up as the friends of small business when in reality they are the biggest betrayers of small business. They are the ones who made every single small business a tax collector when they imposed the GST. They loaded up small businesses with all that paperwork, forcing them to bring in MYOBs and to fill out business activity statements. They burdened them. These great friends of small business now worry that everything will come to an end when we introduce a price on carbon for the top 500 businesses. We introduced initiatives such as providing an asset tax write-off to improve the cash flow of small businesses around the country. Name one government that in one move was able to improve the cash flow of businesses to the tune of $6,500. It never happened under those opposite. We are providing it.



A government member:  Per asset.




Mr HUSIC:
  Per asset, indeed. When we give business tax cuts, what do these people on the other side, parading themselves as the great friends of small business, do? They oppose it. Big business and the corporate sector are trying to work out what is going on on that side of the fence when they will not provide a business tax cut and when they will not support what we are trying to do—effectively redistribute the huge wealth that has been generated on one side of the country to ensure that the two million businesses across this nation have a huge injection in cash flow. What do those opposite do? They oppose it. The member for Dunkley comes in here parading himself as some friend of small business.




Mr Perrett:
  Mr ShamWow.




Mr HUSIC:
  Mr ShamWow—there he is with this false pretence that he will help small business. 


This week was a week of distractions. Yesterday the press gallery was in a state of confusion. I come from the great state of New South Wales. Mr O'Farrell, Premier of New South Wales, was deaf to the concerns about the drive-by shootings that have been happening in Western Sydney. I am happy to be corrected on this, but I thought there were about 60 drive-by shootings in the space of a year. We never saw anything, but all of a sudden yesterday the opposition discovered its concern for this issue.




Mr Perrett:
  When the AFP is successful.




Mr HUSIC:
  The AFP successfully intervened, Customs successfully intervened and those opposite were suddenly concerned about it. The press gallery was wondering where this all came from. The greatest smuggling act yesterday was these guys smuggling their embarrassment through distraction. What they tried to do yesterday was confect concern about something that we had been worried about for ages. The New South Wales government never did anything. The New South Wales government need to have something that can distract them from their problems with casinos in New South Wales. And you needed a distraction from the fact that you were not there to support business in this country because you announced you were putting your own interests above business interests. At least we stand up for the people that you always point out we represent: the union movement. You do not. The guys opposite fail to stand up for their own, the ones they claim they represent.


Look at the suite of policies that we have put in since 2007, all the things we have been doing. I have mentioned the asset tax write-off. I have mentioned the corporate tax cuts we are trying to make. We are providing a head start for small companies on the company tax rate, which you will deny through your actions in parliament. Businesses that operate as sole traders, partnerships and trusts will benefit from the next round of personal income tax cuts, which start in July this year. We have reduced quarterly pay-as-you-go income tax instalments for the 2011-12 income year for taxpayers using the GDP adjustment method, providing $700 million as a cash flow benefit to small business. Huge. Those are the types of things that we are doing. The New Enterprise Incentives Scheme is a program that helps eligible social security recipients to get into self-employment, to get into small business, giving them a start.


Look at the types of things that we on this side of the fence are doing to help small business but that are opposed by those opposite every single step of the way. They are not interested in jobs. Today demonstrated it. They were more interested in providing a job for someone they did not want to give a job to themselves. They were concerned that the former Treasurer and member for Higgins was not going to get the plum job at the Future Fund. Yet they would not even put him in as leader of their own party. That is what they are concerned about in this place. They are not concerned about the jobs created by small businesses. They are not concerned about the policies that we are putting forward that support small business. It was remarkable, I have to say, to hear the Leader of the Opposition talk about Peter Costello, the former member for Higgins. He has now been lionised by those opposite after he was demonised when he was in the parliament.


We had the situation where the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Warringah, was saying that the member for Higgins as Treasurer alone was responsible for two million jobs being created. Those opposite were in power for 11 years and they created two million jobs, but we have nearly cracked one million in one parliamentary term. What was the former member for Higgins doing in what we are told were great times for the economy? Those opposite were not interested in creating jobs. They were not responsible for creating jobs. They made life hard for working people trying to draw a wage through what they did with Work Choices. On top of that they put huge burdens on small business.


Where were they when small businesses were asking for help on trade practices reform? Missing in action. When small businesses were concerned about predatory pricing that was squeezing them out of business or when small businesses were concerned about creeping acquisitions, I remember the member for Higgins resisting the calls for trade practices reform, sitting on reports that had been done, reports that called for that reform to occur to help small business, which did not want to be muscled out by big business. I congratulate those opposite. They have got form. They are always helping out those big interests in the economy: Clive Palmer, our national treasure, Gina Rinehart—



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr HUSIC:
  I know you love Gina. I am waiting for the T-shirts to sprout on the other side of the chamber. Back then, they were going slow on competition reform, slowing things down so that small businesses could not get ahead. I never heard you, Member for Dunkley, ever raise that. The other thing is that I have never seen the member for Dunkley be so concerned about the fact that those opposite, your side of politics, would deny those people a tax cut. You are an absolute disgrace to small business. (Time expired)

Ms AE Burke
):  The member for Flynn is not being assisted by his colleagues. The member for Flynn has the call.




Mr O'DOWD:
  I think they are doing a great job. You cannot talk about small business without talking about big business, because a lot of small business works for big business. That is what you must consider. The week after the carbon tax was announced in this House, Rio Tinto, a big multinational company, put the Boyne smelter at Boyne Island on the market. It also put its 42 per cent share of the Gladstone power house on the market.


This MPI is about small business, but I am saying that Rio Tinto employed 4,000 people in Gladstone and a lot of subcontractors, who are small—




Mr Hartsuyker:
  The government will turn Rio Tinto into a small business!




Mr O'DOWD:
  That is right.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  One person has the call: the member for Flynn.




Mr O'DOWD:
  They talk about Clive Palmer; Clive Palmer is the man who saved a thousand jobs in Townsville at the zinc refinery. How many people does Gina Rinehart employ?


The wind-back on the solar hot water scheme: does anybody in the government realise what that meant to those businesses that had geared up to look after that industry? It just flattened them—bang! Finished. Those opposite rave on about the BER. I could tell you something about the BER. There were four examples in my area where small business could have done the job of building the BER—




Mr Billson:
  Didn't get a look in.




Mr O'DOWD:
  They did not get a look in. Do you know what? Their price was up to 50 per cent less.




Mr Hartsuyker:
  How much?




Mr O'DOWD:
  $900,000 from—




Dr Mike Kelly:
  It does sound like ShamWow.




Mr Bruce Scott:
  No, it's true.




Mr O'DOWD:
  It is true. I have got the evidence. Actually, I have given the evidence to the Senate. Reed Constructions was a favoured son of this government. Where is it now? Where are the contractors—the subbies—going to get their money from? There is nearly $100 million owed to subbies. Where has the money gone? The overall cost of the BER was about $4,300 per square metre to build libraries and that type of thing. The price to build a four-bedroom home with a double carport is about $1,200 per square metre. Where did that money go? How come Reed Constructions is in administration? I do not know.


Even the Road Safety Remuneration Bill 2011, which was discussed today in the House, is more red tape and more costs to small business. What small business hates is getting more bits of paper under their nose and being told: 'This is more regulation. You will do this; you will do that.' We have a taxation system. If you ring the tax office to get clarity on a problem you might have, depending who you ring, you might get five different answers. If you ring five different times you get five different answers.



Mr Bruce Scott interjecting—




Mr O'DOWD:
  Unbelievable! What was that?




Mr Bruce Scott:
  Are they answered in Australia?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Flynn has the call, and he is meant to be giving the speech.




Mr O'DOWD:
  Would you control the House, please!



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I might save us all and sit you down, if you are not careful!




Mr O'DOWD:
  The biggest problem affecting small business is productivity. Our productivity is the worst in the world.



Dr Mike Kelly interjecting—




Mr O'DOWD:
  You laugh, Member for Eden-Monaro, you clown: it is the worst in the world.



The SPEAKER:  The honourable member will withdraw the use of that term.




Mr Randall:
  Is 'clown' unparliamentary?



The SPEAKER:  It is all about the context.




Mr O'DOWD:
  I will withdraw, Mr Speaker. Small business is faced with a renewable energy tax. That was passed by both sides of the House, but it will have a big impact on business. It will add at least 10 per cent to costs, and that is before the carbon tax. The carbon tax has been well documented and talked about. Not only will it affect the 500 biggest polluters in Australia, those awful big companies that we used to encourage to come to Australia and set up their businesses, it will affect every man, woman and child in Australia. Make no mistake about that. It is not just going to affect the 500. IR laws are inflexible. That is why you are flat out getting a cup of coffee on a Saturday or a Sunday. From five o'clock on a Friday afternoon until eight o'clock Monday morning, you will pay dearly if you want a cup of coffee anywhere in Australia. We have a tourism industry. And guess what? Tourism does not really start until after five o'clock on any day of the week. Yet the laws are that stringent and that tough; there is no bending them.




Mr Bruce Scott:
  There are penalties everywhere.





Mr O'DOWD:
  Yes, there are penalties everywhere. (Time expired)

"Pyne, Christopher, MP",LP,2012-03-15,"



Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Manager of Opposition Business) (16:30):  I rise on the adjournment on a very serious matter that is afflicting not just Adelaide but towns across Australia, and that is the illegal importation of weapons. This is an issue that the opposition raised in question time yesterday. It is very important in the adjournment that we explain that this problem, which occurred at Sylvania Waters Post Office—the arrival of illegally imported weapons and those weapons then being used in the street fighting in Sydney—is not only a Sydney issue. It is very much an issue in Adelaide and in the rest of the country. But, as a South Australian member, my remarks are going to be about South Australia.


Stephen Pallaras, the Director of Public Prosecutions in Adelaide, only recently was bemoaning the level of violence, the level of lawlessness, that exists on the streets of Adelaide. He said:


… the level of violence in terms of the bikie violence has been escalating to a point where we are losing our sensitivity to these events …


Unfortunately that is true. Over the last few months and in the last 12 months there have been at least 12 drive-by shootings in the city of Adelaide. But there have also been gunfights in the last two or three months in Adelaide. On 16 January, a gunfight broke out between members of rival bikie gangs in a crowded hotel, the Findon Hotel, in the western suburbs of Adelaide. On 18 December a gunfight broke out at Caffe Paesano—a noted eatery in North Adelaide, in O'Connell Street—filled as it was, after Carols by Candlelight, with families and innocent South Australians simply going about their business. The place was riddled with the bullets of two rival bikie gangs. Nobody was killed but others have been killed in this bikie war that is occurring in my city.


As recently as a month ago, one of my own constituents, Giovanni Focarelli, was murdered in a bikie gunfight in the north of the city, and his father was very badly wounded. In fact, his father has been wounded and hospitalised numerous times over recent months. While I certainly do not defend the Focarelli family, sadly, after that gunfight, nobody who was present at it was able to help the police in their inquiries with bringing the perpetrators of that murder to justice. Unfortunately, the streets of Adelaide are becoming more like the streets of Gotham City or the shoot-out at the OK Corral.


Today I bemoan the fact that there is a causal link between the policies of this government and the bikie wars that are occurring in South Australia and also the organised gangland warfare that is going on in other parts of the country. There is a direct causal link, because this government made the decision to cut the Customs budget by $60 million. It made the decision to get rid of 340 staff; they were axed from the Customs department. At the same time, the government has increased spending by at least $1 billion to stop boats with illegal arrivals coming to Australia. That money would never have been needed to be spent if the government had simply kept the policies of the Howard government in place, which had stopped the boats.


The government changed that policy in August 2008 and since that time there has been a massive blow-out in the immigration budget. The government has found some savings in the Customs budget to fill that hole by removing staff from Customs. So Customs and Border Protection have been unable to detect the incoming illegal weapons that are being used in the warfare that is occurring around Australia and in my city of Adelaide. So there is a direct causal link between this government's reprehensible policy decision-making process and the safety of Australians. South Australians are being placed at risk by this government's very bad decisions.


We know that the number of scannings of air cargo inspections have dropped by 75 per cent and the scannings of sea cargo inspections have dropped by 25 per cent since the government introduced those cuts. The government stands condemned. For the first time in my 19 years in parliament, constituents are coming to see me because they are concerned about their safety and that of their families due to the lawlessness that now infects the streets of Adelaide. Adelaide is too beautiful a place to have been placed in this position, and the government is responsible for part of it. (Time expired)

"Griggs, Natasha, MP",CLP,2012-03-15,"



Mrs GRIGGS
 (Solomon) (09:30):  I rise again to raise the unresolved issue of the 396 RAAF base houses in Eaton in Darwin. I have spoken on this issue many times in this place and I will continue to do so until this issue is resolved. Many of my constituents are concerned about the rumours that Defence will knock down 100 Defence houses in Eaton so that DHA can replace them with 100 DHA owned homes. This is absolutely ridiculous. There is another way, and that way was suggested in the motion that I tabled and that was passed in June last year. Why is it that the Labor government continues to ignore the wishes of the people and the wishes of the parliament?


The government has done nothing in the last two years. Prior to the election, it was Labor's position to knock down those houses, despite the assurances from Minister Snowdon, a fellow Territorian. He said that the houses are safe. I suggest that with these rumours the houses are not safe. They are still planning to knock them down despite all the assurances given to me and the people of Darwin that this would not happen. It simply astounds me and other Territorians, including the Save Eaton Group, that 200 taxpayer funded houses can sit there and remain vacant in Eaton, rotting away in the Top End. The excuse of the houses not meeting Defence standards is wearing thin in my community. We believe that while these houses may not be to Defence standards they are definitely to community standards and they should be made available to Territorians. This is another example of why Territorians cannot trust Labor.


If the Territory Henderson Labor government cared about Territorians, it would be fighting alongside me to make these houses available to Territory people. It would stand up to the Gillard Labor government, join forces with me and say, 'Let's make these houses available to Territorians.' The Country Liberals support these RAAF base houses being made available to Territorians. Country Liberal leader Terry Mills, along with member for Fong Lim and former member for Solomon Dave Tollner and my other Country Liberal colleagues, supports my continued fight to make these houses available to Territorians.


Labor's waste and mismanagement of these taxpayer funded assets has put added pressure on the basic living costs of Territorians, which shows how out of touch Labor is. Julia Gillard and Labor claim that they care about working families yet they ignore the opportunity to use a significant portion of the Defence houses at Eaton to address the critical shortage faced by many Territorians. Unlike Labor, the coalition cares about families in the Territory, which is why we will continue to work hard with local residents and the Save Eaton Group to fight for what is best for Territorians, which is to make these houses available. A coalition federal government working with a Country Liberal Territory government would give Territorians hope, rewards and opportunities and make these houses available.

"Simpkins, Luke, MP",LP,2012-03-15,"



Mr SIMPKINS
 (Cowan) (10:12):  I certainly welcome the opportunity this morning to speak on the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (R 18+ Computer Games) Bill 2012. I join with all members of the House in agreeing that this is much needed reform, and we certainly look forward to the elements of this bill taking effect so that we can have greater confidence as we carry on into the future. We would have greater confidence that the young people and, in fact, the adults of this country are properly advised and, in appropriate cases, properly protected from some of the online computer game content that abounds in the world at this point.


A common theme when I go around and speak particularly to primary school classes in the electorate of Cowan, and senior classes, is that so many young people are keen to get into this industry. When we see the figure of $2.5 billion that is likely to be generated in the economy by the computer game industry by 2015, it is not a surprise, particularly for those of us who see that there are young people so keen to get into the industry to create games. As we know, there are a fairly large number of computer game laboratories generating these games around the country. When Apple informs us that they get upwards of 20,000 applications a month for games to be registered with them, it really does show that there is certainly demand and people are willing to satisfy supply.


That being said, it is a little bit of a mystery to me why some people are interested in some of the games that are produced. There are extremely violent games and there are games produced that have sexual content, which I think many people would have objections to. It really does come as a surprise that there is demand for such games. Whilst I will speak a little bit more about the differences between MA15+, R18+ and refused classification, what I would say is that greater protection, greater knowledge and greater information is long overdue in all cases with regard to such games. 


It is the case that, when this country has had the highest classification of MA15+, there have been substantiated allegations that there are some games that have been, as has been said, shoehorned into that category. Possibly there has been a bit of a liberal interpretation of the categorisation. Some games that we might think should not ordinarily be allowed to be accessed by those 15 years and above have actually made it into that category. Others of course have been refused classification, and I think that is good. What we will have with this legislation is that, for games that I think were MA15+ but probably should have been adult 18 and above only, we will have the opportunity to push those sort of games upwards, I would imagine. Also, where some of these games have had slight modifications made to them so that those that would have had R18+ classification in others parts of the world have been dragged down into the MA15+, but again with material in them that I think a lot of people would find quite concerning, there will be the ability to look again at those games and push them into R18+ classification. That is most definitely a good thing.


With regard to the classification of restricted 18+, what we will see is the restriction of sale, hire, display, advertisement and, in overall terms, warnings to parents. I am a parent, with two girls, aged 13 and nine, who are into games—definitely not the sorts of games that might have those classifications. I suspect Moshi Monsters is probably not going to see a categorisation above G. Angry Birds may be a little more severe, but is not going to be in this sort of category. I certainly hope that we will never see anything like an MA15+ game or anything worse than that in my house. But it is the case that the ability to provide warnings to parents on computer games through this legislation is very important. The alarm bells certainly do ring when you are a parent and you see something with an R on the front of it, and there is a difference between seeing those and M category movies. When that is transposed over to computer games, if parents see R18+ on the front of games they should be rightly concerned and should certainly examine them and find out whether their children are attempting to buy such video games or they are in the possession of their children.


It does, however, still come down to vigilance by the parents of those under 18 in keeping an eye on what is going on, so they can look at and examine things and make decisions if they find their children possess those games in their house and they have a concern that needs to be dealt with. But, as we also know through the work that has taken place over recent years and has been particularly noted by a House committee recently, the vast majority of gamers are actually young adults, I would say—around the age of 32—and many of them, 47 per cent, happen to be women now. What we are dealing with here is certainly freedom of choice. It comes down to adults being able to make informed choices. If they wish to buy R18+ games, that should certainly be the case. But I would always warn and advise parents to keep an eye on those under 18 and what is in their possession or what they are attempting to buy.


This legislation brings us into line with comparable nations in the Western world. It is bizarre that we have not had a classification. In Australia we have had classifications of MA15+ or refused classification, but there has been nothing in between. That has singled us out as being different from the rest of the Western world. So it is important that we have the R18+ classification, and I certainly welcome that. That is consistent with international standards.


It is a very important step forward. I think we will see that this is legislation which is non-controversial, and that is why we see it here in the Federation Chamber. But I would say that, while there is the provision in the bill that a game cannot be reclassified within two years of its having been classified, it is important that, should people have concerns about games currently rated MA15+, they consider trying to have those games reclassified to R18+. That would be a positive step forward. Currently there are games rated MA15+ which are concerning and not appropriate for those under the age of 18. Those games should be reviewed, and this legislation will allow that to happen. At the same time the classifying authorities should not be afraid of refusing classification where the content is beyond the point of classification. There are some really bizarre levels of violence and sexual content out there that I think should still be refused classification, and most people probably agree with that.


I welcome the introduction of this bill into the House. I look forward to it being passed and the classification R18+ adding some real value in this country and providing greater certainty and help for parents and gamers across Australia.

"Georganas, Steve, MP",ALP,2012-03-15,"



Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh) (10:23):  I too rise to support that Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (R 18+ Computer Games) Bill 2012. This issue was first raised with me by many of my constituents from Adelaide's western suburbs in the seat of Hindmarsh who contacted me, largely by email, a couple of years ago. They were very frustrated with the state of affairs at that particular time. As members in this place would be well aware, films—including those publicly shown—DVDs and computer games may be classified G, PG, M or MA15+. Films can also be classified R18+ or X18+. There has been no classification for computer games beyond that of MA15+.


We had a situation where the federal government, and every state and territory in the Commonwealth—bar one—supported the introduction of an R18+ classification for computer games. Without that classification, MA15+ continued as the highest, or the most restrictive, classification of games. The effect of this has been seen to be largely twofold. Firstly, materials which had not met the MA15+ classification have been refused classification and have been unavailable for sale in Australia. Importing such material, if caught, would result in fines or at least confiscation. Piracy thrives in such environments. Secondly, those responsible for the development of these games can tweak or resubmit their games and, I understand, in at least some cases eventually have those games passed as under MA15+ classification.


The bottom line of this is that kids can end up with games classified as MA15+ that have content that should much more appropriately have been classified as R18+. Kids can access material that they, on balance, should not or that we should not want them to access. There is good reason for having a well-graded, well-tiered system that enables the niche allocation to appropriate levels of restriction and access. It facilitates finely tuned classification and finely tuned marketing. This benefits all of us. We know what a product is, we know who should not be accessing it and we can know that we most probably do not want to access it when you have good classification. But this awkward, clumsy classification regime that can shed little light on what the content actually was has been the situation endured by many for some considerable time.


There has been universal support for change for quite some time, apart from the one state. Queensland supported change; Western Australia supported change; New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania supported change; the ACT and the Northern Territory supported change; the federal government supported change. Because my own home state, South Australia, opposed the change, change was defeated. It was unilaterally vetoed. So, when contacted by many of my constituents who were very concerned by South Australia's veto of the clear and unambiguous national will, I responded with my view that the will of the minority dominating or vetoing the will of the overwhelming majority is undemocratic and wrong. It is undemocratic for the few to rule contrary to the will of the majority—to dominate the majority or to veto the majority. That was my opinion at the time, which I communicated to all those that contacted me on this particular issue. It might be surprising that this view was very welcomed by most of the people that did contact me on this issue.


I certainly welcomed South Australia's new Attorney-General's agreement with each and every other state and territory in the land and the federal government. I welcome the fact that the will of the overwhelming majority will be respected and acted upon through this bill. I also welcome the benefits that this new classification should have for the gaming community in Australia: that is the protection of younger gamers from inappropriate materials and content and the better honouring, I hope, of the copyright law that should come with this bill. But it remains a curious issue that we can have eight players being vetoed by one sole state, territory or federal government. It goes, of course, to the creation of the National Classification Scheme under the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission concerning censorship procedure in 1991, over 20 years ago now. The recommended national approach to classification makes absolute, perfect sense. This is appropriate and it is good, in my view. The Intergovernmental Agreement on Censorship which underpins the scheme confirms that certain changes to the scheme, such as amendments to the National Classification Code and classification guidelines must be considered and agreed to by censorship ministers. It must be unanimous.


The intergovernmental agreement reads in part:




B. The aim of the new scheme is to make, on a co-operative basis, Australia’s


censorship laws more uniform and simple with 
c
onsequential benefits to the public


and the industry;





C. The new scheme accurately reflects, and maintains, the balance of responsibilities


that has been arrived at between Australian jurisdictions. It also recognises that, in


relation to the Code and classification guidelines, the Commonwealth, and the


Participating States are equal partners and that policy on these matters is derived


from agreement between all jurisdictions
 …



I observe that the preceding paragraph notes that it was not an agreement of national uniformity as such, as it contains the observation that, 'Western Australia and Tasmania will not participate in the new scheme in relation to publications.' It goes on to say:


Under the Act each Participating Minister and the Commonwealth Minister are to agree:


(a) on the classification guidelines;


(b) on amendments to those guidelines; and


(c) on amendments to the Code ...


Apparently publications were out, but, in relation to games, the required uniformity of opinion, the required unanimity of determination, is without exception and has, as a consequence of the position held by one of the nine ministers, held back what almost all have long considered positive change. This has been of immense frustration to my constituents that contacted me on this particular issue. It has been imbalanced, unfair, undemocratic and most unwelcome.


There probably is not much call for changes to the actual classification structure around Australia. It is not like the system requires ongoing maintenance and adjustment on a regular basis, so one might just write off this exercise as a bad experience and forget about it, but it is of concern to me that one of the nine can uphold reform. We saw something vaguely similar with Western Australia being the sole state not to sign up for the first national health deal. At least this was able to be negotiated, put through a process of give and take and manipulated into a form that does attract the agreement of each negotiator. There was sufficient detail to actually have negotiation. In this case it has been binary—it is a straight yes or no. I will leave my discontent there and move on in support of this bill. I commend it to the House.

"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,2012-03-15,"



Mrs MOYLAN
 (Pearce) (10:31):  I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this legislation on the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (R 18+ Computer Games) Bill 2012, which seeks to introduce an R18+ category for computer games, aligning the existing classifications levels for films and other publications.


Computer games, films and publications advertised or sold in Australia are currently regulated by the classification act, which sets out a sliding scale of age limits and a corresponding allowable impact of violence and sexual themes on the material covered. The scheme is designed to be user-friendly, allowing purchasers and particularly parents to easily decide whether the material they are buying or viewing, or that their children have access to, is suitable for the maturity of the individual. The procedures and thresholds for classification falls under federal jurisdiction to ensure national consistency. However, the states and territories independently legislate as to the level of material that can be advertised and sold within their borders.


Classifications are decided with reference to the impact test as well as the overall cumulative effect. At the more restricted end, movies and publications with a strong impact are deemed MA15+, high impact is R18+ and very high is refused classification, which prevents the material from being sold or advertised in Australia. However, computer games have been an anomaly. At the restricted end, they are classified as either MA15+ or, if the themes depicted exceed the strong impact threshold, they are refused classification.


The reason for omitting the R18+ classification category appears to stem from a recommendation made in 1993 by the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Electronic Technology. I am sure that in this place we would agree that 1993 was a long time ago. I do not think any of us could have at all foreseen the kind of video games that would be available on the market today. That committee made recommendations in their submission to the Attorney-General's Department at that time. Electronic Frontiers Australia and AusGamers noted that three assumptions underpinned the select committee's recommendation which resulted in the exclusion of the R18+ category. Those were that (1) computer games are only for children; (2) the level of technology involved with the use of computer games means that many parents do not necessarily have the competency to ensure adequate parental guidance; and (3) having regard to the extrasensory intensity involved in the playing of interactive games and the implications of long-term effects on users, games should be subject to stricter criteria for classification than those applying to film or video. We certainly know that computer games have gone far beyond children's toys and playthings. Certainly, it has been a bit of a minefield for many parents who are not technology savvy. There are still plenty of people in the community, who, although they can do the basics, find it difficult to understand the complexities of new technologies. 


The first point that computer games are only for children may, as I say, have been correct at that time, but we have now gone well beyond that. The classification code's first principle that adults should be able to read, hear and see what they want was viewed at the time as not relevant and, instead, focus was ascribed to the second principle that minors should be protected from material likely to harm or disturb them. It therefore seemed incongruous to allow for games with high-impact themes, when children were the focus of the industry. But that is no longer the case. Gaming technology and capability has exponentially increased, allowing for storylines, graphics and themes which have attracted increasingly older audiences. Research by Bond University, which was published last year, entitled Digital Australia, notes that the average age of video game players in Australia today is continually increasing. In 2005, the average gamer was 25 years old and today they are 32 years old.


More tellingly, 75 per cent of all video game players in Australia are aged 18 years or older. The ability of parents to ensure adequate control and guidance has also markedly increased, with computer literacy becoming a significant aspect of everyday life. We are having to grapple with this technology because so much is now done via a computer. But a clear-cut classification system would further assist parents when making choices about what games are suitable for their children to play, with an R18+ rating providing certainty that the game is unsuitable for children. 


Public support for an R18+ category appears to be very strong. In 2009, the Attorney-General's Department received 54,437 submissions to its discussion paper on the topic, of which a compelling 98 per cent were in favour of an R18+ category. Following more recent discussion papers on the topic, however, there has been strong opposition from a minority of submissions to the Attorney-General's Department that reinforce the Senate's original cautious approach regarding the interactive nature of gaming. A key concern was whether R18+ games have an acceptable place in society, regardless of age. Particular emphasis was placed on the fact that, in all other forms of media, the consumer is passive, by viewing, listening or hearing the relevant material. However, with computer games the consumer is actively directing events. Some of the games are extremely violent and extremely graphic.


Understandably, there is a worry that what happens in the virtual world has an impact on a person's real world. We would agree that this is probably so for children in particular and that allowing more violent and graphic games could lead to adverse social consequences. 


Research into this area has been mixed. It really depends on whom you listen to. Sometimes you have to wonder who is funding the research. For adults who have violent tendencies and who play video games, it is hard to distinguish whether gaming inflamed the violent behaviour or whether that person already had a violent disposition and was drawn to violent video games. For children, though, there is a greater likelihood that exposure to violent media will have a detrimental effect. It is sometimes very difficult to pick your way through this matter, because there are many and varied views on the subject. But I think that most parents would agree that we need to address the issue of classification and give parents some guidelines as to what might or might not be suitable for their young people.


The Australian Council on Children and the Media pointed to research undertaken by a long-term video game researcher Craig Anderson, whose 2007 journal article entitled 'The effect of video game violence on physiological desensitization to real-life violence' concluded:


It is not surprising that when the game involves rehearsing aggressive and violent thoughts and actions, such deep game involvement results in antisocial effects on the player …  


That is but one of the many views.


The council went on to argue that adopting an R18+ rating system would lead to a greater proliferation of violent games and, with that, children would be more likely to be exposed to violent media through adult family members playing the game in their presence or the children receiving the game or a copy from an adult. However, there is also a strong argument that a clear rating system, which shows that the game is for adults only, helps informed choices and gives adults confidence to tell children that the game is not suitable for them.


Regardless of which view is subscribed to, ratings systems are only part of the solution to this problem. With the proliferation of visual media, and the internet playing a part in every aspect of children's lives, it is incumbent upon all of us as adults and as parents to help children understand the distinction between reality and fantasy where computers are involved. I think we see this on Facebook too. I had one young person tell me recently: 'No, this is his other personality on Facebook. There's this one and there's another one over here. Which is the real one?' So I think we have a lot of work to do to help young people distinguish between the play, the fantasy and the reality.


I certainly appreciate the concern that many have about the impact of violent media and agree that ceiling standards developed in consultation with the community are necessary. To this end it is worth noting than an R18+ category is not a generic free-for-all category without limit. Games with a very high impact in terms of language, sexual references or violence would be refused classification in any event. Creating a specific adult category also helps ensure that minors are not exposed to unsuitable material. A number of games that are classified as R18+ in the United States and other countries are legally available in Australia at the moment and classified as MA15+. To meet the current Australian classification framework, developers sometimes make relatively minor adjustments to tone down the violence within their games, but the overall impact is still similar. Under the proposed changes, rather than having slightly altered adult games available to children, only adults would have access to them legally.


Ensuring classification consistency across all types of media is also important in helping empower consumers where we are now seeing convergence across all types of media. The distinction between interactive and non-interactive entertainment is increasingly blurred. That is another issue that modern society has to grapple with. Movies inspired by books are being easily transformed into video games with highly interactive internet advertising strategies. To increase the experience of customers, entertainment titles are sold as packages, often with a DVD, computer game and links to special internet content all contained in one packet. Censors are then placed in the unique and difficult position of having to determine whether to treat the items as a game or as a film, or potentially have different, dual ratings for the title's movie and game.


The gaming experiences are also becoming more cinematic, with seamless interaction between scripted plot segments and user-controlled action. The growth in popularity of role-playing games and their increasing plot sophistication make many of them seem like a 'choose your own' adventure movie rather than a traditional game. Also, the prolific computer graphic imagery in movies can be simply copied across to a game release, meaning there is nearly no difference in visual depiction between the game and the movie itself. 


The trend towards convergence is only increasing and makes the traditional argument of a difference between interactive and non-interactive media irrelevant. Without a consistent classification framework confusion can arise, ultimately eroding the whole intention of the system, which is to empower consumers and, I suppose, to look after the interests of children.


The 2009 report by Bond University entitled Interactive Australia makes the point that the absence of an R18+ rating for computer games has potentially misled parents and consumers. By not acknowledging the full spectrum of game suitability an artificial view has been created that violence and themes portrayed in games are not as bad as what can be seen in the movie or on TV because they do not extend to R18+ ratings. Research in Interactive Australia found that four out of five parents are influenced by the Classification Board's ratings, but nearly two-thirds are unaware of them and there is currently no R18+ classification for video games. Respondents are worried with a common reply, 'If I knew that, I would not think MA15+ was for my 15-year-old.' Having an R18+ classification is a sensible response to the changing attitudes and demographics of gamers. It also strengthens the classification framework ensuring that unsuitable games are less likely to end up in the hands of children and empowers parents and consumers through increased awareness and increased knowledge. I think much work has been done to try to find a way through what is clearly a very difficult subject matter and one that causes great divisions within the community, like so many of these modern conundrums. But I think we probably have the best possible outcome and I commend the bill to the House.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2012-03-15,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley—Government Whip) (10:46):  With these things, we usually get up and say we are pleased to speak on the bill. From my perspective, I am relieved to be speaking on the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (R18+ Computer Games) Bill 2012, because it has taken 10 years to get to the point where we make a decision about the classification of video games and, as the member for Pearce indicated in her contribution, the feedback on this matter was phenomenal. There were 54,000 public submissions received on this issue alone showing a huge amount of interest in this matter. I think it shows the degree to which this is not just something that is seen as a kids' domain; this is something that has been embraced and featured in homes across the country for many years by people of different ages. As I said, for the past decade, the Commonwealth, the states and the territories have been unable until recently to agree to the reforms required for the introduction of this classification for computer games.


It is an important reform, not only for the Australian adult population who have long asked for the right to make personal decisions about their entertainment but in recognising that we have a flourishing industry that is involved in the design and development of computer games right here in Australia. The development industry is growing and has got itself a fantastic international reputation. I commend to the Federation Chamber the Working in Australia's Digital Games Industry: A Consolidation Report, which was released last year by the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Creative Industries and Innovation and the Queensland University of Technology. It was done in conjunction with the Game Developers' Association of Australia. That association described the local industry in the following terms. It said: 


Australia has a dynamic and sophisticated game development industry. With experience developing and marketing products for the largest game publishers in the world, Australia offers the best in creative talent, advanced technology and management experience.


In the report it seeks to demonstrate the breadth of the industry in the country by relying on the Australian Bureau of Statistics report, which in 2008 released the first issue of Digital Game Development Services, Australia. As at June 2007, it noted—and I imagine these figures continue to increase but they are worth noting—that 45 game development businesses operate in Australia, with three-quarters operating out of Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. Of the 1,431 workers employed in the games development industry, 695 are located in the member for Herbert's great state of Queensland, representing 48.6 per cent of all workers in the country. Artists, animators and programmers combined account for over 63 per cent of games workers and nonresidents account for 6.1 per cent of those workers. In terms of export, the figures are fantastic. Bear in mind, too, that a lot of small businesses operate in this sector—close to 50—and it is indicated that they employ up to five workers. There are 11 small- to medium-sized businesses employing six to 50 workers and large businesses operating with over 200 workers.


I sit on another committee, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Infrastructure and Communications, and, as part of our work last year we went around the country in the course of developing our report on the NBN and our report Broadening the debate talks about a lot of the creative and visual arts businesses that will now be able to collaborate with businesses overseas and, off a platform of superfast broadband, be able to shift large packets of data overseas. If you look at the industry now and at what we are doing in revitalising our technological infrastructure, you see this will open up huge sections for our local economy, particularly the one that we are referring to today in terms of games development. It will give people a head start in an industry that young people in particular want to be able to work in.


The classification issue we discuss here is enormously relevant because it opens up the scope of work that can be done by local businesses where people do not want to see their work, their time and the investment that they put into it suddenly held up because our classifications have not kept pace with the rest of the world. As I said, there is that $161 million of revenue, most of it export earnings, with the revenue from games development growing at a rate of 16 per cent annually for the five years leading to 2010-11. So this bill gives the industry the certainty that they had long hoped for and it lets them attract much-needed investment, particularly from overseas, and there is that collaboration that I referred to earlier. It will also achieve for them parity with the much larger film industry, which for many years has enjoyed investment and incentives that they can only dream of accessing. The games development industry, a relatively small player compared to their global competitors, continues to compete with developers overseas who in some cases receive industry assistance for their work. Without doubt this bill will improve their competitiveness in what is globally a $25 billion industry.


I want to pick up on some statistics as to one recent game that was released—Modern Warfare 3, developed by Activision. It had the largest on-day, or early, shipments registered in history. Some 1.5 million people queued at 13,000 stores across the UK and the US to buy this one game. In the US and the UK over 6.5 million copies of the one game were sold on one day and grossed, in the first 24 hours, $400 million, a huge amount of money. So you can see the interest that is there. I want to come back to that game later because it is absolutely relevant in the context of what we are discussing now.


The bill that has come before parliament today reflects in a sense our nation's growing up. It was not that long ago, as I indicated earlier and as the member for Pearce reflected upon in her contribution to this debate, that these games were seen as the domain of children and adolescents. As many of these young people matured so too did their taste in games and so did the games themselves. The present regime fails to take into account that computer gaming is no longer the sole domain of young people. The Interactive Games and Entertainment Association estimates 55 per cent of gamers are now over the age of 18 and the average age is now 30 years old. If you want an indication of how far things have come, look at how many members of parliament will actually speak in this debate alone. I have estimated close to 25 MPs will be devoting some part of their time to debating this very bill.


If we are going to talk about declaring interests, I actually own an Xbox 360 and for my birthday my wife bought me a Kinect, which we both use as well. All this reflects the diversity as consoles change, and you have the Wii, which has been used in nursing homes of all things to keep people who are older mobile and active. A few years ago I had the opportunity to read a really novel book by Stephen Johnson called Everything Bad is Good for You, which reflects on movements in popular culture and what those are actually doing to us as people. So the complexity, for instance, of what we watch on TV in terms of storylines—but even of video games themselves—calls on us to think and to use our motor skills and to be a lot more imaginative and innovative. He charts how changes in popular culture and changes in scores, for example, by students in schools with those IQs actually going up, and he talks about the interaction of TV, popular culture and games on those. So this is having a big impact. A 2011 report, which I referred to earlier, found that currently almost half of gamers are female and that 55 per cent of seniors, age 65 and older, play games. So in this context it is well and truly time that we permit the introduction of this R18+ classification for games. The bill will bring the classification of games into the 21st century. It will make the system much more relevant to the community and, whilst not every adult will want to access R18+ video games, it has long been the view of a large proportion of the adult population that they should have the right to decide what entertainment is appropriate for them to consume.


Under the present regime the Office of Film and Literature Classification will review a game and, if they find that game to be too violent or not fitting with community standards for a MA15+ rating, they will effectively ban it from sale in Australia by refusing classification for the game. That system has not served us well in recent times. There have been a number of well-publicised occasions on which games have received classification only to have it later withdrawn. The most notable example was in 2005, with the introduction of the game 'Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas,' which was rated in the US as MA15. However, the authorities in the US later discovered a feature which allowed users to engage in explicit sex scenes through software modification called 'Hot Coffee'. The game in the US subsequently had its rating changed to the higher R18 rating, but the lack of such a classification in Australia meant that the game was banned, despite 250,000 games having already been sold here.


There are also other examples. Going back to the modern warfare example, many people would not realise that Modern Warfare 2 has a scene in it where you take on the role of a Russian ultranationalist terrorist. You walk through an airport where you gun down people in that scene. That, frankly, is too violent and graphic for younger audiences and, if parents knew that it existed, they would be horrified. We need a classification system that takes it out of that age group and puts it into a much older age bracket. To be honest, I found that scene very confronting. Frankly, I do not know why you would need to have that in a game, because of what the member for Pearce indicated about the virtual world and reality. We definitely need a move whereby we do not see a game entirely banned but see absolutely reasonable concerns addressed through a classification system that is keeping pace with modern times.


This bill is not without its detractors. Many representations have been made opposing the introduction of an adult-only classification. Among the concerns is that games will include content currently refused classification, as I indicated earlier, that are deemed distasteful or excessively violent. While I do not doubt that some of that content may be offensive to adult members of the community they, equally, have the choice not to play these games. What has not attracted much attention is the introduction of the R18+ rating, which will give the Office of Film and Literature Classification the scope to apply that rating to games currently rated MA15+. I am sure many parents would be horrified at the level of violence contained in games that children can already access. Current guidelines allow MA15+ games to contain pretty violent, explicit and extreme content. The bill may reduce that level of violent and offensive content.


Views have been expressed that, in some places, R18+ games will eventually make their way into the hands of underage people. My view is that you cannot blame that on the classification system. The system is essentially there to guide people's choice of what to view, what to read, what to play and for parents to make choices for children. Obviously, it is the responsibility of parents to know what their children are viewing and playing, but sometimes they just do not know and will not necessarily follow what is contained in a game because they are not going to play it themselves. However, having a classification system in place allows parents the ability to make active decisions that they believe are in the best interests of their family, particularly young children. If anything, the R18+ rating will only make that job easier as most reasonably minded parents will not permit their child to play something with an R rating but may contemplate allowing them to play an MA rated game. Again, it is up to families to make that choice.


I think the level of interest in this matter has been terrific. I think it reflects a broader societal move. I think the classification, as I have said, is long overdue. It is good that it has come in and I certainly commend the bill to the House.

"Jones, Ewen, MP",LP,2012-03-15,"



Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (10:59):  I would like to echo the words of the member for Chifley. What an industry this is. I rise to speak on the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (R 18+ Computer Games) Bill 2012. I do so in the full knowledge that I know absolutely nothing about the modern computer game. I know absolutely nothing about gaming. It is completely and utterly beyond me why people even bother with it. My level of gaming was playing Asteroids down at the cafe at lunchtime putting 20c in the machine. Asteroids was my game of choice. You blew up rocks on a black and white screen. I could quite happily pass half an hour playing that.


We have an Xbox 3, a PlayStation 3, a Wii and an iTouch at home, which my son, my wife and my daughters play. They could be sitting on there watching people kill themselves—I would not know. And that is half the problem with the way that gaming is these days. I have a 10-year-old son. He is forever gaming. He loves them. The best thing about it as a parent is that it keeps them quiet; they are out of the road. That is one of the dangers with gaming. I know of families with children who are not even teenagers yet who are playing Grand Theft Auto. Because they are in their room by themselves and they are quiet, that is okay. That will play out in other ways down the track.


Getting back to this bill, this will allow games that are deemed inappropriate for children to be sold in Australia with the new category 'restricted to adults'. As the member for Chifley said, when I was first approached about and made aware of this bill I thought that it was about kids. But gaming is not about children anymore. Our lives have changed. We have become more sedentary. We have become more stay-at-home. These games are a way of enjoying time at home. It is a personal choice. As the member for Chifley said, most of these gamers are over 18. The average age of gamers is now 30. There are some great benefits there.


This bill will align the computer game classification system with the more commonly understood film and television classification systems. Far from allowing more violent and inappropriate computer games into the country, this bill will ensure that kids are not able to buy and play video games that they should not be playing. It will also allow people who are over 18 to get games that are currently banned in Australia. At the moment, the highest classification is MA15+. This means that some of the extremely violent and explicit games are not allowed into the country, while many more that should be restricted to just adults are allowed in and sold to people who are under 18 because their current restriction is just MA15+. Experience shows us that very few games made for adults are restricted from being sold in Australia, meaning that most are given the MA15+ rating. Far from being a system that prevents minors from playing inappropriate games, it is enabling them to do just that.


I know kids who are playing Grand Theft Auto and those sorts of games. That will play into how children behave at school and those sorts of things. I was talking to a principal at one of my local schools. People want to send their kids to his school because there they will be disciplined. He said, though, that if parents are not doing it at home they cannot expect it to be done there. We are seeing a shift in the way that parents parent. When I was a child, the last thing that you would do if you got in trouble at school was to tell your parents, because automatically your parents' default position would be to side with the teacher. Now we are seeing more and more that the parent is siding with the child and chastising the teacher in front of the child, thus reinforcing the child's position. These parents have disengaged by letting these kids watch these sorts of games and then the kids come to school and play that out through their language or actions. And then the parents reinforce that attitude by chastising the teacher. And then we wonder why 22 per cent of all teachers leave the industry after only three years. There are things at play here that we have to be very careful about.


Aligning the video game classification with that of movies will also help parents to stop their kids playing games that are not appropriate. Most people are familiar with the movie classification system, as movies are much more mainstream than video games, particularly for parents. Many parents do not realise that MA15+ is the highest classification that we have for video games and that therefore games with that rating may not be appropriate for teenagers. This bill corrects that problem. That is a positive thing. As the member for Chifley said, the number of members who are speaking on this bill is a testament to how serious this is and what an industry this has become. Finally, this bill is about fairness. As I said before, video games are not the domain of kids and teenagers. Seventy per cent of computer gamers are actually over the age of 25. Nobody wants to see violent and explicit games in the hands of kids, but gamers who are over the age of 18 have every right to play these games if they choose to. Given that such a majority of the gaming community are adults, it is only right that we allow them to buy these games in this country. 


I hate to keep going back to when I was child but, when I was a child, my grandmother would take us to the movies. We would see Pinocchio or The Love Bug or those sorts of things, which were strictly G rated and strictly for kids. Even now, the G rated films are different. We saw Snow White, the cartoon. There is nothing in there. There is no subtext or anything like that. But if you go and watch any Pixar picture now, because it is such a big industry, because the graphics are there, because so many parents are going with their kids, there is so much more in there for the parent. There are jokes. If you watch any of the Pixar movies, or the latest kids' films, you will find the parents laughing at one stage and the kids laughing at another. There are so many little things in there for popular culture.


As a parent, I have been concerned about violent and graphic content that has become common and accepted in video games. There are far too many games, despite their content, which are easily accessible to young teenagers. The absence of an 'adults only' category has clearly not helped us restrict this access to inappropriate games. The introduction of the 18+ category is a common-sense measure to help us properly address this issue. That is the message that video gamers in my electorate have been telling me. We are one of the last countries to get on board with this measure and it is time that we did. 


The North Queensland Cowboys spend so much time training. Their day is structured around training. They get to go home. Every one of them is a gamer. Every one of them has an Xbox 3, a PlayStation 4, an Xbox 360  et cetera. These guys all game. They are all adults, all grown up and none of them go out and kill people. So we have to make sure that we protect these sorts of things.


I was contacted by Gavin Dwyer about the concern that the gaming community in Townsville has about this issue. They want to make sure that the legislation is passed. They have been fighting for this for years. I want to ensure that it finally gets through. He reiterated to me that video gamers are not just kids. That seems to have been the consistent theme through this whole debate. There are far more adults and there are no reasons that they should not be able to decide for themselves what is and what is not appropriate to play. I also spoke to Rob from Gametraders in Townsville about this bill and about the impact, from his perspective, that it would have on the gaming retailers. This is only allowing stores to give gamers what they want, which can only be good for business. As he pointed out, in a difficult retail environment this gives them the freedom of choice to provide a product that adult gamers want to buy and that, as adults, they should be able to. As the member for Cowan said this morning in his contribution to the debate, Apple is receiving applications for over 20,000 games a month to be registered on their network—that is, 20,000 games a month across the world. We are talking about a major industry here. Mr Dwyer said, 'People like me have been left behind by it, but there is no reason why everyone else should have to pay for it.'  He also said that no game shop wants to see generally bad and inappropriate games go through, but most of the customers in his shops are adults and want to be given access to the games, regardless of whether they think children should be able to play them. This bill simply allows for that. 


I would like to touch a little on the difference between an adult and a child when we look at things such as movies or games, at the actual violence and the stylisation of violence that goes on here. I love Quentin Tarantino films and the stylised violence of Reservoir Dogs. I just love that film, irrespective of whether the guy ends up getting his ear cut off. It is a very nasty piece of film but, because the whole thing is set in this quasi comedy, in this quasi surrealness, you know that it is not real. I also watched Once Were Warriors, the New Zealand film. There is a scene where he belts his wife. I found that the most disturbing bit of film I have ever seen in my life. It really upset me—the towelling he gave his wife was just so real. He sent her away and then in the morning she comes out with her face so puffed up and bad and he says, 'Geez, go and clean yourself up, woman,' and just walked out of the room. Those are the sorts of things where I, as an adult, can make the differentiation. But when it comes to games, I think we have to understand that people see things differently—what we see as stylised violence someone else may see as an absolute graphic display of violence and destruction that is going to feed into people and we are going to have mass murderers walking around the place. It does not happen because people can make that difference and correlation.


Take shows like The Simpsons. My son loves The Simpsons. He does not get half of The Simpsons; he does not get what they are about. All he sees is colour and movement. I love The Simpsons because there is so much popular culture in there, and so many references to the movies I have seen. Every night it is a quiz to go in and watch The Simpsons so that you can see where the links are, what they are trying to say, what that subtext is. Those are the sorts of things that I think gamers are very much aware of.


When it comes to this bill, it is about time we started treating people like adults. If it is an R18+ they should be able to make that decision for themselves. It is not so much trying to buy condoms at the pharmacy when you are 15—someone may have told me about that once upon a time. It is about making a conscious decision about the way you want to play your life. But for the kids who are playing these games instead of other things I just say this: instead of playing a game can we just go outside and kick a ball? When you are going in a car can you just look out the window? I am always reminded of the story told by Billy Connolly—Billy Connolly's World Tour of Scotland. He and Pamela had the kids with them. On their last night they stayed in this castle in Edinburgh and they built a great big dragon's nest and they had a bonfire and the sparks were flying up into the night—only Billy Connolly can tell the story. The next day when they were going back to the United States he sat the kids down—they had been all over Scotland for 16 weeks and done and seen amazing things—and asked them what was the best part of the trip. The kids got into a huddle and then came back and said, 'Sesame Street'. They had the DVDs of Sesame Street in the Tarago as they were driving around and that was the best part of it. He said he felt like he had just wasted 16 weeks of his life trying to educate his kids. I was driving to Ayr recently and for only the second time since I have been in Townsville I saw a brolga, Townsville's emblem. It is a beautiful flighted bird; it is the largest flighted bird in Australia. I looked out the window and said, 'Look, kids—a brolga.' They were all just sitting there gaming away. Anything could have happened. So, look out the window, go and kick a ball, go and throw something, go and play with someone, go for a swim, do something with your lives other than just gaming. I recommend the bill to the House.

"Gash, Joanna, MP",LP,2012-03-15,"



Mrs GASH
 (Gilmore) (11:13):  The extent to which video games influence the development of young minds is open to debate. Indeed, it is a complex issue. Young minds are influenced by a large variety of factors. Most cope very well and grow up well adjusted—some do not. Some are easily influenced by external stimuli, while most can and do make rational and responsible decisions despite potentially adverse influences. Some reach levels of maturity earlier than others while some never arrive. These are the realities of life. The key is how the family unit is supervised and how responsibilities are distributed.


The Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (R 18+ Computer Games) Bill 2012 to introduce an R18+ category for video games simply provides another tool to assist responsible parents. I say 'responsible' because the only people who can enforce this classification are the parents. Based on previous experience it is unrealistic to expect that this can be enforced in any meaningful way by governments. We went through the issue of alcopops. The government imposed a heavy tax premium on premixed alcoholic drinks. The result was that we just shifted the problem. The same can be said about selling tobacco to minors. It has been written into law forever yet you walk down the street and you see groups of 14-year-olds puffing away without a care in the world. No one challenges them. It has become an accepted fact of life. Every now and then you hear about a prosecution for illegal sales to a minor, but in the main it is safe to say it has very little impact. Sadly, some parents even condone the behaviour by allowing children almost free will. The fact remains that despite the millions of dollars sunk into protecting and barricading minors from smoking many just do and society is accepting the fact.


Video games are in the same mould. I think by attaching a prescriptive restriction to a product you only make it more tempting. We already have the MA15+ classification applied and that means games are restricted to those over 15. If you are under 15 you cannot legally access the material or play the game without being accompanied by a legal guardian. Does that stop the proliferation of these games? Has the classification protected sensitive young minds? I think not because the ones more likely to be attracted are those whose curiosity has been whetted—the very type of mind the classification seeks to protect.


For what it is worth I found this on Wikipedia. The Entertainment Software Association states that 20 per cent of video game players are boys under the age of 17 and 26 per cent are over 50 regardless of gender so that the average game player is 37. This has been ascribed to a 2009 fact sheet published by the Entertainment Software Association in America. I went to their website and there it was. In a survey of 1,102 teenagers aged 12 to 17, 97 per cent of them said they play video games. Moreover half the survey respondents said they had played a video game in the last day. Three-quarters of parents who were surveyed said that they checked the ratings on their children's games. However, half the boys who were asked about their favourite game listed a game with an M or AO rating as their favourite content and just 14 per cent of girls. It is the temptation of the forbidden which is the drawcard and the adults only rating helps to act as the pointer.


The entry goes on to say that the adult demographic is the fastest growing segment of the American video games market. Thirty-two per cent of adults are playing video games, although critics have suggested that such statistics are often used to deflect from the fact that almost all American children are exposed to video games. That is the American experience and, given our love affair with American culture, I would say that statistics in Australia are not too wide off the same mark.


The point I am trying to make is that, at the end of the day, with the way things are it is not going to matter very much whether an R18+ rating is applied or not. The only benefit I see in this bill is that it introduces a uniform classification to that applied to film and television and as a result it is easier to understand. At least in standardising the approach it may help to minimise confusion. To an extent, this classification debate is largely academic. What is pertinent are two questions: will this tool be used and how will it be used? I do not have that answer but when I was reading up on the subject I came across a little article on a games blog site written by Mark Serrels. The website is kotaku.com.au. Published in October last year the article talks about the classification review and the panel chair, Professor Terry Flew. It is important to understand what his views are. The article says:


'One of the things we were aware of from the outset taking on the inquiry,'


says Professor Flew—


'was that there was considerable dissatisfaction with the R18 classification issue—that this issue had been on the agenda for over a decade and, as you may well be aware, gamers were a very important group in making submissions to this enquiry. So we're certainly aware of the importance of the issue.'


According to Professor Flew:


R18+ was an issue that really exemplified and exposed the difficulties of using 20 year old legislation to navigate a post-internet age.


In other words, the person who will be administering the new arrangement believes it is already redundant. The article goes on:


'Games have an interesting status in terms of the Classification Scheme in two respects,' … 'Firstly, the assumption that computer games were considered to be more akin to films and broadcasting proved to be historically significant—you have to remember that decisions were being made in what was largely a pre-internet era.


'Secondly there was a range of what some sociologists and others call 'moral panics', particularly with regards to the interactive nature of games. There was the idea that games impacted on individual behaviour,' …


'This was all, in a sense, amateur psychology—before anyone was playing the kind of games with which we would eventually become familiar. But there was a sort pre-emptive set of assumptions made about the impact of interactivity that continued to resonate through the decisions being made about video game classification.'


This bill is less to do with any real attempt at addressing the real issues than about being seen to be doing something—anything. From where I stand right now I can safely say that this bill may not help much but it will not hurt much either. Is this regulation made for the pure sake of it and nothing else, or will it achieve something?


The essence of what Professor Flew is saying about this type of legislation is that it should be able to meet the demands of an ever-fluid environment. What may have seemed appropriate 10 years ago is anachronism today. Earlier, I mentioned adolescents smoking and drinking. It is safe to say that the best outcome of legislation prohibiting the sale of tobacco and alcohol to minors is that it helped to contain the incidence of early experimentation.


Both tobacco and alcohol are addictive substances to those who are vulnerable to addiction and have addictive traits. The same can be said about almost anything in society. I well remember the parental debates in the 1950s and 1960s about the addictive nature of television. Most of us survived. The legitimisation of the pornography industry in the 1970s and the 1980s was a similar phenomenon. Did we survive that? It seems that we did, except perhaps for a very small slice of the population who are prone to addiction.


There is no doubt that upwards of 80 per cent of the population supports the introduction of an R18+ category, so the bill is a no-brainer. We live in an age in which our children are more computer savvy than we are. The computer age has delivered a rapid expansion of knowledge and access at a speed that is generally beyond the comprehension of many adults and beyond their ability to adapt to. And it cannot be contained. Yet it forms a significant part of everyday life. We cannot escape it. That is where the youth of today have it over us. I would ask any parent this question: do you really know what your children are getting up to? And, if you do not, do you trust them to do the right thing by you?


We recognise the contribution of the game development industry to the Australian economy and also note that more than 88 per cent of Australian households own a device for playing computer games. The Australian gaming industry is forecast to grow at a rate of about 10 per cent a year, with forecasts predicting that it will reach $2.5 billion annually by 2015. Australia has 25 major game development studios which export over $120 million worth of products a year. Australia is the only Western country that does not have an R18+ classification for games. The UK, EU member countries, the United States and New Zealand all have adult classifications for computer games. In the interests of conformity on the world stage, adopting a universally recognised system of measurement would be beneficial.


This bill is really about self-regulating censorship of video games. There is no doubt that it is intended for parents. As much as we approach this with the best of intentions, we cannot guarantee that those who need it most will use it. The irony is that responsible and well-intentioned adults already monitor the activities of their children. There are many children out there who are already accessing MA15+ games, some with the blessing of their parents. Others are exploiting the ignorance or apathy of their parents. It is specifically that style of parenting that should be targeted. But will this legislation achieve that?


As I said earlier, is there any point to this legislation but housekeeping? I do not oppose the bill. My concern is the proliferation of these games and their ability to desensitise some children to violence and sexuality. What needs to be emphasised is that this R18+ classification is primarily for parental control purposes. In recognising these games, we do not want to keep the impression that they are somehow government approved. This legislation alone will not compel parents towards more responsible parenting. Parents who have a cavalier attitude towards their children viewing inappropriate material have to be engaged in some other way. Perhaps, by focusing on regulating the industry, we may be distracting ourselves from the main agenda. Perhaps that is why there is a growing move to willingly shift personal responsibility away from the individual and onto the government. Parents still have an obligation to decide what is okay for their children. The role of government is surely to help parents in that process but not to take it over.


In conclusion, who should be the censor? Should it be the government or should it be the parent? I would like to recognise and acknowledge Jessica Cowan from Kiama, who is here on work experience and who has had input into this speech.

WYATT ROY
 (Longman) (11:24):  Once again I find myself rising to speak on matters of freedom of choice and individual responsibility. This morning I rise to speak to the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (R18+ Computer Games) Bill. This bill comes on the back of 12 months of public consultation, with 98 per cent support for its main measure, which is to introduce an R18+ category for computer games. The introduction of an R18+ category for computer games is an important step in the advancement of the computer game industry, as well as for the media industry generally. This measure will bring Australia into line with many other countries around the world that have a classification process for computer games and will create consistency across Australian classification for other film classification categories. Currently in Australia, the highest legal classification available for computer games is MA15+. Computer games that are deemed to have content beyond the scope of the MA15+ level are currently not classified and instead are deemed to be refused classification in Australia. This scenario has wide reaching impacts on the gaming community and on society more broadly. These impacts present a compelling and valid argument to create an additional category for computer games, that of R18+.


The real issue at play here is not the video games themselves; there is a more basic ideological belief that compels this argument. We on this side of the chamber believe in individual rights, liberties and freedom. We believe that the lives of adults need not be governed by Big Brother but that individuals deserve to have the opportunity to make decisions about the way they live their own lives. Certainly, in terms of entertainment, we believe that, so long as a particular behaviour or activity does not adversely impact on others, an individual should be able to have every choice about what entertainment media they want to consume. The inclusion of this additional classification of the R18+ category will restore liberty to adults, giving them choice to legally consume gaming entertainment. The video games that adults choose to engage with should be their decision alone, not the decision of a government. This is exactly what this bill seeks to address. Not only should it be an individual's freedom and responsibility to determine their own entertainment; it should also be a choice to access the same standard of content across different mediums. In Australia at the moment there is a strange circumstance where the medium is determining the maturity of the content allowable to consumers. But why should we determine that R18+ content, which at the same level of classification across other categories is allowable, is instead disallowed simply for a different medium, namely video games?


This is a flawed system with no logical grounding. There is no reason that content at the maturity level of R18+, regardless of the medium in which it is located, should be treated similarly. Again, for a country that prides itself on fairness and equality, this is an interesting contradiction. Beyond the scope of personal freedom, our current system of classification is leaving us open to more sinister loopholes, which have been exploited to the detriment of both the gaming industry and society in general. Presently in Australia, gaming content is being down rated simply to move around the lack of an R18+ category, in order to minimise the number of video games that are being refused classification. Content has been modified to manipulate the existing classification system, which is in fact posing more of a risk to young people than extending the classification system would do. Fallout 3, Grand Theft Auto IV and House of the Dead are all examples of the down rating of games to prevent causes for refused classification. In the cases of Fallout 3 and Grand Theft Auto IV, the games have undergone minor cosmetic surgery to manipulate our flawed classification system to result in an MA15+ classification. More concerning still, was that the House of the Dead, which has been classified for adults only around the world, has been classified as MA15+ in Australia, with no changes whatsoever to its content. Fallout 3, even with minor changes, was refused classification in Britain, across Europe and in New Zealand. Similarly, Grand Theft Auto IV has been restricted to R18+ in other countries, while being available to anyone over 15 in Australia, after some small changes. Clearly there are major disparities between classifications in Australia and elsewhere that demonstrate that our existing classification system is not working. These disparities indicate that Australia needs to lift its game and make changes to its classification system to ensure that it is effective. The best way to do this is to add the category of R18+.


I fear that attempts to hijack this debate are being made by some in the public sphere who are trying to make this a debate about the safety of young people and their exposure to content that is deemed unsatisfactory for their years. Safety is always an issue; protecting our young people is always important. But the argument that expanding the classification system will expose our young people to inappropriate content is fallible and untrue. By regulating classifications more through the creation of an additional level of classification, it is less, not more, likely that young people will be exposed to content beyond their maturity.


Unfortunately it is the human condition to break rules, to push boundaries and to obtain the impermissible. Across many different countries for many different goods and services, in our history we have seen evidence that banning products usually results in an underground illegal market. Such markets thrive on the illegality of a product and exist generally below the radar of law enforcement. I do not condone this behaviour but merely note its existence. In the case of what we have here to debate today, we have observed that part of the problem with our current situation is that individuals are still sourcing these games illegally and without any regulation. The indiscriminate nature of this illegal market for games means that there is absolutely no parameter for who is able to access them. Savvy teenagers are getting their hands on content that is undeniably beyond their maturity. This is a problem, one that should be presented with a solution.


An effective solution is simple: classify this content so that there is no illegal demand and instead the oxygen is sucked out of the illegal market for these games. By classifying content as R18 rather than refusing classification, it is more difficult, not less difficult, for young people to be exposed to content beyond their years.


The introduction of the new media technologies has always caused moral panics in our society. There are many examples to choose from, but let me just choose a few. When the Gutenberg printing press was first developed, social panic surrounded the initial mass printing of Bibles. What would happen to society if the Catholic Church were to lose absolute control of the biblical message? After a few years when Bibles became more commonplace, the fear and anxiety around mass access to the Bible and the hype about the potential degradation of society as a result was soothed. More recently, the increasing prevalence of televisions in the lounge rooms of families around the world inflamed a moral panic when it was assumed that the institution of the family would come to a grinding halt and fade from society, as it was presumed that the television would become the all-absorbing central aspect of people's lives, deadening their cognitive function and destroying an individual's capacity and desire to interact with others.


The truth is that moral panics have surrounded the introduction and rise of most new media technologies and video gaming is no exception. The current discussion about video games has been framed with a very negative light. The fear of this new technology and its integration into society has seen emotions inflamed. But there is no reason for fear to prevent a logical, common-sense decision to expand Australia's classification of video games to include an adult R18+ classification. This does not undermine social values and it will not degenerate our cultural esteem. It will not provide easier access or exposure of children to this media; it will, however, allow informed adults to make their own choices about the media they consume.


The point is this: by creating an additional classification category, adults will have the freedom to choose to engage with computer games, which is their imperative. There is a fundamental concern when we as policymakers are playing Big Brother with the people in our communities, preventing sensible adults from making decisions about their entertainment, which has no bearing on the lives of anyone but themselves. This represents a common-sense and practical solution to a very real problem, and it is for this reason that I speak in support of this bill today.

"Irons, Steve, MP",LP,2012-03-15,"



Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (11:34):  I rise to speak on the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (R 18+ Computer Games) Bill 2012. It is always a pleasure to follow the member for Longman. I know he has careful insight into video games. I sat in awe for years watching my son, who is about the same age, play PlayStation and Xbox and all the various games that came along, and I am sure that, along with you, Mr Deputy Speaker, we do not have the skill that these young people have.


I support the expansion of Australia's video game classification system to include an R18+ category. In our rapidly growing technologically centred world, this legislation is important in ensuring consistency between games and other entertainment mediums. This bill will bring the classification categories for computer games into line with existing categories used to classify films. Currently, if the content of a computer game is considered inappropriate for an MA15+ classification, the game is refused classification and banned from sale in Australia.


This bill enjoys wide support amongst the Australian community. According to a Bond University report, 91 per cent of adults believe there should be an R18+ classification for video games. This is not necessarily because they want to access video games containing adult content but because they would like the right to choose which video games they use, in the same way that they choose which film to watch or magazine to read. According to the Bond University study, Australian game players have an average age of 30 and that number is set to rise over the coming years. With this statistic in mind, it is important to recognise that the demand for games containing adult content will rise with it.


The National Classification Scheme regulates the availability of films and computer games and is a cooperative arrangement between the Commonwealth, states and territories. The National Classification Scheme allows buyers of these products to make informed decisions about what they consume and what they allow their children to access. The Commonwealth Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995 establishes which classification should be appointed to publications, films and computer games. The Classification Board is an independent statutory board that makes classification decisions under the act. The classification act of 1995 and the Classification Code create a range of classification categories from general to parental guidance, mature, mature accompanied, restricted and refused classification. The code sets out principles for the application of these classifications. The principles are that adults should be able to read, hear and see what they want; minors should be protected from material likely to harm or disturb them; and everyone should be protected from exposure to unsolicited material that they find offensive. When making decisions, the Classification Board must take into account community concerns about depictions that condone or incite violence and the portrayal of persons in a demeaning manner.


These classification guidelines apply to both films and computer games, with the same content in either category having to meet the same description of appropriate content. Where the current act differs is in what categories of classification are available. The R18+ rating available for films and DVDs is not available for computer games. Under the current system this means that the same content produced in the form of a DVD can be legally sold in Australia, whilst that content used in a computer game would be made illegal. This is the inconsistency that the current bill before this House will address.


It is important at this point to point out that having an R18 classification added to the code for computer games will not mean that no restrictions will be placed on computer games sold in Australia. The code will still hold the RC, or refused classification, category used to make illegal the sale of games with gratuitous or exploitative depictions of sexual violence. It could also apply to games that depict violence which is judged to have a very high impact and can reasonably be assumed to offend against the standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults. This would see games containing such themes not classified and unavailable for purchase in Australia.


I strongly support the bill's principle that minors should be protected from material likely to harm them. In 2009, I successfully campaigned for a drinking board game to be banned from sale to minors. I was astonished to find that a game which claimed to be the world's best-selling adult drinking game was being advertised alongside family and children's games in a junk mail brochure. The game was available to minors but was promoting behaviour that was potentially harmful and not appropriate for people under the legal drinking age. My campaign for the drinking game to be banned from sale to minors was successful with the Australian Classification Board classifying the game as Category 1 restricted. This decision led to the game being sold in only a small number of registered shops, only in special packaging and only out of view. In his response to the campaign that I started, the Classification Board Chairman, Donald McDonald, wrote to me stating that the Classification Board is:


… mindful of current community concerns regarding alcohol consumption and refers to one of the underpinning principles of the national Classification Code, being 'minors should be protected from material that is likely to harm or disturb'.


I am happy to say today that the game is now legally restricted to adults. I have brought this example to the House's attention as it demonstrates the Classification Board as an independent statutory body in action and how effective they can be at dealing with these sorts of content issues.


The classification bill seeks to ensure that a similar process is available through adult content in computer games. I acknowledge that some critics may feel that a blanket ban on all adult content is necessary. Some have raised concerns with the R18+ classification used for DVDs also applying for computer games, because it would allow legal sale of material they consider to be offensive. I believe, however, that actions such as prohibiting the sale of certain games in Australia will have the opposite effect and bring games containing content inappropriate for minors to greater prominence. The reality is that Australia's classification system is being used as a selling point in other countries around the world. For example, computer games have been marketed in New Zealand as 'the game that was banned in Australia'. Our restrictive classification system is unintentionally promoting games containing explicit and adult material by drawing attention to them. A marketing campaign that states, 'the game that was banned in Australia' as a selling point is using our current classification system as a tool for promoting the game and its content, instead of simply ensuring minors do not have access to games inappropriate for their age group and development level.


I draw the attention of the House to the classification systems in comparable overseas jurisdictions that have an adult restricted rating for computer games in place. The list includes the United States, Canada, Japan, Germany, New Zealand, South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong. Of great concern to me is the inconsistency of classification across international borders leading to a large number of computer games that are restricted to 17-and 18-year-olds in Europe and America receiving only an MA15+ classification in Australia


The absence of an R18+ classification in Australia would appear to be making more violent games available to younger people in Australia than in other comparable countries. Many parents rely on the classification system to guide them as to what content they make available to their children. The R18+ classification sends a clear and unambiguous message to parents that the game material is unsuitable for minors. It is worrying to think that games that may receive a higher classification overseas are being subtly tweaked here in Australia so that they only just qualify for the MA15 classification. This means that minors have access to games that would otherwise be restricted to those who are 18 years old due to our lax classification procedures.


The Bond University study showed that 63 per cent of respondents to the survey of video games did not realize Australia has no R18+ classification for video games, reflecting the lack of understanding consumers have of the difference between film and video game classifications. With no R18+ classification available for video games, games featuring violence, nudity, and adult themes are instead being classified as MA15+ and are available to minors. This is inappropriate and a failure of the original legislation. Games originally intended for adults should be classified as such and not repeatedly modified to fit only just inside the criteria for MA15+. Games of this classification are readily available to minors and R18+ classification will ensure all games containing content deemed to be of an adult nature are available only to adults.


As a parent I find this concerning and the passing of this bill will ensure these games receive a classification that more appropriately reflects content and the appropriate consumers of that content. Having an R18+ category will also reduce the number of refused classification games, reserving that classification for games containing content unsuitable for sale to anyone in Australia. Currently, games which contain adult content, as well as games containing extreme content, such as sexual violence, fall under the same RC category, making it difficult for consumers to ascertain whether a game is simply unsuitable for a minor or for all consumers. The introduction of this bill will strengthen the meaning of the 'refused classification' category in the internet age we live in, where a whole range of content is able to be accessed and downloaded instantly. An RC classification under this proposed bill will signal to consumers who may consider accessing an RC classified game over the internet that the game contains extreme content deemed to be unsuitable for use by anyone, as opposed to containing material that is not suitable for a minor, as is the case under the current legislation.


A Bond University study highlights the fact that 78 per cent of parents are involved in the purchasing of games for their children and that 92 per cent are aware of the games that their children are playing. The absence of a higher restricted classification level sends confusing messages to parents, who may not realise the MA15+ games are the highest-rating games available.


As is currently the case for DVDs, the R18+ rating carries a strong warning which indicates the game content is highly inappropriate for minors and sends a clear message to parents and adult consumers alike. The current classification system is ineffective—

Mr IRONS:
  The current classification system is ineffective in restricting strong-impact video games being accessed. It encourages consumers to circumvent the domestic market and instead turn to online illegal downloads of games that are otherwise unavailable in Australia, costing our economy $100 million a year in illegal downloads. The R18+ level of classification will help prevent the illegal download of unclassified video games unable to be sold in Australia. This will be incredibly beneficial to Australian retailers, distributors and copyright owners who are missing out on revenue for a small but nevertheless significant part of the market. Australia has a growing games sector, and pragmatic and sensible legislation is important in supporting it. This bill will benefit not only consumers of video games but also those in industry, including manufacturers and retailers. The proposed legislation will enable Australia's game development sector to be better able to compete in international markets by ensuring that games containing adult material developed in Australia can be developed and sold at home first before entering overseas markets.


This legislation reflects a pragmatic approach to video game availability in Australia. It upholds the rights of adults to access adult level content while ensuring minors are not exposed to graphic strong-impact content. Adults should not be prevented from playing R18+ level computer games simply because they are unsuitable for minors. This bill strikes the right balance between allowing adults to be free to read, hear and see what they want and community concerns about protecting minors from explicit content.


Just as I was able to have the drinking board game banned from sale to minors in 2009, the same option should be available for computer games without having the contents completely banned from sale in Australia. A clear and unambiguous message about computer games' content will benefit parents, particularly those who are not familiar with computer games and are dependent on classifications as a guide. This bill is a positive step forward for our classification system and, given the strong support for an R18+ from parents, I urge the House to support its passing.

Dr JENSEN
 (Tangney) (12:03):  I rise in support of the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (R 18+ Computer Games) Bill 2012, which seeks to extend existing restraint on the purchase of video games with potentially damaging content from 15 to 18 years of age. It is not often that I rise in this place in support of greater regulation. However, R18+ classification is common-sense legislation regarding content that includes violence, coarse language, nudity, drug use and other adult themes. Games designed for adults and classified as such overseas can finally be classified in the same way in Australia.


In 2009 the Attorney-General released a discussion paper on the introduction of an R18+ classification category for computer games. Respondents to this paper included a broad range of stakeholders, including industry representatives, family groups and social commentators. Ninety-eight per cent of 54,437 submissions received in response to the discussion paper supported the introduction of the R18+ category. As a father of three, I speak with experience. I am genuinely concerned for the welfare of not just my own children but of all those in Tangney and right across our nation. Australia remains the only Western nation not to have an R18+ rating for video games and an overwhelming majority of my constituents in Tangney—and indeed Australians—wish to see this change as soon as possible. This bill allows such action.


From the outset, I note that the coalition recognises the contribution of the game development industry to the Australian economy. Australia is home to 25 major game development studios, which export over $120 million worth of products. Our computer gaming industry is expected to grow at a rate of about 10 per cent per year, with forecasts predicting that it will reach $2.5 billion annually by 2015. The significance of this industry must therefore not be understated.


Some may argue that the introduction of this restriction may cause economic harm to the game development industry. However, I remind the House that 75 per cent of gamers in Australia are aged 18 years or older and will remain unaffected by these changes. The industry sees great economic and social benefit in these amendments. Game importers have also long complained that a lack of an R18+ category in Australia has meant that a number of popular games have either been banned from sale or modified to meet an MA15+ rating, an obvious restriction of trade.


More than 88 per cent of Australian households own some of computer game console. There is no doubt that computer gaming entertainment forms a significant part of Australia's pastimes. I do not question the legitimacy of computer games as enjoyable sources of entertainment. Nor do I question the right of adults to choose what sort of content they do or do not wish to view. I do, however, wish to ensure the wellbeing of younger Australians, particularly in the highly impressionable age bracket of 15 to 18. The current highest classification of MA15+ does not go far enough.


As the legislation stands, games with content deemed to exceed this classification are modified to fit classification guidelines or simply refused classification—in other words, banned. Australia's lack of an R18+ rating has led to a number of mainstream releases that are readily available to adults in other countries being refused classification here. For instance, Syndicate was refused classification in December last year because of violence that was high in impact. This first person shooter is readily available to adults in other countries, including the United Kingdom, under their R18+ equivalent and 18 certificate.


Conversely, a significant number of games rated MA15+ in Australia have been rated for 17- or 18-year olds in Europe and the United States, with a mere handful edited to genuinely earn their Australian rating. Fallout 3 was initially refused classification for its realistic depictions of drug use. But after some minor edits it was made available to children in Australia while still being restricted to adult sales in many other countries. The publishers of Grand Theft Auto IV self-censored the game for the Australian market, making cosmetic edits to acts of a sexual nature with a splattering of blood thrown in for publicity purposes. With these minor edits, the game was made available for sale in Australia to children aged 15 and older while still being restricted for sale to adults overseas. House of the Dead: Overkill should probably have been refused classification due to its excessively violent content. Yet it was given approval and continues to be available to children aged 15 and over. Again, overseas rating bodies have classified the game for adults only.


In the context of film, if an R18+ classification was not in place, well-known titles such as Dirty Harry, Pulp Fiction and Fight Club would have been banned in Australia or edited into a lower classification because they were outside the MA15+ category guidelines. In this context, it is unthinkable that such films would be deemed illegal. This legislation allows this commonsense approach to film classification to be extended to other forms of electronic entertainment. I recognise that there is a place for sexual content, coarse language and perhaps violence in the realm of entertainment. This does not mean that this content in games should escape proper and diligent regulation. As a scientist by training, I have a keen interest in understanding the world about us through a prism of cause and effect. Things do not just happen. There is a consequence propelled by a prior cause. It is an established fact that children are at the peak of their developmental vulnerability in their mid-teen years. Children do not just grow up with a propensity for coarse language, drug use et cetera. While nature plays a significant role in biologically determining our behaviour, nurture plays a role in shaping and defining an individual's cognitive process. Given the influence of social conditioning on cognitive development of children aged between 15 and 17, it is important to ensure that they are afforded every advantage. Each and every one of us in this place is a reflection of our life's experiences. This is precisely what adds to the diversity and functionality of this parliament. But the younger we are, the more vulnerable we are likely to be. As we grow older we find our personalities and behaviours are shaped by the sorts of exposures that we have formed during our formative years. Just as exposure to scientific process and content makes young students more inquisitive and gives them the ability to think critically and compete in a professional world with great competence, so exposure to violence, sexual content, coarse language, drug use and other adult themes can just as easily impact development.


This bill is about choice—the opportunity to protect children between the vulnerable ages of 15 and 17 from accessing content that is clearly inappropriate for these ages. The R18+ category gives consumers, parents and retailers the right to choose in an informed manner the content with which their children engage and will prevent minors from purchasing unsuitable material. Such classification also gives us the opportunity to police these types of games more effectively. Presentation of a drivers licence or proof-of-age card at the time of purchase allows a simple and non-burdensome way of ensuring younger Australians are restricted from inappropriate content at the point of sale and hire. My coalition colleagues and I wish to extend the protections of the current legislation to ensure younger Australians to the age of 18 are not exposed to content that may be harmful or adult themes that they might find distressing or difficult to comprehend and process. Current classifications fall short on protecting minors from this harmful and disturbing content. This is why we support this bill. Games of an adult nature clearly deserve classification that fairly reflects this R18+ rating. I commend this bill to the House. It has bipartisan support towards a good and noble cause.

Mrs ANDREWS
 (McPherson) (12:21):  I rise today to speak on the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (R 18+ Computer Games) Bill 2012. The objective of the bill being debated today is to introduce an R18+ classification for computer games, allowing for adult players to purchase games that have up until now been refused classification or been modified to suit the current classification system. It will provide Australian consumers—including gamers, parents and retailers—with the information to decide which computer games are and are not suitable for minors to play. This bill is also the result of an in-principle agreement made by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General in 2011.


Currently, all films and computer games, and some publications, are examined by the Classification Board before they can be released to the public. However, the current classification system for films ranges from general, or G, up to R18+ for high level content and X18+, which usually accompanies sexually explicit content only. The principles that guide the way in which the Classification Board makes decisions about films and computer games are contained within the Classification Code 2005, which states that:


Adults should be able to read, hear and see what they want, and minors should be protected from material likely to harm or disturb them.


The measures being discussed today are intended to strike the appropriate balance between these two interests. We must have consideration, though, to the fact that we as part of a responsible community bear an obligation to ensure the welfare of our youth and their healthy development in the years to come.


Currently, the highest classification available to the video gaming industry is mature accompanied, or MA15+. This means that any viewer of the media in question who is under 15 years of age must be accompanied by a parent or guardian. Because the maximum classification has been maintained at an MA15+ level, it has meant that any computer game with adult themes exceeding what could be classified as MA15+ has been refused classification, meaning that the game in question is unable to be sold, distributed, hired, exhibited, displayed, demonstrated or advertised in Australia.


Presently, there are only a very small number of games that are refused classification. For a game to be sold in Australia when it does not meet classification requirements for an MA15+, the computer game must undergo modification to make elements of it less graphic and to fit within the MA15+ classification. However, this inadvertently means that computer games that would otherwise be reserved for adult players in other countries are playable by those computer game players that are between the ages of 15 and 17 here. This is the opposite of the original intention of such classifications, which is to protect minors from content that they should not be subject to.


Where we in Australia would either refuse classification or allow modifications to games to suit our classifications schemes, other countries have introduced adult classifications. The United States, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and European Union member nations, all have adult classification for computer games, whereas Australia is currently the only Western nation that does not carry such a classification. Video gaming is not a small phenomenon in Australia. Studies from 2008 show that 88 per cent of Australian households have some form of device for playing computer games, with 50 per cent of Australian players reporting that they play games daily or every other day. The Digital Australia 2012 report, which was produced by Bond University School of Communication and Media for the Interactive Games and Entertainment Association, revealed that the number of Australian households with a computer game device increased to 92 per cent in 2012 with 57 per cent of gamers now playing either daily or every other day. In 2008 the computer game industry saw sales rising to $1.96 billion with the sales of games software increasing from 57 per cent from the previous year, and consoles sales rising 43 per cent. 


On top of this there are 25 major game development studios in Australia which export $120 million worth of products a year. Forecasts from the PricewaterhouseCoopers report entitled Australian Entertainment and Media Outlook 2011-2015 expect that the Australian computer game industry will expand at a compound annual growth rate of 9.5 per cent per year and eventually reach $2.5 billion by 2015. Globally this number is expected to reach $90.1 billion by 2015 through a compound annual growth rate of 8.2 per cent. The industry not only hires many people in the retail sector but also provided employment for the designers and developers who create the games as well as many other professionals who are required to ensure the successful operation of a business. It is therefore obvious that the computer gaming industry is not a fringe industry but one that contributes significantly to the Australian economy. 


This was also reflected by the findings of the public consultation on the possible introduction of R18+ classification for computer games. Submissions for the public consultation were called for on 14 December 2009. By the time submissions formally closed on 28 February 2010, more than 58,000 valid submissions had been received by the Attorney-General's Department. The final report into the public consultation found that 98 per cent of those submissions were in favour of an R18+ classification for computer games, with only two per cent opposed. 


There are clearly two issues that need to be dealt with: firstly there are issues with gamers who are 18-years old and over and their right to choose what games they wish to play; and, secondly, there are issues with those who are less than 18 years old and are therefore minors and should be protected from material likely to harm or disturb them. I will now discuss the issue of choice with gamers who are over 18 years. There is a common perception that many computer game players are under the age of 18. The evidence, however, shows the contrary. In the public consultation over 72 per cent of respondents were aged between 18 to 34 years old. And just over two years on, the data from the Digital Australia 2012 report confirms this ratio, with the report finding 75 per cent of computer gamers are over the age of 18. The report also found that the average age of computer gamers is 32, which rose from 30 in 2008. 


An Australian Law Reform Commission issues papers revealed that Australian computer gamers want the ability to choose what they play. Adult Australians are currently given the ability to choose what films and television programs they wish to view. If they do not like what is on the TV or in the cinema they can simply choose not to watch it, whilst those who do want to view it are given the opportunity to do so. It should be no different for those who wish to play computer games. 


This leads me to the second issue, which is the need to protect minors from material and games that are likely to harm or disturb them. Many interest groups have come forward saying that the introduction of an R18+ rating will lead to children being able to access with greater ease computer games which are deemed inappropriate for their age. As I said before, the discrepancy between our classification system for computer games and the classification system of other countries already contributes to this, with young Australian gamers being able to access games that other children of a similar age would usually not be able to get hold of.


Under current laws, a person under the age of 15 is unable to purchase a computer game with a classification which is rated above their current age unless an adult is present. This is a similar circumstance to a minor attempting to purchase films or publications which carry a classification for above their current age. I previously mentioned that some R18+ games have been modified for Australian distribution and have since been sold under the MA15+ classification. In this circumstance, the parent has the discretion whether or not to buy the MA15+ game for the child. The parent may be under the impression that the game is appropriate for their child to play due to the labelling, but they are more than likely unaware that the game they are buying with good intentions was previously deemed to be completely inappropriate for their child. With an R18+ classification, however, there will be an added disincentive for parents to purchase games for their younger children, due to the non-discretionary nature of an R18+ classification, which clearly stipulates that the computer game is inappropriate for a person of a younger age.


I will conclude today by reiterating that I do have a concern for minors and that it is our need and our desire to provide the necessary protection from material that is likely to harm or disturb them. We do have an obligation to our youth to ensure they are protected from things that could be detrimental to their upbringing.


Debate adjourned.

"Simpkins, Luke, MP",LP,2012-03-15,"



Mr SIMPKINS
 (Cowan) (10:12):  I certainly welcome the opportunity this morning to speak on the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (R 18+ Computer Games) Bill 2012. I join with all members of the House in agreeing that this is much needed reform, and we certainly look forward to the elements of this bill taking effect so that we can have greater confidence as we carry on into the future. We would have greater confidence that the young people and, in fact, the adults of this country are properly advised and, in appropriate cases, properly protected from some of the online computer game content that abounds in the world at this point.


A common theme when I go around and speak particularly to primary school classes in the electorate of Cowan, and senior classes, is that so many young people are keen to get into this industry. When we see the figure of $2.5 billion that is likely to be generated in the economy by the computer game industry by 2015, it is not a surprise, particularly for those of us who see that there are young people so keen to get into the industry to create games. As we know, there are a fairly large number of computer game laboratories generating these games around the country. When Apple informs us that they get upwards of 20,000 applications a month for games to be registered with them, it really does show that there is certainly demand and people are willing to satisfy supply.


That being said, it is a little bit of a mystery to me why some people are interested in some of the games that are produced. There are extremely violent games and there are games produced that have sexual content, which I think many people would have objections to. It really does come as a surprise that there is demand for such games. Whilst I will speak a little bit more about the differences between MA15+, R18+ and refused classification, what I would say is that greater protection, greater knowledge and greater information is long overdue in all cases with regard to such games. 


It is the case that, when this country has had the highest classification of MA15+, there have been substantiated allegations that there are some games that have been, as has been said, shoehorned into that category. Possibly there has been a bit of a liberal interpretation of the categorisation. Some games that we might think should not ordinarily be allowed to be accessed by those 15 years and above have actually made it into that category. Others of course have been refused classification, and I think that is good. What we will have with this legislation is that, for games that I think were MA15+ but probably should have been adult 18 and above only, we will have the opportunity to push those sort of games upwards, I would imagine. Also, where some of these games have had slight modifications made to them so that those that would have had R18+ classification in others parts of the world have been dragged down into the MA15+, but again with material in them that I think a lot of people would find quite concerning, there will be the ability to look again at those games and push them into R18+ classification. That is most definitely a good thing.


With regard to the classification of restricted 18+, what we will see is the restriction of sale, hire, display, advertisement and, in overall terms, warnings to parents. I am a parent, with two girls, aged 13 and nine, who are into games—definitely not the sorts of games that might have those classifications. I suspect Moshi Monsters is probably not going to see a categorisation above G. Angry Birds may be a little more severe, but is not going to be in this sort of category. I certainly hope that we will never see anything like an MA15+ game or anything worse than that in my house. But it is the case that the ability to provide warnings to parents on computer games through this legislation is very important. The alarm bells certainly do ring when you are a parent and you see something with an R on the front of it, and there is a difference between seeing those and M category movies. When that is transposed over to computer games, if parents see R18+ on the front of games they should be rightly concerned and should certainly examine them and find out whether their children are attempting to buy such video games or they are in the possession of their children.


It does, however, still come down to vigilance by the parents of those under 18 in keeping an eye on what is going on, so they can look at and examine things and make decisions if they find their children possess those games in their house and they have a concern that needs to be dealt with. But, as we also know through the work that has taken place over recent years and has been particularly noted by a House committee recently, the vast majority of gamers are actually young adults, I would say—around the age of 32—and many of them, 47 per cent, happen to be women now. What we are dealing with here is certainly freedom of choice. It comes down to adults being able to make informed choices. If they wish to buy R18+ games, that should certainly be the case. But I would always warn and advise parents to keep an eye on those under 18 and what is in their possession or what they are attempting to buy.


This legislation brings us into line with comparable nations in the Western world. It is bizarre that we have not had a classification. In Australia we have had classifications of MA15+ or refused classification, but there has been nothing in between. That has singled us out as being different from the rest of the Western world. So it is important that we have the R18+ classification, and I certainly welcome that. That is consistent with international standards.


It is a very important step forward. I think we will see that this is legislation which is non-controversial, and that is why we see it here in the Federation Chamber. But I would say that, while there is the provision in the bill that a game cannot be reclassified within two years of its having been classified, it is important that, should people have concerns about games currently rated MA15+, they consider trying to have those games reclassified to R18+. That would be a positive step forward. Currently there are games rated MA15+ which are concerning and not appropriate for those under the age of 18. Those games should be reviewed, and this legislation will allow that to happen. At the same time the classifying authorities should not be afraid of refusing classification where the content is beyond the point of classification. There are some really bizarre levels of violence and sexual content out there that I think should still be refused classification, and most people probably agree with that.


I welcome the introduction of this bill into the House. I look forward to it being passed and the classification R18+ adding some real value in this country and providing greater certainty and help for parents and gamers across Australia.

"Georganas, Steve, MP",ALP,2012-03-15,"



Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh) (10:23):  I too rise to support that Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (R 18+ Computer Games) Bill 2012. This issue was first raised with me by many of my constituents from Adelaide's western suburbs in the seat of Hindmarsh who contacted me, largely by email, a couple of years ago. They were very frustrated with the state of affairs at that particular time. As members in this place would be well aware, films—including those publicly shown—DVDs and computer games may be classified G, PG, M or MA15+. Films can also be classified R18+ or X18+. There has been no classification for computer games beyond that of MA15+.


We had a situation where the federal government, and every state and territory in the Commonwealth—bar one—supported the introduction of an R18+ classification for computer games. Without that classification, MA15+ continued as the highest, or the most restrictive, classification of games. The effect of this has been seen to be largely twofold. Firstly, materials which had not met the MA15+ classification have been refused classification and have been unavailable for sale in Australia. Importing such material, if caught, would result in fines or at least confiscation. Piracy thrives in such environments. Secondly, those responsible for the development of these games can tweak or resubmit their games and, I understand, in at least some cases eventually have those games passed as under MA15+ classification.


The bottom line of this is that kids can end up with games classified as MA15+ that have content that should much more appropriately have been classified as R18+. Kids can access material that they, on balance, should not or that we should not want them to access. There is good reason for having a well-graded, well-tiered system that enables the niche allocation to appropriate levels of restriction and access. It facilitates finely tuned classification and finely tuned marketing. This benefits all of us. We know what a product is, we know who should not be accessing it and we can know that we most probably do not want to access it when you have good classification. But this awkward, clumsy classification regime that can shed little light on what the content actually was has been the situation endured by many for some considerable time.


There has been universal support for change for quite some time, apart from the one state. Queensland supported change; Western Australia supported change; New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania supported change; the ACT and the Northern Territory supported change; the federal government supported change. Because my own home state, South Australia, opposed the change, change was defeated. It was unilaterally vetoed. So, when contacted by many of my constituents who were very concerned by South Australia's veto of the clear and unambiguous national will, I responded with my view that the will of the minority dominating or vetoing the will of the overwhelming majority is undemocratic and wrong. It is undemocratic for the few to rule contrary to the will of the majority—to dominate the majority or to veto the majority. That was my opinion at the time, which I communicated to all those that contacted me on this particular issue. It might be surprising that this view was very welcomed by most of the people that did contact me on this issue.


I certainly welcomed South Australia's new Attorney-General's agreement with each and every other state and territory in the land and the federal government. I welcome the fact that the will of the overwhelming majority will be respected and acted upon through this bill. I also welcome the benefits that this new classification should have for the gaming community in Australia: that is the protection of younger gamers from inappropriate materials and content and the better honouring, I hope, of the copyright law that should come with this bill. But it remains a curious issue that we can have eight players being vetoed by one sole state, territory or federal government. It goes, of course, to the creation of the National Classification Scheme under the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission concerning censorship procedure in 1991, over 20 years ago now. The recommended national approach to classification makes absolute, perfect sense. This is appropriate and it is good, in my view. The Intergovernmental Agreement on Censorship which underpins the scheme confirms that certain changes to the scheme, such as amendments to the National Classification Code and classification guidelines must be considered and agreed to by censorship ministers. It must be unanimous.


The intergovernmental agreement reads in part:




B. The aim of the new scheme is to make, on a co-operative basis, Australia’s


censorship laws more uniform and simple with 
c
onsequential benefits to the public


and the industry;





C. The new scheme accurately reflects, and maintains, the balance of responsibilities


that has been arrived at between Australian jurisdictions. It also recognises that, in


relation to the Code and classification guidelines, the Commonwealth, and the


Participating States are equal partners and that policy on these matters is derived


from agreement between all jurisdictions
 …



I observe that the preceding paragraph notes that it was not an agreement of national uniformity as such, as it contains the observation that, 'Western Australia and Tasmania will not participate in the new scheme in relation to publications.' It goes on to say:


Under the Act each Participating Minister and the Commonwealth Minister are to agree:


(a) on the classification guidelines;


(b) on amendments to those guidelines; and


(c) on amendments to the Code ...


Apparently publications were out, but, in relation to games, the required uniformity of opinion, the required unanimity of determination, is without exception and has, as a consequence of the position held by one of the nine ministers, held back what almost all have long considered positive change. This has been of immense frustration to my constituents that contacted me on this particular issue. It has been imbalanced, unfair, undemocratic and most unwelcome.


There probably is not much call for changes to the actual classification structure around Australia. It is not like the system requires ongoing maintenance and adjustment on a regular basis, so one might just write off this exercise as a bad experience and forget about it, but it is of concern to me that one of the nine can uphold reform. We saw something vaguely similar with Western Australia being the sole state not to sign up for the first national health deal. At least this was able to be negotiated, put through a process of give and take and manipulated into a form that does attract the agreement of each negotiator. There was sufficient detail to actually have negotiation. In this case it has been binary—it is a straight yes or no. I will leave my discontent there and move on in support of this bill. I commend it to the House.

"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,2012-03-15,"



Mrs MOYLAN
 (Pearce) (10:31):  I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this legislation on the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (R 18+ Computer Games) Bill 2012, which seeks to introduce an R18+ category for computer games, aligning the existing classifications levels for films and other publications.


Computer games, films and publications advertised or sold in Australia are currently regulated by the classification act, which sets out a sliding scale of age limits and a corresponding allowable impact of violence and sexual themes on the material covered. The scheme is designed to be user-friendly, allowing purchasers and particularly parents to easily decide whether the material they are buying or viewing, or that their children have access to, is suitable for the maturity of the individual. The procedures and thresholds for classification falls under federal jurisdiction to ensure national consistency. However, the states and territories independently legislate as to the level of material that can be advertised and sold within their borders.


Classifications are decided with reference to the impact test as well as the overall cumulative effect. At the more restricted end, movies and publications with a strong impact are deemed MA15+, high impact is R18+ and very high is refused classification, which prevents the material from being sold or advertised in Australia. However, computer games have been an anomaly. At the restricted end, they are classified as either MA15+ or, if the themes depicted exceed the strong impact threshold, they are refused classification.


The reason for omitting the R18+ classification category appears to stem from a recommendation made in 1993 by the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Electronic Technology. I am sure that in this place we would agree that 1993 was a long time ago. I do not think any of us could have at all foreseen the kind of video games that would be available on the market today. That committee made recommendations in their submission to the Attorney-General's Department at that time. Electronic Frontiers Australia and AusGamers noted that three assumptions underpinned the select committee's recommendation which resulted in the exclusion of the R18+ category. Those were that (1) computer games are only for children; (2) the level of technology involved with the use of computer games means that many parents do not necessarily have the competency to ensure adequate parental guidance; and (3) having regard to the extrasensory intensity involved in the playing of interactive games and the implications of long-term effects on users, games should be subject to stricter criteria for classification than those applying to film or video. We certainly know that computer games have gone far beyond children's toys and playthings. Certainly, it has been a bit of a minefield for many parents who are not technology savvy. There are still plenty of people in the community, who, although they can do the basics, find it difficult to understand the complexities of new technologies. 


The first point that computer games are only for children may, as I say, have been correct at that time, but we have now gone well beyond that. The classification code's first principle that adults should be able to read, hear and see what they want was viewed at the time as not relevant and, instead, focus was ascribed to the second principle that minors should be protected from material likely to harm or disturb them. It therefore seemed incongruous to allow for games with high-impact themes, when children were the focus of the industry. But that is no longer the case. Gaming technology and capability has exponentially increased, allowing for storylines, graphics and themes which have attracted increasingly older audiences. Research by Bond University, which was published last year, entitled Digital Australia, notes that the average age of video game players in Australia today is continually increasing. In 2005, the average gamer was 25 years old and today they are 32 years old.


More tellingly, 75 per cent of all video game players in Australia are aged 18 years or older. The ability of parents to ensure adequate control and guidance has also markedly increased, with computer literacy becoming a significant aspect of everyday life. We are having to grapple with this technology because so much is now done via a computer. But a clear-cut classification system would further assist parents when making choices about what games are suitable for their children to play, with an R18+ rating providing certainty that the game is unsuitable for children. 


Public support for an R18+ category appears to be very strong. In 2009, the Attorney-General's Department received 54,437 submissions to its discussion paper on the topic, of which a compelling 98 per cent were in favour of an R18+ category. Following more recent discussion papers on the topic, however, there has been strong opposition from a minority of submissions to the Attorney-General's Department that reinforce the Senate's original cautious approach regarding the interactive nature of gaming. A key concern was whether R18+ games have an acceptable place in society, regardless of age. Particular emphasis was placed on the fact that, in all other forms of media, the consumer is passive, by viewing, listening or hearing the relevant material. However, with computer games the consumer is actively directing events. Some of the games are extremely violent and extremely graphic.


Understandably, there is a worry that what happens in the virtual world has an impact on a person's real world. We would agree that this is probably so for children in particular and that allowing more violent and graphic games could lead to adverse social consequences. 


Research into this area has been mixed. It really depends on whom you listen to. Sometimes you have to wonder who is funding the research. For adults who have violent tendencies and who play video games, it is hard to distinguish whether gaming inflamed the violent behaviour or whether that person already had a violent disposition and was drawn to violent video games. For children, though, there is a greater likelihood that exposure to violent media will have a detrimental effect. It is sometimes very difficult to pick your way through this matter, because there are many and varied views on the subject. But I think that most parents would agree that we need to address the issue of classification and give parents some guidelines as to what might or might not be suitable for their young people.


The Australian Council on Children and the Media pointed to research undertaken by a long-term video game researcher Craig Anderson, whose 2007 journal article entitled 'The effect of video game violence on physiological desensitization to real-life violence' concluded:


It is not surprising that when the game involves rehearsing aggressive and violent thoughts and actions, such deep game involvement results in antisocial effects on the player …  


That is but one of the many views.


The council went on to argue that adopting an R18+ rating system would lead to a greater proliferation of violent games and, with that, children would be more likely to be exposed to violent media through adult family members playing the game in their presence or the children receiving the game or a copy from an adult. However, there is also a strong argument that a clear rating system, which shows that the game is for adults only, helps informed choices and gives adults confidence to tell children that the game is not suitable for them.


Regardless of which view is subscribed to, ratings systems are only part of the solution to this problem. With the proliferation of visual media, and the internet playing a part in every aspect of children's lives, it is incumbent upon all of us as adults and as parents to help children understand the distinction between reality and fantasy where computers are involved. I think we see this on Facebook too. I had one young person tell me recently: 'No, this is his other personality on Facebook. There's this one and there's another one over here. Which is the real one?' So I think we have a lot of work to do to help young people distinguish between the play, the fantasy and the reality.


I certainly appreciate the concern that many have about the impact of violent media and agree that ceiling standards developed in consultation with the community are necessary. To this end it is worth noting than an R18+ category is not a generic free-for-all category without limit. Games with a very high impact in terms of language, sexual references or violence would be refused classification in any event. Creating a specific adult category also helps ensure that minors are not exposed to unsuitable material. A number of games that are classified as R18+ in the United States and other countries are legally available in Australia at the moment and classified as MA15+. To meet the current Australian classification framework, developers sometimes make relatively minor adjustments to tone down the violence within their games, but the overall impact is still similar. Under the proposed changes, rather than having slightly altered adult games available to children, only adults would have access to them legally.


Ensuring classification consistency across all types of media is also important in helping empower consumers where we are now seeing convergence across all types of media. The distinction between interactive and non-interactive entertainment is increasingly blurred. That is another issue that modern society has to grapple with. Movies inspired by books are being easily transformed into video games with highly interactive internet advertising strategies. To increase the experience of customers, entertainment titles are sold as packages, often with a DVD, computer game and links to special internet content all contained in one packet. Censors are then placed in the unique and difficult position of having to determine whether to treat the items as a game or as a film, or potentially have different, dual ratings for the title's movie and game.


The gaming experiences are also becoming more cinematic, with seamless interaction between scripted plot segments and user-controlled action. The growth in popularity of role-playing games and their increasing plot sophistication make many of them seem like a 'choose your own' adventure movie rather than a traditional game. Also, the prolific computer graphic imagery in movies can be simply copied across to a game release, meaning there is nearly no difference in visual depiction between the game and the movie itself. 


The trend towards convergence is only increasing and makes the traditional argument of a difference between interactive and non-interactive media irrelevant. Without a consistent classification framework confusion can arise, ultimately eroding the whole intention of the system, which is to empower consumers and, I suppose, to look after the interests of children.


The 2009 report by Bond University entitled Interactive Australia makes the point that the absence of an R18+ rating for computer games has potentially misled parents and consumers. By not acknowledging the full spectrum of game suitability an artificial view has been created that violence and themes portrayed in games are not as bad as what can be seen in the movie or on TV because they do not extend to R18+ ratings. Research in Interactive Australia found that four out of five parents are influenced by the Classification Board's ratings, but nearly two-thirds are unaware of them and there is currently no R18+ classification for video games. Respondents are worried with a common reply, 'If I knew that, I would not think MA15+ was for my 15-year-old.' Having an R18+ classification is a sensible response to the changing attitudes and demographics of gamers. It also strengthens the classification framework ensuring that unsuitable games are less likely to end up in the hands of children and empowers parents and consumers through increased awareness and increased knowledge. I think much work has been done to try to find a way through what is clearly a very difficult subject matter and one that causes great divisions within the community, like so many of these modern conundrums. But I think we probably have the best possible outcome and I commend the bill to the House.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2012-03-15,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley—Government Whip) (10:46):  With these things, we usually get up and say we are pleased to speak on the bill. From my perspective, I am relieved to be speaking on the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (R18+ Computer Games) Bill 2012, because it has taken 10 years to get to the point where we make a decision about the classification of video games and, as the member for Pearce indicated in her contribution, the feedback on this matter was phenomenal. There were 54,000 public submissions received on this issue alone showing a huge amount of interest in this matter. I think it shows the degree to which this is not just something that is seen as a kids' domain; this is something that has been embraced and featured in homes across the country for many years by people of different ages. As I said, for the past decade, the Commonwealth, the states and the territories have been unable until recently to agree to the reforms required for the introduction of this classification for computer games.


It is an important reform, not only for the Australian adult population who have long asked for the right to make personal decisions about their entertainment but in recognising that we have a flourishing industry that is involved in the design and development of computer games right here in Australia. The development industry is growing and has got itself a fantastic international reputation. I commend to the Federation Chamber the Working in Australia's Digital Games Industry: A Consolidation Report, which was released last year by the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Creative Industries and Innovation and the Queensland University of Technology. It was done in conjunction with the Game Developers' Association of Australia. That association described the local industry in the following terms. It said: 


Australia has a dynamic and sophisticated game development industry. With experience developing and marketing products for the largest game publishers in the world, Australia offers the best in creative talent, advanced technology and management experience.


In the report it seeks to demonstrate the breadth of the industry in the country by relying on the Australian Bureau of Statistics report, which in 2008 released the first issue of Digital Game Development Services, Australia. As at June 2007, it noted—and I imagine these figures continue to increase but they are worth noting—that 45 game development businesses operate in Australia, with three-quarters operating out of Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. Of the 1,431 workers employed in the games development industry, 695 are located in the member for Herbert's great state of Queensland, representing 48.6 per cent of all workers in the country. Artists, animators and programmers combined account for over 63 per cent of games workers and nonresidents account for 6.1 per cent of those workers. In terms of export, the figures are fantastic. Bear in mind, too, that a lot of small businesses operate in this sector—close to 50—and it is indicated that they employ up to five workers. There are 11 small- to medium-sized businesses employing six to 50 workers and large businesses operating with over 200 workers.


I sit on another committee, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Infrastructure and Communications, and, as part of our work last year we went around the country in the course of developing our report on the NBN and our report Broadening the debate talks about a lot of the creative and visual arts businesses that will now be able to collaborate with businesses overseas and, off a platform of superfast broadband, be able to shift large packets of data overseas. If you look at the industry now and at what we are doing in revitalising our technological infrastructure, you see this will open up huge sections for our local economy, particularly the one that we are referring to today in terms of games development. It will give people a head start in an industry that young people in particular want to be able to work in.


The classification issue we discuss here is enormously relevant because it opens up the scope of work that can be done by local businesses where people do not want to see their work, their time and the investment that they put into it suddenly held up because our classifications have not kept pace with the rest of the world. As I said, there is that $161 million of revenue, most of it export earnings, with the revenue from games development growing at a rate of 16 per cent annually for the five years leading to 2010-11. So this bill gives the industry the certainty that they had long hoped for and it lets them attract much-needed investment, particularly from overseas, and there is that collaboration that I referred to earlier. It will also achieve for them parity with the much larger film industry, which for many years has enjoyed investment and incentives that they can only dream of accessing. The games development industry, a relatively small player compared to their global competitors, continues to compete with developers overseas who in some cases receive industry assistance for their work. Without doubt this bill will improve their competitiveness in what is globally a $25 billion industry.


I want to pick up on some statistics as to one recent game that was released—Modern Warfare 3, developed by Activision. It had the largest on-day, or early, shipments registered in history. Some 1.5 million people queued at 13,000 stores across the UK and the US to buy this one game. In the US and the UK over 6.5 million copies of the one game were sold on one day and grossed, in the first 24 hours, $400 million, a huge amount of money. So you can see the interest that is there. I want to come back to that game later because it is absolutely relevant in the context of what we are discussing now.


The bill that has come before parliament today reflects in a sense our nation's growing up. It was not that long ago, as I indicated earlier and as the member for Pearce reflected upon in her contribution to this debate, that these games were seen as the domain of children and adolescents. As many of these young people matured so too did their taste in games and so did the games themselves. The present regime fails to take into account that computer gaming is no longer the sole domain of young people. The Interactive Games and Entertainment Association estimates 55 per cent of gamers are now over the age of 18 and the average age is now 30 years old. If you want an indication of how far things have come, look at how many members of parliament will actually speak in this debate alone. I have estimated close to 25 MPs will be devoting some part of their time to debating this very bill.


If we are going to talk about declaring interests, I actually own an Xbox 360 and for my birthday my wife bought me a Kinect, which we both use as well. All this reflects the diversity as consoles change, and you have the Wii, which has been used in nursing homes of all things to keep people who are older mobile and active. A few years ago I had the opportunity to read a really novel book by Stephen Johnson called Everything Bad is Good for You, which reflects on movements in popular culture and what those are actually doing to us as people. So the complexity, for instance, of what we watch on TV in terms of storylines—but even of video games themselves—calls on us to think and to use our motor skills and to be a lot more imaginative and innovative. He charts how changes in popular culture and changes in scores, for example, by students in schools with those IQs actually going up, and he talks about the interaction of TV, popular culture and games on those. So this is having a big impact. A 2011 report, which I referred to earlier, found that currently almost half of gamers are female and that 55 per cent of seniors, age 65 and older, play games. So in this context it is well and truly time that we permit the introduction of this R18+ classification for games. The bill will bring the classification of games into the 21st century. It will make the system much more relevant to the community and, whilst not every adult will want to access R18+ video games, it has long been the view of a large proportion of the adult population that they should have the right to decide what entertainment is appropriate for them to consume.


Under the present regime the Office of Film and Literature Classification will review a game and, if they find that game to be too violent or not fitting with community standards for a MA15+ rating, they will effectively ban it from sale in Australia by refusing classification for the game. That system has not served us well in recent times. There have been a number of well-publicised occasions on which games have received classification only to have it later withdrawn. The most notable example was in 2005, with the introduction of the game 'Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas,' which was rated in the US as MA15. However, the authorities in the US later discovered a feature which allowed users to engage in explicit sex scenes through software modification called 'Hot Coffee'. The game in the US subsequently had its rating changed to the higher R18 rating, but the lack of such a classification in Australia meant that the game was banned, despite 250,000 games having already been sold here.


There are also other examples. Going back to the modern warfare example, many people would not realise that Modern Warfare 2 has a scene in it where you take on the role of a Russian ultranationalist terrorist. You walk through an airport where you gun down people in that scene. That, frankly, is too violent and graphic for younger audiences and, if parents knew that it existed, they would be horrified. We need a classification system that takes it out of that age group and puts it into a much older age bracket. To be honest, I found that scene very confronting. Frankly, I do not know why you would need to have that in a game, because of what the member for Pearce indicated about the virtual world and reality. We definitely need a move whereby we do not see a game entirely banned but see absolutely reasonable concerns addressed through a classification system that is keeping pace with modern times.


This bill is not without its detractors. Many representations have been made opposing the introduction of an adult-only classification. Among the concerns is that games will include content currently refused classification, as I indicated earlier, that are deemed distasteful or excessively violent. While I do not doubt that some of that content may be offensive to adult members of the community they, equally, have the choice not to play these games. What has not attracted much attention is the introduction of the R18+ rating, which will give the Office of Film and Literature Classification the scope to apply that rating to games currently rated MA15+. I am sure many parents would be horrified at the level of violence contained in games that children can already access. Current guidelines allow MA15+ games to contain pretty violent, explicit and extreme content. The bill may reduce that level of violent and offensive content.


Views have been expressed that, in some places, R18+ games will eventually make their way into the hands of underage people. My view is that you cannot blame that on the classification system. The system is essentially there to guide people's choice of what to view, what to read, what to play and for parents to make choices for children. Obviously, it is the responsibility of parents to know what their children are viewing and playing, but sometimes they just do not know and will not necessarily follow what is contained in a game because they are not going to play it themselves. However, having a classification system in place allows parents the ability to make active decisions that they believe are in the best interests of their family, particularly young children. If anything, the R18+ rating will only make that job easier as most reasonably minded parents will not permit their child to play something with an R rating but may contemplate allowing them to play an MA rated game. Again, it is up to families to make that choice.


I think the level of interest in this matter has been terrific. I think it reflects a broader societal move. I think the classification, as I have said, is long overdue. It is good that it has come in and I certainly commend the bill to the House.

"Jones, Ewen, MP",LP,2012-03-15,"



Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (10:59):  I would like to echo the words of the member for Chifley. What an industry this is. I rise to speak on the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (R 18+ Computer Games) Bill 2012. I do so in the full knowledge that I know absolutely nothing about the modern computer game. I know absolutely nothing about gaming. It is completely and utterly beyond me why people even bother with it. My level of gaming was playing Asteroids down at the cafe at lunchtime putting 20c in the machine. Asteroids was my game of choice. You blew up rocks on a black and white screen. I could quite happily pass half an hour playing that.


We have an Xbox 3, a PlayStation 3, a Wii and an iTouch at home, which my son, my wife and my daughters play. They could be sitting on there watching people kill themselves—I would not know. And that is half the problem with the way that gaming is these days. I have a 10-year-old son. He is forever gaming. He loves them. The best thing about it as a parent is that it keeps them quiet; they are out of the road. That is one of the dangers with gaming. I know of families with children who are not even teenagers yet who are playing Grand Theft Auto. Because they are in their room by themselves and they are quiet, that is okay. That will play out in other ways down the track.


Getting back to this bill, this will allow games that are deemed inappropriate for children to be sold in Australia with the new category 'restricted to adults'. As the member for Chifley said, when I was first approached about and made aware of this bill I thought that it was about kids. But gaming is not about children anymore. Our lives have changed. We have become more sedentary. We have become more stay-at-home. These games are a way of enjoying time at home. It is a personal choice. As the member for Chifley said, most of these gamers are over 18. The average age of gamers is now 30. There are some great benefits there.


This bill will align the computer game classification system with the more commonly understood film and television classification systems. Far from allowing more violent and inappropriate computer games into the country, this bill will ensure that kids are not able to buy and play video games that they should not be playing. It will also allow people who are over 18 to get games that are currently banned in Australia. At the moment, the highest classification is MA15+. This means that some of the extremely violent and explicit games are not allowed into the country, while many more that should be restricted to just adults are allowed in and sold to people who are under 18 because their current restriction is just MA15+. Experience shows us that very few games made for adults are restricted from being sold in Australia, meaning that most are given the MA15+ rating. Far from being a system that prevents minors from playing inappropriate games, it is enabling them to do just that.


I know kids who are playing Grand Theft Auto and those sorts of games. That will play into how children behave at school and those sorts of things. I was talking to a principal at one of my local schools. People want to send their kids to his school because there they will be disciplined. He said, though, that if parents are not doing it at home they cannot expect it to be done there. We are seeing a shift in the way that parents parent. When I was a child, the last thing that you would do if you got in trouble at school was to tell your parents, because automatically your parents' default position would be to side with the teacher. Now we are seeing more and more that the parent is siding with the child and chastising the teacher in front of the child, thus reinforcing the child's position. These parents have disengaged by letting these kids watch these sorts of games and then the kids come to school and play that out through their language or actions. And then the parents reinforce that attitude by chastising the teacher. And then we wonder why 22 per cent of all teachers leave the industry after only three years. There are things at play here that we have to be very careful about.


Aligning the video game classification with that of movies will also help parents to stop their kids playing games that are not appropriate. Most people are familiar with the movie classification system, as movies are much more mainstream than video games, particularly for parents. Many parents do not realise that MA15+ is the highest classification that we have for video games and that therefore games with that rating may not be appropriate for teenagers. This bill corrects that problem. That is a positive thing. As the member for Chifley said, the number of members who are speaking on this bill is a testament to how serious this is and what an industry this has become. Finally, this bill is about fairness. As I said before, video games are not the domain of kids and teenagers. Seventy per cent of computer gamers are actually over the age of 25. Nobody wants to see violent and explicit games in the hands of kids, but gamers who are over the age of 18 have every right to play these games if they choose to. Given that such a majority of the gaming community are adults, it is only right that we allow them to buy these games in this country. 


I hate to keep going back to when I was child but, when I was a child, my grandmother would take us to the movies. We would see Pinocchio or The Love Bug or those sorts of things, which were strictly G rated and strictly for kids. Even now, the G rated films are different. We saw Snow White, the cartoon. There is nothing in there. There is no subtext or anything like that. But if you go and watch any Pixar picture now, because it is such a big industry, because the graphics are there, because so many parents are going with their kids, there is so much more in there for the parent. There are jokes. If you watch any of the Pixar movies, or the latest kids' films, you will find the parents laughing at one stage and the kids laughing at another. There are so many little things in there for popular culture.


As a parent, I have been concerned about violent and graphic content that has become common and accepted in video games. There are far too many games, despite their content, which are easily accessible to young teenagers. The absence of an 'adults only' category has clearly not helped us restrict this access to inappropriate games. The introduction of the 18+ category is a common-sense measure to help us properly address this issue. That is the message that video gamers in my electorate have been telling me. We are one of the last countries to get on board with this measure and it is time that we did. 


The North Queensland Cowboys spend so much time training. Their day is structured around training. They get to go home. Every one of them is a gamer. Every one of them has an Xbox 3, a PlayStation 4, an Xbox 360  et cetera. These guys all game. They are all adults, all grown up and none of them go out and kill people. So we have to make sure that we protect these sorts of things.


I was contacted by Gavin Dwyer about the concern that the gaming community in Townsville has about this issue. They want to make sure that the legislation is passed. They have been fighting for this for years. I want to ensure that it finally gets through. He reiterated to me that video gamers are not just kids. That seems to have been the consistent theme through this whole debate. There are far more adults and there are no reasons that they should not be able to decide for themselves what is and what is not appropriate to play. I also spoke to Rob from Gametraders in Townsville about this bill and about the impact, from his perspective, that it would have on the gaming retailers. This is only allowing stores to give gamers what they want, which can only be good for business. As he pointed out, in a difficult retail environment this gives them the freedom of choice to provide a product that adult gamers want to buy and that, as adults, they should be able to. As the member for Cowan said this morning in his contribution to the debate, Apple is receiving applications for over 20,000 games a month to be registered on their network—that is, 20,000 games a month across the world. We are talking about a major industry here. Mr Dwyer said, 'People like me have been left behind by it, but there is no reason why everyone else should have to pay for it.'  He also said that no game shop wants to see generally bad and inappropriate games go through, but most of the customers in his shops are adults and want to be given access to the games, regardless of whether they think children should be able to play them. This bill simply allows for that. 


I would like to touch a little on the difference between an adult and a child when we look at things such as movies or games, at the actual violence and the stylisation of violence that goes on here. I love Quentin Tarantino films and the stylised violence of Reservoir Dogs. I just love that film, irrespective of whether the guy ends up getting his ear cut off. It is a very nasty piece of film but, because the whole thing is set in this quasi comedy, in this quasi surrealness, you know that it is not real. I also watched Once Were Warriors, the New Zealand film. There is a scene where he belts his wife. I found that the most disturbing bit of film I have ever seen in my life. It really upset me—the towelling he gave his wife was just so real. He sent her away and then in the morning she comes out with her face so puffed up and bad and he says, 'Geez, go and clean yourself up, woman,' and just walked out of the room. Those are the sorts of things where I, as an adult, can make the differentiation. But when it comes to games, I think we have to understand that people see things differently—what we see as stylised violence someone else may see as an absolute graphic display of violence and destruction that is going to feed into people and we are going to have mass murderers walking around the place. It does not happen because people can make that difference and correlation.


Take shows like The Simpsons. My son loves The Simpsons. He does not get half of The Simpsons; he does not get what they are about. All he sees is colour and movement. I love The Simpsons because there is so much popular culture in there, and so many references to the movies I have seen. Every night it is a quiz to go in and watch The Simpsons so that you can see where the links are, what they are trying to say, what that subtext is. Those are the sorts of things that I think gamers are very much aware of.


When it comes to this bill, it is about time we started treating people like adults. If it is an R18+ they should be able to make that decision for themselves. It is not so much trying to buy condoms at the pharmacy when you are 15—someone may have told me about that once upon a time. It is about making a conscious decision about the way you want to play your life. But for the kids who are playing these games instead of other things I just say this: instead of playing a game can we just go outside and kick a ball? When you are going in a car can you just look out the window? I am always reminded of the story told by Billy Connolly—Billy Connolly's World Tour of Scotland. He and Pamela had the kids with them. On their last night they stayed in this castle in Edinburgh and they built a great big dragon's nest and they had a bonfire and the sparks were flying up into the night—only Billy Connolly can tell the story. The next day when they were going back to the United States he sat the kids down—they had been all over Scotland for 16 weeks and done and seen amazing things—and asked them what was the best part of the trip. The kids got into a huddle and then came back and said, 'Sesame Street'. They had the DVDs of Sesame Street in the Tarago as they were driving around and that was the best part of it. He said he felt like he had just wasted 16 weeks of his life trying to educate his kids. I was driving to Ayr recently and for only the second time since I have been in Townsville I saw a brolga, Townsville's emblem. It is a beautiful flighted bird; it is the largest flighted bird in Australia. I looked out the window and said, 'Look, kids—a brolga.' They were all just sitting there gaming away. Anything could have happened. So, look out the window, go and kick a ball, go and throw something, go and play with someone, go for a swim, do something with your lives other than just gaming. I recommend the bill to the House.

"Gash, Joanna, MP",LP,2012-03-15,"



Mrs GASH
 (Gilmore) (11:13):  The extent to which video games influence the development of young minds is open to debate. Indeed, it is a complex issue. Young minds are influenced by a large variety of factors. Most cope very well and grow up well adjusted—some do not. Some are easily influenced by external stimuli, while most can and do make rational and responsible decisions despite potentially adverse influences. Some reach levels of maturity earlier than others while some never arrive. These are the realities of life. The key is how the family unit is supervised and how responsibilities are distributed.


The Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (R 18+ Computer Games) Bill 2012 to introduce an R18+ category for video games simply provides another tool to assist responsible parents. I say 'responsible' because the only people who can enforce this classification are the parents. Based on previous experience it is unrealistic to expect that this can be enforced in any meaningful way by governments. We went through the issue of alcopops. The government imposed a heavy tax premium on premixed alcoholic drinks. The result was that we just shifted the problem. The same can be said about selling tobacco to minors. It has been written into law forever yet you walk down the street and you see groups of 14-year-olds puffing away without a care in the world. No one challenges them. It has become an accepted fact of life. Every now and then you hear about a prosecution for illegal sales to a minor, but in the main it is safe to say it has very little impact. Sadly, some parents even condone the behaviour by allowing children almost free will. The fact remains that despite the millions of dollars sunk into protecting and barricading minors from smoking many just do and society is accepting the fact.


Video games are in the same mould. I think by attaching a prescriptive restriction to a product you only make it more tempting. We already have the MA15+ classification applied and that means games are restricted to those over 15. If you are under 15 you cannot legally access the material or play the game without being accompanied by a legal guardian. Does that stop the proliferation of these games? Has the classification protected sensitive young minds? I think not because the ones more likely to be attracted are those whose curiosity has been whetted—the very type of mind the classification seeks to protect.


For what it is worth I found this on Wikipedia. The Entertainment Software Association states that 20 per cent of video game players are boys under the age of 17 and 26 per cent are over 50 regardless of gender so that the average game player is 37. This has been ascribed to a 2009 fact sheet published by the Entertainment Software Association in America. I went to their website and there it was. In a survey of 1,102 teenagers aged 12 to 17, 97 per cent of them said they play video games. Moreover half the survey respondents said they had played a video game in the last day. Three-quarters of parents who were surveyed said that they checked the ratings on their children's games. However, half the boys who were asked about their favourite game listed a game with an M or AO rating as their favourite content and just 14 per cent of girls. It is the temptation of the forbidden which is the drawcard and the adults only rating helps to act as the pointer.


The entry goes on to say that the adult demographic is the fastest growing segment of the American video games market. Thirty-two per cent of adults are playing video games, although critics have suggested that such statistics are often used to deflect from the fact that almost all American children are exposed to video games. That is the American experience and, given our love affair with American culture, I would say that statistics in Australia are not too wide off the same mark.


The point I am trying to make is that, at the end of the day, with the way things are it is not going to matter very much whether an R18+ rating is applied or not. The only benefit I see in this bill is that it introduces a uniform classification to that applied to film and television and as a result it is easier to understand. At least in standardising the approach it may help to minimise confusion. To an extent, this classification debate is largely academic. What is pertinent are two questions: will this tool be used and how will it be used? I do not have that answer but when I was reading up on the subject I came across a little article on a games blog site written by Mark Serrels. The website is kotaku.com.au. Published in October last year the article talks about the classification review and the panel chair, Professor Terry Flew. It is important to understand what his views are. The article says:


'One of the things we were aware of from the outset taking on the inquiry,'


says Professor Flew—


'was that there was considerable dissatisfaction with the R18 classification issue—that this issue had been on the agenda for over a decade and, as you may well be aware, gamers were a very important group in making submissions to this enquiry. So we're certainly aware of the importance of the issue.'


According to Professor Flew:


R18+ was an issue that really exemplified and exposed the difficulties of using 20 year old legislation to navigate a post-internet age.


In other words, the person who will be administering the new arrangement believes it is already redundant. The article goes on:


'Games have an interesting status in terms of the Classification Scheme in two respects,' … 'Firstly, the assumption that computer games were considered to be more akin to films and broadcasting proved to be historically significant—you have to remember that decisions were being made in what was largely a pre-internet era.


'Secondly there was a range of what some sociologists and others call 'moral panics', particularly with regards to the interactive nature of games. There was the idea that games impacted on individual behaviour,' …


'This was all, in a sense, amateur psychology—before anyone was playing the kind of games with which we would eventually become familiar. But there was a sort pre-emptive set of assumptions made about the impact of interactivity that continued to resonate through the decisions being made about video game classification.'


This bill is less to do with any real attempt at addressing the real issues than about being seen to be doing something—anything. From where I stand right now I can safely say that this bill may not help much but it will not hurt much either. Is this regulation made for the pure sake of it and nothing else, or will it achieve something?


The essence of what Professor Flew is saying about this type of legislation is that it should be able to meet the demands of an ever-fluid environment. What may have seemed appropriate 10 years ago is anachronism today. Earlier, I mentioned adolescents smoking and drinking. It is safe to say that the best outcome of legislation prohibiting the sale of tobacco and alcohol to minors is that it helped to contain the incidence of early experimentation.


Both tobacco and alcohol are addictive substances to those who are vulnerable to addiction and have addictive traits. The same can be said about almost anything in society. I well remember the parental debates in the 1950s and 1960s about the addictive nature of television. Most of us survived. The legitimisation of the pornography industry in the 1970s and the 1980s was a similar phenomenon. Did we survive that? It seems that we did, except perhaps for a very small slice of the population who are prone to addiction.


There is no doubt that upwards of 80 per cent of the population supports the introduction of an R18+ category, so the bill is a no-brainer. We live in an age in which our children are more computer savvy than we are. The computer age has delivered a rapid expansion of knowledge and access at a speed that is generally beyond the comprehension of many adults and beyond their ability to adapt to. And it cannot be contained. Yet it forms a significant part of everyday life. We cannot escape it. That is where the youth of today have it over us. I would ask any parent this question: do you really know what your children are getting up to? And, if you do not, do you trust them to do the right thing by you?


We recognise the contribution of the game development industry to the Australian economy and also note that more than 88 per cent of Australian households own a device for playing computer games. The Australian gaming industry is forecast to grow at a rate of about 10 per cent a year, with forecasts predicting that it will reach $2.5 billion annually by 2015. Australia has 25 major game development studios which export over $120 million worth of products a year. Australia is the only Western country that does not have an R18+ classification for games. The UK, EU member countries, the United States and New Zealand all have adult classifications for computer games. In the interests of conformity on the world stage, adopting a universally recognised system of measurement would be beneficial.


This bill is really about self-regulating censorship of video games. There is no doubt that it is intended for parents. As much as we approach this with the best of intentions, we cannot guarantee that those who need it most will use it. The irony is that responsible and well-intentioned adults already monitor the activities of their children. There are many children out there who are already accessing MA15+ games, some with the blessing of their parents. Others are exploiting the ignorance or apathy of their parents. It is specifically that style of parenting that should be targeted. But will this legislation achieve that?


As I said earlier, is there any point to this legislation but housekeeping? I do not oppose the bill. My concern is the proliferation of these games and their ability to desensitise some children to violence and sexuality. What needs to be emphasised is that this R18+ classification is primarily for parental control purposes. In recognising these games, we do not want to keep the impression that they are somehow government approved. This legislation alone will not compel parents towards more responsible parenting. Parents who have a cavalier attitude towards their children viewing inappropriate material have to be engaged in some other way. Perhaps, by focusing on regulating the industry, we may be distracting ourselves from the main agenda. Perhaps that is why there is a growing move to willingly shift personal responsibility away from the individual and onto the government. Parents still have an obligation to decide what is okay for their children. The role of government is surely to help parents in that process but not to take it over.


In conclusion, who should be the censor? Should it be the government or should it be the parent? I would like to recognise and acknowledge Jessica Cowan from Kiama, who is here on work experience and who has had input into this speech.

"Roy, Wyatt, MP",LP,2012-03-15,"



WYATT ROY
 (Longman) (11:24):  Once again I find myself rising to speak on matters of freedom of choice and individual responsibility. This morning I rise to speak to the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (R18+ Computer Games) Bill. This bill comes on the back of 12 months of public consultation, with 98 per cent support for its main measure, which is to introduce an R18+ category for computer games. The introduction of an R18+ category for computer games is an important step in the advancement of the computer game industry, as well as for the media industry generally. This measure will bring Australia into line with many other countries around the world that have a classification process for computer games and will create consistency across Australian classification for other film classification categories. Currently in Australia, the highest legal classification available for computer games is MA15+. Computer games that are deemed to have content beyond the scope of the MA15+ level are currently not classified and instead are deemed to be refused classification in Australia. This scenario has wide reaching impacts on the gaming community and on society more broadly. These impacts present a compelling and valid argument to create an additional category for computer games, that of R18+.


The real issue at play here is not the video games themselves; there is a more basic ideological belief that compels this argument. We on this side of the chamber believe in individual rights, liberties and freedom. We believe that the lives of adults need not be governed by Big Brother but that individuals deserve to have the opportunity to make decisions about the way they live their own lives. Certainly, in terms of entertainment, we believe that, so long as a particular behaviour or activity does not adversely impact on others, an individual should be able to have every choice about what entertainment media they want to consume. The inclusion of this additional classification of the R18+ category will restore liberty to adults, giving them choice to legally consume gaming entertainment. The video games that adults choose to engage with should be their decision alone, not the decision of a government. This is exactly what this bill seeks to address. Not only should it be an individual's freedom and responsibility to determine their own entertainment; it should also be a choice to access the same standard of content across different mediums. In Australia at the moment there is a strange circumstance where the medium is determining the maturity of the content allowable to consumers. But why should we determine that R18+ content, which at the same level of classification across other categories is allowable, is instead disallowed simply for a different medium, namely video games?


This is a flawed system with no logical grounding. There is no reason that content at the maturity level of R18+, regardless of the medium in which it is located, should be treated similarly. Again, for a country that prides itself on fairness and equality, this is an interesting contradiction. Beyond the scope of personal freedom, our current system of classification is leaving us open to more sinister loopholes, which have been exploited to the detriment of both the gaming industry and society in general. Presently in Australia, gaming content is being down rated simply to move around the lack of an R18+ category, in order to minimise the number of video games that are being refused classification. Content has been modified to manipulate the existing classification system, which is in fact posing more of a risk to young people than extending the classification system would do. Fallout 3, Grand Theft Auto IV and House of the Dead are all examples of the down rating of games to prevent causes for refused classification. In the cases of Fallout 3 and Grand Theft Auto IV, the games have undergone minor cosmetic surgery to manipulate our flawed classification system to result in an MA15+ classification. More concerning still, was that the House of the Dead, which has been classified for adults only around the world, has been classified as MA15+ in Australia, with no changes whatsoever to its content. Fallout 3, even with minor changes, was refused classification in Britain, across Europe and in New Zealand. Similarly, Grand Theft Auto IV has been restricted to R18+ in other countries, while being available to anyone over 15 in Australia, after some small changes. Clearly there are major disparities between classifications in Australia and elsewhere that demonstrate that our existing classification system is not working. These disparities indicate that Australia needs to lift its game and make changes to its classification system to ensure that it is effective. The best way to do this is to add the category of R18+.


I fear that attempts to hijack this debate are being made by some in the public sphere who are trying to make this a debate about the safety of young people and their exposure to content that is deemed unsatisfactory for their years. Safety is always an issue; protecting our young people is always important. But the argument that expanding the classification system will expose our young people to inappropriate content is fallible and untrue. By regulating classifications more through the creation of an additional level of classification, it is less, not more, likely that young people will be exposed to content beyond their maturity.


Unfortunately it is the human condition to break rules, to push boundaries and to obtain the impermissible. Across many different countries for many different goods and services, in our history we have seen evidence that banning products usually results in an underground illegal market. Such markets thrive on the illegality of a product and exist generally below the radar of law enforcement. I do not condone this behaviour but merely note its existence. In the case of what we have here to debate today, we have observed that part of the problem with our current situation is that individuals are still sourcing these games illegally and without any regulation. The indiscriminate nature of this illegal market for games means that there is absolutely no parameter for who is able to access them. Savvy teenagers are getting their hands on content that is undeniably beyond their maturity. This is a problem, one that should be presented with a solution.


An effective solution is simple: classify this content so that there is no illegal demand and instead the oxygen is sucked out of the illegal market for these games. By classifying content as R18 rather than refusing classification, it is more difficult, not less difficult, for young people to be exposed to content beyond their years.


The introduction of the new media technologies has always caused moral panics in our society. There are many examples to choose from, but let me just choose a few. When the Gutenberg printing press was first developed, social panic surrounded the initial mass printing of Bibles. What would happen to society if the Catholic Church were to lose absolute control of the biblical message? After a few years when Bibles became more commonplace, the fear and anxiety around mass access to the Bible and the hype about the potential degradation of society as a result was soothed. More recently, the increasing prevalence of televisions in the lounge rooms of families around the world inflamed a moral panic when it was assumed that the institution of the family would come to a grinding halt and fade from society, as it was presumed that the television would become the all-absorbing central aspect of people's lives, deadening their cognitive function and destroying an individual's capacity and desire to interact with others.


The truth is that moral panics have surrounded the introduction and rise of most new media technologies and video gaming is no exception. The current discussion about video games has been framed with a very negative light. The fear of this new technology and its integration into society has seen emotions inflamed. But there is no reason for fear to prevent a logical, common-sense decision to expand Australia's classification of video games to include an adult R18+ classification. This does not undermine social values and it will not degenerate our cultural esteem. It will not provide easier access or exposure of children to this media; it will, however, allow informed adults to make their own choices about the media they consume.


The point is this: by creating an additional classification category, adults will have the freedom to choose to engage with computer games, which is their imperative. There is a fundamental concern when we as policymakers are playing Big Brother with the people in our communities, preventing sensible adults from making decisions about their entertainment, which has no bearing on the lives of anyone but themselves. This represents a common-sense and practical solution to a very real problem, and it is for this reason that I speak in support of this bill today.

"Irons, Steve, MP",LP,2012-03-15,"



Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (11:34):  I rise to speak on the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (R 18+ Computer Games) Bill 2012. It is always a pleasure to follow the member for Longman. I know he has careful insight into video games. I sat in awe for years watching my son, who is about the same age, play PlayStation and Xbox and all the various games that came along, and I am sure that, along with you, Mr Deputy Speaker, we do not have the skill that these young people have.


I support the expansion of Australia's video game classification system to include an R18+ category. In our rapidly growing technologically centred world, this legislation is important in ensuring consistency between games and other entertainment mediums. This bill will bring the classification categories for computer games into line with existing categories used to classify films. Currently, if the content of a computer game is considered inappropriate for an MA15+ classification, the game is refused classification and banned from sale in Australia.


This bill enjoys wide support amongst the Australian community. According to a Bond University report, 91 per cent of adults believe there should be an R18+ classification for video games. This is not necessarily because they want to access video games containing adult content but because they would like the right to choose which video games they use, in the same way that they choose which film to watch or magazine to read. According to the Bond University study, Australian game players have an average age of 30 and that number is set to rise over the coming years. With this statistic in mind, it is important to recognise that the demand for games containing adult content will rise with it.


The National Classification Scheme regulates the availability of films and computer games and is a cooperative arrangement between the Commonwealth, states and territories. The National Classification Scheme allows buyers of these products to make informed decisions about what they consume and what they allow their children to access. The Commonwealth Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995 establishes which classification should be appointed to publications, films and computer games. The Classification Board is an independent statutory board that makes classification decisions under the act. The classification act of 1995 and the Classification Code create a range of classification categories from general to parental guidance, mature, mature accompanied, restricted and refused classification. The code sets out principles for the application of these classifications. The principles are that adults should be able to read, hear and see what they want; minors should be protected from material likely to harm or disturb them; and everyone should be protected from exposure to unsolicited material that they find offensive. When making decisions, the Classification Board must take into account community concerns about depictions that condone or incite violence and the portrayal of persons in a demeaning manner.


These classification guidelines apply to both films and computer games, with the same content in either category having to meet the same description of appropriate content. Where the current act differs is in what categories of classification are available. The R18+ rating available for films and DVDs is not available for computer games. Under the current system this means that the same content produced in the form of a DVD can be legally sold in Australia, whilst that content used in a computer game would be made illegal. This is the inconsistency that the current bill before this House will address.


It is important at this point to point out that having an R18 classification added to the code for computer games will not mean that no restrictions will be placed on computer games sold in Australia. The code will still hold the RC, or refused classification, category used to make illegal the sale of games with gratuitous or exploitative depictions of sexual violence. It could also apply to games that depict violence which is judged to have a very high impact and can reasonably be assumed to offend against the standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults. This would see games containing such themes not classified and unavailable for purchase in Australia.


I strongly support the bill's principle that minors should be protected from material likely to harm them. In 2009, I successfully campaigned for a drinking board game to be banned from sale to minors. I was astonished to find that a game which claimed to be the world's best-selling adult drinking game was being advertised alongside family and children's games in a junk mail brochure. The game was available to minors but was promoting behaviour that was potentially harmful and not appropriate for people under the legal drinking age. My campaign for the drinking game to be banned from sale to minors was successful with the Australian Classification Board classifying the game as Category 1 restricted. This decision led to the game being sold in only a small number of registered shops, only in special packaging and only out of view. In his response to the campaign that I started, the Classification Board Chairman, Donald McDonald, wrote to me stating that the Classification Board is:


… mindful of current community concerns regarding alcohol consumption and refers to one of the underpinning principles of the national Classification Code, being 'minors should be protected from material that is likely to harm or disturb'.


I am happy to say today that the game is now legally restricted to adults. I have brought this example to the House's attention as it demonstrates the Classification Board as an independent statutory body in action and how effective they can be at dealing with these sorts of content issues.


The classification bill seeks to ensure that a similar process is available through adult content in computer games. I acknowledge that some critics may feel that a blanket ban on all adult content is necessary. Some have raised concerns with the R18+ classification used for DVDs also applying for computer games, because it would allow legal sale of material they consider to be offensive. I believe, however, that actions such as prohibiting the sale of certain games in Australia will have the opposite effect and bring games containing content inappropriate for minors to greater prominence. The reality is that Australia's classification system is being used as a selling point in other countries around the world. For example, computer games have been marketed in New Zealand as 'the game that was banned in Australia'. Our restrictive classification system is unintentionally promoting games containing explicit and adult material by drawing attention to them. A marketing campaign that states, 'the game that was banned in Australia' as a selling point is using our current classification system as a tool for promoting the game and its content, instead of simply ensuring minors do not have access to games inappropriate for their age group and development level.


I draw the attention of the House to the classification systems in comparable overseas jurisdictions that have an adult restricted rating for computer games in place. The list includes the United States, Canada, Japan, Germany, New Zealand, South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong. Of great concern to me is the inconsistency of classification across international borders leading to a large number of computer games that are restricted to 17-and 18-year-olds in Europe and America receiving only an MA15+ classification in Australia


The absence of an R18+ classification in Australia would appear to be making more violent games available to younger people in Australia than in other comparable countries. Many parents rely on the classification system to guide them as to what content they make available to their children. The R18+ classification sends a clear and unambiguous message to parents that the game material is unsuitable for minors. It is worrying to think that games that may receive a higher classification overseas are being subtly tweaked here in Australia so that they only just qualify for the MA15 classification. This means that minors have access to games that would otherwise be restricted to those who are 18 years old due to our lax classification procedures.


The Bond University study showed that 63 per cent of respondents to the survey of video games did not realize Australia has no R18+ classification for video games, reflecting the lack of understanding consumers have of the difference between film and video game classifications. With no R18+ classification available for video games, games featuring violence, nudity, and adult themes are instead being classified as MA15+ and are available to minors. This is inappropriate and a failure of the original legislation. Games originally intended for adults should be classified as such and not repeatedly modified to fit only just inside the criteria for MA15+. Games of this classification are readily available to minors and R18+ classification will ensure all games containing content deemed to be of an adult nature are available only to adults.


As a parent I find this concerning and the passing of this bill will ensure these games receive a classification that more appropriately reflects content and the appropriate consumers of that content. Having an R18+ category will also reduce the number of refused classification games, reserving that classification for games containing content unsuitable for sale to anyone in Australia. Currently, games which contain adult content, as well as games containing extreme content, such as sexual violence, fall under the same RC category, making it difficult for consumers to ascertain whether a game is simply unsuitable for a minor or for all consumers. The introduction of this bill will strengthen the meaning of the 'refused classification' category in the internet age we live in, where a whole range of content is able to be accessed and downloaded instantly. An RC classification under this proposed bill will signal to consumers who may consider accessing an RC classified game over the internet that the game contains extreme content deemed to be unsuitable for use by anyone, as opposed to containing material that is not suitable for a minor, as is the case under the current legislation.


A Bond University study highlights the fact that 78 per cent of parents are involved in the purchasing of games for their children and that 92 per cent are aware of the games that their children are playing. The absence of a higher restricted classification level sends confusing messages to parents, who may not realise the MA15+ games are the highest-rating games available.


As is currently the case for DVDs, the R18+ rating carries a strong warning which indicates the game content is highly inappropriate for minors and sends a clear message to parents and adult consumers alike. The current classification system is ineffective—

Mr IRONS:
  The current classification system is ineffective in restricting strong-impact video games being accessed. It encourages consumers to circumvent the domestic market and instead turn to online illegal downloads of games that are otherwise unavailable in Australia, costing our economy $100 million a year in illegal downloads. The R18+ level of classification will help prevent the illegal download of unclassified video games unable to be sold in Australia. This will be incredibly beneficial to Australian retailers, distributors and copyright owners who are missing out on revenue for a small but nevertheless significant part of the market. Australia has a growing games sector, and pragmatic and sensible legislation is important in supporting it. This bill will benefit not only consumers of video games but also those in industry, including manufacturers and retailers. The proposed legislation will enable Australia's game development sector to be better able to compete in international markets by ensuring that games containing adult material developed in Australia can be developed and sold at home first before entering overseas markets.


This legislation reflects a pragmatic approach to video game availability in Australia. It upholds the rights of adults to access adult level content while ensuring minors are not exposed to graphic strong-impact content. Adults should not be prevented from playing R18+ level computer games simply because they are unsuitable for minors. This bill strikes the right balance between allowing adults to be free to read, hear and see what they want and community concerns about protecting minors from explicit content.


Just as I was able to have the drinking board game banned from sale to minors in 2009, the same option should be available for computer games without having the contents completely banned from sale in Australia. A clear and unambiguous message about computer games' content will benefit parents, particularly those who are not familiar with computer games and are dependent on classifications as a guide. This bill is a positive step forward for our classification system and, given the strong support for an R18+ from parents, I urge the House to support its passing.

"Jensen, Dennis, MP",LP,2012-03-15,"



Dr JENSEN
 (Tangney) (12:03):  I rise in support of the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (R 18+ Computer Games) Bill 2012, which seeks to extend existing restraint on the purchase of video games with potentially damaging content from 15 to 18 years of age. It is not often that I rise in this place in support of greater regulation. However, R18+ classification is common-sense legislation regarding content that includes violence, coarse language, nudity, drug use and other adult themes. Games designed for adults and classified as such overseas can finally be classified in the same way in Australia.


In 2009 the Attorney-General released a discussion paper on the introduction of an R18+ classification category for computer games. Respondents to this paper included a broad range of stakeholders, including industry representatives, family groups and social commentators. Ninety-eight per cent of 54,437 submissions received in response to the discussion paper supported the introduction of the R18+ category. As a father of three, I speak with experience. I am genuinely concerned for the welfare of not just my own children but of all those in Tangney and right across our nation. Australia remains the only Western nation not to have an R18+ rating for video games and an overwhelming majority of my constituents in Tangney—and indeed Australians—wish to see this change as soon as possible. This bill allows such action.


From the outset, I note that the coalition recognises the contribution of the game development industry to the Australian economy. Australia is home to 25 major game development studios, which export over $120 million worth of products. Our computer gaming industry is expected to grow at a rate of about 10 per cent per year, with forecasts predicting that it will reach $2.5 billion annually by 2015. The significance of this industry must therefore not be understated.


Some may argue that the introduction of this restriction may cause economic harm to the game development industry. However, I remind the House that 75 per cent of gamers in Australia are aged 18 years or older and will remain unaffected by these changes. The industry sees great economic and social benefit in these amendments. Game importers have also long complained that a lack of an R18+ category in Australia has meant that a number of popular games have either been banned from sale or modified to meet an MA15+ rating, an obvious restriction of trade.


More than 88 per cent of Australian households own some of computer game console. There is no doubt that computer gaming entertainment forms a significant part of Australia's pastimes. I do not question the legitimacy of computer games as enjoyable sources of entertainment. Nor do I question the right of adults to choose what sort of content they do or do not wish to view. I do, however, wish to ensure the wellbeing of younger Australians, particularly in the highly impressionable age bracket of 15 to 18. The current highest classification of MA15+ does not go far enough.


As the legislation stands, games with content deemed to exceed this classification are modified to fit classification guidelines or simply refused classification—in other words, banned. Australia's lack of an R18+ rating has led to a number of mainstream releases that are readily available to adults in other countries being refused classification here. For instance, Syndicate was refused classification in December last year because of violence that was high in impact. This first person shooter is readily available to adults in other countries, including the United Kingdom, under their R18+ equivalent and 18 certificate.


Conversely, a significant number of games rated MA15+ in Australia have been rated for 17- or 18-year olds in Europe and the United States, with a mere handful edited to genuinely earn their Australian rating. Fallout 3 was initially refused classification for its realistic depictions of drug use. But after some minor edits it was made available to children in Australia while still being restricted to adult sales in many other countries. The publishers of Grand Theft Auto IV self-censored the game for the Australian market, making cosmetic edits to acts of a sexual nature with a splattering of blood thrown in for publicity purposes. With these minor edits, the game was made available for sale in Australia to children aged 15 and older while still being restricted for sale to adults overseas. House of the Dead: Overkill should probably have been refused classification due to its excessively violent content. Yet it was given approval and continues to be available to children aged 15 and over. Again, overseas rating bodies have classified the game for adults only.


In the context of film, if an R18+ classification was not in place, well-known titles such as Dirty Harry, Pulp Fiction and Fight Club would have been banned in Australia or edited into a lower classification because they were outside the MA15+ category guidelines. In this context, it is unthinkable that such films would be deemed illegal. This legislation allows this commonsense approach to film classification to be extended to other forms of electronic entertainment. I recognise that there is a place for sexual content, coarse language and perhaps violence in the realm of entertainment. This does not mean that this content in games should escape proper and diligent regulation. As a scientist by training, I have a keen interest in understanding the world about us through a prism of cause and effect. Things do not just happen. There is a consequence propelled by a prior cause. It is an established fact that children are at the peak of their developmental vulnerability in their mid-teen years. Children do not just grow up with a propensity for coarse language, drug use et cetera. While nature plays a significant role in biologically determining our behaviour, nurture plays a role in shaping and defining an individual's cognitive process. Given the influence of social conditioning on cognitive development of children aged between 15 and 17, it is important to ensure that they are afforded every advantage. Each and every one of us in this place is a reflection of our life's experiences. This is precisely what adds to the diversity and functionality of this parliament. But the younger we are, the more vulnerable we are likely to be. As we grow older we find our personalities and behaviours are shaped by the sorts of exposures that we have formed during our formative years. Just as exposure to scientific process and content makes young students more inquisitive and gives them the ability to think critically and compete in a professional world with great competence, so exposure to violence, sexual content, coarse language, drug use and other adult themes can just as easily impact development.


This bill is about choice—the opportunity to protect children between the vulnerable ages of 15 and 17 from accessing content that is clearly inappropriate for these ages. The R18+ category gives consumers, parents and retailers the right to choose in an informed manner the content with which their children engage and will prevent minors from purchasing unsuitable material. Such classification also gives us the opportunity to police these types of games more effectively. Presentation of a drivers licence or proof-of-age card at the time of purchase allows a simple and non-burdensome way of ensuring younger Australians are restricted from inappropriate content at the point of sale and hire. My coalition colleagues and I wish to extend the protections of the current legislation to ensure younger Australians to the age of 18 are not exposed to content that may be harmful or adult themes that they might find distressing or difficult to comprehend and process. Current classifications fall short on protecting minors from this harmful and disturbing content. This is why we support this bill. Games of an adult nature clearly deserve classification that fairly reflects this R18+ rating. I commend this bill to the House. It has bipartisan support towards a good and noble cause.

"Andrews, Karen, MP",LP,2012-03-15,"



Mrs ANDREWS
 (McPherson) (12:21):  I rise today to speak on the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (R 18+ Computer Games) Bill 2012. The objective of the bill being debated today is to introduce an R18+ classification for computer games, allowing for adult players to purchase games that have up until now been refused classification or been modified to suit the current classification system. It will provide Australian consumers—including gamers, parents and retailers—with the information to decide which computer games are and are not suitable for minors to play. This bill is also the result of an in-principle agreement made by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General in 2011.


Currently, all films and computer games, and some publications, are examined by the Classification Board before they can be released to the public. However, the current classification system for films ranges from general, or G, up to R18+ for high level content and X18+, which usually accompanies sexually explicit content only. The principles that guide the way in which the Classification Board makes decisions about films and computer games are contained within the Classification Code 2005, which states that:


Adults should be able to read, hear and see what they want, and minors should be protected from material likely to harm or disturb them.


The measures being discussed today are intended to strike the appropriate balance between these two interests. We must have consideration, though, to the fact that we as part of a responsible community bear an obligation to ensure the welfare of our youth and their healthy development in the years to come.


Currently, the highest classification available to the video gaming industry is mature accompanied, or MA15+. This means that any viewer of the media in question who is under 15 years of age must be accompanied by a parent or guardian. Because the maximum classification has been maintained at an MA15+ level, it has meant that any computer game with adult themes exceeding what could be classified as MA15+ has been refused classification, meaning that the game in question is unable to be sold, distributed, hired, exhibited, displayed, demonstrated or advertised in Australia.


Presently, there are only a very small number of games that are refused classification. For a game to be sold in Australia when it does not meet classification requirements for an MA15+, the computer game must undergo modification to make elements of it less graphic and to fit within the MA15+ classification. However, this inadvertently means that computer games that would otherwise be reserved for adult players in other countries are playable by those computer game players that are between the ages of 15 and 17 here. This is the opposite of the original intention of such classifications, which is to protect minors from content that they should not be subject to.


Where we in Australia would either refuse classification or allow modifications to games to suit our classifications schemes, other countries have introduced adult classifications. The United States, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and European Union member nations, all have adult classification for computer games, whereas Australia is currently the only Western nation that does not carry such a classification. Video gaming is not a small phenomenon in Australia. Studies from 2008 show that 88 per cent of Australian households have some form of device for playing computer games, with 50 per cent of Australian players reporting that they play games daily or every other day. The Digital Australia 2012 report, which was produced by Bond University School of Communication and Media for the Interactive Games and Entertainment Association, revealed that the number of Australian households with a computer game device increased to 92 per cent in 2012 with 57 per cent of gamers now playing either daily or every other day. In 2008 the computer game industry saw sales rising to $1.96 billion with the sales of games software increasing from 57 per cent from the previous year, and consoles sales rising 43 per cent. 


On top of this there are 25 major game development studios in Australia which export $120 million worth of products a year. Forecasts from the PricewaterhouseCoopers report entitled Australian Entertainment and Media Outlook 2011-2015 expect that the Australian computer game industry will expand at a compound annual growth rate of 9.5 per cent per year and eventually reach $2.5 billion by 2015. Globally this number is expected to reach $90.1 billion by 2015 through a compound annual growth rate of 8.2 per cent. The industry not only hires many people in the retail sector but also provided employment for the designers and developers who create the games as well as many other professionals who are required to ensure the successful operation of a business. It is therefore obvious that the computer gaming industry is not a fringe industry but one that contributes significantly to the Australian economy. 


This was also reflected by the findings of the public consultation on the possible introduction of R18+ classification for computer games. Submissions for the public consultation were called for on 14 December 2009. By the time submissions formally closed on 28 February 2010, more than 58,000 valid submissions had been received by the Attorney-General's Department. The final report into the public consultation found that 98 per cent of those submissions were in favour of an R18+ classification for computer games, with only two per cent opposed. 


There are clearly two issues that need to be dealt with: firstly there are issues with gamers who are 18-years old and over and their right to choose what games they wish to play; and, secondly, there are issues with those who are less than 18 years old and are therefore minors and should be protected from material likely to harm or disturb them. I will now discuss the issue of choice with gamers who are over 18 years. There is a common perception that many computer game players are under the age of 18. The evidence, however, shows the contrary. In the public consultation over 72 per cent of respondents were aged between 18 to 34 years old. And just over two years on, the data from the Digital Australia 2012 report confirms this ratio, with the report finding 75 per cent of computer gamers are over the age of 18. The report also found that the average age of computer gamers is 32, which rose from 30 in 2008. 


An Australian Law Reform Commission issues papers revealed that Australian computer gamers want the ability to choose what they play. Adult Australians are currently given the ability to choose what films and television programs they wish to view. If they do not like what is on the TV or in the cinema they can simply choose not to watch it, whilst those who do want to view it are given the opportunity to do so. It should be no different for those who wish to play computer games. 


This leads me to the second issue, which is the need to protect minors from material and games that are likely to harm or disturb them. Many interest groups have come forward saying that the introduction of an R18+ rating will lead to children being able to access with greater ease computer games which are deemed inappropriate for their age. As I said before, the discrepancy between our classification system for computer games and the classification system of other countries already contributes to this, with young Australian gamers being able to access games that other children of a similar age would usually not be able to get hold of.


Under current laws, a person under the age of 15 is unable to purchase a computer game with a classification which is rated above their current age unless an adult is present. This is a similar circumstance to a minor attempting to purchase films or publications which carry a classification for above their current age. I previously mentioned that some R18+ games have been modified for Australian distribution and have since been sold under the MA15+ classification. In this circumstance, the parent has the discretion whether or not to buy the MA15+ game for the child. The parent may be under the impression that the game is appropriate for their child to play due to the labelling, but they are more than likely unaware that the game they are buying with good intentions was previously deemed to be completely inappropriate for their child. With an R18+ classification, however, there will be an added disincentive for parents to purchase games for their younger children, due to the non-discretionary nature of an R18+ classification, which clearly stipulates that the computer game is inappropriate for a person of a younger age.


I will conclude today by reiterating that I do have a concern for minors and that it is our need and our desire to provide the necessary protection from material that is likely to harm or disturb them. We do have an obligation to our youth to ensure they are protected from things that could be detrimental to their upbringing.


Debate adjourned.

"Cobb, John, MP",Nats,2012-03-15,"



Mr JOHN COBB
 (Calare) (12:31):  I rise today to speak about mining in the Lithgow region in Calare and the threat that this Greens driven Labor government is posing for this very vital industry. Along with the power stations, mining is the largest employer in Lithgow and it is absolutely crucial to the viability of our city. Yesterday I received some good news, finally, for the local mining industry. The environmental protection and biodiversity conservation referral for the Springvale mine north of Lithgow has finally been approved by the minister for the environment. This essentially allows for an extension of operations at the mine. The problem is that it has taken the minister an entire year to come to this decision, at great cost to the mine's owner and causing incredible angst amongst the 350-plus employees and contractors and ongoing costs of half a million dollars a day to Centennial Coal.


In April 2011, Centennial submitted the EPBC referral for the Springvale mine to the minister following already lengthy discussions with the department. Since then, Centennial Coal have been forced to wrangle with Labor government bureaucracy and red tape in trying to seek approval to extend their operations. All the while, the 350-plus employees were on tenterhooks, not knowing if their jobs were secure. Concern was also mounting about the local power station's ability to meet its annual electricity generation targets because it relies on this mine for coal of a particular bent. Further delays led to the sterilisation of 1.5 million tonnes of coal, with a profit impact on Centennial Coal of approximately $26 million. That is not to mention the loss of $10.9 million in state royalties and $14 million in federal taxes.


It is incomprehensible why this Greens driven Labor government—and I mean driven by the Greens party—would risk the viability of one of the largest underground coal producers in New South Wales. Fortunately for Centennial Coal, their employees and the local community, approval was finally granted yesterday, and now they can get on with the job.


But, just as the mine has overcome one Greens driven Labor government hurdle, another looms: the mining tax. The minerals resource rent tax will hit mines in the Lithgow region hard. As this ill-conceived tax goes before the Senate, the mines of Lithgow fret. Mines in Lithgow fall into that fateful category of the smaller and mid-tier coalmining companies that will be paying the tax straightaway. Under the tax, local mining businesses will be instantly less competitive against the larger mining bodies. They will continue to pay royalties on production while also being subject to increased compliance burdens. Our mining companies already pay double taxation through company taxes and state government royalties, and since the mining tax does not replace any of these taxes it will be triple taxation of Lithgow's and Australia's miners. We oppose Labor's mining tax because it is bad economics to single out a single sector with extra taxes. The mining industry is too important for Lithgow and too important for Australia to have its viability threatened, as this government seems hell-bent on doing. It is amazing what a government will do to keep one vote in the House of Representatives, irrespective of whether it is in Australia's interests or not. Given that this is also supposed to be about relief for small business—and the Treasurer makes a big play of that—let me tell you that Lithgow is not very different from the rest of Australia. Two-thirds of small business will get nothing out of this because two-thirds of businesses are partnerships or they are small traders. You only get this huge one per cent if you are a company, and very few small businesses are companies.


Lithgow, like the area of Parkes or Orange, is very big on mining. Most of regional Australia has its issues with mining, but it has also been very good to us in terms of jobs and in terms of bringing the resources to us. I do not know why any government would be so hell-bent on hitting hit us with a mining tax and a carbon tax at the same time and basically for the same purpose: to make life harder for regional Australia in particular.
