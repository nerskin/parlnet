The PRESIDENT:  In accordance with the usual practice and with the concurrence of the Senate, government responses will be incorporated in Hansard.




The 
documents
 read as follows—





Australian Government Response to Senate Community Affairs References Committee Report on The role of the Therapeutic Goods Administration regarding medical devices, particularly Poly Implant Prothèse (PIP) breast implants





Government response to recommendations









Recommendation 1





The committee recommends that there be rigorous systems put in place to ensure that medical practitioners provide consumers with all the information needed to allow them to give fully informed consent.












Response:





The Australian Government notes the recommendation, and undertakes to bring it to the notice of the Medical Board of Australia (MBA) for consideration.





Codes relating to the conduct of medical practitioners are the responsibility of the MBA. The MBA 
Good Medical Practice: A Code of Conduct for Doctors in Australia 
describes the ethical and professional standards that are expected to be met by all doctors registered to practise in Australia. It specifically covers informed consent (section 3.5).





Where a practitioner is believed to be acting outside the Code of Conduct, a notification can be made to Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA). The practitioner may then be subject to investigation or performance assessment by the Board so that appropriate action can be taken to protect the public.









Recommendation 2





The committee recommends that the TGA review all cases where sponsors have not met their obligations in relation to their listing on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods to ensure that these cases do not pose any health risk to the Australian public, and that important data has not been missed.












Response:





The Australian Government agrees with this recommendation, noting that in the context of the Report the recommendation refers specifically to high risk medical devices.





In 2010, the TGA implemented a process under which all annual reports required to be submitted by sponsors of Class III, Active Implantable Medical Devices and implantable Class IIb medical devices for the first three years of inclusion of the device on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods are audited and reviewed. All such reports have since this time been so audited and reviewed. Following the TGA's review of annual reports, appropriate regulatory action is taken where necessary.









Recommendation 3





The committee recommends that the Department of Health and Ageing include as part of their annual report process, information on the TGA's procedures for monitoring requirements placed on Class III medical devices.












Response:





The Australian Government agrees with the recommendation.





Since 2010, the TGA has had in place processes for monitoring requirements placed on the sponsors of high risk medical devices (see response to 
Recommendation 2
). In accordance with this recommendation, the Department of Health and Ageing will seek to make information on these procedures available through its Annual Report.









Recommendation 4





The committee recommends that the TGA put in place measures to ensure that when recommendations made by the Advisory Committee on Medical Devices (formally the Medical Devices Evaluation Committee) are not followed, the delegate needs to set out specific and compelling reasons why the decision was taken.












Response:





The Australian Government agrees with the recommendation, and notes that the delegate is already required to document the specific reasons for their decision.





The Advisory Committee on Medical Devices (ACMD) is a statutory committee established under the Therapeutic Goods Regulations 1990 to advise and make recommendations to the Minister or Secretary about matters related to medical devices.





The ACMD may be asked for advice relevant to a decision to include a medical device on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG). The delegate may take into account advice from the ACMD when making his or her decision. The Government agrees that the delegate should continue to document the specific reasons for that decision.









Recommendation 5





The committee recommends that the Therapeutic Goods Administration include in their updates on PIP breast implants, and as part of any future recalls on other devices or medications, details of the type of evidence they are pursuing in order to further inform the Australian public.












Response:





The Australian Government agrees with the recommendation.





Consistent with the Australian Government's commitment to transparency, the TGA will adopt a strong focus on improving its communication and engagement with the community.





The Government will ensure that the TGA focuses on the information needs of the community and other stakeholders to ensure that the right information is presented in a way that meets the varying needs of all stakeholders.





The TGA website will be continuously improved and updated to ensure that it provides high quality information about its investigations into the safety of medical devices. In relevant cases this information will include the type of evidence being pursued.





In August 2012, the TGA made the Database of Adverse Event Notifications (DAEN) available to the public through its website
1
. DAEN provides information about adverse events to medicines that have been reported to the TGA since 1971. Further work will be





1
 The database is available at


http://www.tga.gov.au/safety/daen.htm





undertaken to provide the public with access to Australian and New Zealand adverse drug and medical device incident data.









Recommendation 6





The committee recommends that the TGA publish updates and details of the discussions that have taken place with international regulators.












Response:





The Australian Government notes the recommendation and consistent with its response to 
Recommendation 5
 will ensure that every effort is made to provide stakeholders with more information.





In particular circumstances, it may not be possible to disclose information about the content of discussions that have taken place with international regulators. The Australian Government and the TGA have signed agreements with several overseas regulatory agencies. These international agreements may include provisions detailing the circumstances under which confidential information and documentation exchanged under the agreement cannot be provided to third parties and therefore cannot be published.









Recommendation 7





The committee recommends that the TGA review its processes to ensure that faulty explanted devices are available to the TGA for independent testing.












Response:





The Australian Government notes the recommendation and agrees to review the relevant processes.





The TGA's Medical Device Incident Reporting and Investigation Scheme (IRIS) has in place a process to request return of faulty devices to the TGA for testing as part of the investigation into an incident when circumstances require. However, under current arrangements the TGA is not able to mandate that explanted devices be returned. The TGA will review the clarity and effectiveness of existing processes to facilitate obtaining samples of explanted medical devices that have been reported through IRIS when laboratory testing by the TGA is deemed to be appropriate and necessary to the investigation.









Recommendation 8





The committee recommends that the TGA's advice about PIP breast implants include the limitations of the evidence and data to ensure that consumers and medical professionals alike are in receipt of as much information as possible that will enable them to make informed decisions about any future treatment.












Response:





The Australian Government agrees with the recommendation and will review the information on the TGA website in the light of this recommendation.





The Government will ensure that the TGA focuses on the information needs of the community and other stakeholders to ensure that the appropriate information is presented and that it includes a description of the limitations of the evidence and data provided.









Recommendation 9





The committee recommends that, in light of the Poly Implant Prothèse breast implant recall, the Department of Health and Ageing establish an opt-out Breast Implant Registry as a priority. The design of such a registry should be based on the National Joint Replacement Registry.












Response:





The Australian Government agrees with the recommendation.





As part of the 2013-14 Budget, the Government will provide seed funding of up to $5.1 million over two financial years to establish and maintain two clinical quality registers for breast implants and cardiac devices before they move to industry cost-recovery arrangements in 2015. The Government agrees that an opt-out approach will be adopted by the new breast implant register in line with the recommendation of the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care on this matter.





The Government notes that the National Joint Replacement Registry is a successful registry that can provide a model for other registries subject to necessary adjustments for different devices and medical specialties as appropriate.









Recommendation 10





The committee recommends that the Australian Government extend the Medicare rebates for MRIs in accordance with the current medical advice.












Response:





The Australian Government agrees with the recommendation.





The PIP MRI initiative enables patients to access Medicare-eligible MRI scans to evaluate the integrity of the implants in all PIP patients and to detect implant rupture in patients who may have subsequently developed symptoms (whether or not they have previously had a normal imaging examination). The initiative has been extended for another 2 years from





11 March 2013 to 11 March 2015.









Recommendation 11
a





The committee recommends that the Department of Health and Ageing implement recommendations 13, 14 and 15 of the HTA Review recommendations as soon as possible. The committee notes this recommendation was also made in its 2011 report on regulation of medical devices (recommendation 7).












Response:





The Australian Government agrees with the recommendation.





In relation to 
Recommendation 13
 of the HTA Review, the Government's response to 
Recommendation 8
 of the Senate Inquiry into 
The regulatory standards for the approval of medical devices in Australia 
provides a response regarding the need to encourage greater reporting of adverse events from therapeutics (including medical devices).





In relation to 
Recommendation 14
 of the HTA Review, the Government's response to 
Recommendation 7
 of the Senate Inquiry into 
The regulatory standards for the approval of medical devices in Australia 
provides a response regarding the expanded use of post market surveillance data.





Recommendation 15
 of the HTA Review is that registers for high risk implantable medical devices and/or procedures be established. This is addressed by the Budget measure outlined in the response to 
Recommendation 9
 above.









Recommendation 11
b





The committee strongly recommends that professional bodies, particularly the ASPS and ACCS, ensure through formal advice that surgeons are aware of their responsibilities to ensure that they provide an ongoing advisory role to their patients even after medical treatment has concluded.












Response:





The Australian Government agrees with the recommendation in principle, and undertakes to bring it to the notice of the Medical Board of Australia (MBA). The MBA may wish to work with professional associations to implement this recommendation.





Professional associations are independent bodies that guide the practice of individuals engaged in a profession and represent the interests of their members. It is a matter for them to determine the advice they provide to their members, noting their role in enforcement of professional standards and protection of the public.









Recommendation 12





The committee recommends that the clinical advisory committee established by the Chief Medical Officer should develop advice, based on current evidence regarding breastfeeding and PIP breast implants, as soon as possible, and that this information be included in future Chief Medical Officer reports on this issue.












Response:





The Australian Government agrees with the recommendation.





The Chief Medical Officer, in consultation with the clinical advisory committee, provided advice regarding breastfeeding and PIP breast implants on 2 July 2012





(www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/PIP-breast-implants

Recommendation 13
   





The committee recommends that the TGA include in their advice that it is unclear whether PIP breast implants rupture more than other silicone breast implants and that further testing and investigation of PIP breast implants will continue to inform this advice.












Response:





The Australian Government agrees with the recommendation.





The Australian Government, through the Report of the Chief Medical Officer, has advised that currently available information cannot confirm or exclude the possibility that PIP implants rupture more than other implants but the number of reported ruptures in Australia to date is within an expected range. The TGA continues to review its advice in the light of further information as it becomes available, including information from the final report of the UK's expert committee convened to review the safety of PIP implants released on 1 February 2013.





The TGA will consider data obtained from the Government subsidised Magnetic Resonance Imaging when providing information to the public on the extent of ruptured PIP implants.

Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network





Review of the Rollout of the National Broadband Network Fifth Report





Australian Government Response to the Committee's Fifth Report of 17 June 2013





INTRODUCTION





In March 2011, the Parliament established the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network (the Committee) to enable the ongoing parliamentary scrutiny of all aspects relating to the rollout of the National Broadband Network (NBN). The Committee is required to report to the Parliament on the rollout of the NBN on a six monthly basis until the completion of the project.





The Committee has been asked to provide progress reports on:






the rollout of the NBN;






the achievement of take-up targets as set out in NBN Co Limited's (NBN Co) Corporate Plan;






network rollout performance including service levels and faults;






the effectiveness of NBN Co in meeting its obligations as set out in its Stakeholder Charter;






NBN Co's strategy for engaging with consumers and handling complaints;






NBN Co's risk management processes; and






any other matter pertaining to the NBN rollout that the Committee considers relevant.





The Committee tabled its first report on the 
Review of the Rollout of the National Broadband Network 
on 31 August 2011, its second report on 24 November 2011, its third report on 25 June 2012 and its fourth report on 28 February 2013. The government's responses to the Committee's first, second, third and fourth reports were tabled in the Parliament on





1 March 2012, 16 April 2012, 9 October 2012 and 5 June 2013 respectively.





On 17 June 2013, the Committee tabled its fifth report, entitled 
Review of the Rollout of the National Broadband Network: Fifth Report. 
The Committee's fifth report was informed by public hearings and public consultation which attracted 20 submissions. The report made five recommendations ranging across: risk mitigation strategies related to policy change, performance reporting, particularly in regard to the regional fibre rollout, issues associated with interim satellite service, the potential of private equity to fund the NBN, and workforce issues associated with the NBN rollout.





BACKGROUND





The NBN is a telecommunications network that will provide access to high-speed broadband to 100 per cent of Australian premises using a combination of fibre to the premises, fixed-wireless and satellite technologies. NBN Co's objective is to provide 93 per cent of premises with access to a high-speed fibre network capable of providing broadband speeds of up to one gigabit per second (Gbps) download and 400 megabits per second (Mbps) upload. Seven per cent of premises will be served by a combination of next-generation fixed-wireless and satellite technologies providing peak speeds of up to 25 Mbps download and 5 Mbps upload.





The NBN will be Australia's first national wholesale, open access broadband network offering equivalent terms and conditions to all access seekers or service providers. The Australian Government has established NBN Co to design, build and operate the new high-speed NBN. NBN Co will roll out the network and sell wholesale services to inter
-
net and telephone service providers. In turn service providers will offer retail services to consumers. This is a significant structural change to Australia's telecommunications industry, aimed at encouraging vibrant retail competition.





On 7 March 2012, the Definitive Agreements between NBN Co and Teistra came into force. The Agreements pave the way for a faster, cheaper and more efficient rollout of the NBN. They include the reuse of suitable Teistra infrastructure, avoiding infrastructure duplication and for Teistra to progressively structurally separate by decommissioning its copper network . during the NBN rollout. The Definitive Agreements will mean less disruption to communities, less use of overhead cables and faster access to the NBN for Australians.





Planning and construction of the NBN is well underway. On 11 January 2013, NBN Co announced that it had exceeded its target to have construction commenced or completed in areas covering 758,000 
premises before the end of 2012. The total number of premises in areas where construction had commenced or completed was 784,592 by year end.





On 21 March 2013, NBN Co reported that it had updated its short-term fibre rollout timeline expecting to pass 341,000 premises with fibre about three months later than the June 2013 target, with between 190,000 and 220,000 premises being forecast to be passed by fibre by end June 2013. NBN Co also assumed direct responsibility for the Northern Territory fibre rollout.





NBN Co advised that this short-term issue will not affect the long-term delivery of the NBN or the overall cost of the project. NBN Co remains on track to deliver better broadband to all Australians by 2021 as set out in NBN Co's 2012-15 Corporate Plan.





On 5 May 2013, NBN Co released an update to its indicative three year fibre rollout plan, which will see NBN construction either commence or be completed by mid-2016 for more than 4.8 million homes, businesses, schools and hospitals across Australia. This is an increase of over 1.3 million premises from NBN Co's 2012-15 fibre rollout plan.





The full list of locations included in the plan can be viewed on NBN Co's website at 
www.nbnco.com.aukollout/about-the-rollout/communities-in-the-rollouthtml.The
 three year rollout plan will be updated each year.





On 4 July 2013, NBN Co released its 30 June 2013 rollout figures, confirming that the company had achieved its revised end of financial year fibre rollout targets. The fibre network has passed more than 207,500 premises as of 30 June 2013, meeting NBN Co's revised forecast of between 190,000 and 220,000 premises. As at 30 June 2013, NBN Co had also covered 27,300 premises with the fixed wireless network and 250,000 premises with the interim satellite service.





There are over 70,000 homes and businesses using the NBN as of 30 June 2013, up from 13,600 premises at 30 June 2012. This represents an increase of more than fourfold in the total number of end users over the past 12 months. Additionally, the number of premises connected to NBN fibre services has increased sevenfold from 3,900 premises as at 30 June 2012, to 33,600 premises as at 30 June 2013.





AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT RESPONSE





The government has considered the Committee's Fifth Report and provides the following response to the recommendations.





Performance Reporting and Regulatory Issues








Recommendation I





The Committee recommends the Government task the NBN Co Limited to update its Corporate Plan 2012-2015 to prepare strategies to minimise risk in any policy changes that may reasonably be expected to occur in the 2012-2015 period.











Shareholder departments and NBN Co are implementing the government's policy to rollout and operate a National Broadband Network within the existing policy framework set out in the Statement of Expectations.





The six-monthly government progress reports to the Committee and NBN Co's 2012-15 Corporate Plan contain risk and mitigation strategies relevant to the existing policy framework.





Regional and Remote Issues








Recommendation 2





The Committee recommends the NBN Co Limited revised Corporate Plan and the six-monthly Shareholder Ministers' Performance Reports to the Committee include further information on the National Broadband Network fibre rollout in regional Australia.











The government supports this recommendation.





The NBN will enable every community in regional Australia fair access to affordable high
-
speed broadband. This is underpinned by the delivery of uniform national wholesale pricing within the three technology platforms—fibre, fixed wireless and satellite—and across the platforms for entry level products and other products to the greatest extent where practicable. This means that wholesale broadband prices for comparable products can be the same for households and businesses regardless of where they are located, in the city, in regional Australia or in more remote parts of the country.





The government and NBN Co are committed to publishing as much information as possible on the NBN rollout to regional and rural Australia.





On 25 July 2012, the government released a list of regional towns across Australia that will be receiving access to the high-speed NBN fibre network. To date, the majority of construction and planning so far in the NBN project has been in non-metropolitan areas with more than 70 per cent of communities in NBN Co's 2013-16 fibre rollout plan located in non-metropolitan Australia. It is expected that more than 70 per cent of Australian premises in non-metropolitan areas will be able to access fibre to the premises by the end of the rollout.





NBN Co's 12-month national construction rollout plan and three year national fibre rollout plan lists the communities, in metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas across each state and territory, where construction on the fibre network will commence, or be completed by mid-2016. NBN Co's rollout plans, interactive maps and detailed information on progress nationally is available at 
www.nbnco.com.au/industry/service-providersinetwork-rollout.html





The government has provided information to the Committee on the progress of the fibre rollout to non-metropolitan areas of Australia in past six-monthly NBN progress reports. The government has also included information on the NBN rollout to regional and rural areas in responses to the Committee's first, second and third reports on the Review of the NBN Rollout.





NBN Co's 2011-13 and 2012-15 Corporate Plans confirm that fibre will be built in regional areas as a priority and now that NBN Co has reached volume rollout, NBN Co is considering what additional information can be provided on an ongoing basis.








Recommendation 3





The Committee recommends NBN Co Limited and the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy closely monitor the current rate of Interim Satellite Service (ISS) activations and, prior to the customer cap on the ISS being reached:





consult with relevant stakeholders and the Australian community on options for establishing cost efficient arrangements to ensure that education, health and local government facilities in rural and remote communities and other individuals determined to be most in need of access to the ISS are still able to access the service; and





consider increasing the customer cap on the ISS, if additional satellite capacity becomes available at a competitive cost.











The government supports this recommendation.





As at 30 June 2013, there were over 34,600 customers with an active NBN interim satellite service (ISS) connection, with another 1,800 orders in the process of being connected.





At the Committee's hearing on 19 April 2013, NBN Co's Chief Executive Officer, Mr Mike Quigley, advised that once the 48,000 customer cap for the ISS is reached, NBN Co will not be able to provide satellite services to new customers.
1
 NBN Co has investigated options for expanding the available capacity on the ISS, but at this time has not identified alternatives that would be economically viable. 
2





Demand for the ISS has been extremely strong. As the former Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator the Hon Stephen Conroy outlined during the Senate Estimates hearing on 30 May 2013, `ISS services were expected to last until late 2014, but the 
popularity of the ISS means that the orders will reach capacity sometime in early 2014. So NBN Co is managing the remaining services to ensure that customers without

existing access to affordable metro-comparable broadband services receive priority registration for the ISS' .
3





Additional Issues








Recommendation 4





The Committee recommends that the Government continue considering investor interest in the National Broadband Network and the optimum capital structure for the NBN Co Limited.











The government does not support this recommendation.





Private equity funding prior to the completion of the NBN rollout was explicitly advised against in the NBN Implementation Stud?. The government remains committed to the sale of NBN Co at an appropriate time.





The 2012-15 Corporate Plan assumes that NBN Co will commence raising debt from FY2015 onwards.
5
 Prior to this, as set out in the Statement of Expectations, NBN Co will be funded with government equity.





For more information on the Government's position on private equity engagement, refer to the government's response to recommendation 6 of the Committee's Fourth Report and recommendation 12 of the Committee's Third Report.








Recommendation 5





The Committee recommends that the NBN Co Limited continue to:





work with contractors to ensure sufficient mobilisation of skilled labour to meet National Broadband Network (NBN) rollout targets;





update NBN workforce modelling data to assist with communicating and planning for changing NBN training needs and workforce demand; and





encourage the participation of local recruitment firms and the local construction industry in the NBN rollout.











The government supports this recommendation.





As outlined in the government's response to the Committee's Fourth Report, NBN Co has developed and is implementing an overall workforce development strategy that involves:






identifying the gap between supply and demand of appropriately skilled resources;






determining relevant training programs and qualifications, providers, and funding to support skills development; and

a skills assurance program to confirm workers have the necessary regulated and required skills to perform work.





The workforce development strategy also recognises the dispersed nature of the rollout. This will allow for greater use of local recruitment firms and the local construction industry in the NBN rollout, in both regional and metropolitan areas.





The government expects to provide an overview of NBN Co's workforce de
ve
lopment strategy in its annual statement to the Committee. In the interim, information can be found at NBN Co's website (
www.nbnco.com.au
) which provides an outline of the workforce development strategy activities.



 




Senate Select Committee on the National Broadband Network





Australian Government Response to the Committee's Second, Third, Fourth and Final Reports





The Senate Select Committee on the National Broadband Network (the Committee) was established on 25 June 2008 to inquire into the government's initial National Broadband Network (NBN) proposal. The Committee published four interim reports dated





2 December 2008, 12 May 2009, 26 November 2009 and 18 May 2010 and a final report on 17 June 2010.





The Committee's interim reports and final report made 47 recommendations ranging across: the implementation plan for the rollout of the NBN; the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's (ACCC) report on the NBN proposals to the NBN Panel of Experts; the business plan for the rollout to mainland Australia and Tasmania; the governance and funding framework for NBN Co; the government's response to the Implementation Study; the rollout to regional and rural Australia; engagement with key stakeholders; workforce issues; and the commissioning of a cost-benefit analysis. A number of recommendations were replicated across the Committee's reports and some recommendations have been overtaken by the passage of time and the progress of the NBN rollout. As such the government has outlined those report recommendations which have been addressed by the public disclosure of information, legislative arrangements or formal agreements or actively canvassed through the work of other parliamentary committees.





The government notes that at least half of the Committee's report recommendations have been addressed by the disclosure of information on the NBN implementation, and the provision of rollout data and advice over time to parliamentary committees and the public. The government has responded to recommendations 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 from the second interim report, recommendations 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10 and 11 from the third interim report, recommendations 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 16, 20, 24, 27 and 28 from the fourth interim report and recommendation 1 from the final report, by publicly releasing detailed information on the NBN rollout, including:






a statement in Parliament on 23 October 2009 providing a progress report on the NBN Implementation






the Australian National Audit Office performance audit of the NBN Request for Proposal process on 3 February 2010






sections of documents relating to the terminated Request for Proposal process

the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman Review report on 4 May 2012






NBN Co's annual reports in respect of the 2008-09, 2009-10, 2010-11 and 2011-12 financial years






NBN Co's Corporate Plans for 2011-13 and 2012-15






responses to parliamentary committee reports and tabled answers to questions on notice






information published, through NBN Co, on the progress of the fibre, wireless and satellite rollout






through NBN Co, release of the first three year national fibre rollout plan in March 2012 and an updated three year plan for 2013-16 in May 2013.





The government is committed to progressing the NBN. Since the Committee finalised its reports on the NBN, the government has established NBN Co Limited as a Government Business Enterprise and the Parliament has passed legislation which sets out the operational framework and company-specific requirements for NBN Co and the rollout. The government has responded to recommendations 1, 3, 8 and 11 from the third interim report and recommendations 1, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 15, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23 and 28 from the fourth interim report, through its commitments or powers reflected under legislative arrangements or formal agreements entered into by the government, including the:






National Broadband Network Companies Act 2011






Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (National Broadband Network Measures—Access Arrangements) Act 2011






Telecommunications Act 1997






Telecommunications (Low-impact facilities) Determination 1997






Telecommunications Code of Practice 1997






Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Act 2012






Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Universal Service Reform) Act 2012






Telecommunications (Industry Levy) Act 2012






Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Regulation 2012






agreement between the government and Telstra for the delivery of the Universal Service Obligation and other public interest telecommunications services






agreement between the government and the Independent Members (Mr Tony Windsor and Mr Rob Oakeshott)






agreement between the government and Telstra, whereby public information on migration activities is undertaken by NBN Co in consultation with the government, Telstra and the wider industry.





In 2011 the government established a Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network (JCNBN), to report to the Parliament on the rollout of the NBN on a six-monthly basis until the completion of the project which demonstrates the government's commitment to openness and transparency for the NBN. The terms of reference for the JCNBN provides for the ongoing parliamentary scrutiny of all aspects of the rollout of the NBN including many of the issues raised in the Committee's reports.





The government has agreed to report to the Parliament, through the JCNBN, on the rollout of the NBN on a six-monthly basis. The government's progress reports on the NBN enable the JCNBN in turn to report to the Parliament and shareholder Ministers as required on the Review of the NBN Rollout.





The government's responses to the JCNBN's first, second, third and fourth reports on the Review of the NBN Rollout address some of the Senate Select Committee's report recommendations. Specifically, recommendation 6 from the third interim report and recommendations 25 and 26 from the fourth interim report which relate to the government undertaking a skills audit for the NBN rollout. The government has addressed these recommendations in its responses to recommendations 13, 14 and 15 of the JCNBN's third report and recommendation 8 of the JCNBN's fourth report on the Review of the





NBN Rollout.





Further to government responses to JCNBN reports on the NBN rollout, shareholder departments and NBN Co appear regularly before parliamentary committees and respond to a significant number of questions on notice around the NBN rollout. The government notes that several of the Committee's 
report recommendations have also been addressed by responses to questions taken on notice at Senate Budget Estimates and JCNBN hearings.





The government notes recommendation 12 of the third interim report was addressed by the Senate when it revised the Committee's terms of reference in 2009.





The government recognises the level of interest in the rollout of the NBN attracts





considerable inquiries from a range of parliamentary committees and the public. To the extent the matters raised in the Committee's report recommendations are not already addressed, the government considers the JCNBN would provide the appropriate process for any further review.

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment) (17:16):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate records its deep regret at the death, on 30 September 2013, of Janet Frances Powell AM, former senator for Victoria and Leader of the Australian Democrats, places on record its appreciation of her long meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to her family in their bereavement.


Janet Powell lost her battle with pancreatic cancer on 30 September, aged 71. Former Senator Powell was not a traditional politician and her path to the Australian parliament was not a route taken by many of us in this place. From a small rural town in the Wimmera, western Victoria, the daughter of farmers, she graduated from the University of Melbourne with a Bachelor of Arts and a Diploma of Education. She worked as a secondary school teacher at Kerang and Nhill high schools. One of the founding members of the Australian Democrats in 1977, she became the first female Victorian state president in 1984. In 1986 she entered the Senate for Victoria, filling a casual vacancy created by the resignation of Democrats founder Don Chipp. The final paragraph of Senator Powell's first speech gave a clue to her style:


Political dogmatism will not remove inequity, put food on people's tables or find them jobs. The Democrats are not interested in dogma; we are interested in people. We will take up issues as they arise, making decisions as we see them in the light of our longstanding objectives and policies and in the interests of the community as a whole.


Indeed, Senator Powell was a strong role model for women in politics and I understand was always generous with her time and experience mentoring women. She was a passionate feminist. In 1989 she made history as the first woman of either house to have a private member's bill passed by both houses—the Smoking and Tobacco Products Advertisements (Prohibition) Bill 1989, which banned the print advertising of tobacco products.


Her successful amendment of the Disability Services Bill 1986 meant that the psychiatrically disabled were included in such legislation for the first time. Senator Powell was also instrumental in the establishment in 1988 of the Senate Select Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals, which investigated the use and impact of pesticides. 


After a national ballot of Democrat members, she succeeded Janine Haines to become leader of the party in 1990, becoming only the second woman to lead an Australian political party. After the initiation of a petition to oust her as Democrats leader in 1991, Senator Powell lost the leadership challenge. One of the criticisms of her at the time was that she had canvassed the possibility of merging with the Australian Greens, a party that she later joined. Former Democrat leader and founder Don Chipp described this incident as the most tragic story to have hit the Democrats.


A year later in 1992 Senator Powell resigned from the Democrats to serve out her term, which ended in 1993, as an Independent. As Democrat leader, Senator Powell had opposed Australian intervention in the first Iraq war and had advocated cutting military ties with the US. It does sound very Green. In her valedictory speech Senator Powell's admiration of the Western Australian Green senators is apparent, and in 2004 she joined the Australian Greens. 


Throughout her career her commitment to the community stood out. The life of a parliamentarian does not leave much spare time on the margins, but Senator Powell always managed to carve out a space to serve the community. After leaving parliament, Ms Powell continued to dedicate her energy to volunteer leadership roles in health, women's issues and services for the disadvantaged. In 2002 Ms Powell was made a Member of the Order of Australia in recognition of her service to the parliament and community, particularly through the leadership of the YWCA. YWCA President Laura Hutchison paid tribute to Ms Powell's 'inspired leadership'. She also said:


Janet was a past president (1994-2000), rowing club patron and life member. She spearheaded a transformation that modernised the YWCA and ensured its survival. Janet drove systemic reform such as changing our constitution to enshrine young women in leadership roles and on a personal level she also mentored a series of younger presidential successors, training a new generation of female leaders. The YWCA continues to benefit from her legacy and is indebted.


Similarly, the Epilepsy Foundation of Victoria praised Senator Powell's sense of community, and they did it with these words:


All of us at the Epilepsy Foundation of Victoria are deeply saddened by the passing of Janet, a long-time member of the Epilepsy Foundation's patrons council.


I pass on my sincere condolences, on behalf of the government, to former Senator Powell's family, her four children—Katrine, Emma, Nick and Alex—her granddaughter, her friends and her colleagues over the years. They are all entitled to be extremely proud of their mother, grandmother, friend and colleague for her contribution to our community and our nation.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2013-11-12,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (17:23):  Today the Senate recognises the remarkable life of a remarkable woman. Janet Frances Powell was a senator, a leader for her community, a champion of women's rights, a feminist and a fighter for progressive causes.


As Senator Abetz has described, she grew up in a small farming community in Victoria and, like many women of her generation, ended up studying teaching. She attended Melbourne university, completing a Bachelor of Arts and diploma of teaching. Through teaching she became involved in community education, which led her on to becoming a founding member of the Australian Democrats in 1977. She became the party's first female Victorian state president in 1984 and then became the natural successor to former Senator Don Chipp when he stood down from the Senate in 1986. Ms Powell served the Senate until 1993, after being elected initially in her own right in the double dissolution election of 1987.


As has been described in many comments—including some that Senator Abetz referred to—she controversially canvassed the idea of merging the Democrats with the Australian Greens, which was a decision that many in her party opposed. As we look at Ms Powell's career, we can see a number of ways in which she really was a woman well ahead of her time. I will mention just a number of achievements. The first is that she was, as always, a tireless campaigner for progressing the rights of women and was the first to introduce a private senator's bill to strengthen affirmative action legislation. We have come a long way in some quarters and not in others since that time, but it does demonstrate the commitment that people in this chamber—particularly women in this chamber—have had for many years to progressing and advancing the representation of women in this place.


She became the first woman and one of the few members of parliament to introduce and pass a private senator's bill, which was the Smoking and Tobacco Products Advertisements (Prohibition) Bill 1989, which banned tobacco advertising in print media. Her bill was the beginning of the fight to ban electronic advertising, including


television advertising, and which then culminated in the last parliament with the passage of Australia's world first plain packaging legislation. If you look at former Senator Powell's bill, you can see that was legislation that was probably 10 or 20 years ahead of its time. Through Janet Powell's leadership, the Democrats became the only party to oppose Australia's participation in the first Gulf war, and she has been credited for persuading the government to recall parliament to debate Australia's involvement in the war.


In her time as a senator she achieved many more great things: widening disability services legislation to include psychiatrically disabled people and advancing government policy on organic farming. She was also pivotal in lifting the ban on gay and lesbian Australians becoming members of our defence forces—an extraordinary achievement—and she fought to ensure a broader representation in media ownership.


She became the leader of the Democrats in 1990 and served in the position for a short period of time. She was ever the reformer, which is one of the ways in which one can understand her support for a merger between the Democrats and the emerging Greens. In her first speech she spoke of the beliefs of the Democrats, and her character can be discerned from this:


From the very beginning the Australian Democrats have been about reform, about new ways, new ideas, about bringing people into the decisions which affect their own lives; about a world which will survive and justice for the individual.


It has been said about Janet Powell that she never fitted the mould of a politician in Canberra. We are richer for that, and we are proud to say that she served in this chamber.


Her life was one dedicated to public service, whether to her rural community or here in the Senate chamber. Through all walks of life she was honest and forthright, and she was a champion of women's rights. I pause here to make this point: there are many women who owe an enormous debt of gratitude to the feminists who have gone before. If we do aspire—as I hope most of us, if not all, do—for our daughters to have the same opportunities as our sons, it is because of women like Janet Powell, and others, who fought to ensure there is a space for our daughters to have those aspirations fulfilled. She was also an environmentalist, a true advocate for equity and a pacifist. Our deepest condolences go to her four children and her family. We thank her and we remember her.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (17:29):  I rise today to join with others in the Senate to celebrate the life and pay tribute to the contribution of the late Senator Janet Frances Powell. Janet was an extraordinary woman, as we have heard, in her upbringing and her aspirations to do better things for Australia—for women, for the community and for the nation. That is what she set out to do from a young age, from country Victoria, in the work that she did to get to university at that time and then to return to country Victoria to teach. She took into country Victoria and into those schools enormous leadership and inspiration for young girls to go on in life and to do the best they could possibly do and achieve their full potential. Right to the end of her life, she mentored women in every place she went, whether it was in schools or in the parliament, and when she left the parliament she continued to mentor young women, as has been said, in terms of leadership roles. She was a member of the Patrons Council of the Epilepsy Foundation of Victoria and a life member of the YWCA. She was appointed to the Victorian Honour Roll of Women. She was a Member of the Order of Australia, in recognition of her service to the parliament and the people of Australia and her leadership of the YWCA.


In terms of the Greens, as well, she invested a huge amount of time in helping young women through the party and talking to them about how to make way and how to continue to contribute both to politics and to strengthening the community. As has been said, she was a founding member of the Democrats in 1977 and then replaced Don Chipp as the senator for Victoria in 1986 and then won the seat in her own right the following year. Once she became leader of the Democrats in 1990, she aspired to merge the Democrats and the Greens, and at that time, in the early 1990s, the Democrats were a much larger and more established party than the Greens were. I was present at the meeting that we had in Launceston with Janet when she came down. Bob Brown and I went and met with her and talked to her there, and her aspiration was to merge the two strongest progressive forces in Australia so that there would be one stronger progressive force, in her view, and also she wanted to move beyond the Democrats' aspiration of, basically, a hand on the shoulder of government. She wanted to go beyond that and see the progressive side of politics form government, and you can see that in the kind of legislation that she introduced. It was more than just accountability that she was seeking; she was trying to implement a progressive agenda in a whole range of areas, as has been outlined.


She had a very difficult time of it and, as has been said, she resigned from the Democrats in 1992 after the leadership spill, but she remained in the parliament for the rest of her term as an Independent. The former Senator Gareth Evans said of her time in parliament:


… I think won a great deal of respect and admiration for the way in which she has withstood, with apparently infinite good cheer, the buffeting of what has been, on any analysis, a pretty tumultuous political career.


I think that is absolutely true, and she remained very even-handed, very kind and very positive in spite of all that had happened to her at that time. She joined the Australian Greens in 2004 and she stood as a Legislative Council candidate in the 2006 Victorian state election. She was unsuccessful in that but, as I have indicated, she made a big contribution to the Australian Greens and in particular the Greens in Victoria.


I want to go to some of her achievements in the parliament. As I said a moment ago, it was beyond accountability for the government of the day; it was actually progressing reform. Senator Wong spoke a moment ago about her private senator's bill on tobacco advertising, and both Senator Abetz and Senator Wong have also recorded her success in having psychiatric illness included in the definitions of disability for the purposes of disability services legislation. Her vocal opposition to the Gulf War was really courageous at the time. She was outspoken. Her pacifism was on show for all to see, and she made such a contribution that the Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, recalled both houses of parliament in January 1991 to debate Australia's involvement. I think the leadership and courage that she offered in the course of that debate were quite extraordinary, and I pay tribute to her pacifism. I also make reference to her work in trying to advance sustainable and organic agriculture. I think that, having been brought up in the country and having taught in the country, she had seen some of the impacts of the increasing industrialisation of agriculture, and she instigated the establishment of the Senate Select Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals to have a look at that at the time.


She was always guided by a strong sense of social justice, and that came out particularly in relation to women's rights. You would have to say that she was not only a role model for women in politics but a pioneer for women in politics. The leadership that she offered was not only in the policy initiatives that she brought to the parliament but also in her sustained commitment for change and her courage in continuing to argue for that change regardless of the opposition that came before her. As has been said, her attempt to strengthen affirmative action legislation is really important, as are her attempts to end discrimination of all kinds on the basis of sexuality and her success with the Defence Force. But she went beyond that. She continued to argue to end discrimination right till the end of her life.


I want to particularly say to her children, Katrine, Emma, Nick and Alex, that they should be really proud of Janet for what she contributed, and I am sure they are. She mentored many of us, and in terms of environmentalism she was quite extraordinary for her time. I spoke to her before she died, and she showed enormous courage in the face of death. Interestingly, even then her whole concern was to stay with the course of action for a more progressive, more inclusive, fairer Australia. That is what she wanted, that is what she campaigned for and that is what I pay tribute to her for doing. On behalf of the Greens, I just want to say that she is an inspirational model of our party and I really admire the fact that she was prepared to take on the idea of a merger right in those early days, and right till the end of her life she stayed committed to a strong progressive movement in Australia to bring about change. I pay tribute to Janet Powell.


Question agreed to, honourable senators standing in their places.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:11):  It is good to be back. It is a great privilege to be patron of Coeliac South Australia and Northern Territory, because they do tremendous work on a very important issue. I have this information from the Coeliac Australia website:


Coeliac disease is an immune disease caused by gluten, a protein in wheat, rye, barley and oats. When people with coeliac disease eat gluten, an inappropriate immune reaction causes inflammation and damage to the small bowel (intestine). Untreated, coeliac disease can cause a range of symptoms and health problems. Treatment involves lifelong and strict avoidance of gluten in the diet and leads to healing of the bowel and better health.


This condition can be very serious if not diagnosed and treated, leading to something called 'villous atrophy', which: 


… reduces the surface area of the bowel available for nutrient absorption, which can lead to nutrient deficiencies. Inflammation also results in problems that can affect the bones, joints, skin and other organs, such as the liver and brain.


It is a grossly underdiagnosed condition.


On 3 November, in Adelaide, I spoke at Coeliac South Australia and Northern Territory's AGM. It was an absolute pleasure to be there. They even laughed at my very bad joke, where I said that I was patron of the Coeliac society because I am a 'gluten for punishment'! I want to congratulate the president, Ms Catherine Russell, and the vice-president, Mr Dennis Fountaine, and their entire committee for the excellent work that they do.


One of the things that has struck me from my involvement with the organisation is how many people think that coeliacs are just fussy eaters, when nothing could be further from the truth. The information I gave from the Coeliac Australia website indicates how serious this condition can be. Most Australians do not realise that coeliac disease is much more prevalent than was previously thought, with more than half of our population at risk of developing the condition, according to new research. A report by journalist Bridie Smith just a few weeks ago indicates that, while overseas studies have suggested that between 30 and 40 per cent of people have the autoimmune disorder, results of the first study to assess the prevalence of the disease in Australians show that 56 per cent carry one of the two known genetic markers associated with the condition.


I am very grateful for the work of the Royal Melbourne Hospital's Dr Jason Tye-Din, which points out that, just because you have a genetic predisposition to the disease, it does not mean that you will get it, but, as Dr Tye-Din says, 'About one in 40 who carry the genetic markers will go on to develop coeliac disease.' A team led by researchers from the Walter and Eliza Hall institute in Melbourne and including scientists from Barwon Health and Deakin University have developed a new diagnostic test which is very accurate. It adds a genetic test which scans for the two key genetic markers carried by 99.6 per cent of coeliac patients.


The research by Dr Jason Tye-Din and others indicates that a very significant one in 60 Australian women and one in 80 men could develop coeliac disease, and this is something like 300,000 Australians with a condition that can cause so much misery and suffering but which can be effectively managed. I agree with David Sullivan, the National Business Development Manager at Coeliac Australia, that the study findings should serve as a wake-up call for the health sector. And I should make it clear that the figures from this research indicate that there are tens of thousands of Australians with this condition who are not diagnosed but who, if they had it diagnosed, could dramatically turn their lives around. A very good friend of mine recently told me that he was suffering a lot of terrible symptoms, of irritability and bloating and the like, and was diagnosed as a coeliac, and his life was turned around as a result of that diagnosis.


This is an important issue that must be dealt with. In terms of preventative health, it is important that the findings of the research serve as a wake-up call to the health sector for more people with this condition to be diagnosed. I urge this government and all my colleagues to make sure that there is appropriate research and education for people to be appropriately diagnosed if they have this condition which can be so well managed if diagnosed. The lack of diagnosis is a real issue, and I will do all I can to work with the coeliac society to increase the level of awareness of this disease.
