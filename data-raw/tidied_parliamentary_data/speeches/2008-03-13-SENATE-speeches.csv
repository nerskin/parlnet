"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-03-13,"—I will be brief. The Democrats will not oppose this. It would not greatly surprise Senator Ludwig that I want to take the opportunity to repeat my view that there should be a greater number of sitting days in general for the Senate this year, as there should have been in a number of years in the past. Extending the hours in the evenings is the inevitable consequence of not having enough time to properly consider legislation. I would also note with regard to this, and maybe even with regard to the usual arrangements for Thursday afternoons, the number of impassioned comments made in the House of Representatives about how terrible it is to have sittings without any sort of expectation that quorums would be called. I am sure there will be a full quorum of Liberal Party senators here throughout both of these evenings, given their new-found desire to have quorate chambers at all times.
I think the broader point needs to be made that, whilst there is a valid case being put, obviously it will be up to the discipline of the major parties and probably, as usual, opposition senators as to whether or not this will be sufficient time to get through the legislation that is desired to get through next week. None of us can know that, other than the opposition, basically. But I do think it needs to be re-emphasised that there is not a sufficient number of sitting days in general for the Senate this year. It is not a particularly good practice, I think, to have this sort of approach as a fall-back arrangement instead.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,1,1
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2008-03-13,"—It gives me great pleasure to address the Governor-General’s speech and the outlining in that speech of the legislative agenda for the first Rudd government. I think the way in which the Rudd government has approached this term and the challenges this country will be confronted with—and is confronted with at the present time—and the way in which it intends to deal with those challenges will ensure that we will see more than one speech by the Governor-General outlining the program for a Rudd Labor government.
One of the centrepieces of the address was the approach to industrial relations. What a welcome breath of fresh air it is to see a government that is committed to ensuring a framework is put in place that will restore fairness as a central point in our industrial relations system—fair to employers and, more importantly, fair to employees—and that will ensure that the old Australian idiom of the ‘fair go’ will be back as a centrepiece of our industrial relations system, getting rid of the pernicious laws that were introduced by the previous government and that tipped the scales squarely in favour of employers and provided the opportunity for unscrupulous employers in this country to attack workers’ wages and living standards.
Over the period of the operation of Work Choices we saw a litany of reports in the newspapers of various companies—Boeing was one, Tristar was another; there was a whole history of companies—where workers were exploited by the use of these laws that were put in place by the previous government. Hopefully, we will see the abolition of most of those laws by the end of this year and see in their place a new industrial relations system operating from 1 January 2010 that has at its heart fairness in the workplace. We hope that that system will run for some considerable time into the future before there is a need to revisit our industrial relations system for further amendments. The reason that that was a centre point of the Governor-General’s address was the way it operated in practice—the disadvantage it brought to many workers in many industries, which was the objective of that legislation all along.
Many other issues were touched upon in the Governor-General’s address in this chamber several weeks ago. The government’s approach to dealing with the economy was one. The problem that is besetting our economy at the moment is that inflation is gradually getting out of control. The previous government allowed a situation to develop in this country where the Reserve Bank is in fact increasing interest rates in order to try to keep inflation under control, while in the rest of the world the central banks in the major developed countries are in fact cutting interest rates to try to boost their economic activity.
That obviously is of major concern in terms of its impact upon living standards, the cost of living for many workers and the capacity of ordinary working families to pay their mortgages, to put sufficient food on the table and so on. We have known for a very long time that one of the most negative features of any economy, particularly for working people, is rising inflation, because that eats into their savings, the value of their wages and their capacity to look after their families—to feed them, clothe them and house them. As has been clearly stated by the Prime Minister and by the Treasurer, that is the No. 1 enemy that is the focus of the government at the moment, and a lot of effort is being put into bringing in a budget in May which will ensure that we get the inflation genie back under control.
The second issue is an issue that was debated in this chamber yesterday—that is, skill shortages. We saw the previous government virtually ignore over 11 years what was happening in terms of skill shortages in this country. It did nothing other than put in place some quick fixes, some bandaids over the system, by bringing in traineeships and cutting apprenticeships and training times—anything to boost the facade of the numbers of people who were in training but at the same time delivering no real jobs out of the process, no real tradespeople coming out at the end of the line and certainly nowhere near sufficient numbers to meet the skills needs of the economy.
The Rudd government, as spelt out in the Governor-General’s address, has made a commitment to reversing that trend, to dealing with the issue of the supply of skilled labour in our economy—not just in terms of meeting the immediate needs of the economy but also in terms of putting in place a structure which will meet the skill needs into the longer term. In other words, this is about being able to assess the changing role, the changing skills, that will be required in our economy over time and to ensure that the infrastructure and training is put in place to ensure that the people are there with those skills when the economy requires them. That will be the central role played by Skills Australia. It will also be its role to ensure that the infrastructure that exists in this country for training people, for providing skills, is utilised in the most effective way to deliver the outcomes that the economy needs. That will be central, over the short to medium term, to the capacity of this government to deliver economic outcomes that are in the best interests of ordinary working Australians. Unless we can provide those human resources, we will not be able to provide the economic outcomes—the productivity—and generate the activity in the economy that we otherwise would be able to or to provide and build upon the nation’s wealth. The more we create, of course, the more there is to share around. One thing about this government is that it will ensure that there is a better distribution of the wealth it has created in the economy than was the case over the past 11½ years under the Howard government.
The Rudd government has set an ambitious agenda for its three-year term, across a wide range of policy issues, and it certainly has been made very clear on every occasion by the Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, that he is determined to deliver on the commitments we made in the election campaign. So far, he has done it on every occasion. I do not think there was any prouder moment for a member of the Labor Party, a member of the Rudd government, than to be in this place as a member of that government when the government had the courage to say sorry to our Indigenous community, to try to commence the process of healing the divisions that have existed between our Indigenous community and the migrants in the country over many, many years and to put in place a framework so that we can live as an integrated community where everyone not only is looked upon as an equal but in fact is given equal treatment. We know from bitter experience that many of our Indigenous communities, particularly in remote areas of the country, are not treated as equals or treated equally when it comes to the distribution of resources—health resources, education resources and so forth. I look forward to seeing the improvement that comes out of the process that is now underway in dealing with those circumstances.
I think the next three years are going to be an exciting period in this parliament. I think it will be an exciting period politically for the nation, but, more importantly, it will be an exciting period for ordinary working Australian families, as they see their lives continuously improved by the policy decisions and approaches taken by the Rudd Labor government in its first term. As I said before, I think the Governor-General will be along here on many more occasions delivering his address on behalf of future Rudd Labor governments.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Governor-General's Speech,9,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-03-13,"—I commence by thanking my Liberal senator colleagues for allowing me to jump the queue as I have a later chamber duty which I cannot avoid. I take this opportunity in making my address-in-reply speech to follow on from the issue of the apology, which was raised by the Governor-General. I want to revisit the issue of apologies and compensation or redress for those referred to as the forgotten Australians. These are most of the 500,000-plus people who experienced institutional and other forms of out-of-home care in 20th century Australia. Now regarded as a conservative estimate, this number is made up of 7,000 to 10,000 child migrants, 30,000 to 50,000 Aboriginal stolen generations children and the 450,000-plus Australian-born non-Indigenous children raised in orphanages, children’s homes and foster care. Sadly, it is the case that, as vulnerable children, these people endured childhoods bereft of the nurturing and stability that family life can provide. It is also the case that many were subjected to ongoing humiliation and systematic abuse that was often criminal in nature. No matter what the race and no matter what the ethnic background of the child, their experiences were all too similar. Whatever the reason and whatever the rationale underlying government policies concerning the removal and so-called protection of children last century, the downfall has undoubtedly been in the execution of those policies.
The contemporary consequences of these past practices have been profound for the survivors of often traumatic childhoods and also for their subsequent generations. There have been three national inquiries that have produced four reports that attest to this reality. These are: the 1997 HREOC stolen generations report, Bringing them home; the 2001 Senate Community Affairs References Committee report on child migrants, Lost innocents: righting the record; and the two Senate community affairs committee reports on children raised in institutional and other forms of out-of-home care, the 2004 Forgotten Australians report and the 2005 Protecting vulnerable children: a national challenge report. All of these reports unanimously recommended that a national apology was required to acknowledge the hurt and distress suffered by many of these children and for the harm and loss of opportunity endured well into their adult lives.
During the last parliamentary sitting, Prime Minister Rudd delivered the long-awaited apology to the Indigenous stolen generations. It was indeed a fine and moving speech, a historic moment that I trust will be the beginning of a new way forward for Indigenous Australians. I am already on the record as welcoming this apology. However, in speaking to Senator Evans’s motion on it, I stressed the need for another national apology to be delivered to former child migrants and to those non-Indigenous Australian-born children raised in care, people who often refer to themselves as the white stolen generations. I also raised the issue of compensation or reparations as the next necessary step.
Just as the Bringing them home report recommended an apology so too did the child migrant and Forgotten Australians reports. Although I recognise the political dimensions to another apology of this nature following on so soon, quite simply it is just the right thing to do. I do acknowledge that the timing, content and presentation of that apology will matter greatly and consultation is necessary. It is the right thing to do because the race based past policy of removing Aboriginal children from their families has its counterpart in the race based child migrant schemes from Britain, Ireland and Malta last century. This history was also race based, as the policy was motivated by a desire to populate Australia with a potentially healthy and productive white workforce. The phrase ‘good British stock’ was actually used.
The evidence of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee is that most children arrived in Australia under the misguided idea that they were coming here for a holiday or an adventure. Most were not orphans, as commonly believed, and more often than not were shipped here without informed or actual parental permission. Not only did they lose the chance of maintaining family contacts; they also lost their country. Many had their names arbitrarily changed or were referred to by number.
While not race based, the removal of hundreds of thousands of Australian-born non-Indigenous children had its foundations in families doing it tough. Children were made wards of the state after being charged in the courts with being uncontrollable, neglected or in moral danger. Notice what I just said: ‘charged in the courts’. Children were charged as being neglected. It is just unimaginable today. It was not because they had done anything wrong but because they had been born into poverty, been born to a single mother who was often a teenager, been born into a home plagued with domestic violence or born to a parent who was unable to cope and the like. Some were indeed orphaned.
So many submissions to the Senate inquiries told of how their family lives had been terrible, but what they experienced in care—unfortunately, for so many of them but not, I should emphasise, for all of them—was far, far worse. There were children who were well cared for by caring people. One only has to read the submissions and Hansard evidence to gain a sense of the almost complete lack of a duty of care for far too many of these children. Not only did the state fail—and by that I mean broad state, federal and state governments—so too did the churches and other receiving agencies charged with providing care for vulnerable kids. The despicable crime of ongoing sexual assault was all too common. Rape, sodomy, oral sex and even bestial acts were all revealed in evidence to the Senate inquiries, as were systemic floggings and beatings with a variety of weapons for the most minor misbehaviours. All these acts amounted to criminal assaults punishable by law at the time. And that is the important point. These things that were done to the children were not lawful at the time and yet there was a conspiracy of silence between churches, health authorities, police and others which mostly kept these incidences under cover.
This appalling treatment of vulnerable kids has its match in prisoner of war camps. Places like Bindoon in Western Australia, Goodwood and The Pines in South Australia, Westbrook in Queensland, Box Hill and Bayswater in Victoria, and Parramatta and Hay in New South Wales were akin to concentration camps that incarcerated and brutalised far too many young people in 20th century Australia. Some beatings even resulted in physical impairments later in life. A former child migrant wrote:
Some of the scars of Keaney’s brutality still remain with me both physically and emotionally ... his actions would have warranted criminal charges had he not ... exerted influence over the law in Western Australia.
This man Keaney was a Christian Brother who publicly possessed considerable public relations skills that he put to good work in creating a mythology about himself. He became known as ‘the orphan’s friend’ and in 1953 was awarded an Order of Australia. Despite the best efforts of the committee and of members of the committee, regrettably that order is still standing, and I hope that the new government will make every effort to have it cancelled and removed. Every word read and uttered about Keaney during the child migrant inquiry revealed just what an evil monster he was. The committee report recommended his MBE be cancelled and annulled but the Howard government would not agree to this, nor have my and other people’s efforts since been successful. It is shameful that Keaney’s name continues to sully the list of deserved award recipients. I hope this government—and I direct my remarks to the attention of the Minister for Human Services, at the table—will address this matter.
Another former child migrant vividly recalled a vicious beating she received from a nun at Goodwood Orphanage. She wrote:
I felt the strap come down across my body. It was the most painful thing I had ever experienced. She continued flogging me, ranting and raving, until I could take no more ... She was like a woman gone insane, showing no mercy at all.
That was submission 68. A former state ward who spent time in the infamous Westbrook institution in Queensland wrote:
This man seemed to take great pleasure in humiliating us publicly, flogging us with his heavy leather belt while we knelt naked at his feet. You could receive anything up to 60 lashes and you always ended up bleeding profusely. Sometimes boys lost consciousness. They were the lucky ones.
That was in submission 141. By the way, these are children. A former Parramatta girl wrote in submission 280:
I had my hands held behind my back, hair held and my head bashed into a lot of sinks in the shower block and lost quite a few teeth.
I know that particular woman; she is a very fine Australian, but she bears the emotional and mental scars of that experience. I could go on and on because the evidence to the Senate inquiries was very extensive, but these typify the widespread physical assaults inflicted on powerless children. They literally lived in fear and terror. And I will repeat: these assaults were not distinguished by what sex or gender you were, they were not distinguished by what race you were or what your ethnicity was or what country you came from. These assaults were applied across the board: white, black, male, female, Maltese, British, Australian—it did not matter. If you were a kid, these particular kinds of horrors were visited on you. That is why I say to this government that an apology is due in the same form as was rightly given to the stolen generations.
Neglect and brutal treatment occurred in all states, in all institutions and in many foster care situations. Mostly the predators were staff members, including religious and lay workers. I will stress again that of course there were many staff members, many religious people and many lay workers who did care for the children as best as they were able. Not everybody was a monster. The covering up of crimes perpetrated on vulnerable children was widespread among the institutions, as was the lack of belief exhibited by adults and the various health, police and welfare authorities when children reported what was continually happening to them. The Senate inquiries were well exposed to evidence that the inspection and superversion regimes were very poor.
Even if kids in care were lucky enough to escape sexual and physical assaults, they still had to endure general neglect, inadequate clothing—rarely were shoes allowed—hunger, lack of education and the exploitation of them as slave labour, in either construction work for boys or laundry work for girls. The other day I drove down to Bindoon—it gives me the horrors; I cannot bear the place—and the stations of the cross are on the hillside. They were built by these children as slave labour. The woman with me at the time happened to be religious and she thought these stations of the cross were marvellous. Then I explained how they were built and what an abomination it was for them to be built by slave labour in the name of Jesus Christ, who, in himself, exhibited the finest characteristics. These were built by monstrous people who pretended that they were doing this in his name. It is just unbearable.
Some children were used for medical and drug experiments, which have been reported in medical journals. Some were unfortunate enough to end up being placed in mental homes or asylums for continual absconding or bad behaviour. Many of them, thousands of them, have since committed suicide. Add to all of this the complete lack of love and nurturing so important to a child’s development and it is no wonder many have been condemned to lifelong scars and troubles. As adults, they have endured lives tarnished by welfare dependency, substance abuse, mental and other health disorders, and relationship and parenting problems.
Moreover, so profound has been the loss of contact with siblings, with family and with place of origin that their sense of self and identity has been irreparably harmed. You are where you come from; you are who you belong to, and they have had that severed—as had the stolen generations. Although some have triumphed over their adversity and found their own healing, they still live with the memories of these tragic childhoods. And there are far too many who have not been so fortunate. I will stress, again and again, that there were many who were fortunate, who were better cared for in these homes than they would have been if they had been left at home. However, one care leaver wrote:
The cumulative effect of this experience is so pervasive that today I’m 52 years old and still a state ward.
That was submission 321. Here is another:
I can’t get some of the terrible things he did to me out of my head, they look in the shadows of my life and haunt me. [He] took my virginity, my innocence, my development, my potential …
That was from submission 239. And a 70-year-old survivor poignantly wrote:
A door opens in the memory bank and the ghosts escape to make us lonely children again.
Committee members and all those involved in these Senate inquiries know only too well that, if you hurt and break the spirit of a child, the result will be a harmed adult. Unfortunately, it is also the case that many survivors of childhood trauma do go on to produce another generation of victims because if you have been harmed as a child your expression of self is often damaged, and that comes out in relationships with your partners and with your children. In submission 267 a daughter of a care leaver wrote:
My Mum … spent years in psychiatric institutions due to the atrocious physical and mental abuse that herself and sister endured for many years at the cruel hands of the ‘so called carers’ at the Salvation Army children’s home.
If the measure of a society is the extent to which it protects and nurtures its children, then, historically, we as a nation have little to be complacent about. If the Prime Minister, if cabinet ministers, if all members of parliament took the time to read the submissions and reports of these three inquiries, I imagine there would be almost total support for the Prime Minister to apologise to all our citizens who suffered as children in care and who continue to carry these scars. Unfortunately, it is the case—we all lead busy lives—that most people have not read the reports or the submissions.
If they read those reports, I also imagine that there would be little resistance to the need for the Commonwealth to follow up an apology with the establishment of a national redress scheme. There would be widespread recognition that an apology is only the first step to righting the wrongs of the past. If we compensate victims of crime and trauma, so too should we compensate those who experienced childhoods of fear, neglect and criminal acts in the care of the state. The state allowed the harm to occur; the state should correct that harm. We should do so because the restitution of past harm through ex gratia payments is a measure of justice often denied these children through the civil and criminal courts and by resistant churches and agencies.
We should do so because of the utter failure of a duty of care by state welfare authorities, the churches and other receiving agencies charged with caring for these defenceless children. Accordingly, the monetary cost of a national redress scheme would need to be shared proportionally by various governments, churches and receiving agencies and it should be capped. Moneys would most likely be expended over a number of years, taking into account the application and decision-making process. It is an obscenity that one or two people who succeed in court can get millions of dollars when the ordinary people would be much better off with tens of thousands of dollars from a redress scheme.
Churches would certainly need to substantially contribute as far too many of their religious and lay workers were perpetrators of sexual and criminal assaults. Some have already been through the courts, while others have escaped prosecution either because they have died or because the lapse of time has presented evidentiary problems. In the United States a recent newspaper report indicated that the Catholic Church in 2007 alone paid out $665 million for child sexual assault cases, which was a 54 per cent increase on 2006. So this is not just an Australian problem but an international problem.
An apology to all those harmed in care last century is only the first symbolic step. Although powerful, it is not sufficient to provide the long-awaited justice due to these people. It is neither too hard nor unaffordable, as is evidenced by the international redress schemes in Canada and Ireland, and here in Australia in Tasmania, Queensland and Western Australia. I stress it is neither too hard nor unaffordable. New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia need to follow suit, as does the Commonwealth with a reparations fund that tops up the state schemes. Shared out proportionally we can afford these redress schemes.
Although redress was an important and unanimous recommendation of the Forgotten Australians report, the then Howard government would not agree to it, nor would it agree to most of the other 38 recommendations. Its poor response dispelled the widespread belief amongst all the forgotten Australians that justice and targeted services would be forthcoming once their government had been presented with the evidence of systemic failures in the duty of care to vulnerable children.
We can no longer deny the collective social record we now have of a less enlightened period of history and its effect down the generations. It is time to address once and for all these hurt childhoods and ruined adult lives through a national redress scheme.
The nation has been set on a path of healing by the Rudd government. More is yet to be done. The real test for a more empathetic Rudd government will be in what it does in a more meaningful way to overcome the national shame not only of the stolen generation but of all the shattered lives of all those who experienced harm when they were in state care as children.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Governor-General's Speech,9,1
"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2008-03-13,"—I welcome the opportunity to speak this morning. I noticed with interest in the Canberra Times yesterday an article by Andrew Fraser, the political correspondent. It was headed ‘Opposition “pinched” review of poll funding’. The article was referring to my motion yesterday in relation to campaign finance reform, political donation reform and a widespread examination by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. The article said:
Senator Ronaldson received the endorsement of yesterday’s joint Coalition parties’ meeting for a motion to refer the issue to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters.
It further quoted me as saying that it would be:
... the most comprehensive nationwide examination of campaign finance since Federation.
Then the article said:
However, the motion appears to almost replicate the wording of a reference given to the committee by Senator Faulkner more than a fortnight ago.
Then the article quotes Senator Faulkner:
“I’ve already done it,” Senator Faulkner said. “He pinched my words.”
So, according to Senator Faulkner in the article, he supported the wording of our motion because they were his words and he would agree with them.
When this matter came before the Senate yesterday, who supported the motion? The Liberal Party and the National Party as a coalition, Family First, the Australian Greens and the Democrats. Who did not support it? Who did not support the words that we had apparently ‘pinched’ from them for a reference to the committee? The Australian Labor Party did not support it. Not only did the Special Minister of State, whose words I had apparently pinched, vote against it, the Australian Labor Party voted against it. But rather than having the intestinal fortitude to call a division, they got their whip to stand up and under his breath say, ‘We just want it noted that we are opposed to this.’ How utterly pathetic.
The reality is that the Australian Labor Party did not support our motion. The motion that I suspect Senator Faulkner was talking about that he referred off to the committee on 27 February was the standard reference that someone in his position would give. I suspect that Senator Abetz has probably used words such as, ‘that an inquiry be conducted by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters to inquire into and report on all aspects of’—the 2007 election, in this case—‘and related matters.’ What the coalition’s motion did was not just give this committee that reference but demanded of them in a nine-point reference to put it all on the table.
Let us have the most comprehensive reform since Federation. Let us stop reacting to Wollongong. Let us stop reacting via press conferences to another disaster for the Australian Labor Party in New South Wales and the Wollongong City Council and the sex and donation scandal. Stop plucking little bits and pieces out and pretending that you are serious about campaign reform and finance reform. The Australian Labor Party voted against a comprehensive inquiry into this issue. So, despite all the platitudes of the Prime Minister, when push came to shove, when the pressure was put on them to see whether they were serious about it, they failed. This comes on the back of a Prime Minister who on 25 February said:
What I’d like to see ... is a general review of how we go about campaign finance. I am a big devotee of campaign finance reform.
So what did this big devotee do when he got the opportunity to do something about reform? He voted against it. He directed his Labor senators to vote against it. Some devotee!
Just out of interest I will pose a question. In his time in the Australian parliament how many times has this big devotee of reform talked about reform? Ten times? Five times? Once? Zero; not once has this big devotee of campaign finance reform mentioned one word about it. The first time he talked about it was when he was hit at a press conference with allegations in relation to the sex and political donations scandal at Wollongong City Council involving the New South Wales ALP. That was the first time this devotee of reform talked about it.
Let us get serious about this issue. The Prime Minister needs to come out today and say that he is prepared to sign up to that motion. It is good enough for the coalition. It is good enough for the Greens. It is good enough for Family First. It is good enough for the Democrats. What have the Australian Labor Party got to hide? Why won’t they have comprehensive reform? What are the Australian Labor Party frightened of? What are they trying to hide by refusing to take this reference? This was a perfect opportunity for the Australian Labor Party to show their bona fides on this matter.
We had the Special Minister of State misrepresenting the position because he clearly does not support my wording. Rather than me having pinched his words, the Special Minister of State is refusing to endorse my wording, the opposition’s wording, for this reference. He refuses to accept it, having said that I copied it. So what is it? Has he mistakenly said that he does not support it and that has been miscommunicated through to the Senate chamber or did he not mean that? The Canberra Times—and I hold nothing against it—were quoting his words that he did mean it. It is as simple as that.
If you respond on the basis of political crisis, you always get caught out. When you go in, as this Prime Minister has done, to support Premier Iemma in New South Wales in relation to the Australian Labor Party’s active apparent involvement in the Wollongong sex and donations scandal, when you back someone like that, you have to be prepared for the ramifications. And the ramifications are that, if you put little bits and pieces on the table, you have to be prepared to put the whole lot on the table, otherwise you will be accused of political opportunism, and indeed the Prime Minister has been opportunistic in relation to this matter. He has put out little bits when responding to New South Wales ALP problems. And then when asked to endorse comprehensive campaign finance reform, of which he is apparently a big devotee, he failed to do so.
If the Labor Party are not serious about this, as is clearly evident by their activities yesterday, why don’t they just say so? Why don’t they acknowledge that their Prime Minister, in defence of a New South Wales Labor mate, tossed a bit on the plate? Why doesn’t the Prime Minister say in reflection, ‘That’s probably not the right thing to do—we’re actually not serious about campaign finance reform, despite what I have said in the past’? With the ALP’s failure yesterday to support the motion that is exactly what the only situation can be. There are no two or three options in relation to this matter. It is quite clear: either you are a devotee and you do something about it or you pluck little bits and pieces out in response to questions at press conferences and then you vote against a motion that I would have thought any big devotee of campaign finance reform not only would have backed but might have even initiated. Well certainly he did not initiate it, so, having lost that opportunity, you would think that the second best course of action, the very least you would do, would be to back it.
—You’d think.
—You would think so, Senator Humphries. But rather than that, there was no initiative and no acceptance; there were just hollow, false words uttered by the Prime Minister. This is, I am afraid, just one example of the failure of the so-called openness and transparency that the Prime Minister took to the Australian people. I am prepared to accept that they took him at face value. They clearly did: he won; we lost. So they have obviously taken him at face value that he would be a Prime Minister running an open and transparent government.
Within a tad over 100 days we have seen no openness and no transparency. We have seen an attempt to hide and run from a motion calling on comprehensive reform of campaign finance and political donations. So much for the openness and transparency! Where has the much-lauded lobbyist register disappeared to? Where has the ministerial staff code of conduct disappeared to? Before Christmas there were bells, whistles, bands and dancing girls—you name it. There was the whole lot up and down the street with this example of openness and transparency. Someone rained on the parade, didn’t they? That was the Prime Minister, who is happy to go out and talk about these things at press conferences when confronted with some difficult questions, but, when push comes to shove, where is he? He is strangely silent in relation to all these matters.
Speaking of strangely silent, the Prime Minister has been strangely silent in relation to the question of union donations. He is happy to talk about overseas donations. He is happy to talk about caps and a couple of other matters he has pulled out in relation to campaign finance reform. There has been no mention of this. He had to be pushed at a press conference again. He said ‘yes’, but he could not bring himself to utter the words that the political donations of the union movement to the Australian Labor Party should be part of this reference. It will be part of this reference, but so will corporate donations, associated entity donations and third-party donations, because the coalition has made it quite clear that it wants a comprehensive review of where this issue is—not little bits and pieces plucked out to defend the Wollongong New South Wales ALP sex and donation scandal, but comprehensive reform.
I will finish my speech as I started. In this chamber yesterday, the coalition, the Democrats, Family First and the Greens voted to support reform. The government, the Australian Labor Party, refused to do so and, for that, they stand utterly condemned.

One of the centre-pieces of this Government’s election platform was the ‘education revolution’. It was a good piece of politics because it played to the electorate’s perceptions that Labor is stronger on education, it was a catchy phrase, and it made the Prime Minister and his team look more future-focused than the Coalition.
The big question that I had during the campaign, and it remains unanswered is – where is the policy to back up this catchy slogan?
An education revolution suggests something pretty transformational. It suggests that we are going to see a fundamental change in direction from the policy of the previous Government. And let’s face it, the higher education system in this country could certainly use that.
Under the Howard Government, Australia was the only country in the OECD to decrease investment in higher education – by 4 percent compared to an average increase of 49 percent.
The previous Government implemented voluntary student unionism legislation which further reduced university funding for campus services to the tune of $160 million per year.
They allowed universities to raise HECS-HELP fees and brought in full-fee degrees for domestic students – which have now reached mortgage-like proportions.
The effect of this shifting of university funding from public to private hands was predictable but not to be underestimated. We have students acquiring significant debt early in life and struggling to balance financial and study commitments.
Universities are facing an estimated $2 billion backlog of deferred maintenance.
Even without these funding pressures, universities face the challenges of an ageing domestic population and an increasingly competitive market for international students.
A genuinely revolutionary education policy would redress the significant funding shortfalls the sector faces, make a university degree less of a financial burden for students, and institute policies that position Australia to have a sustainable and competitive higher education system into the future.
So far, while moves such as the review of voluntary student unionism are welcome, I see no suggestion of anything so revolutionary from this Government.
Overseas Aid
The Governor-General referred to the ‘growing recognition that with coordinated international efforts, major progress can be made on reducing global poverty’ and restated the Government’s commitment to increasing the level of Australia’s overseas development assistance to 0.5 per cent of gross national income by 2015-16.
This increase in aid is welcome, though only relative to our currently parlous level of 0.3 per cent.
The new Government’s policy on overseas aid certainly represents a big step in the right direction. I like the idea of concentrating our aid efforts, and the proposed audit of the needs of our closest neighbours is a good starting point. It will provide a blueprint to allow a more comprehensive and effective aid effort in the future.
Labor’s proposed investment in aid, however, still contrasts with the 0.7 percent level that the UN has asked for in order to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, and to which Australia has previously agreed! Five OECD nations are already contributing at this level.
It is shameful that we have been through one of the longest periods of uninterrupted economic growth in our history and yet are still miserly with our development assistance.
While I welcome the Rudd Government’s commitment to increase that, I note that it is a second term commitment – should that occur – and is still well below the level at which Australia agreed in-principle to invest. Must try harder.
Science and Innovation
I congratulate my long-time Senate colleague, Senator Kim Carr, on being appointed Minister of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research and on his work in that role since the election.
He has sent a clear message that the politicisation of our science agencies will not continue and that they are free to report facts and findings as they see them. The Democrats have long called for this very move.
The Minister’s commitment to explain where his decisions on grant funding differ from the recommendations of the various advisory boards is also a welcome one.
I would much prefer to see this requirement stipulated in legislation – and I am somewhat suspicious of the Government’s reluctance to do so.
The National Innovation Review is one of the most significant exercises for innovation policy I have seen in my time in this place.
I share the Minister’s concern about the bewildering array of government programs that exist to support innovation in this country, and for the sake of administrative efficiency and business user-friendliness, I would like to see amalgamation and simplification.
I do have some concerns about the breadth of this review and hope that it will not become so cumbersome itself that it fails to generate any meaningful conclusions. I wonder whether a number of more specific and separate reviews would produce a better result?
Nevertheless, I will watch this process with interest and will have more to say on the review over the coming months. In the meantime, I wish the Minister and the Government well in this ambitious and useful exercise.
Housing & homelessness
The Governor-General made reference to the Government’s plan to address ‘challenges relating to housing affordability and homelessness’. After years of inattention from the previous Government, I am pleased to see that these areas have been made a priority.
I congratulate Tanya Plibersek on her appointment as Minister for Housing and welcome the Government’s commitment to a National Housing Strategy, working across all levels of government.
When Australia’s housing market ranks as the least affordable in the world, it is hardly surprising that people are being turned away from homeless shelters. I commend the Government on committing $150 million to address the drastic shortage in crisis accommodation that routinely sees people miss out on a bed in their most desperate time of need.
I will wait with great interest the outcome of the Government’s White Paper on Homelessness and I encourage the Government to make a commitment from the outset to implementing the paper’s recommendations to fix this blight on our prosperous nation. I have no doubt the paper will explore the complexities of homelessness, initiated by events such as unemployment, family and relationship breakdowns and complicated by mental health and addiction issues. Solving the problem will take courage and foresight from the Government.
Of course, one of the biggest contributors to homelessness is the soaring cost of Australian homes, which now rank as some of the least affordable in the western world. This crisis of affordability is having an impact across the socio-economic spectrum: Gen Y aspirants are struggling to piece together enough for a deposit, others struggle with soaring rent, while hundreds of thousands wait for a place in Australia’s dilapidated public housing stock.
While I am glad that housing has been placed squarely on the COAG roundtable, in a climate of fiscal restraint I fear that it will be an issue that will test the newfound spirit of cooperation between State and Federal Labor. I am also concerned that the Government’s cornerstone affordability measure–a low tax deposit savings scheme–will do nothing to improve affordability in real terms. Creating more tax breaks to arm buyers with extra capital won’t drive market prices down, nor will it create that elusive ‘downwards pressure on inflation’ to keep interest rates low.
If the Government is serious about addressing home affordability, it must examine the two huge elephants in the room – negative gearing and capital gains tax – that reward speculative and inflationary activity. Otherwise, there is a danger that Labor’s housing rhetoric will not become a reality.
National Security and Human Rights
Details of the Government’s agenda in relation to human rights and Australia’s domestic security regime were conspicuously absent from the Governor-General’s speech.
The previous Government enacted more than 40 pieces of security related anti-terror legislation, many of which have curtailed fundamental Human Rights and broadened the unsupervised powers of the AFP and ASIO. Many laws abrogated fundamental legal principles like natural justice, the presumption of innocence and the right to silence.
Labor was complicit in the creation of this rights-abrasive monolith, having voted with the Coalition to pass many of the draconian laws. It also voted down my motion to initiate a Senate inquiry into the nature and extent of the laws in the wake of the Dr Mohamed Haneef affair, a motion that will be re-introduced into the new Parliament.
So far, the new Government has promised a judicial inquiry into the Haneef affair – but we have seen little detail of the inquiry. Meanwhile, simultaneous inquiries are being conducted by the AFP in relation to Haneef, and the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security into the Ul-Haque debacle.
The inquiries are fragmented and incident specific. They will not consider the laws in their totality, nor how those laws interact with other draconian laws such as Ministerial discretion under the Migration Act. Moreover they will largely be conducted behind closed doors, with little opportunity for public input.
The Government also proposes to conduct a public consultation into the need for a Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities. Again, detail on this proposal is sketchy – the Government has released no information of the form of the consultation or the resources available to the process, and the Attorney-General has already ruled out a constitutional Bill of Rights and the enforceability of any Charter against individuals and Corporations.
This sounds like a recipe for a toothless tiger to me. It is one thing for the Government to make the right sounds on human rights, but quite another to get the policy right. I am particularly interested in how the Government proposes to reconcile some of the rights offensive policies which it has committed to – such as mandatory detention – in light of its ostensible commitment to human rights.
Work and family
I was encouraged by the Governor-General’s reference to the Government’s commitment to ‘measures that will relieve the pressure on working parents’, including a commitment to flexible parental leave and access to affordable and high quality child care.
These are just some of the many key supports needed for working families around Australia.
Raising the Child Care Tax Benefit from 30% to 50% to assist with the out of pocket expense of childcare is essential in ensuring that we have universal and affordable childcare across the board. Labor’s commitment to assist parents with the financial burden of childcare is commendable, and something for which the Democrats have long advocated.
While not explicitly outlined within the Governor-General’s address, I would like to briefly address Labor’s commitment to paid maternity leave.
The Democrats have been at the forefront of calls for the introduction of government-funded paid maternity leave. Last year, I re-introduced legislation that would provide for 14-weeks government funded leave at the minimum wage.
While it is pleasing to see that there will be some movement on this issue, with the Labor Party initiating a Productivity Commission inquiry into the feasibility of paid maternity leave, it is essential that this issue is not delayed any further.
We have already seen the issue of paid maternity leave subject to a comprehensive HREOC inquiry, as well as a Senate inquiry into my first Private Senator’s Bill for paid maternity leave back in 2002.
Considering Australia remains one of only two OECD countries without a scheme of paid maternity leave, and the fact that three quarters of Australians support it, the onus is now on the Labor Party to deliver on this vital area of support for working mothers, sooner rather than later.
I hope to see some real policy action from the Government before the end of my term, and will watch with interest deliberations of the Productivity Commission inquiry into paid maternity leave when they are released in February 2009.
River Murray and Water
The Governor-General referred to the Government’s resolve to tackle the water crisis, including in relation to the Murray-Darling Basin.
Unlike some of the Eastern seaboard States which have received heavy rainfalls of late, my home State of South Australia remains well and truly gripped by one of the worst droughts this nation has seen. While the rain has been a mixed blessing for some, resulting in dangerous floods and extensive property damage, it has also provided a vital top up to many water catchments, particularly in Queensland and NSW.
In South Australia – the last in a long line of Murray-Darling dependants – the consequences of the drought have never been clearer and there is real concern that the easing of drought conditions upstream will quell the impetus for serious and long term reform of the management of this vital water resource.
The Government’s resolve to tackle the water crisis remains to be tested, and Senator Wong will no doubt face a difficult challenge in balancing the national interest against that of her home State which – at the bottom of the Murray – is losing out.
While climate change is a priority for the federal Government, the water crisis has so far been largely overlooked. Water issues were given cursory attention at the December COAG despite almost a year having elapsed since the $10 billion plan to take over the Murray Darling river system was announced. The Rudd Government is yet to resolve Victoria’s concerns with the plan, which halted the deal last year, although I note that negotiations appear to be progressing.
Commonwealth control of the Murray-Darling river system was long overdue and while those of us who supported such control had concerns about the Howard Government’s proposed Murray takeover, these were outweighed by the need for urgent action to arrest the drought’s impact.
Mighty River Red Gums are dying; salinity has reached dangerously high levels; and irrigators and Riverland towns are struggling.
Action is needed on all fronts, such as reforming unsustainable practices; over-allocations; and consumer incentives to reduce domestic water consumption. Such options should be exhausted before expensive and energy intensive options like desalination are considered.
My constituents in South Australia are bravely doing their bit - installing rainwater tanks, grey water diverters, water-saving showerheads, or dual flush toilets – and in the meantime watching their gardens (and in some cases their livelihoods) wither away before their eyes.
I will be monitoring the new Government’s action on water reforms closely to ensure that their efforts are not in vain.
Conclusion
Already in the short time since this Government was elected, much has been made of ‘new ideas’, its ‘fresh approach to governing’ and the unique, cooperative opportunity presented by concurrent Labor Governments at both a Federal and State level.
While such optimism and plans are welcome, they must be tempered by the reality that this Government will be judged by its achievements rather than its agenda. I, for one, will be watching very closely to ensure that the rhetoric is matched by reality.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Governor-General's Speech,9,1
"Heffernan, Sen Bill",LP,2008-03-13,"—Mr Acting Deputy President Murray, before I go to what will be a bit of a wander because, as everyone knows, it is not often I get up in this place, I would first like to comment on your speech and the starkness of the reality of what happened to tens of thousands of children who were wards of the state or locked away in all sorts of institutions and boarding schools. I will not dwell on it, but I think that your speech should be circulated to every person in the parliament. I have discovered that, the more you know about human nature and the more you worry about human nature, the worse you feel. The more you know about Mother Nature and the more you worry about Mother Nature, the better you feel. One of the great disappointments in public life for me is that, if you have an inquiring mind, the more you know, the worse you feel about what you know.
I commend you on your speech. There is a lot of hard work that would need to be done. Obviously I have a very strong view, for instance, that priests ought to be able to get married. It is just stupid. They used to be able to get married and then, in the 1200s or so, the church decided they had better protect the estate of the church. I have to say it is so well documented—

Senator Conroy interjecting—

—Senator Conroy, as you know, priests wake up the same as we all do.
—Let’s not do this again!
—They are human. The world’s most precious and important vocation, in my view, is parenthood and the world’s most difficult vocation is the priesthood. I agree with what Senator Ronaldson had to say. I have a very simple mission statement in public life that I try to stick to. With all human endeavour, there are some human failings. I accept that. I try to stick to the fact that I do not like crooks—I usually use a much rougher word—and people who prey on kids, and I would like to think that I do not have a price. I have to say that you can solicit donations from people without being corrupted and influenced by the donations. As a former president of the Liberal Party I collected probably millions of dollars. I have to say that no-one really put it on me. If you do not have a price, it will not affect you. But for a lot of institutions—police et cetera—if they cannot pay the tucker bill, it is an easy way out if someone slips them an envelope of money.
The first time that I was offered a million dollar bribe was only two or three years ago. I rang up Alan Ramsey and said, ‘Ramsey, put this in your diary: I’ve just been offered a million dollar bribe.’ It was to do with the redevelopment of the Malabar rifle range. The bloke who came to see me—and this is the way they operate—just said in the conversation, ‘Senator, and there’s a million in this for you.’ I said to him, ‘Well, old mate, I’ve got a surprise for you: I actually do this job for nothing.’ I immediately rang the appropriate people and took out a bit of insurance by ringing Alan Ramsey and getting him to make a diary note. The bloke never came back, because he was obviously looking for someone he could utilise with a bit of money. You do run into these people. I had some people in my office only last year talking about issues surrounding the development of the Tralee subdivision here in Canberra. As a consequence—and without giving anything away—of those meetings, which were with people from all sides of the argument, I called the Australian Federal Police before one party left the office. You do not have to be affected if you do not have a price.
I have decided that it is much easier to move onto the greater concerns for all Australians in my time here. I do not think that you can deal with the human nature stuff appropriately if you are fair dinkum. Senator Murray, as with what you came up against, you can talk yourself blue in the face and nothing seems to happen. It is a bit like reintroducing pornography into Indigenous communities unless the Indigenous community votes that they do not want to have it. It is ridiculous. In 1999, I commissioned a woman who won the University Medal at the University of Sydney for her thesis on domestic violence in rural New South Wales to do a report on Indigenous child abuse in New South Wales. I can still remember that the people who were on the inquiry into the shutting down of ATSIC did not want me to table this report. No-one else had taken any notice of it. It was graphic. It eventually got tabled. But nobody wants to take firsthand possession of the problem because they do not want to own it.
Up in my office, I have a new secretary. I have had some pretty wonderful calls come into my office, but yesterday a male prostitute rang me because he was about to commit suicide. These things get you down, I have to tell you. The reason that his life has become dysfunctional is that he was seriously abused by a well-known serial abuser at Trinity College in Sydney. I noticed the other day that they have locked up another Marist brother in Sydney and that they are about to lock one up here in Canberra. I get too bloody angry to talk about it.
What I would like to move on to is Mother Nature. All Australians ought to give consideration to the fact that with the way we are headed we have seen the best of the planet. Poor old Mother Earth is taking a hiding if you believe the scientists of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change—the 2,500 eminent scientists. They tell us that in 50 years time 50 per cent of the world’s population will be short of water and there will be about a billion people unable to feed themselves. This is on the assumption that the population increases from 6.5 billion to nine billion in that time. Bear in mind that most of the research and modelling that is going on at the moment is on the energy requirement behind that development rather than on the food task to feed them to get to that point. A lot more work needs to be done on the food as well as the energy.
A billion people will be unable to feed themselves. At the present time on the planet, there are about 800 million people who are short of food and there are a billion people who gorge themselves and are obese for whatever reason. There were no fat prisoners of war, by the way, so you do not have to be obese if you do not stick it down your neck—unless you have a medical condition. The scientists tell us that in 50 years—and we are getting there—30 per cent of the productive land of Asia, where two-thirds of the world’s population lives, will go out of production. They tell us that the food task will double and they tell us—and listen carefully to this—that 1.6 billion people on this planet will be displaced.
When Mick Keelty said a few months ago that the greatest threat to Australia’s sovereignty is climate change, he was right on the money. Fortunately for Australia, we are in a position where we are going to be able to handle this, in my view. But a lot of the planet is not going to be able to. The scientists have estimated that somewhere between 200 million and 300 million people in the central part of Africa will be displaced. Because of the irreversible mining of the great northern aquifer in China, something over 400 million people will be displaced. Places like Bangladesh not only will be subject to the mining of the groundwater which ends up in their rivers—their freshwater is being mined by places like India, who are in full denial—but will also succumb to the rising sea.
China, to its credit, recognises that it has this serious water problem and is undertaking great engineering works to try and overcome it by moving water to where they have depleted their ground reservoirs. One of the things that they have underway in an engineering sense—and they say that you can fix anything with engineering if you have enough money—is the building of a water pipeline that will be 1,200 kilometres of 36 or 37 pipes laid side by side that are each 4½ metres deep. It just goes to show that you can do it if you have enough dough.
I think we all ought recognise that there are lots of problems on the planet. But if the scientists are only 50 per cent right and we have only 800 million people who are displaced or if the scientists are only 10 per cent right and we have only 16 million people displaced, the United Nations will not fix the problem. The United Nations, with great respect Mr Acting Deputy President, or some parts of it, has become a massive lot of immeasurable, unaccountable blubber with all sorts of subcultures. I was pleased to see that they arrested some child predators in Timor-Leste. That is all part of the subculture of that set-up.
Australia, the scientists tell us—we are coming to the good news—is going to lose somewhere between 25 and 50 per cent of run-off in the southern parts of the continent. I am fearful. I declare an interest: I am a farmer. There is a gloomy dry winter forecast for lots of southern Australia at the present time, yet the northern parts and northern New South Wales are having a wonderful season, thank God, so there are some options there. Scientists are saying that somewhere between 3,500 and 11,000 gigalitres might disappear out of the run-off from the Murray-Darling Basin. The Murray-Darling Basin has 6.2 per cent of Australia’s run-off, 23,000 gigalitres, and we have about 70 per cent of the productive irrigated water work in that area. I stood up in this place a few years ago and said that any 50-year plan for the Murray-Darling Basin would exclude furrow cotton and paddy rice. Poor old Sharman Stone, Kay Hull and everyone rang me up and abused me and said, ‘What are you doing?’ It is true—they will be opportunity crops but it will be a question of how often the opportunity is going to come along and whether you can maintain the infrastructure in the meantime. I will not get into too much of the technical side because I do not have enough time.
If that is true, we are going to have to reconfigure not only the way we have settled rural and regional Australia but the way we do our business in rural and regional Australia. I have argued this for many years. In my maiden speech here in 1996 I argued that we should develop the north—that we should commit ourselves to doing the science through a task force on the development of the north. I urge and commend the government to get on with it—I am sure Penny Wong will. Uniquely, if we can maintain our sovereignty, as Mick Keelty said, against the background of the earlier figures of displacement, and occupy and manage the north, Australia will still be a world-leading contributor, punching well above its weight in the export of food and other materials, and maintaining our standard of living.
Bear in mind that in the three main catchments of the north, the Timor Sea catchment has 78,000 gigalitres of run-off, the gulf catchment has 98,000 gigalitres of run-off and the north-east catchment in Queensland has 85,000 gigalitres of run-off, against 23,000 gigalitres in the Murray-Darling Basin, where we all seem to want to do business. If we do not do something about that, in 50 years time Australia will be like the rest of the planet—in serious trouble.
Peter Beattie made a serious error, which the Australian Conservation Foundation agrees with, in the wild rivers legislation where Queensland has locked up the first kilometre from productive land in a great many of the gulf rivers. The gulf has 17 million hectares, which is bigger than Victoria, and very little development. During the last federal election campaign—I thought it was a great exercise of democracy that the government changed without anyone getting too excited and we all went back to work and we are still here today doing business and smiling at each other, unlike a lot of the rest of the world—Mick Keelty set this out. You may recall the 18 fishermen and their families on whose fishing zone we imposed our sovereignty. They decided to come to Australia because we mucked up their business enterprise and we sent them to Christmas Island. I cannot imagine what will happen if the science is right and there are, at the top of the prediction, 1.6 billion people who have to be resettled. I am sure there will be a new set of world orders because people in survival mode will make their own rules.
It is interesting that Australia has the privilege of democracy and our system of government. Bear in mind that, as far as I can see, in this parliament there is not one person in the government who lives or has made a living in the bush—commercially that is. They might have a holiday shack or something. Gavin O’Connor obviously did. I am pleased to see that Tony Burke has been appointed as the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, in which I take a deep interest, because he has a good brain and has been a good listener. We have a lot of work to do.
The wool industry is in a hell of a mess at the present time—it is dysfunctional. The thing we need to do on behalf of Australia’s wool growers is let the world know that Australia’s farmers are its greatest environmentalists. Landcare did a wonderful thing for Australian farmers: it taught us what was happening with our land. We are about survival, so we have to look after the land. We are only the custodians. Also, we care for our stock. We are not into animal cruelty, as some of the lunatics you see on the television would have you believe. Most of them would not know where the sun comes up. Most of them plait their armpits and smoke pot. Mulesing is a very necessary thing at the present time because we do not have other technology. As Ian McLachlan and others have said, they are working on it.
In the meantime, Australia could lead the world because we now have technology for pain relief. We could apply pain relief mandatorily for mulesing, castration and tail docking. I think we should move to that as part of an interim measure of genetic fix or technological fix for what is part of the great Australian bush—that is, fly waves and flyblown sheep. Flyblown sheep is a pretty serious problem. There is a bit of pain inflicted. I have mulesed thousands of sheep. It takes about 15 seconds to knock the top off and, if your teeth are good enough, tear the nuts out, trim around the tail, cut the tail off with the shears and then, if you put on pain relief, away they go.
The alternative to that is a very maggoty, destructive fly wave. So there needs to be some common sense brought to that debate. There needs to be unity in the debate. I think that, because we have been reactive rather than proactive, the wool industry and the government should give consideration to setting up some sort of committee to address the urgency which sits above all the politics and squabbling that is going on.
There are a couple of other issues. I think it is stupid that the Liberal Party and the Nationals have not merged. I was pleased to see Doug Anthony, Ian Sinclair and Peter Nixon in the paper today saying again what they and I said years ago. There are natural constituencies; the Labor Party’s are generally urban and a lot of ours are rural and regional. You cannot compartmentalise constituencies with modern communication and transport. We should recognise that the city needs to understand bush issues and problems as well as the bush needing to understand the city. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Governor-General's Speech,9,1
"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2008-03-13,"—I am pleased to rise today to speak in the Senate in response to the Governor-General’s address at the opening of the 42nd Parliament. On 24 November 2007, the Australian people voted for a change of government. They voted out the Howard government to embrace the fresh ideas of Kevin Rudd and the Australian Labor Party. The Liberal government and their Work Choices legislation undoubtedly contributed to the election result. There is no denying that the Work Choices legislation was an attack on Australian working families, and that is the view that the Australian community took when they cast their vote. I can certainly testify that that was very evident throughout my home state of Tasmania.
The legislation meant that parents spent less time with their children and that Australian workers and working families had no financial security. Workers were forced to work more hours just to put food on the table and to try to pay their bills. With spiralling petrol, childcare, housing and grocery costs, the cost of living was getting out of control. Yet our previous Prime Minister, John Howard, insisted, ‘Australian families have never been better off.’ In saying this, he demonstrated just how out of touch and arrogant his government was. Interestingly, his views have not changed in recent speeches he has been giving overseas. I am still unsure as to where the coalition actually now stand—some agree and some do not—but the reality is that they have not listened to the Australian community and their views have ultimately not changed. The previous government were irresponsible and Australians expressed their disappointment in the Liberal Party loud and clear on 24 November 2007.
Under John Howard’s Work Choices laws, workers could be put on AWAs with just five minimum conditions. There was more power for employers to dictate working hours and workers had to negotiate conditions like overtime pay, penalty rates, public holidays and annual leave entitlements. John Howard promised that his industrial relations system would be simple, fair and flexible. It was not. It caused mass confusion for workers and employers alike. John Howard promised in television ads, newspapers and booklets which cost the Australian taxpayers millions of dollars that overtime and penalty rates would be protected by law. Once again, that was not the case.
On the point of Work Choices advertising, Ms Julia Gillard, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations—
—And Deputy Prime Minister.
—And Deputy Prime Minister. She is a woman, so she has many jobs! She revealed on 19 February this year that almost 100,000 Work Choices computer mouse pads together with more than 436,000 Work Choices booklets were stashed away by the previous Liberal government prior to the last election. It was good to see they had their priorities right! Australian taxpayers have been forking out $930 per month to store this Liberal government’s Work Choices propaganda. This was part of the propaganda Australian taxpayers had already forked out $121 million for, thanks to the previous Liberal government. And they lecture us about economics and financial management! My constituents in Tasmania were not very pleased to hear that their taxes were being used in this irresponsible way. The Liberal Party’s motto was: spend, spend, spend whatever it takes, as long as we win.
I am pleased to note on this occasion, though, that Ms Julie Bishop, the shadow minister for employment, business and workplace relations, issued a media statement on 7 February this year saying that people should have the right to union representation in their employment negotiations. Unions under Work Choices have in some circumstances been unable to talk directly to their members in the workplace, which is something that I consider important in allowing unions to fulfil their role as representatives of workers. Ultimately, the Howard government exploited Australian workers. I do not think there is any dispute about that. They knew that the Work Choices legislation would have a devastating effect on Australian families, but they pushed the legislation through regardless. I might just add that Senator Barnett, from my home state, who has recently been lecturing us and espousing his views about us needing to be a caring government, was one of those people who sat in this chamber and participated in pushing that legislation through.
The previous government tried to fool Australians by changing the name of their workplace relations reforms. But the Australian people did not fall for this ploy. They knew what John Howard was about and they voted accordingly. The Liberals filled our letterboxes with glossy brochures, trying to convince us that Work Choices was a good thing. But, once again, Australians were not fooled. Never take the Australian workers for granted. Do not believe your own rhetoric is my message to the opposition now. Australians realised that they were not getting a fair deal, and I hope that those on the other side of the chamber now recognise that they must indeed listen to the people they represent. But, to date, the evidence is that they are still not listening and that they are still not prepared to admit that they were wrong.
Despite desperate attacks from the Howard government since the Work Choices legislation was introduced, Labor has always maintained its belief that this country should have a fairer, simpler and more balanced workplace relations system. The Rudd Labor government is committed to restoring balance in the workplace. Labor recognises that Australians are hard workers. Australians have worked hard to ensure the prosperity of our nation and to ensure their children have a better standard of living than they had. All workers ask for is fair treatment—a fair day’s pay for a fair day’s work. But under the Howard government this right was denied. Australians have always held a strong belief in the importance of fairness at work and they know that only a Labor government will stand up for their rights in the workplace. The Rudd government is committed to building a modern workplace relations system that balances flexibility for employers with fairness for employees. A flexible and a fair workplace relations system is critical to building a competitive economy that delivers for Australian workers.
The government’s plan for the future of Australia’s workplace relations system will encourage wages and conditions to be negotiated at the enterprise level. We believe all Australian employees are entitled to a safety net of 10 national employment standards. We believe employees earning less than $100,000 are also entitled to an extra safety net provided by modern, simple awards. The Office of the Employment Advocate, now known as the Workplace Authority, conducted a survey which showed the following results with respect to Work Choices legislation. It was found that leave loadings were removed from 64 per cent of AWAs, penalty rates were removed from 63 per cent of AWAs, shift loadings were removed from 52 per cent, and in 16 per cent of all cases all award conditions were removed. These shocking statistics show just how unfair and unjust the Howard government’s legislation was. I believe Australians do not have to choose between economic prosperity and fair treatment at work. Australians can have both. Australian workers deserve both. Australians deserve to have the best system, the fairest system, that will protect their rights at work and also ensure that their families are able to balance their work and home lives. Labor’s industrial relations policy, Forward with Fairness, ensures that this happens
In April last year, the ALP published the Forward with Fairness workplace relations policy and confirmed that, if elected, we would abolish Australian workplace agreements. In August last year we released our Forward with Fairness policy implementation plan, which reiterated Labor’s commitment to abolish Australian workplace agreements. It also set out sensible transitional arrangements a Rudd Labor government would adopt for implementing this key commitment. This policy makes it clear that, when Labor’s workplace relations system is fully operational, there will be no AWAs.
The Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008 begins the process of phasing out the Howard-Costello government’s extreme and unfair Work Choices law in favour of a fairer, more productive and flexible workplace relations system. It has been developed following extensive consultation with employer organisations, unions and state and territory ministers. The government understands that to create a simple, fair, flexible and productive workplace relations system, we must talk with employers, employees and those who will play a role in our new workplace relations system.
The Rudd Labor government will create a new industrial relations system for a modern Australian economy and modern Australian workplaces. Labor’s system will be a simple one: we will work with the states for a single, uniform national system for the private sector and economic reform the Howard government was never able to achieve. We will reduce the rules and regulations about what can be included in the agreements so that employers and employees will be able to talk and bargain about what suits them. And we will have a new accessible, impartial, independent umpire, Fair Work Australia, which offers a simple, one-stop shop service.
Labor’s system will be a fairer system. Labor is committed to ensuring that the minimum wage is set by Fair Work Australia in an open and transparent process that considers the needs of Australian working families, particularly the low paid, and the needs of the Australian economy. We will also have a clear and decent safety net of legislated conditions and industry awards so that employers and employees can easily understand their rights and obligations at work. The Labor government, unlike the previous government, recognises the needs of both employers and businesses and is committed to striking the right balance. This was something the former Liberal government showed no interest in. The former Liberal government were only concerned about catering for the needs of big business at the expense of Australian workers and their families.
The people opposite me in the chamber supported and voted for John Howard’s unfair legislation. They argued for more than 12 months that Work Choices was fair, even though they knew it was having a devastating effect on Australian workers. I am pleased to say on this occasion that the former industrial relations minister, Joe Hockey, now admits the laws went too deep. In fact, recently on the television program Four Corners Mr Hockey confirmed what we all knew on this side, and that is that his own cabinet colleagues were unaware of the actual impact that these conditions were going to have on Australian families. Can you believe that? Members of the cabinet at that time were unaware of one of the most devastating pieces of legislation that has come through this chamber.
—They weren’t unaware; they didn’t care.
 (Senator Murray)—Order! Minister, you are being disruptive.
—I take Senator Conroy’s point. The reality is that they did not care, and that is very evident here today with some of the contributions during this debate and the confusion still within the coalition as to whether or not they should keep Work Choices. The distress these laws caused working families will never be forgotten. There is a lesson from history we can learn. The same thing happened in 1929 when that government attacked Australian workers. At that time they voted out the Prime Minister and his government. On 24 November 2007 the people did the right thing by getting rid of John Howard and his government.
I fully support the comments of Ms Gillard, the Deputy Prime Minister, in her second reading speech on the Forward with Fairness bill in which she stated:
It is now time for members in this place to respect and represent the clear message from the Australian people. No more Work Choices, no more Australian workplace agreements, no more unfairness, complexity and confusion.
She went on to say:
If the opposition uses its numbers in the Senate to unduly delay or reject this bill then that would be a deliberate choice by the Liberal Party to keep Work Choices alive. That would be a deliberate decision by the Liberal Party to treat the Australian people with contempt.
Minister Gillard and the Australian Labor Party understand the needs of working families. We understand that Australians need employment security. During 2008, the government will be consulting with employers, employees, businesses, unions and industry about its plans for a new workplace relations system.
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd’s new workplace relations system will be fully operational by January 2010. It will be underpinned by a modern and fair set of minimum conditions. The new arrangements will foster the creation of a more highly skilled workforce, job growth and a better balance between work and family life. I commend these measures to the Senate and hope we can achieve some positive outcomes out of the mess that was created by the previous government.
I would like to place on record some of the other issues that I would have liked to cover in my address today, including the skill shortages and the economic difficulties we now face with inflation because of the legacy of 12 years of the Howard government. I would also like to say what a turning point it was and how proud I was to stand here as an Australian when the Prime Minister apologised on behalf of the country to the Indigenous members of our community. I, too, would like to join with others in hoping that this will strengthen the relationship and bring us closer together. There are so many other issues I would have liked to cover today, but I will leave it there.
Debate (on motion by Senator Conroy) adjourned.
Ordered that the resumption of the debate be made an order of the day for a later hour.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Governor-General's Speech,9,1
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2008-03-13,"—I rise today to give my address-in-reply to the speech by Governor-General Michael Jeffery AC, CVO, MC and to bring up a couple of issues that I think we can go further with. I think health issues in Australia, especially in regional areas, can be addressed in a more dynamic manner than how we are currently dealing with them. We still have cases in Australia where towns such as Cunnamulla, Thargaminda and even Pittsworth, near Toowoomba, are without a doctor. It is not a case of having the right standard of medical care; there is no doctor in the town. We should have the capacity to be more dynamic in our thinking about how we can fill these gaps. We have obviously had some major problems in Queensland with the Dr Patel issue. This is a case of not doing our homework prior to Dr Patel turning up and it is also a cover-up by the people who vouched for his credentials. Those credentials were not apparent. In fact, he had an extremely chequered history.
Be that as it may, we should make sure that those problems are dealt with—and I implore the state Labor government in Queensland to be more effective in its role of government and to cover those issues. However, we must not close our eyes to the fact that a lot of our problems, especially in regional areas, can be fixed with doctors from overseas. We should be more streamlined and more proactive in how we source these doctors.
I have been lucky enough to have delegations come to me from Brazil, where there are approximately 350,000 doctors—they say an oversupply. A lot of them are from extremely competent universities recognised internationally, recognised by the Royal College of Physicians, and they would quite happily take the opportunity to move to Australia but, unfortunately, this process is stymied. We must have the capacity to attract workers from countries such as Brazil—there is a good experience with Brazilian workers coming in on 457 visas, especially for such things as meatworks; they fit into the community and work well and everybody is happy—and to use those countries as a source of other professions, especially doctors and dentists. There should be a proactive move to encourage those who wish to move to Australia, to fix our problems when they have an abundance and we are lacking. If they are willing to come and to try to effect that process then this is something that could become a constructive policy of a government. It could bring a result in areas where currently communities, especially some of the Indigenous communities in the west of my state and also communities in general, are lacking dentists and doctors.
If we cannot fill positions with doctors, if we have an inability or if people are unwilling, we are going to have to look at the role extension of nurses. There will have to be a recognition that it is no good to say, ‘A nurse is not as good as a doctor,’ if you cannot get a doctor to turn up at all. This area of policy has to be addressed by the government in the coming term. They cannot just discuss the problem; they must come up with concrete solutions and I have laid one on the table.
With respect to the Governor-General’s reference to economics, I have serious concerns about the capacity of the current government to ardently deal with the issue of a US recession. I have been scrolling through the results produced by a search engine to find any statements by the current Treasurer as to how he intends to deal with the fact that the US, from Mr Greenspan on, has foreshadowed a recession and is now moving into a recession. We in Australia, whether or not we like it, cannot believe in the myth of decoupling. We will be, unfortunately, part of that process.
It is a cyclical thing and the previous government, especially with Peter Costello, did an exceptional job of riding the wave of prosperity in its best possible form to leave our nation in the strongest possible position. To suggest otherwise is a myth. But now the world is turning and we will need the current Treasurer to be competent in his management of what will be a precarious position. It is no good for him to continually point his finger over his shoulder and say, ‘This is nothing to do with me.’ He is now the Treasurer; therefore he has to deal with it.
One of the most dire things that we are looking at at the moment is that oil has now gone through the $110 a barrel mark with an exchange rate of 90c. If we have a recession and a loss of desire by the Americans to purchase Chinese products and therefore a loss of the Chinese desire, to the extent that it is currently there, to consume Australian resources and we have the devaluation of the Australian dollar, we are going to have an absolute economic catastrophe in the suburbs of our major capitals. The price of fuel will go through the roof. Rather than being a Jonah or a harbinger of dire times I have spoken about this a number of times. We have to come up with an alternative policy to deal with the issues that have come about because of our total reliance on an oil based fuel for the internal combustion engine.
Families will not be able to afford fuel at $3 a litre and that is where it will be heading. It will not be possible to get a 60-litre tank filled for $180 and just take it out of the budget every week. That effect will go right to the sense, style and quality of life of so many working families, especially in our suburbs. It will make the economics of transport and the economics of people in regional areas immensely difficult. This cost overlay will filter into every section of our economy. On this issue, which is coming to our horizon, we have not seen one policy by the Treasurer or the current government as to how they are going to manage it. How high do we need the price of fuel to go before it becomes a requirement of the government to start dealing with the issue? It is the No. 1 consumer item of concern today. The Australian people rightly have an inherent fear of how they are going to manage this increase in fuel prices.
I do not know whether it is a panacea but we have always put on the table biofuel, not because of any particular reason but at least as a move towards a solution. I do not for one moment say it is a solution to everything, but at least it is a step in a suite of possibilities that we need to take on board if we are going to maintain the quality of life as expected now by people who see a motor vehicle as part of the expression of their economic freedom.
Climate change is another issue. I refer also to one of the issues that Senator Heffernan brought up. We have to be more proactive in how we develop new areas of this nation to produce food for the nation if you truly believe climate change is what is occurring. You cannot have it both ways. You cannot say: ‘You’re a sceptic; you don’t believe in climate change. However, we’re not going to propose any concrete and definitive plan for how to deal with it, especially in how we feed ourselves.’ If climate change is happening—and I believe that climate changes all the time; it is obviously changing—then where is our plan for the development of the north? Why does this get compartmentalised as an issue that is not of concern? We cannot go on with a total reliance on the Murray-Darling Basin scheme if the capacity for it to produce food is diminished. We must find the next step. It must be in the development of the north and it is going to require changes to federal policy and to state government policy, especially tree-clearing guidelines, wild rivers legislation and these things that really we have to have another look at if we are serious about this problem.
A final issue that I want to briefly touch on is the concern I have when people start talking about reforming the federation. For me, reforming the federation is a key to centralisation. I have a concern that what we are seeing now with the current government is that it will be operated out of one office and that is Mr Rudd’s. It will be a government which will be completely centralist and socialist in its application of how it deals with the Australian people. It will be a government that does not espouse any adherence to the belief, to the idea, that people in certain parts of the nation have a different outlook on life. We are starting to see it already. There is a move towards the centralising of the bureaucracy, the centralising of control. It is manifestly growing and it will grow in the same form as the way Mr Rudd operated when he was in Queensland. It is about to be levelled at us here.
That is especially pertinent in this chamber because as senators it is incumbent upon us to make sure that we keep the aspect of decentralisation—that protection of a second chamber and that protection of the review and amendment of decisions. We need to make sure that the parliamentary process, which is always the best mechanism of democracy and freedom for a nation, remains sacrosanct. I implore all senators to remember that when they came to this chamber they swore an oath of office that they would uphold the Constitution. To my Labor colleagues I say that that will mean that at times you have to have the capacity and the desire to challenge even your own government.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Governor-General's Speech,11,1
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2008-03-13,"—It is my pleasure to rise to speak on the address-in-reply to the Governor-General and to do so at this first occasion for many years on which we have seen a change in government in Australia. With that I think it is important to look at the type of country the new government has inherited, the type of country the previous government left and indeed the changes that the previous government made over that time as well as the challenges that we face into the future. I believe quite strongly that the previous government, led by John Howard and Peter Costello for the last 11½ years, left a much better country than the one which it inherited back in 1996. It left a country where people enjoy the aspirations of life and confidence in the future and where, I believe, young people look forward to having jobs and opportunity both here in Australia and around the world in a far more outward-looking sense than was the case in 1996 when the Howard government came to office fresh on the back of economic recession and troubled times.
One need only look at the statistics and influences over that time to see the strength of the Australian nation that the new government has been fortunate enough to inherit. We can look at the economic growth of the nation over the last 11½ years, averaging some 3.6 per cent per annum. There was extremely strong growth throughout that period of time—extremely strong growth for an already developed country—averaging some one per cent above the OECD average during that period. It is a record of which the former government should be proud. Economic growth in and of itself is not the end you desire; what it drives though are factors such as employment. We see the government enjoying the fact that when it came to office there were 10½ million Australians enjoying jobs and the opportunities of employment in Australia. There was growth of some 2.2 million jobs over the preceding 11½ years, which is an outstanding record, ensuring that Australians of all ages and backgrounds have the opportunity of those jobs, some 60 per cent of which were full-time employment opportunities.
Commensurate with the growth in employment comes the fall in unemployment. The government is indeed very fortunate to have inherited an unemployment rate of some 4½ per cent. That is nearly half of the rate that the Labor Party left the previous government in 1996. We saw a near halving of unemployment during those 11½ years. Nothing is more important to Australians and Australian working families, as the government is fond of recalling, than the opportunity to have a job and an income to put food on the table. We have, of course, declining unemployment. This is not declining for the wrong reasons; it is declining for the right reasons, because the labour market during this time was also growing. In November last year the participation rate stood at 65.3 per cent. It was nearly two per cent up over the life of the previous government and at a near record high for the participation rate in Australia. So we have more Australians in the labour market and more of those people in the market in jobs than ever before.
With a very strong track record of strong real wages growth, people are also earning more money than ever before. There was a 2½ per cent growth in real wages over the 11½ years of the Howard-Costello government compared with a 1.8 per cent reduction in real wages under the previous Hawke-Keating government. On top of all this economic growth, jobs and opportunity, the government has been fortunate to inherit a debt-free government. The Howard-Costello years saw the elimination of some $96 billion in government debt, saving on average $8.6 billion in interest payments, and investment in the Future Fund and the Communications Fund, which the new government has already set about raiding and destroying. Investments from those savings in debt repayments and interest repayments were made in hospitals and schools, with more than $20 billion extra going to our hospitals and schools in real terms than at the election of the Howard-Costello government. We saw very strong tax cuts—the reductions in rates, reductions in thresholds and reductions in company tax, as well as income tax cuts. The largest ever were delivered in 2000 and there were further cuts in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007; and, of course, cuts are forecast again for 2008. There is the promise of more tax cuts to come, built on the strong fiscal budget management of the previous government.
These are a great set of circumstances for any new incoming government. We have long called Australia the lucky country; well, the Rudd government are far and away the lucky government, because they have inherited a growing economy, Australians in jobs and a debt-free government. They have inherited a wealth of opportunity to be able to build an even better country off the back of the work done in the Howard-Costello years. Economic management always has its challenges. Peter Costello as Treasurer used to speak of us having good problems and bad problems. Paul Keating had a lot of bad problems to deal with. His bad problems were high unemployment, low economic growth, a recession and staggeringly high interest rates. Those are bad problems. This government has been left with good problems, the good problems caused by a strongly growing economy. Yes, that means there are some capacity constraints in the economy. Yes, it means there are some mild inflationary pressures. But remember that those inflationary pressures are nothing compared with those of the past. Again, the Howard-Costello years saw inflation averaging just 2½ per cent, well less than the 5.6 per cent it had averaged under the Hawke-Keating years. Interest rates, similarly, were 7.26 per cent on average, compared with 12.75 per cent previously. These are good problems to have when the sole economic challenge you have is the fact that the economy is running so strongly that you need to slightly manage issues of inflation.
So it is with this great set of circumstances that the very lucky Rudd government has its work cut out for it in living up to and improving upon the economic conditions that Australians enjoyed and that were left to it. They need to improve on those to demonstrate to Australians that they are worthy of sitting on the government benches. They need to continue to grow jobs, push down unemployment and ensure that Australians enjoy the types of economic growth and opportunities that they have come to expect. But the government has many other challenges as well to live up to the many, many promises that it made during the election campaign to ensure that it won the treasury bench. There were many promises about making working families better off. Senator Joyce was just speaking about the pressures on families from higher petrol prices. Mr Rudd lulled Australians into believing that petrol prices—

Senator Patterson interjecting—

—Senator Patterson is right. Fixing petrol prices is an enormous problem. But Mr Rudd lulled Australians into believing that they would be better off on petrol prices and grocery prices under him than they would have been under a Liberal-National Party government. We wait to see the dividend of that. Australians, in particular, await the dividend of lower petrol prices and lower grocery prices. They await the substantial and sustained increase in the quantity of our investment in education that Mr Rudd promised. We will be looking for a substantial and sustained increase from this government in terms of education spending. That is what was promised. That is what we will expect to see. We await the elimination of duplication and overlap within the nation’s health system because, again, that is what was promised. That is what we expect to hold this government to account for. Of course, we look to see budget surpluses. If Mr Rudd and his team are so committed to budget surpluses and to fiscal restraint, not only do we await them delivering budget surpluses off the revenue that the Howard-Costello government left them but we particularly look forward to them seeing that their Labor colleagues in state and territory governments deliver some budget surpluses as well and bring their spiralling debt under control.
I look forward to seeing the end of blatant political advertising, wherever it occurs. I look forward to driving down the road in Adelaide and not hearing Premier Mike Rann on the radio in taxpayer funded commercials that he reads himself. I look forward to putting the television on and not seeing Premier Mike Rann appearing in taxpayer funded commercials. For all that you might have attacked government funded advertising in the past, I do not recall hearing John Howard on the radio or on television.
—Or in a helicopter.
—Or in a helicopter like Steve Bracks, flying over Melbourne. These Labor governments have taken taxpayer funded advertising to new heights of political opportunism. I look forward to seeing Mr Rudd bring an end to that. He needs to hurry up, because it was only a few weeks ago that I heard Mr Rann on radio yet again. Perhaps next time Mr Rudd is sitting down with the Labor Party’s national president, he could suggest that he follow the lead he is trying to set on blatant political advertising. Of course, we also look forward to fixing issues like broadband and communications—issues that the government again made great noise about.
In particular, as a South Australian, I look forward to the government successfully tackling the challenges we face on water management, issues which Senators Joyce and Heffernan before me have both spoken of. As a South Australian, I am well aware of the challenges faced by the Murray-Darling Basin system. 2007 was the driest ever year for inflows into the system. Prior to that, 2006 was the driest ever year for inflows into the system. It is pretty clear that that track record of driest ever inflows into the system is creating a very dire situation. It is causing pain for a lot of communities around the Murray-Darling system. Irrigators, as we are well aware, are suffering the pain of lost income, lost livelihood and diminishing property values. These are people whose family properties are often under threat now and whose future looks very grim indeed.
I spent some time recently with houseboat and tourism operators along the river system. They are, perhaps, the forgotten victims of the system and are people who are really caught on a double-edged sword on this issue. In most parts, the river, from a tourism perspective, is still quite accessible. Houseboats can still sail. Indeed, in some ways, the drop in river levels and the drought have created a unique opportunity. There are now sandy banks along the edges of the river. For the uneducated in terms of the river management, it looks quite attractive in places. There are things there that you would never have expected to see before. But the constant negative press about the river—necessary, perhaps, to get the attention required to see long-term solutions—has the ill effect of driving tourists away in droves. Our tourism operators are suffering, as they wish to see those long-term solutions but also wish to encourage tourists to continue to travel to and enjoy the river.
The cities of Adelaide, Whyalla, Port Augusta, Port Pirie, Broken Hill and many other towns in my home state are suffering and stressed over the availability of urban water supplies going into the future. State governments have for too long failed to secure alternative means of obtaining those water supplies. We are now seeing the stresses that this places on those communities. Then there is the environment. The environment is particularly stressed in this situation. The river Murray mouth, which has been dredged for many years now to keep it open, is truly suffering as a result of this prolonged drought. The Coorong, a Ramsar listed site of particular environmental importance, is struggling from the lack of freshwater inflows and is at serious risk. Many other lakes and reserves, such as Lake Alexandrina, are equally suffering under the driest ever conditions in the Murray-Darling Basin. This is the gravest of situations. While we have seen some drought-breaking rains in the north-east of Australia that are extremely welcome, they are doing little for additional flows into the Murray-Darling system, particularly down into the Murray. This grave situation is going to continue.
Labor came to office with some big promises on water, especially on the future of the river Murray. They promised the restoration of some 500 billion litres of water flows as a matter of urgency, and 1,500 billion litres of environmental flows over the next decade. They also promised to bring forward some of the expenditure on the National Plan for Water Security that John Howard announced just prior to Australia Day last year. This was greeted with much fanfare at the time and there was also much criticism from the then Labor opposition of the slow pace of expenditure on the National Plan for Water Security. They promised to bring forward $100 million of expenditure into this year, the 2007-08 financial year. This was an election commitment to encourage Australians to believe that Labor were serious about addressing water.
What did we discover during Senate estimates in talking with the water minister? Not that $100 million was going to be brought forward. Apparently, that was unachievable. The minister had not thought to see whether that was achievable at the time of making the promise. Only $15 million will be brought forward into this financial year—only $15 million out of $100 million. But, as they say in those classic commercials, wait, there is more, because, while $15 million is being brought forward, $50 million worth of programs under the National Plan for Water Security have fallen to the government’s razor gang. So the government promised to bring $100 million forward, is only bringing $15 million forward and has actually cut $50 million out. If my maths is correct, that is a $35 million cut in expenditure in the National Plan for Water Security in this financial year. This is the government’s first great delivery on the Murray-Darling Basin and on trying to ensure the water security for all of Australia. South Australians, sitting at the end of the system, have every right to be extremely disappointed that the government cannot live up to that promise and that the Minister for Climate Change and Water, a South Australian senator, cannot deliver for her home state on this first basic promise that Labor made to support the environment and particularly water.
We have negotiations for agreement on the National Plan for Water Security going along at a snail’s pace. We have the Prime Minister dodging any responsibility for it. He refused to place water on the COAG agenda for the first meeting of Labor premiers and leaders after the election in December. After refusing to place it on the agenda, he gave the then acting South Australian Premier, Kevin Foley, the assurance that he was committed to taking Premier Rann and Premier Brumby aside and dealing with the impasse in the new year as soon as he was able to. We are a long way into the new year and Prime Minister Rudd has not met with Premier Rann and Premier Brumby. He has not taken them aside, as he promised, to deal with this. Indeed, what he said on his last visit to Adelaide was: ‘Discussions with Victoria will be conducted at her’—Senator Wong’s—‘level and in due course at my level once we have narrowed the gap in terms of the negotiating position.’ Talk about buck passing. He has handballed it off to Senator Wong and only wants to step in and take the credit when it has all been negotiated. We will be looking to hold the government to account on its many promises. But I in particular will be looking to hold it to account on the delivery of more water flows for the river Murray and water security for all South Australians, particularly those in Adelaide.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Governor-General's Speech,11,1
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2008-03-13,"—The debate on the Governor-General’s speech has centred, quite appropriately, on measures that the new government is taking to manage the economy. It has also touched on the question of how it intends to fight inflation. Putting to one side the scepticism which many in this chamber and elsewhere would no doubt feel about the Labor Party’s ability to follow through on a policy such as this, it is important for us to focus on one omission from those plans that were outlined to this chamber. What we did not hear about was the government’s two per cent increase in the efficiency dividend. When we consider the way in which that efficiency dividend is impacting on programs all over Australia and all across the spending programs of the Commonwealth government, it is not surprising to find a lack of transparency evident about that particular issue.
The two per cent efficiency dividend is applied to almost all Commonwealth government departments. It will strip away Public Service jobs, gut public programs and research at our valuable national institutions and bin dozens of major projects already approved and funded—I emphasise that they are already funded—by the former coalition government. What the government’s program did not tell us about was how the government’s ‘slash first and ask questions later’ approach would damage communities around Australia, and nowhere more so, may I say, than here in the Australian Capital Territory. They were light on detail, I suspect, because they were unclear themselves as to how these initiatives would impact on individual programs and services delivered to the Australian people.
We saw some evidence of that in the fiasco last week and earlier this week surrounding the mooted cancellation of carer payments and seniors bonuses, one way of saving money which turned out to be a bit of a disaster. So back to the drawing board they go. Let us see what else they can find to meet these very impressive savings targets and think subsequently about how they will impact on the Australian people.
I want to put on the record some of the effects of the government’s scorched earth approach to savings. Let us start with Australia’s national institutions—the great collecting and research facilities which protect, preserve and promote Australian culture and history. The work of these institutions is absolutely invaluable, for without them we would have no collective record of our past achievements, no way of furthering our understanding of Australia’s past and present, and no way of encouraging culture, arts and learning in the future. Despite this, it was revealed in recent budget estimates hearings that every major institution in Australia will see its budget cut back by this government’s razor gang—no regard for their capacity to sustain such cuts and no allowance made for their needs to see through the important programs that each operates.
The National Gallery of Australia, which is responsible for preserving and promoting the largest art collection in Australia, not to mention the largest and most comprehensive collection of Aboriginal art anywhere in the world, will see over $2.8 million hacked from its budget over the next four years. The National Library of Australia, that great treasure trove of Australian literature, research and knowledge, will suffer a cut of over $3.8 million. The National Museum of Australia, the brainchild of Paul Keating and something of a cause celebre for Labor over the past 15 years, will see its budget slashed by over $2.6 million. Isn’t it funny? They talked at length about how we needed a national museum but failed to deliver it when in government. It was the coalition government that delivered the National Museum, yet when the Labor Party returned to office one of their first acts is to cut its budget—disgraceful.
Despite what the government seems to think, these institutions already run a very tight ship in terms of their funding. None would say, privately or publicly, that they have money sloshing around, unused, in their budgets. I doubt that there would be a single inch of ‘bureaucratic fat’ to be found among them. This means that the government’s budget cuts will actually be carving into the flesh and blood of these institutions—their public programs, research and collecting capabilities, and their touring programs. Never mind that cutting these programs and capabilities will affect Australia’s cultural life well into the future. Never mind that this decision will probably cost the government more in the long run when eventually it realises that these institutions are worthy of support and has to spend a fortune bringing them back up to scratch. Apparently making a big show of fiscal restraint is far more important than the long-term wellbeing of Australia’s cultural institutions.
It would be bad enough if these were the only damaging cuts the government planned to make, but they have not stopped there. Let us look also at what is in store for the Australian National Botanic Gardens—our living, breathing museum of Australian flora. As any member who has visited this oasis of green in the middle of Canberra would know, the gardens are home to hundreds of plant species which do not exist outside of Australia, as well as some which do not now exist anywhere outside of the gardens themselves. This facility is one of the key resources used to further our understanding of how climate change will affect Australia’s native plant species, as well as ensuring that threatened and protected species are preserved for the future.
During the election campaign last year, Labor lambasted the former Howard government for supposedly neglecting the gardens. Apparently we had not done enough to preserve their future. Indeed, Labor promised an additional $1.5 million to install urgently needed new pumping and recycling systems to secure its water supply—a very important asset for any gardens, I would have thought.
The reality is that we had not neglected the gardens. We increased their budget year in, year out. The nature of the problem facing the gardens was rising water costs and other expenses, some of them imposed by the ACT government. The gardens saw their utilities bill rise to over $600,000 per year. Nonetheless, it was our responsibility that the gardens were in trouble and we had to fix it. Labor promised $1½ million.
Next we see the phenomenon which Senator Birmingham has already described with respect to, ironically, the national water plan. As was revealed in February’s budget estimates, there was to be a savings measure imposed on the gardens—$2.6 million imposed on the national parks agency, which is responsible for the gardens, and an indeterminate amount to be sustained by the gardens themselves over the next four years—to satisfy the government’s increased efficiency dividend, which, incidentally, they severely criticised at 1¼ per cent in the hands of the Howard government but which now becomes acceptable at 3¼ per cent under the Rudd government. So $1½ million was promised but $2.6 million is taken out the back door. Worse, the $1½ million which we were expecting to be delivered almost immediately we have now been told will not be delivered until at least next year. This is, frankly, despicable.
During the election Labor would have had us believe that the gardens were under imminent threat of extinction without new water infrastructure. Now it seems that not only can the gardens wait indefinitely for that new infrastructure to be delivered but they can also wear big budget cuts when it suits the government’s agenda. In executing this sleight of hand, the Labor Party also went out to a large proportion of the Canberra community, which is very concerned about institutions like the gardens, and no doubt reaped the votes of the people who believed that the representative was going to secure the garden’s future but, instead, has delivered a net reduction in funding to the gardens. I wonder what those people think about that today.
The efficiency dividend is one type of cut this government will be making. In their so-called ‘war on inflation’, they have also deemed it necessary to slash over $643 million in spending for projects already approved and funded by the former coalition government using its budget surplus. We are not talking about election promises here; we are talking about funding which was allocated in the 2007-08 budget or earlier budgets that provide a range of important infrastructure, community and welfare programs, which the community deserves and I think supports.
The prime example of this is some $70 million allocated in May last year for the next stage of capital works to complete Walter Burley Griffin’s vision for our national capital. This money was handed to the National Capital Authority for major works on the Russell roundabout joining Kings Avenue and Parkes Way—a road most members of this house would be familiar with as it ferries them directly to the Canberra airport. This money was also intended to complete major works on Constitution Avenue, in keeping with Griffin’s plan to make it the third arm of the Parliamentary Triangle. Griffin envisioned Constitution Avenue as a wide, European style boulevard where people would live, work and meet and which would finally link the Parliamentary Zone to Canberra’s civic heart. But this will not happen now for at least some time because on 8 February the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Lindsay Tanner, announced that $46,500,000 would be slashed from the Griffin Legacy works. Just enough funding will be left to complete the works on the Russell roundabout, no doubt making Mr Tanner’s trip to and from the Canberra airport quicker and more comfortable. But the plans for Constitution Avenue’s grand development will be shelved completely.
If Labor had opposed those plans and thought they were a bad idea or a waste of money, I could understand these cuts. But, of course, they did not. They supported the plans when they were announced. Now, apparently, they are dispensable. This is one case where the razor gang has not just pruned back spending a bit; it has cut this project right off at the root and ensured that it will not come to fruition at any time in the foreseeable future.
In a sense, the government has also scattered lime on the remains of the Constitution Avenue project by significantly reducing funding for the agency which was supposed to carry it out—the National Capital Authority. I do not want to bore the house with item after item from the government’s hit list, but the NCA really has been cut off at the knees by this government. Almost immediately upon taking office, the government announced that the NCA would have to shed 33 of its staff and $1.6 million from its budget in this financial year alone. You might think, ‘This is just another government agency; what does it matter if it has to shed a few staff and cut a few dollars?’ Anybody who lives in or visits this city and walks around the Parliamentary Triangle sees the product of the work of the National Capital Authority. That is what is at risk today by virtue of this cut of a third of the entire agency’s staff. It is impossible for cuts of that kind to be sustained without ordinary Australians seeing the legacy of that in the nature, shape and future planning of the Parliamentary Triangle. I dread to think what that will mean for the shape and appearance of our national capital into the future. The ACT Labor government and their federal Labor colleagues have long had a very serious antipathy for the National Capital Authority and this has no doubt precipitated the decision to cut back its budget. But the long-term sustainability of such cuts needs to be understood.
Nor should the cuts already made at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Australian Bureau of Statistics and Centrelink in Canberra go unremarked, or those at any other agency which is getting the chop in the May budget. It has been indicated to me that some of those opposite think it is a bit hypocritical for my party to criticise Public Service cuts given the cutting that was engaged in after the coalition took office in 1996. But those who try to make that argument tend to overlook the fact that there was a very different environment in 1996 to the one that operates today. In 1996 we faced almost $100 billion in national debt, a budget that was $10 billion in deficit and an economy staggering from a recent major recession. We had to find savings in the budget simply to put ourselves back into economic control. After 12 years in government, we have left Labor with exactly the reverse situation. They have inherited a multibillion dollar budget surplus and an economy which has been stimulated by more than a decade of strong economic management. There is just no need for this government to make cuts on the scale being talked about in the media and foreshadowed for the May budget.
I suspect that the government are attempting to show what a strong, fiscally conservative government they are and that the things they will spend money on into the future will be their own work and not the legacy of the former government. A bit of insulation from the budget surpluses of the Howard government is what they are after. It is very clever politics, but it is not clever policy. It is not clever to cut back spending on our national institutions at a time when we have budget surpluses just begging to be reinvested in ways that will benefit the nation. It is not clever to slash Public Service jobs when, according to this government, they have a range of new reforms they want to carry out which will need an experienced, well-resourced Public Service. Cutting of the kind they are talking about now will be counterproductive in that regard. It is certainly not clever to curtail the long-term planning and development of our unique national capital, which just about every previous Australian government has seen fit to invest in, all for the sake of short-term political gain on the part of this government.
This is a government which, despite the legacy it has received from its predecessor, feels the need to slash and burn its way through the federal budget. Balancing budgets is a perfectly honourable thing to do and a perfectly acceptable exercise to engage in, but to do so in a way which damages the fabric of the Australian Public Service and the great national institutions, most of which reside here in the national capital, is a serious mistake. It is particularly dangerous to do so in a way which is indiscriminate. I recall very well the words used by the Labor opposition to describe the 1¼ per cent efficiency dividend that was used by the Howard government. It said the dividend was indiscriminate, unfocused and took out good programs and bad. Now we discover that apparently our mistake was not in having an efficiency dividend but in not having one that was large enough.
I would remind those opposite when they talk about how fiscally conservative they now are that every time we announced a new spending program, every time we put money into new areas in health, education, national institutions, bonuses for seniors or carers et cetera, they welcomed that spending. They said it was a good thing. Often they said it came too late or, in fact, it was not enough. That was the general criticism that was made. But we are now told, almost in the same breath, that we were spending too much. Well, that is an issue and a challenge for the government to face. It can face it any way it wants. But I say to the government: if you want to make cuts which impact on the fabric of the Australian Public Service and the integrity of Australia’s national institutions, you will have this senator to deal with and this issue will not be let rest until those cuts and that damage are made good.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Governor-General's Speech,11,1
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2008-03-13,"—I, too, would like to contribute to the address-in-reply to the Governor-General’s policy speech. Today there is a great deal of interest in matters to do with Indigenous affairs, especially since the apology to our Indigenous people was made by this parliament last month. As I said in my speech to the Senate on the apology, it is a disgrace that in modern Australia there is a segment of our population whose living standards and circumstances are below what we would regard as acceptable for Australians at large. As I also said at the time, I believe we in the federal parliament should pledge ourselves to overcoming those pockets of Indigenous disadvantage and poverty which exist in our society and to ensuring that our Indigenous citizens are able to enjoy the benefits which living in modern Australia should bring them.
While the apology was an important symbolic gesture, I am concerned that the impression has been created to some degree that the previous government, under the coalition, was less concerned than it might have been about dealing with Aboriginal disadvantage and responding to the needs of our Indigenous people. The facts of the matter show how wrong such an impression is. Today I would like to remind the Senate of some of the important and very practical measures which were provided for the benefit of our Indigenous citizens in the last budget of the Howard government, for 2007-08. It is quite apparent that, far from being indifferent to the needs of our Indigenous people, the Howard government showed a great deal of concern about the general conditions of Indigenous people and a strong commitment to overcoming inequity and ensuring social justice for the Aboriginal people of Australia, who represent about 2.4 per cent of our population.
It is important to understand, in considering issues to do with Indigenous people, that around 70 per cent of our Indigenous people are urbanised and live in large cities such as Perth, Sydney and Brisbane and in the country towns and regional centres of our states. In most cases they are living as ordinary families in the community, doing the things that ordinary families do and accessing the services provided to all members of our society, including health, education, housing and social security. Less than 30 per cent of Indigenous Australians live in the so-called outback—in the Northern Territory, the Central and Western deserts of the Northern Territory and Western Australia, the Kimberley or the north-west of Queensland. That is quite a small percentage of the total Aboriginal population. But while that percentage is small, the problems that Aborigines living in remote areas face are, I do accept, generally more serious. That is why the Howard government initiated the Northern Territory intervention—to deal with some of the more urgent problems which were found to exist in the Northern Territory, as documented in the Little children are sacred report.
Today I would like to remind the Senate of some of the more practical measures the Howard government included in its last budget to improve conditions for Indigenous people in areas of social justice, education, health, housing, economic independence and culture. Firstly, I would like to deal with social justice, which is really an umbrella concept because social justice is about making sure that every Australian—Indigenous and non-Indigenous—has choices about how they live and that they have the means to make those choices in their lives. Social justice covers many areas, such as education, health and housing, and it is the wish of any government that all of its people should have access to these things. The Howard government was in fact very aware of the disadvantage faced by Indigenous Australians and was working very hard towards the general goals, as outlined above, of social justice for Indigenous people. During the term of the Howard government, real spending on Indigenous specific programs increased by 42 per cent and reached a record of $3.5 billion in the last financial year of that government, which of course runs into this year. Total expenditure in last year’s budget for A Better Future for Indigenous Australians—a program of great importance—was $1,349.5 million and covered some 42 individual programs. This included $187.3 million spent on education, $135.4 million spent on health, $293.6 million spent on housing, $234.2 million spent on economic independence and $104.8 million spent on cultural programs.
As I said, the most looked at of the government actions to assist Indigenous Australians in the previous year was probably the Northern Territory intervention. Contrary to claims that it was rushed through parliament without much scrutiny, the bill for the Northern Territory intervention was one of the longest-debated bills in Senate history, with over 27 hours of time devoted in the Senate to considering this particular piece of legislation. Everyone regards it as pivotal in having defined the federal government’s interest in addressing some of the very real problems which existed in the Northern Territory, and which it seems exist also in other parts of the north of Australia, such as the north of Western Australia in Halls Creek, Fitzroy Crossing and Kununurra. Now the government of Western Australia, together with those of other jurisdictions such as Queensland, are seeking to address similar problems.
I will turn to some of the specific headings, such as education. Education is very important to Indigenous people because it is the key to the door of the world for them. Very important is not just education in terms of reading and writing but job skill education. Today, Indigenous students represent about 3.5 per cent of the overall student population of Australia. Something like 3.5 per cent of the Aboriginal population are attending university or other tertiary education compared to about 6.3 per cent of non-Indigenous Australians, so there is certainly a deficit there. But in the last budget the Howard government had programs totalling $187.3 million devoted specifically to assisting Indigenous people in facilitating their education.
The first program was a funding boost which saw an allocation of some $218 million to provide young Indigenous people from remote communities with a new start in life by assisting them with boarding school places and scholarships. These funds were aimed at Indigenous education and training mobility programs, such as the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program, which assisted young people to access quality training in major centres. It was designed to increase the number of places available by 860 to a total of 1,500. Places in the Indigenous Youth Leadership Program were increased to 750. Indigenous Access Scholarships, which assist Indigenous students enrolled in undergraduate courses at university level to meet the costs associated with relocating from remote and rural areas, saw funding increases for an additional 100 scholarships provided to Indigenous students from remote areas to attend tertiary education institutions.
Boarding hostel subsidies were provided to the extent of $43 million to help establish boarding hostels in regional towns that have quality secondary schools. For example, the construction of a new boarding hostel at Kununurra is expected to be completed around the middle of this year. There was $65 million injected into upgrading facilities to provide additional places in a number of existing boarding schools with strong track records of providing secondary school education for young Indigenous people. These were very practical measures to ensure that more Indigenous people participated in the education services provided to Australians in general.
Health is a very important area, of course, in terms of social justice for Indigenous people because generally they have a much poorer health record, with high incidence of kidney disease and diabetes and a lower life expectancy. In the last budget, again in a very practical way, the Howard government allocated $134.5 million to several programs, including the establishment of quality health standards. This saw $36.9 million invested into Indigenous health services for upgrading buildings and clinics, patient information and management systems, staff training and management to enable them to meet Australian healthcare standards.
The Indigenous Community Initiative of the National Illicit Drug Strategy was provided with $14.6 million to fund a variety of programs to provide evidence based Indigenous specific treatment guidelines, together with alcohol awareness products and other resources to enable Indigenous communities to address the misuse of alcohol and drugs. There was a family centred primary healthcare program with $38.2 million provided to existing Aboriginal medical services and primary healthcare service delivery centres. This funded up to 45 additional professionals providing primary health care.
Most importantly perhaps was an enhancement of Telehealth in Western Australia, with $3.1 million of funding coming into a project to enable improved health service delivery for up to 454,000 residents in regional, rural and remote communities across the state of Western Australia. This includes more than 44,900 Indigenous Western Australians. That is very important because it provides the latest technology as a means of delivering health services.
It is interesting to look at a summary of what the Howard government achieved in terms of Indigenous health programs since it came into office in 1996. Under the 10 years of the Howard government, spending on Indigenous health programs increased by a factor of 3.5. So, in other words, 3½ times as much money was spent on Indigenous health programs at the end of the Howard government’s 10-year period in office than was spent at the beginning. Indigenous utilisation of Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme increased by 80 per cent, and there were 50 per cent more Indigenous doctors and 30 per cent more Indigenous nurses in practice at the end of the Howard government’s period of office than at the beginning.

 (Senator Watson)—Order! It being 12.45 pm, the Senate will now proceed to non-controversial legislation.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Governor-General's Speech,11,1
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2008-03-13,"—I will be very brief. I am going to say a few words on the Higher Education Support Amendment (VET FEE-HELP Assistance) Bill 2008 only because of the debate regarding the Skills Australia Bill yesterday. In a sense, I feel provoked to say a few words. There was much discussion yesterday about what the coalition did in office to help with the skill shortage and to train people in vocational and educational training. As you will know, Mr Acting Deputy President Watson, what the substantive act originally did was extend FEE-HELP to students in vocational and educational training. So when the government yesterday were talking on the Skills Australia Bill about the fact that the coalition government was asleep at the wheel, how wrong they were, because the act extended substantively FEE-HELP to students in vocational and educational training. This is non-controversial legislation and this is a technical amendment, in a sense, to bring rigour back to the act. I know there are some amendments that have to be made to streamline the process. I understand that. I just wanted to make the point about how much the Howard government did to reskill Australia and that the substantive act, by extending FEE-HELP to students in vocational and educational training, is a very good example of that.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT AMENDMENT (VET FEE-HELP ASSISTANCE) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2008-03-13,"—In summing up the debate on the Higher Education Support Amendment (VET FEE-HELP Assistance) Bill 2008 I thank Senator Mason for his contribution and reiterate that this amendment was necessary to change the legislative guidelines which sit under the VET FEE-HELP legislation. These guidelines allow for the extension of the higher education FEE-HELP arrangements to the vocational education sector. Specifically, and importantly, the amendment ensures that the VET FEE-HELP is restricted to full-fee-paying students in diploma, advanced diploma, graduate certificate and graduate diploma courses. It also ensures that VET providers will have credit transfer arrangements with a higher education provider for each diploma and advanced diploma qualification.
VET FEE-HELP is expected to assist more than 6,000 students over the next four years to obtain high-level vocational qualifications. It is critical to Australia’s long-term prosperity that we lift the skills base of Australian workers so that Australian business can compete in international markets. By improving movement of students between vocational education and higher education sectors we will be increasing skill levels and assisting in increasing productivity. Of course, VET FEE-HELP is consistent with our social inclusion policy. It allows students who may otherwise not have pursued training at these levels because of financial pressures to gain access to training for the first time or to upgrade lower level qualifications. Higher level VET qualifications are a centrepiece of the Skilling Australia for the Future policy. This amendment will allow VET FEE-HELP to be introduced during 2008. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2008-03-13,"—I rise to make a few short comments to contribute to the debate on the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (Poisons Standard) Bill 2008. The opposition supports this bill. As the Minister for Health and Ageing said in her second reading speech, this bill was made necessary because of consequences which flowed from the Federal Court decision in Roche Products Pty Ltd v National Drugs and Poisons Schedule Committee, handed down on 30 August 2007. The court held that decisions taken by the committee are legislative in character. This means that the Poisons Standard and its amendments are legislative instruments. It has been policy for many years that the Poisons Standard is not treated as a disallowable legislative instrument for the sensible public policy reason that the standard operates through a joint arrangement with state and territory jurisdictions, and disallowance in one legislature would potentially disrupt that arrangement. The regulation of poisons is rightly a matter which all governments take seriously. This bill includes retrospective provisions to preserve the status quo of the Poisons Standard up to the Roche decision and, while the coalition has long held as a principle that retrospective legislation is generally to be avoided, it is necessary in cases such as these where protection of the public should be paramount. The opposition supports this bill.",SENATE,<title>THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT (POISONS STANDARD) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1

As he said, it does make a number of amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 and addresses the legal consequences of that recent Federal Court decision. It does have some retrospectivity to it which, of course, is not necessarily always a good thing but in this case is a very important factor.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2008-03-13,"—I rise to make a few comments about the Trade Practices Amendment (Access Declarations) Bill 2008. The opposition are supporting the bill; it is a very effective and important bill which will clarify that access declarations and extension notices which extend the period of access declarations are not legislative instruments for the purposes of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. It is a very technical amendment with some very practical implications for the industry. I have to say—seeing as it is an amendment to the Trade Practices Act—that enabling a competitive market structure has of course been a key focus of the coalition over the years. As part of that, of course, we introduced telecommunications specific sections into the Trade Practices Act and underpinned the introduction of the open access regime by opening up exchanges and the customer access network to full competition. I note that a couple of days ago the High Court in fact said that it was a legal and effective regime.
Consumers have been the real beneficiaries of competition through falling prices, with fixed line prices falling by almost 19 per cent and mobile service prices falling by a whopping 36 per cent. I do not think anyone would seriously argue how important competition is. It is a market, however, of continuous evolution, and services innovate at an exponential rate. With technology evolving so quickly there are always new challenges being faced by government. As I have said before, communications policy is never a ‘set and forget’ exercise. That is why we introduced a comprehensive broadband plan that would provide fast internet to 100 per cent of the population using a mix of technologies to be available by mid-2009.
This is in contrast to the Labor government’s muddled approach to broadband, with the extraordinary displays of incompetence by the current Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Conroy. Having made much of Labor’s so-called broadband revolution, the rollout of the new fibre network was supposed to be a new direction for the industry and for the country. Senator Conroy had grandly promised voters that within just six months of gaining office work would begin on the hook-up of 98 per cent of Australians to high-speed broadband. It is diverting, to say the least, that commentators have not failed to notice that this commitment has slipped and it is already a broken election promise. As Malcolm Farr observed in the Sunday Telegraph recently:
... this race to the digital future has had a sluggish start more suited to the steam age.
It is obvious for all to see that steam age Senator Conroy—steam age Steve—is hopelessly out of his depth in understanding the myriad complex issues that he must face in this new network build. To begin with, Labor’s plan is mired in uncertainty as to what type of rollout it will be—fibre to the node or fibre to the home—who will build it, how access will be provided, how the access price will be determined, how long the build will take and how far it will reach. Added to these uncomprehended questions by the minister, the important point is that no-one yet knows how the government will use the $4.7 billion of taxpayers’ money slated for investment. It is true that $4.7 billion might get Senator Conroy’s network to Wollongong but not much past 75 per cent of the population. How regional Australia is to get some share of any benefit of this vast taxpayer spend is a quandary, and Senator Conroy seems unable to address it.
Typically, Labor has reached out to an expert task force to provide some answers. When it comes to a new network build I do not criticise the place of an expert task force to examine all the barriers to the build and to provide recommendations to government. Indeed, I did it myself. What I do criticise, however, is that Labor inherited a perfectly well formed expert task force that had been set up under the Howard government to oversee a new fibre network build. In his bumbling, stumbling way Senator Conroy disbanded this expert task force but retained a similar membership with essentially the same task, wasting months in the process. This is clearly a minister who is dithering and wasting time while the rest of the world is moving on to a digital future. It is not an auspicious beginning to the handling of a complex portfolio, and we can only hope in the interests of our own digital futures that someone in the Rudd government, perhaps Mr Lindsay Tanner, who, it seems, is taking some supervisory role over Senator Conroy, will come to the rescue of this increasingly desperate looking and nervous sounding minister.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (ACCESS DECLARATIONS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-03-13,"—The Trade Practices Amendment (Access Declarations) Bill 2008 amends part XIC of the Trade Practices Act 1974 to make it clear that access declarations and notices intended to extend the period of access declarations are not legislative instruments for the purpose of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. The bill also has retrospective effect. This bill only impacts on part XIC of the Trade Practices Act relating to telecommunications access. It does not affect part IIIA and access regimes, such as those which impact on rail access.
The objective of the bill is stated as being ‘to provide certainty to the telecommunications sector’ by providing that access declarations and extensions of periods of access are not legislative instruments. Necessarily, the bill has retrospective effect—it provides that declarations and extensions of periods of access dating from before the commencement of the bill should also be deemed not to have been legislative instruments. Although the Australian Democrats as a rule do not support retrospectivity in the application of legislation, in this case the Trade Practices Amendment (Access Declarations) Bill 2008 restores and clarifies the law to reflect its original intention. This bill is necessary to give certainty to the large and volatile telecommunications sector, particularly given the importance of telecommunications to the Australian economy, productivity and infrastructure.
The necessity for this legislation has arisen from a decision of the Federal Court in relation to a weight loss drug called Xenical. Roche Products Pty Ltd, the manufacturer of the drug, challenged a decision of the National Drugs and Poisons Schedule Committee withdrawing the committee’s consent for direct advertising to consumers of the drug. As a preliminary matter the Federal Court considered whether the decision of the National Drugs and Poisons Schedule Committee was legislative or administrative in character.
In their decision brought down in late 2007 the court found that the decision of the National Drugs and Poisons Schedule Committee was legislative in character rather than administrative. This was justified by looking at what the decision does rather than what it is called. The decision of the court impacts only on part XIC of the Trade Practices Act and that part of the Trade Practices Act sets out an access regime for the telecommunications industry. The regime provides for the declaration of carriage services and related services by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission after a public inquiry in accordance with section 505 of the Telecommunications Act 1997.
There are a number of access declarations in force at the moment including the high-frequency unconditioned local loop service and the domestic digital mobile terminating access service. The ACCC has declared these services on the basis that they are not legislative instruments and therefore are not required to be registered.
Following the Roche Products case, there was concern that access declarations which were made by the ACCC under part XIC of the Trade Practices Act were legislative in character and so fell within the definition of a legislative instrument in the Legislative Instruments Act. If that was so, then the failure to record access declarations on the register may have had the unintended consequence that they would be or are unenforceable. Thus any legal action to, say, impose access obligations on carriers or providers on the basis of an existing part XIC declaration could potentially be blocked or overturned by a court. If that were to occur the existing telecommunications access regime would be rendered inoperative.
As soon as the Roche court case ruling came through, Telstra was apparently setting up to challenge all the ACCC access declarations. This bill does not prevent Telstra challenging ACCC access decisions; it just prevents Telstra from challenging access rulings on these particular technical grounds. Without this bill, Telstra could challenge each of those access service declarations and say that they are invalid because they are not on the register, so causing significant delays and uncertainty while the matter was concluded in the courts. In my view that would have an anticompetitive effect.
A decision in Telstra’s favour would have the impact of effectively dismantling the current competitive telecommunications industry structure in Australia. It would also ensure that Australia then would continue to trail the world in high-speed broadband while the mess was sorted out. As the Australian Democrats made clear at the last election, a failure to invest in broadband and to advance the broadband policy of the government will put Australia’s social capacity, economic growth, e-commerce growth and future competitiveness at risk.
We think this bill makes a small contribution to advancing the cause of a better broadband and telecommunications network, and therefore the Australian Democrats support the bill.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (ACCESS DECLARATIONS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2008-03-13,"—In summing up the debate today, I appreciate Senator Murray’s very concise summation of the intent of the Trade Practices Amendment (Access Declarations) Bill 2008, because from Senator Coonan’s contribution we were not too sure just what it was all about.
Two points that are important in Senator Murray’s contribution were the issue about retrospectivity, restoring the original intent of the legislation, and that we are debating this trade practices amendment bill after having just finished with the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (Poisons Standard) Bill 2008 which was also affected by the same Federal Court decision of Roche Products Pty Ltd v the National Drugs and Poisons Schedule Committee, and indicates the broader impact on a range of competitive markets that a Federal Court decision can make. On the basis of the generous support for this non-controversial legislation I commend the bill to the Senate.

The coalition will be supporting these bills because the legislation is effectively a mirror image of the bill that Senator Brandis put before the Australian public last September. The government, very wisely in my view, has adopted the approach that was set out in that bill and we therefore commend the government for its wisdom in this one area, and one area alone; there are a couple of areas where I will not be praising the government.
It is important that these bills proceed quickly and it is worth while paying tribute to those that have carried out work to bring about major reforms in the film sector. I examined the second reading speech and debates in the other place and I came to the conclusion that some of the speakers may not have been fully aware of the history in getting to this position and were not aware of the amount of work that was done so that these major reforms could be carried out. I particularly pay tribute to my colleagues, the former Treasurer, the former Minister for Finance and Administration and, of course, the former Prime Minister, who allowed me as the arts minister to initiate a major review into the film sector that was announced in the 2006 budget.

Opposition senator—You were a great arts minister.
—Thank you. I acknowledge that comment from the senator. As a result of that budget announcement in 2006 a major review was conducted—led by a senior officer of the then department, DCITA, James Cameron—to review the sector and consult widely along the terms that the government had specified, which James Cameron and I did. The review produced a report that resulted in a very substantial package for the film industry totalling some $300 million over four years, which was widely welcomed. Part of this package was the merger of three film agencies, and that is what this bill gives effect to.
I would also like to acknowledge the great work done by a number of other people in the department: Peter Young, who is with us in the chamber, for the advice that he gave, and Rhonda Thorpe. It is remarkable that you can carry out a merger like this with so little public discontent—I hope I am not speaking out of school here. But these mergers are always difficult—they always involve personalities—and I think the leadership that Brian Rosen, Chris Fitchett and Daryl Karp have given in this area has been extremely important. I have no doubt that the bringing together of these bodies will be done in a very successful and cooperative fashion. That of course will mean that the new body, Screen Australia, will start off on a very sound footing indeed. I praise the new minister for the arts, Mr Garrett, for making sure that this comes before the parliament early. It will enjoy the support of the Liberal Party and the National Party.
Having said that, I have to say that, as a former minister for the arts, I have been concerned about the announcements the government has made. If you had told the arts community before November that within two or three months close to $50 million was going to be chopped off the arts budget, this would have been a matter of great controversy. I am worried that, as a result of some actions by the government, good programs have been cut. I refer particularly to the program Australia on the World Stage—which many will know I had a strong interest in for a number of years—which was to provide funding for Australian performing arts companies, the visual arts and Australian artists to tour overseas. The announcement was made in the 2007 budget that this program would commence. The program had just commenced and was very widely welcomed in the arts community. Unfortunately, the $20 million that was in the forward estimates for this program was brutally chopped by the government in one of its first announcements of savings.
I suspect Mr Garrett was not properly informed about the importance of this program. I suspect that the Minister for Finance and Deregulation was flexing his muscles, and I suspect that DFAT, probably not surprisingly, were concerned about protecting some of their own positions and were prepared to sacrifice this program. I must confess to the Senate that I thought it was a mistake to locate this program solely in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and to not have the administration of it shared with the arts portfolio. Anyway, it has been sacrificed as a result of the government’s announcements, much to the annoyance of many in the arts community. I have no doubt that ultimately the program will be restored under some other name at some future time.
For colleagues like Senator Stephens, it would be well worth your looking closely at what the government has done in this particular area. It is a mistake. It saves about $5 million a year. It puts our cultural diplomacy back a great deal. It is a program which I think should be restored, and I have no doubt will be in the future because the demand is there for it.
Like many other senators I have also been concerned about the significant cuts that have been made to the major collecting institutions as a result of the efficiency dividend. I think that that again is a mistake. It is one of those things that the Department of Finance and Deregulation brought forward. It means, I think, that bodies like the National Library of Australia, the museum and the art gallery are going to be forced in the end to cut some programs in order to meet those savings targets.
It does stick in one’s throat to read that not all arts programs have been cut and that there are some new arts programs. One that the Labor Party has announced is $2.5 million to protect a dead tree in Queensland, which is apparently writ large in Australian Labor Party history. Governments do these things from time to time, though I think that the Labor Party would expect that, in the context where you are cutting our major collecting institutions and our cultural training institutions, people will recall that not everything has been cut and there is new money available—but it is available for those things which are particularly close and dear to Labor mates. I think that that is unfortunate, particularly in the context of what the government has done to date.
There is another issue that is in the sights of the Department of Finance and Deregulation. It was mentioned at Senate estimates that there are discussions about changing the depreciation provisions, particularly as they relate to the major collecting institutions. This matter had not been resolved at the time of Senate estimates. But, if it is resolved in the way the Department of Finance and Deregulation want it to be, it will result in major reductions in funding to bodies like the National Library of Australia. This is what will happen. When I was the arts minister, the department of finance tried this stunt on me and on my department. I have to say that the portfolio was very ably defended, if I may give myself some flowers! It was because money could be taken off it. Of course they will say, ‘Well, this money is being used to add to the collection.’ That is true. But if you remove one source of funding for adding to the collection you will probably have to find another. This is really a bit of a test of the new arts minister to see whether he is able to defend his portfolio against the Department of Finance and Deregulation. The Department of Finance and Deregulation has made a complete goose of itself in the last fortnight over the carers allowance.
People like Senator Stephens, sensitive people, will wonder how on earth the Labor Party got itself into this mess. It got itself into this mess because the department of finance and the finance minister picked up this brief and ran hard with it. Of course, it did not result in any savings in the end; it added to significant costs to the budget. I would urge those who believe that our collecting institutions should receive more money, not less money, to look very closely at this area. I hope that Mr Garrett is looking closely to ensure that in this area the department of finance’s efforts to cut funding are effectively rejected.
Having said that, I commend the bills. I think they are good. They are bills that were brought forward by Senator Brandis. He can take some pride in the work that he was able to do to continue to advance the review package, and I take some pleasure because, as a former minister for the arts, I was there at the start of the process which has resulted in such an important package for the film industry.",SENATE,<title>SCREEN AUSTRALIA BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2008-03-13,"—I thank the Senate for its support of this legislation and I thank Senator Kemp for his contribution. I know how much he enjoyed being minister for the arts and we heard some of the reasons why this afternoon.
The bills before us, the Screen Australia Bill 2008, the National Film and Sound Archive Bill 2008 and the Screen Australia and the National Film and Sound Archive (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2008, result in the creation of a single, direct funding body, Screen Australia, to bring key film and television support agencies under one roof. This will provide a one-stop shop for obtaining funding for all aspects of filmmaking, together with simpler processes and guidelines and greater flexibility to respond quickly to new or emerging priorities.
As evidenced by the recent public consultation process on the draft legislation, there is widespread support for the merged agency. These changes to direct funding mechanisms, which will come about as a result of the creation of Screen Australia, together with the introduction of the producer offset, provide a solid framework within which the Australian film and television industry can move forward. They are clear evidence of this government’s strong commitment to the industry. It is the government’s hope that this package will lead to an increase in the number of stories that can engage Australian and international audiences and enable the development of a more prosperous and sustainable film industry in Australia.
The bill to establish the National Film and Sound Archive as a new statutory authority will afford it an opportunity to take its place as an independent national collecting institution responsible for preserving, maintaining and providing access to some of our most treasured screen and sound icons. The new archive will expect to provide strong leadership to the archival community in Australia and engage internationally on significant archival issues. It will have a high public profile and build community awareness and appreciation of our cultural heritage, preserved through moving images and sound recordings. The government is very pleased to be able to implement this election commitment for which the archival community has long lobbied and looks forward to working with the archive to build on its already formidable reputation for excellence. I commend the bills to the Senate.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2008-03-13,"—I have some further information in relation to a question asked of me yesterday by Senator Bob Brown on the planned cull of kangaroos. The following information has been provided to me by the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts. Whether the kangaroos are translocated or culled is a matter for the ACT government and the Department of Defence. I am advised that Defence will cull the population using tranquilliser darts and lethal injection in a process overseen by the RSPCA. I am advised that the ACT government received expert advice that there would be unacceptable animal welfare consequences involved with the live capture, transport and subsequent release of the kangaroos into a different environment.
The eastern grey kangaroo is not a listed threatened species under the EPBC Act and so part 13 of that act does not apply. Therefore, the federal Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts has no jurisdiction to intervene regarding the method of removal of the kangaroos in question. It has been determined by the Department of Defence that the cull is unlikely to have a significant adverse impact on the environment and therefore a referral is not required. The fact that the proposed cull will be undertaken by a Commonwealth agency on Commonwealth land does not automatically require referral under the EPBC Act.
The impacts of the current overpopulation of kangaroos at Belconnen include a lack of grass cover, leading to erosion, and an increase in weed infestations. The area in question is natural temperate grassland on the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales and the ACT and is listed under the EPBC Act as an endangered ecological community. These grasslands support threatened species, including the grassland earless dragon, striped legless lizard and golden sun moth. Kangaroo overpopulation will also have serious implications for the welfare of the kangaroos themselves. If nature is left to take its course, many kangaroos may suffer a slow death by starvation. Maintaining a sustainable population of kangaroos on the site is important for the ongoing protection of the listed threatened grassland community and species on the site.
Senator Brown also sought a guarantee that the grasslands in question are to be reserved and their environmental values protected. The grasslands, as I have said, are a listed ecological community already protected by the EPBC Act. Defence has a responsibility to protect the grassland ecological community and species listed under that act. Maintaining a sustainable population of eastern grey kangaroos on the site is, therefore, a key environmental management responsibility of the Department of Defence. Accordingly, and as I alluded to yesterday, this is not a matter over which the federal Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts has authority; it is ultimately a matter for the ACT government and the Department of Defence.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Kangaroo Culling</title>,Questions Without Notice: Additional Answers,18,1
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2008-03-13,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked today.
I particularly want to take note of two answers given by Senator Ludwig on behalf of the Attorney-General to questions by, respectively, Senator Kirk and me, concerning the Haneef inquiry. If you had to have a short essay on the cynicism of the Rudd government, you could not have done better than to compare the answer that Senator Ludwig gave to a dorothy dix question from Senator Kirk and the answer he gave to my question immediately thereafter, concerning the Haneef inquiry. Senator Ludwig said very grandly: ‘Australians are entitled to know what really happened in relation to the matter of Dr Haneef.’ He told us that the inquiry by Mr Clarke QC announced by the Attorney-General this morning would ‘enable all the information to be properly addressed’. That was the government’s spin. We know that in its early days the Rudd government is coming very closely to resemble the Blair government in its reliance upon spin, this shadowy world in which nothing has substance or firm meaning, in which it is—
—Creating diversions—
—all a matter of illusion and, as Senator Coonan said, diversions. It is a bit like TS Eliot’s poem The Waste Land:
We are the hollow men
We are the stuffed men
…            …            …
Shape without form ...
Nevertheless, when Senator Ludwig responded to my question, I had to point out to him that Mr McClelland said at his press conference this morning:
... the inquiry would not examine the flow of intelligence from overseas security agencies.
Just consider for a moment what that means. The government has announced this inquiry—it is not a royal commission, it does not have subpoena powers; it is an informal inquiry essentially established on a very limited basis. The need for the inquiry relies entirely upon the government’s own assertion that the public needs to be reassured about the operation of the counterterrorism laws. So what does the government do? The government raises a false issue and says, ‘Well, we have to set up this strange informal inquiry in order to address a concern which we ourselves have raised, and which was not there in the first place.’
Nevertheless, what the inquiry is about, as the Attorney-General announced this morning, is the case of Dr Haneef and, in particular, the role of the Australian Federal Police. This much we know, and I think it is uncontroversial. Not only the Australian Federal Police but the Queensland Police Service were in receipt of certain security information concerning Dr Haneef, and that security information concerned, in particular, international telephone calls made by or to Dr Haneef. We also know—this is also uncontroversial—that the principal source of the information was the British intelligence services and, in particular, MI5. So we know this much, and the Attorney-General must know as well: the Australian Federal Police and the state policing authorities were in possession of foreign intelligence information which identified Dr Haneef as a person of interest and ultimately they made some decisions, in relation to him, that led to his detention. So the government very grandly with great flourish announce: ‘We’re going to have an inquiry into how the AFP handled the Dr Haneef case.’ And what do they withdraw from the terms of reference of the inquiry? What does the Attorney-General specifically say the inquiry cannot look at? It cannot look at the flow of intelligence from overseas security agencies.
You do not need to be a lawyer to work out that, if the whole basis of the AFP forming the appropriate state of mind—the suspicion about Dr Haneef—was information provided by the British intelligence services that was transmitted to the Australian intelligence services and transmitted to the AFP and if you are going to have an inquiry into whether the AFP did the right thing, front and centre in the inquiry ought to be the sources upon which they relied to form the requisite suspicion that Dr Haneef was a person of interest, that Dr Haneef had done nothing wrong. Yet, that is the very thing Mr McClelland announced this morning the inquiry could not look at. (Time expired)

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2008-03-13,"—I also want to take note of answers to various questions and think it is probably quite appropriate to comment on the issues raised by Senator Brandis. Senator Brandis in the opening remarks of his contribution referred to The Waste Land. One must say that that was quite an appropriate way to commence his remarks: a grey, hopeless, useless, negative wasteland. That is entirely a proper description of what has occurred in respect of this entire matter concerning Dr Haneef over the last 12 to 18 months: a person properly employed, legally going about his duties, caught up and embroiled in a whole scandal not of his own making, punished, deported from this country and denied the opportunity to earn his livelihood. What other example could you have of a grey, useless, hopeless, negative wasteland? That was a topical issue for months and months and months prior to the last election.
In all that time the former cabinet, the former responsible ministers—in particular, Mr Andrews—refused to open the files and refused constantly to disclose information which would either properly and satisfactorily identify responsibility and guilt or, on the other side of that coin, disclose what emerged latterly when Federal Court findings were made as to innocence. So we as the then opposition raised that issue prior to the election and made a commitment to hold an independent judicial inquiry into the case of Dr Haneef in the light of findings by Justice Spender which were later upheld by a full Federal Court that reviewed Minister Andrews’s decision to cancel Dr Haneef’s visit. So we have committed to holding an independent judicial inquiry into the entire case of Dr Haneef.
That undertaking was honoured this morning by the Attorney-General of Australia, Mr McClelland, by the appointment of retired New South Wales court judge Mr John Clarke QC. As Mr McClelland said, quite properly and quite responsibly, an independent inquiry is needed to establish the facts and to ensure public confidence in Australia’s counterterrorism arrangements. Mr McClelland also made the point that, since becoming Attorney-General, he had been briefed regularly by the relevant intelligence agencies and he had come to the view that they were and are operating to high standards. But, because of the mire of disinformation and misinformation properly described by Senator Brandis as a wasteland, we need to assure our community that our national security agencies are functioning in the best way they possibly can at an individual agency level and collectively and on a cooperative basis. Indeed, as was referred to earlier, opposition Senator Birmingham from South Australia made that point to the AAP this morning when he said:
If an inquiry is required to ensure that faith is maintained in the community then that’s important ...
Senator Birmingham was right to say that this morning, Mr McClelland was right to repeat it in his press conference and it is right now on the issue raised by Senator Brandis of the wasteland that exists surrounding, and which has become part of, the case involving Dr Haneef.
The Clarke inquiry will be an opportunity to obtain a factual account of the matter, which still has not been disclosed and was not disclosed by the previous government, from an independent and former experienced judicial officer. Mr Clarke no doubt will conduct a rigorous and independent inquiry that will result in informed consideration and informed conclusions of the lessons to be learnt from the Haneef case for judicial officers, for intelligence officers and for intelligence agencies and undoubtedly will be able to assure the Australian community as to the veracity— (Time expired)

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2008-03-13,"—I have to say, in relation to Labor’s backflip on the access card, that the stumbling, bumbling performance today by Senator Ludwig should be ringing alarm bells in the community that the Rudd Labor government is incompetent and has no plan whatsoever to deal with welfare fraud. Just one month ago, on 13 February, Senator Ludwig was actually boasting about scrapping the coalition’s access card and crowing that it was the financially responsible thing to do. He said that Labor had better priorities than saving taxpayers from being the victims of fraud, such as the education revolution. He said:
We are focused on the practical things ... rather than a card.
So, as of 13 February, Senator Ludwig was very clear that Labor would not have a smart card. Today, of course, he could not rule it out. So, within the space of four weeks, what has been revealed is that the Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, has put it back on the table. This is a backflip of spectacular proportions, and the public are owed an explanation. Either Senator Ludwig has been reversed rolled or gazumped by the Prime Minister or the Prime Minister has finally woken up to the fact that there is a need to reduce fraud on the Commonwealth and to reduce the complexity of there being 17 different payment cards to access Commonwealth benefits and has woken up to the fact that the Medicare card is 23 years old and the Australian Federal Police have said that it is more often than not enabling fraud rather than preventing it.
It is interesting that Senator Ludwig said, in a press release on 1 March:
... welfare fraud is a significant problem and ... the ultimate victims are ordinary Australian taxpayers.
His solution—and I do not think this is a joke; I think he meant it to be taken seriously—was to announce a ‘Fraud Fortnight’, an initiative which sounded like an extended Halloween trick or treat session lasting two weeks, which was supposed to raise awareness of welfare fraud. You have to say to Senator Ludwig: that really does not cut it. Fraudsters are getting away with ripping off welfare and Labor are going to have to do more than trick or treating.
So what did Mr Rudd come in and say to the minister? He said, ‘Look, we’ve got a fraud problem which we’ve got to fix.’ What was Senator Ludwig’s response? He said, ‘We’ve got a sort of trick or treat, Prime Minister; that should scare off the fraudsters.’ Mr Rudd was not happy with that. He preferred to do what he does best; that is, to look at coalition policies—which, of course, he could copy.
This might sound like a case of deja vu, because we know that this me-tooism has become something of a habit for the Labor government. When they do not have a plan of their own, when they do not know how to deal with any of the really difficult problems—the heavy lifting that is necessary in government—they seem to be coming round to the idea that the coalition’s ideas were not too bad after all. You only have to look at Senator Conroy’s pathetic performance on trying to roll out a broadband network. He has adopted the same expert taskforce, with much the same members, as the coalition and he has already broken an election promise in allowing it to slide beyond the promised time frame. As Senator Ludwig’s answer makes very clear today, you can see very clearly that Labor are desperate to find some answer to the problem of welfare fraud. The Australian people are not that dumb that they cannot see that this is a direct and obvious steal from the government’s access card.
The coalition government was already well advanced in the design and implementation of a smart card to address these problems, and yet Labor, as opportunistic as ever in opposition, could not help themselves. They decided to chuck it out, waste a billion dollars of taxpayers’ money; and now, in government, Labor realise that Australia needs to use technology to address welfare fraud. They want to develop a consumer friendly and useful smart card to address fraud. What is clear from this display and Senator Ludwig’s complete inability to rule out an access card is that is what they are going to do. They know they should not have ditched it in the first place and they have simply adopted ours. (Time expired)

"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2008-03-13,"—There was a disparate range of issues raised today by the opposition, but I would like to take note of the answers regarding the economy and the budget. There were several which touched on this dominant theme of recent debate, which was also a theme of the election. It has been a strong focus for this government since coming into power. They have focused on the economy and the budget process and fulfilled an election commitment to be conservative fiscal managers. Naturally, and the Prime Minister has already signalled this, that will result in a bit of pain during the budget process. The Labor government have a commitment to rein in the problems that were created by the former government not addressing a number of threats and a number of opportunities in the economy in the recent past. It is true that Australia has had a strong economy over the past decade or two. Australia has made good use of favourable world economic conditions and favourable terms of trade conditions to put many of the indicators in a good position. But whether it made the former government lazy or whether they were simply incapable of dealing with the issues, they ignored a number of threats that were apparent over the last few years. In particular, they did not make use of a number of opportunities presented by the economic conditions at the time.
Senator Evans spoke about the balance of trade being stubbornly and consistently negative for Australia. In opposition, the Labor Party warned about the problems that might result from this and some of those problems are coming home to roost. Successive Liberal governments did not deal with a number of these issues, and now the incoming Rudd government has the difficult task of addressing a lot of those threats that are apparent, and becoming more apparent. The Labor government is looking to the future; it is looking to provide a stable and solid economic platform for the future. It does have to deal with the problems of building capacity and building up skills and addressing infrastructure needs while fulfilling its commitments to deliver a good budget surplus and rein in spending to ensure that inflation is contained in our economy. All of these things impact on the Labor constituency, those working families that are affected by interest rate rises, by inflation, by price increases—as was outlined with petrol prices, grocery prices and so on.
We in the Labor Party are determined to make sure the economy is right because we are interested in working families and making sure that those working families benefit from the strength of the economy. We are making sure that it is not just chief executives and senior executives of large companies that benefit, but that the benefits of a strong economy are also felt by working families in Australia. From time to time those opposite make fun of the phrase ‘working families’, but it is a serious issue for us in the Labor Party because that represents a fundamental constituency of ours. We have a strong connection and a strong loyalty to make sure that any benefits of Australian wealth created through our primary industries or through our manufacturing or services are felt by those Australians and that their work is well rewarded. That is what drives the Labor Party and will continue to drive the Labor Party and guide our examination of the budget processes and, where the pain might be felt in that budget, to ensure that spending is properly targeted and focused.

"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2008-03-13,"—For as long as I can remember, Labor has talked down the economy. In 1996 the then shadow Treasurer, Gareth Evans, condemned the then government’s savings measures—our efforts to balance the budget. He likened our efforts to taking a baseball bat to the economy. They were not. In 1998 the then shadow Treasurer, Simon Crean, said that the new tax system tax cuts would overheat the economy. They did not. Around the same time, the then opposition leader, Kim Beazley, said that the GST would king-hit the economy. It did not.
To be fair, you do expect oppositions, particularly Labor oppositions, to be negative. But usually, with a change of government, the parties reverse roles. You would expect that a new government would embrace its role to talk up the economy. But, no, we have seen the bizarre situation where the new government is actually talking the economy down; the bizarre situation where the new government is not seeking to defend consumers. Since Mr Swan has been Treasurer we have witnessed him give the green light to banks increasing mortgage rates independently of Reserve Bank decisions. We have seen him give the green light to banks to increase their mortgage rates over and above Reserve Bank decisions. Even worse, we have seen him, the Treasurer of Australia, fuel inflation expectations by declaring, irresponsibly, that the inflation genie is out of the bottle. Those are not the words of a responsible Treasurer. Those are the words of an economic vandal.
Inflation expectations are, in a sense, self-fulfilling. That is why his comments were so dangerous. If consumers think inflation is going to rise they will more readily pay higher prices for goods and services. And if businesses think inflation is rising they will act by lifting their prices to cover anticipated extra costs. That is not just my view. That is not just the view of economists. It is the view of the Chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, who recently said, ‘Undoubtedly, the state of inflation expectations greatly influences actual inflation.’ It is a fact, and it was irresponsible for Wayne Swan to declare the inflation genie is out of the bottle. Also, in talking up inflation, the Treasurer has been increasing the likelihood of further interest rate increases.
Labor cynically want inflation to rise and rates to rise. In Labor’s view, the quicker rates rise the sooner they will fall—they hope before the election. They do not care that rate rises which occur too quickly will kill the economy and cost jobs. There is clear evidence already that their plan is working. The Westpac Melbourne Institute consumer sentiment index, which was released recently, showed that there was a 21 per cent fall during the last three months. It is the biggest quarterly slide since the series began in 1975. And the Sensis consumer report released today found that 24 per cent of households felt they were worse off, due mainly to cost of living concerns. Petrol prices were their main concern—top of the list. So the Labor plan that we are seeing is: let’s talk up inflation, let’s talk up rates, let’s kill the economy and let’s hike up unemployment. High unemployment? Well, that solves the skills crisis. Rates hiked high and fast? Well, there is a chance they might come down before the election. The only price is more jobless.
I have a bit of advice for the Treasurer: accept the role that you have and master your brief. The job of the Treasurer is to defend the economy; it is to point to the positives; it is to build local and international confidence in our economy. I said yesterday in the chamber that, if Mr Swan does not master his brief very shortly, he will go the way of John Kerin, who, we will all remember, delivered just one budget, in 1991, after serving as Treasurer for only six months. I was a junior opposition staffer at the time and I remember being in the queue at the House Table Office waiting to get my budget papers and seeing, two in front of me, the man who the year before had delivered the budget lining up to get his budget papers. If Wayne Swan does not master his brief soon, he will be in that queue next budget and it will be Mr Bowen or Mr Tanner standing at the dispatch box delivering the budget. This government has to stop complaining about the economy and accept the responsibility. They were elected to govern. They were elected to rule for all Australians. (Time expired)

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2008-03-13,"—On behalf of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Burke, I table a statement on the Wheat Export Marketing Bill 2008 and I seek leave to incorporate the statement in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
Australia’s export wheat marketing arrangements are in desperate need of reform. The current arrangements are a shambles and have failed growers on several levels – the governance arrangements have failed, the management of the single desk has failed and, importantly, the arrangements have also failed growers morally.
The arrangements put in place in 1999 by the previous Government – the granting of a legislative monopoly to a private corporation, AWB Limited – was always destined to fail as it put in place inappropriate incentives without the necessary checks and balances.
The subsequent bandaids applied to the arrangements to get them through the current situation are exactly that – bandaids – bandaids that have merely patched up an ineffective and inefficient system without remedying the underlying defects.
Governance arrangements
You have to ask: why do we have the current governance arrangements? A statutory authority, the Australian Wheat Board, was privatised in 1999 and the legislative monopoly for the export of wheat handed to a private corporation. When a government entity holding a monopoly or a dominant market position was privatised it was common practice to put in place strong regulatory arrangements.
But in this instance, what did growers get? The Wheat Export Authority (WEA). A body with few powers and which was hamstrung from the start. An organisation that Senator Heffernan famously referred to as ‘a bed of pansies, when what’s needed is a thousand-pound gorilla’.
The WEA was limited to reporting to growers after the fact, was restricted in the information it could obtain from AWB and restricted in what it could report to growers because AWB claimed all information as ‘commercial-in-confidence’. It was the regulator you had when you weren’t having a regulator.
The Member for O’Connor could see the flaws in the arrangements in 1999 and said so in this House on many occasions.
Without a strong, effective regulator it is no surprise that things unfolded as they did. The incentives on AWB Limited to exploit its position and behave as a law unto itself were unfettered.
Moral imperative
It is growers, Mr Speaker, who should be most disturbed by what has happened. Their trust in the former management of AWB Limited was betrayed.
As Commissioner Cole said in his report:
A government grant, by legislation, of a monopoly power confers on the recipient a great privilege. It carries with it a commensurate obligation. That obligation is to conduct itself in accordance with high ethical standards. The reason such an obligation is imposed is because, by law, persons are denied choice with whom they may deal.
Sadly, as has been extensively chronicled, the former management of AWB Limited did not live up to these obligations.
The actions of former AWB executives cost Australian wheat growers and the Australian economy enormously. The reputation of Australia as a fair trading nation was tarnished. The time to repair the damage is now.
The flaws and consequences in the current arrangements
Supporters of the single desk argue that the monopoly power extracts a price premium on the world market and this is passed onto growers.
The evidence to support this theory is lacking.
In normal years, Australia accounts for around 15 per cent of the world wheat trade, which is not enough to exert any significant monopoly power. The ACCC, in its merger guidelines, sets 40 per cent market share as the level for exerting monopoly power.
While Australian wheat does obtain a price premium in the market, this is due to its superior milling characteristics. We get a price premium because we have the best wheat.
Mr Speaker, there have been numerous studies and reports on the single desk over the years. One report, however, stands out for its independence and that is the National Competition Policy Review of the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 held in 2000.
That review, conducted by Mr Malcolm Irving, Mr Jeff Arney and Professor Bob Lindner, could not find any clear, credible evidence that the export wheat marketing arrangements were of benefit to the Australian community. In fact, they said:
On balance, the Committee came to the view that the introduction of more competition into export wheat marketing in the future would more likely deliver net benefits to growers and to the wider community than continuation of the current arrangements….(page 7)
While some growers believe that the single desk has operated in their interests, you only have to peruse the recent reports of the Export Wheat Commission to see this has not been the case. For example, a recent report by the Export Wheat Commission estimates that growers were worse off by $14 million on ship chartering costs because of the absence of competitive forces in the transport supply chain.
The industry needs significant reform to increase the level of competition. Competitive forces are needed so that costs in the marketing and logistics sectors are minimised. Only then will returns to growers be maximised.
And worst of all, as Commissioner Cole noted, many growers have no option. Those in the west are tied to the single desk. At least in the eastern states growers have the option of selling their wheat into the domestic market – and in recent years have shown their willingness to use that option.
Need for legislative change
It is now time to remedy these defects.
The latest bandaid applied to the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 is about to expire. The power for me as Minister to grant or refuse export permits expires on 30 June 2008.
At that point, the Export Wheat Commission will become the final arbiter on whether an export permit should be issued. Growers will face considerable uncertainty about the marketing of their wheat on issues such as who may be granted permits and how will AWB be able to manage its obligations under the Act to run pools.
Worse, under the current legislation – without the government’s proposed reforms – there will be no protection for growers in the form of a probity test, and there will be no protection for growers from possible anti-competitive behaviour.
Even AWB Limited considers the situation undesirable. As Mr Gordon Davis, the CEO of AWB Limited, said on 6 March:
If the [draft legislation] is not approved in the Senate, wheat growers will be left in a twilight zone where AWB is expected to run a National Pool without the bulk veto and bulk export permits can be issued to other marketers and traders by the regulator.
In these circumstances, AWB would have the responsibility to maximise returns to wheat growers but lack the ability to do so effectively. No responsible Board of Directors would agree to continue running a National Pool in these circumstances and in the current US sub-prime environment.”
Increasingly growers are accepting the need for change. The recent vote by A-class shareholders in AWB Limited for reform of the company, while not reaching the 75 per cent threshold for success, did exceed 60 per cent.
Proposed reforms
Last Wednesday I released exposure drafts of the bills to implement our reforms and that deliver on our election commitment.
The Bills outline how the new arrangements will work. They explain the establishment of the new regulator, Wheat Exports Australia, and detail the criteria that WEA must consider in whether a company should be accredited to export bulk wheat.
There are clear probity requirements that must be met before a company may be accredited. These relate to the financial resources of the company, the skills of its management, the systems it has in place to manage risks associated with the trade in wheat, and the demonstrated behaviour of the company and its executives.
Mr Speaker, we need to ensure we do not replace a single wheat export monopoly with three regional monopolies at the ports. I have therefore included a special requirement for any company that operates a bulk grain handling facility at a port terminal. On applying for accreditation they will be required to grant access to that port terminal facility to other exporters as a condition of their accreditation.
WEA will also have the power to audit accredited companies to make sure they are complying with the conditions of their accreditation and to obtain information from them.
Severe penalties will apply for exporting wheat in bulk without accreditation and for making false or misleading statements to WEA.
I have invited public comments on the exposure drafts and given all interested parties until 3 April to provide comments. I have also spoken with a range of key stakeholders about the draft legislation, including state farm organisations, bulk handlers and potential exporters. While not all support the new policy direction, I am encouraged by their engagement in the process and their willingness to help achieve the best possible system.
I note, Mr Speaker, the comments from several organisations that support our policy and the draft bills. Of particular note are the statements from the major trading companies and grower groups including the Grains Council of Australia, AWB Limited, ABB Ltd, CBH Ltd and Graincorp. Mr Speaker, I table supporting documents.
During consultation, concern was raised as to whether the changes would have an impact on the willingness of the banks to lend money to growers. To that end, I have met with the Australian Bankers Association who have confirmed that the marketing changes will have no detrimental impact on growers obtaining finance.
As part of the reform process I have established an Industry Expert Group to advise me on the provision of industry good functions under the new arrangements. Some of these functions were previously provided by AWB Limited. I expect the Industry Expert Group will be issuing its Discussion Paper today.
Mr Speaker, I am pleased to inform the House that yesterday our colleagues in the other place agreed to refer the Bill to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee for Inquiry.
I understand the Committee is working to be on the road consulting with wheat growers from the 25th of March.
At the request of Senator Scullion, the Inquiry has been extended by a further two weeks, to report back by 24 April.
I understand the Committee is planning to travel to every wheat growing state during the consultation period.
I urge all Members to support the bills when they are introduced into the House. If they do not pass through Parliament in time for a 1 July commencement date then growers will be faced with enormous uncertainty.
Mr Speaker, I can confirm that Labor members in this place will be voting to support the passage of this important legislation.
The Opposition needs to clearly understand that if we don’t change the legislation which the previous government have left us with, there will be no protection for growers from the possibility of anti-competitive behaviour, and there will be no protection for growers in the form of a probity test.
Growers need the certainty of knowing that the buyers of their wheat have the reputation and financial backing to pay for their crop. That certainty can be delivered today by the Opposition declaring its support for these changes.
The Opposition failed to deliver this reform in government. Should they continue to frustrate this reform from Opposition then they must be prepared to stand up and accept the responsibility for the consequent impact to growers and their families.
Mr Speaker, the Australian wheat industry has a positive future under our proposed reforms but not under the existing legislation. It is imperative that these bills, once introduced, be passed by the parliament without delay, an imperative that both sides of politics today provide growers with certainty.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Wheat Marketing Export Legislation</title>,Ministerial Statements,21,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-03-13,"—The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park is of course an exceptional, quite incredible, environmental asset for the people of Queensland and indeed Australia. As I have said on the record a number of times, probably the most significant single isolated environmental achievement of the previous coalition government was the decision to significantly expand the areas within the marine park covered by protection. People may not realise it, but the marine park is not 100 per cent protected. There are a range of different zones within the park, and previously the area within the marine park that was fully protected was quite small. That has now been increased—with varying degrees of protection from full protection to intermediate protection—to quite significant amounts. That has meant an extra responsibility on the marine park authority to ensure the full management of those expanded areas of protection. As you increase the number of protected areas you of course increase the need to monitor whether activity within those areas is legal and appropriate.
There is ample scientific evidence to demonstrate that significantly increasing the areas that are protected within a marine park dramatically improves not just the overall ecological health, which is the core aim, but also the resilience of not just the reef but also the marine park, more broadly, from external factors such as climate change, pollution coming from the land, the impact of tourism and the like. It also, for those who are interested in fish stocks, increases the overall stocks of fish that are available. It was politically difficult for the former government to expand the amount of protected areas within the marine park, and they should be congratulated for having done so. Flowing on from that is ensuring that the resourcing and powers of the marine park authority are adequate to ensure that the full benefit of that rezoning is achieved.
I reinforce the need to look not just to the ecological values of the marine park but also to the cultural values. I am very disappointed that the board of the marine park authority no longer has an automatic requirement for an Indigenous representative. That was a legislative change made in the dying days of the previous government and one that I was very disappointed to see. It was done, I must say, without very much consultation at all. That does not mean that there is no ability for an Indigenous person to be on the board, and I hope that still applies with future appointments to the board. But it also places a greater onus on the authority and related people, including the federal government, to ensure that the authority does better in all its various agencies and consultative bodies in working with traditional owners and Indigenous peoples all the way through the marine park and coastal areas. And, with an area that large, there are very large numbers of different traditional owner groups.
I also once again highlight the arguments that have been put forward by a number of groups, including those that helped provide the intellectual and scientific basis for expanding the protected areas within the marine park, to also look at further expanding the areas and size of the marine park or having a separate marine park in the Coral Sea. I think there is a very strong argument for this. It reflects a private senator’s bill that I and Senator McLucas have put forward in the past to expand the area that is protected through the marine park to expand the zone that is protected from exploitation and from oil and gas exploration. This would create the world’s largest marine sanctuary and would be a valuable ecological contribution. It would further enhance resilience against climate change and would further build on the work that has already been done. So, as a Queenslander, I repeat my call for greater protection not just for the Barrier Reef Marine Park but also for areas further to the east in the Coral Sea. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority</title>,Documents,24,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2008-03-13,"—I also want to make a couple of remarks on the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and to congratulate the authority for the work that it has done over a long period of time. I also want to draw the Senate’s attention to the significant effort the Liberal Party and Liberal governments have put into saving one of Australia’s iconic natural assets. The reef authority was set up under previous Liberal governments and it was Liberal governments that saved Fraser Island many years ago. So two of the very special natural iconic features of my own state of Queensland are places that have been protected and preserved by Liberal governments in the past. As Senator Bartlett generously mentioned, our government did take a lot of flak—and a lot of flak from our own side, I might say—on some extensions to the marine park that occurred last year. I have some hesitations about the way that was done, and I do not want to rehash things that are now over and finished. The compensation paid to fishermen was appropriate but is getting very large.
All of that aside, we certainly do have a great natural asset in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. I would be very interested to see, now that Senator McLucas is a senior member of the government, whether the marine park is extended into the Coral Sea, as Senator Bartlett just reminded us. I think, as with many things in the Labor Party, it was pretty easy for them to make fairly attractive statements in opposition but now they are in government they have many things to look at. They are finding it much more difficult to actually meet their rhetoric. So I look with interest, Senator McLucas, at your proposal for the extension of the marine park. I will be very interested to see Mr Garrett and the Treasurer bringing that issue forward.
The marine park authority now has a skills based board. I think that the board in recent times has been a very good one. Until recently it was well led by Virginia Chadwick. I wish Virginia well in her retirement. This report that we are discussing today was delivered during her term as Chairman of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. I wish Dr Russell Reichelt every success as he now takes on the leadership role in the authority.
The authority does fabulous work in protecting and preserving the reef—not just for conservation’s sake; fishing is still an important industry in the reef area and that should never be forgotten. Of course, the tourism industry in my state of Queensland is, to a very large degree, dependent on the Great Barrier Reef, and huge amounts of employment are created by tourist activities on the Great Barrier Reef. The challenge is always to make sure that you can exploit the Great Barrier Reef in a commercial way through tourism but at the same time ensure that it is protected and preserved, and that the human footprint does not in any way take away from the very fragile ecology of the reef.
There is a concern about global warming and the impact it will have on the reef. I am no scientist but it is certainly something that we have to be very careful of. The reef is a living organism; it is something that I would hope would change with nature. As I say, that is more a matter for the scientists. But I do know that it is a matter that the park authority board are very carefully monitoring at this time and doing what they can to ensure that this great icon of Australia continues in all its glory for centuries to come.
 (Senator Barnett)—Senator McLucas, before you proceed, I just indicate to you that you have approximately two minutes before the end of this segment of the Senate proceedings.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority</title>,Documents,24,1
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2008-03-13,"—Thank you for your assistance, Mr Acting Deputy President. In that case I will just go to one question, and that is the private member’s bill that Senator Bartlett and I moved in this place—and this is for your benefit, Senator Macdonald. The private member’s bill that we moved did not extend the marine park authority area. I am astonished that you have forgotten that, or do you prefer—
—I did not take a great deal of notice of your private member’s bill.
—I am sure the people of North Queensland would be interested to know that you probably still support oil drilling in the area east of the Great Barrier Reef. But let us be very clear: the private member’s bill that was moved by Senator Bartlett and me extended the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park region, not the marine park area. There is a very significant difference in the management regime that would be required if the region was extended, because the region is not an extension of the marine park. That means that an extension to the exclusive economic zone of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park region does not change the management regime in any way. It was purposefully done because it is a very sensible solution to ensuring that the former government could not continue with oil drilling to the area east of Townsville that was proposed under the former Liberal-National Party government—to the very great concern of the tourism industry, the conservation sector and, to be frank, all North Queenslanders. It was a proposal that was well received in North Queensland, and I am sure you know that Senator Macdonald. That is why I need to clarify for the Senate—
—Correct, not clarify.
—You are correct—not clarify; I need to correct Senator Macdonald’s comments so that the Senate is properly informed.
—Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired.
—I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-03-13,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
This report is the Auditor-General’s Performance audit: whole of government Indigenous service delivery arrangements, which was handed over to the parliament in mid-October last year, just before the election. It is an important and thorough document and I will not have time to go through the full details here.
Given the debate last year and some of the debate that has occurred this year regarding the situation faced by many Indigenous Australians, particularly in more remote areas and communities, it is important to look at the adequacy of government service delivery arrangements to Indigenous Australians and to those communities. One of the pluses of the approach by the former Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Mr Brough, in regard to Indigenous affairs was that he did communicate a sense of urgency and enhanced focus on problems faced by many Indigenous communities and people. Having called for a greater priority to be given to Indigenous issues I welcomed that focus even though I did not always agree with the particular approaches he gave. That has meant an ongoing focus and a heightened degree of political debate around issues affecting Indigenous Australians, particularly those in remote communities and in the Northern Territory.
One of the less positive aspects in the approach that the former minister, Mr Brough, the former government and the former Prime Minister took, along with increasing the urgency, was politicising the debate in a much more ideologically divisive way than had occurred before and I think that is unfortunate. We are still seeing the legacy of that at the moment. That is not to say that people cannot have different views or different policy positions. I think it is important to have that contest of ideas. The real problem that we saw and continue to see to some extent was that anybody who had a different view about the approach being proposed in regard to the Northern Territory was accused of not caring about children or of being willing to support or enable the continuation of exploitation of children by paedophiles. That accusation then eliminated the prospect of having rational political and public debate. Either you were forced to agree with what had been put forward or, if you disagreed, you were immediately told you were supporting paedophiles or you did not care, or other ideological point-scoring opportunities emerged that we saw far too much of last year and we are still seeing to some extent.
Particularly important in those debates is to try to move away from an antagonistic and divisive approach, and that is advice for all of us from all perspectives. I am not seeking to solely blame only the previous government or minister for taking that approach. I think all sides could try to pull it back down to an evidence base. We also have to look at what works on the ground. One thing that is particularly galling is when there is a lot of chest puffing, lecturing and criticism from the government level about other people’s failures, or failures in Indigenous communities or attacking various individuals or particular organisations.
We see it in examples like this audit report. As with all audit reports they are about as non-ideological as you could get and identify that we are failing on the basics of service delivery. That is where we need to keep reminding ourselves that whatever approach people are putting forward in regard to providing assistance to Indigenous Australians—who have as much right as every other Australian to get services to meet their needs—if we cannot even work and perform adequately on delivering those services then we frankly have not got much right to go around lecturing other people on their failings.
If there is one job of government that people can expect it is that, whatever services they decide to deliver and whatever service it is that taxpayers are funding, those services are delivered adequately, competently and effectively. I appreciate that is not always easy in remote areas let alone in remote Indigenous communities. But as this audit report shows we are still falling far short of what is adequate in regard to Indigenous service delivery arrangements and the so-called whole-of-government arrangements that were in place previously.
My plea is for all of us not to forget our own responsibilities and as part of the system of government overall for us to keep an eye on the adequacy of service delivery on the ground. We can have our philosophical debates and our different views about what services should be delivered and the legal framework around that, but let us not take our eye off the less exciting issues that are not likely to get on the front pages or where there are not so many political points to be scored. In some ways they are the far more important issues of how adequately those services are being delivered.
This report indicates failures to date and identifies areas for improvement such as the implementation overall of the Indigenous affairs arrangements and the role of the lead agencies including improvement in the whole-of-government governance and accountability arrangements; improvement in collaborative efforts to support effective service delivery including the development of joint funding arrangements; and improvement in ensuring programs respond flexibly to Indigenous need. We hear a lot of lecturing and a lot of pontificating in this place and in the media about inadequate governance and accountability arrangements amongst Indigenous organisations. I am not disputing there are grounds for criticism there. But it makes it a lot harder for any of us to credibly call for improvements in governance arrangements with Indigenous organisations and communities when we are still falling short of the mark ourselves in regard to governance and accountability arrangements according to the Auditor-General.
I also particularly want to emphasise the point the Auditor-General highlights about the need for improvement in the way programs respond flexibly to Indigenous need. This is a crucial area not specifically in the Northern Territory or in these whole-of-government arrangements but anywhere where we are working with Indigenous Australians and providing government services to them to ensure that there is sufficient flexibility to respond to the different needs in different areas.
As all of us here who have had any experience in Indigenous communities know—particularly, to use the example again of the Territory or, in my own state of Queensland, communities on Cape York as well as elsewhere in Queensland—there is incredible diversity in those communities. Even on the cape in Queensland between the west coast, the east coast, the top end and the southern end each community is different. The broad brush of their needs may be the same but the nature of them—the focal points within those needs—can be quite different. The capacity within different communities to work with service delivery agencies is often quite different and can fluctuate over time. Unless we have enough flexibility within the programs that governments are funding and delivering, we are going to continue to fall short. We need to have enough self-awareness to recognise our own failings or the failings of government agencies and to keep the blowtorch on those a lot more than we do.
I think it is all too easy to blame the obvious problems that exist in many Indigenous communities solely on dysfunction within the communities themselves and not look at the dysfunction that exists within some government departments or on the lack of cooperation between different government departments. This Audit Office report clearly shows that we are falling well short of what is adequate.
Indigenous Australians deserve competent, efficient and adequate services that are the same as for everybody else, particularly at a time when they are being used as a political football by all sides of politics. To some extent I think they have even more reason to expect that the least we can do is to ensure that our own house is in order. This report clearly shows that we have got some way to go.",SENATE,<title>AUDITOR-GENERAL’S REPORTS</title>,<title>Report No. 10 of 2007-08</title>,Auditor-General's Reports,26,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2008-03-13,"—The Audit report No. 10 2007-08: Performance audit: whole of government Indigenous service delivery arrangements is timely in view of what is happening in many of the Indigenous communities in my state of Queensland, where the state government simply seems uninterested in and incapable of assisting the people in those communities. It highlights again that the Commonwealth has a responsibility and has discharged that responsibility in the only area that it has constitutional power to do so—that is, the Northern Territory—but has been simply kept out of helping in Queensland by the state Labor government for what were fairly crass political reasons. I hope, for Indigenous people’s sake, that the Labor Party, now having achieved power federally, is able to impose on the administration of Indigenous communities in Queensland as it did in the Northern Territory, although I fear that the actions of the Rudd government in winding back the intervention in the Northern Territory are not a good precursor to positive action in my state of Queensland.
I want to highlight the difficulties in one Indigenous community in Queensland, that of Aurukun. It was reported yesterday in the Cairns Post by a reporter, Margo Zlotkowski, that the Aurukun community has spent an unbudgeted $65,000 per month since December on nine security guards who are providing round-the-clock patrols in that community. As the CEO of that community said, ‘We’re going to end up being bankrupt in a year if we keep paying that.’ The CEO went on to say that one of his employees gave notice to leave because she was so terrified after having had rocks thrown on her roof and regular threats made against her that she would cry uncontrollably at night when any trouble flared. He said, ‘One night she fainted. It was just terrible.’
In Australia you have a situation where employees who go to these communities to help are absolutely terrified for their future. There is the recent case on an island in the Torres Strait where a nurse was raped by 10 men and when she called upon the Queensland health department for assistance they said, ‘Oh well, if you can get yourself down to Thursday Island we’ll have a look at the problem.’ The approach of Queensland Health in that particular instance alone is just incredible in a country like Australia.
There are endemic problems in these communities, which the Howard government recognised in the Northern Territory and started to do something about. Not everyone agreed, but it was the first time ever that I can recall—certainly in my time in the parliament—that a government has really taken action instead of talking about it. But within 100 days of the change of government we seem to be going back to a situation where we will talk about it again, we will have lots of reports, we will have lots of hand wringing and we will have lots of high-profile media issues like saying sorry and delivering apologies. It makes great media, but what does it do for those on the ground? This Auditor-General’s report shows that we have to do much better in the delivery of services. As I said in my speech on the apology, all the apologies in the world given in this lovely building in this lovely city will not make one iota of difference to the Indigenous people who are living in Third World situations in the north of Australia. I am just so distressed at the fact that Mr Rudd is already winding that back.
We will go back, as I say, to talking about it. We will have lots of little meetings with the intelligentsia—people in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra will wring their hands and work out strategies—but the Indigenous people will go on suffering because the government seems to be unprepared to continue the firm and real action that was taken by the previous government. I can only hope that in the next three years this government does see some sense in trying to improve the lot of Indigenous people.
You do not improve the lot of Indigenous people by saying: ‘We all accept that pornography is bad. We all accept that it has an influence on child sexual abuse, but rather than cutting it off as the previous government did, we are now going to let the community decide whether they should have it.’ Yes, sure the kids and the women will have a lot of say in that. But that seems to be the proposal from the Labor government. It is legislation that is not yet before this chamber, as I understand. It is yet to come. Perhaps I will have to look at it a bit more closely, but it seems from newspaper reports on that legislation that we are simply turning the clock back to the stages where governments do absolutely nothing.
As with the case in Aurukun, there does need to be firm action taken. Will the Queensland government take it? I cannot imagine they would. Governments of both persuasions have done nothing for the last 20 years—principally Labor, I might say. I think our side did try to do something about it, but not in the same vein as Mr Brough did. Certainly, in the last decade that Labor have been in power in Queensland they have done absolutely nothing. They talk a lot and get their photos taken a lot, but the problems go on.
This situation in Aurukun really does need to be addressed. According to the Cairns Post report, the community is looking at the installation of security cameras so that they will not have to employ a security guard for $65,000 per month. They are looking at installing 14 cameras in key areas such as the council chambers, the store, the tavern, the works depot, the airport and the health clinic and that would cost about $350,000. Seriously, if the Queensland government will not provide that money, I would urge the federal government to see whether there is some way that they can assist with it. Because if you keep spending $65,000 a month just on a security guard, you are going to go broke and the services that these community councils do provide will simply no longer be there because they will not have the money to pay for them.
It is the sort of issue that a government which is serious could actually do something about in a practical way. Do not get up and talk about it, do not wring hands, do not get photos taken, but put some money into it and address the root cause of the problem. One would hope that you would not need security cameras or security guards if the real, underlying problems were attacked, but in its first 100 days this new government has not shown any inclination to get involved in the job that has to be done.",SENATE,<title>AUDITOR-GENERAL’S REPORTS</title>,<title>Report No. 10 of 2007-08</title>,Auditor-General's Reports,26,1
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2008-03-13,"—I will pick up on what Senator Macdonald was saying, although he was speaking mainly about Aurukun and I want to speak about Mabuiag Island. What happened last week was unbelievably shocking and the insensitivity of the Queensland health department knows no bounds. One really has to query how a nurse could have been treated in such a shocking way when she phoned the health department on Thursday Island and was told—I think the words reported were—‘It’s an unfortunate incident, you being raped, but get over it and catch the next plane to Thursday Island.’ She was not able to do that because the police were coming over by boat and in the long term her fiance had to hire a helicopter to get her out and take her over to Badu Island.
This was reported by Mr Tony Koch, a very reliable and knowledgeable reporter, particularly on Indigenous affairs. I think Australia owes Tony Koch a lot because he has exposed what has been happening, sometimes very sympathetically towards the Indigenous people. He has opened the debate on what has been going on in some of these Indigenous communities. Only a month or two ago he raised the issue of a 10-year-old girl being raped and the perpetrators of the crime being given a warning. His exposure of what happened on Mabuiag Island in the Torres Strait last week really put a chill down everyone’s spine. A nurse was sent to an island—I suppose the island would have 100 people living on it. Her quarters had no locks, no airconditioning and no blinds and she was left there exposed to what eventually happened.
I raise this issue because I have read that the federal government will appoint a commissioner to take some interest in Queensland Health. If this is the case then I think one of the first priorities for the federal government should be to investigate people who are put in these positions on islands or in communities and have no security, whether they be policemen, nurses or doctors.
Unfortunately, I have not been to the Torres Strait for a number of years, but I used to go there fairly frequently, and I could never believe that this sort of behaviour would take place. It certainly would not have taken place 10 or 15 years ago. But I think, as Senator Macdonald has said, that with the porn, the booze and the drugs that have gone in there the whole ethics of the islands have changed. This would never have happened 10 or 15 years ago, and I cannot believe that it has happened now—but it has. A woman, a nurse, was left alone to look after the community, to serve the community. It is a great hardship to be treated like that.
We can pour scorn on the health department—and they deserve every bit of scorn that could be poured on them—but where I am coming from is looking at a more positive aspect of this. If the federal government is appointing a federal health commissioner to liaise with the health department in Queensland, then surely this has got to be a priority of this government to take some action on.
We are also seeing the unwinding of the intervention. People in the communities will be asked whether they want pornographic literature and pornographic movies to be allowed in. If you allow that sort of stuff in, you are going to suffer the consequences. The consequences happened at Mabuiag Island last week. For everyone’s sake, no-one wants to override Indigenous people, but we cannot just allow this to continue. All Australian people want the Indigenous communities to succeed, but everyone realises the talkfests are over. They have been going on for 20 or 30 years and it is time to finish them. The Howard government realised that and took action. Yes, it was unpleasant for some people, but overall it did have overwhelming support. I am appealing for none of that to be watered down. It is necessary. It is absolutely necessary when you go into these Aboriginal and Islander communities.
So I say to the people on the opposite side who have some influence with the federal government: if a federal health commissioner is appointed to liaise with the Queensland health department, for goodness sake make it the commissioner’s first priority to see that the people in these remote communities do have some security and somewhere that they do not have to lock themselves in, if they have locks on the door. Give them some sort of peace at night, which they do not have. I take this opportunity to make those few remarks.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2008-03-13,"—Tonight I wish to provide to the Senate a report on Labor’s Australian Political Parties for Democracy, APPD, work. Over the past two years my colleague Senator John Faulkner has reported on our APPD schemes in his capacity as Chair of the International Party Development Committee, the IPDC. This was the committee that the Australian Labor Party established to oversee our international projects. Senator Faulkner resigned from the IPDC last December to take up appointments as the Special Minister of State and Cabinet Secretary in the Rudd Labor government. As Chair of the IPDC, Senator Faulkner guided the creation of the international projects unit within the national secretariat and observed keenly the growth of our APPD programs.
Also resigning from the IPDC is Robert McClelland, who has been replaced on the committee by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Stephen Smith. The Hon. Robert McClelland, of course, has been appointed as Attorney-General. Other changes to the committee include Melissa Parke, the new member for Fremantle, who replaces Carmen Lawrence, who retired from politics at the last election. Ms Janelle Saffin, the new member for Page, is replacing Senator Faulkner. A sitting member of the International Party Development Committee, Mark Butler, now the member for Port Adelaide, has been appointed as the new Chair of the IPDC.
As ALP International Secretary, I remain a member of the committee. Also continuing as members of the committee are former senator and former deputy president Sue West, who is currently the Vice President of Socialist International Women; Richard Marles, the new member for Corio; Greg Sword; and Tim Gartrell, the Australian Labor Party National Secretary. Dr Michael Morgan will continue as the secretary of the committee and Director of International Projects. The high calibre of our committee members—those who have left the committee, together with all other members and new members—demonstrates how seriously we take these tasks. We wish the retiring members the best of luck in their new roles and thank them for their service on the committee.
The Australian Labor Party is committed to using the Australian Political Parties for Democracy program for a range of international activities, including consolidating democracy in our region and building public diplomacy programs with like-minded political parties around the world. Through the programs overseen by the IPDC, the international projects unit has become a focal point of campaigning expertise, party building and democracy assistance in our region and has facilitated broad-reaching party-to-party links.
With the time remaining tonight, I want to report on a selection of these activities. Over the past two years we have maintained friendships with UK Labour, New Zealand Labour and the US Democrats. In 2007-08, we have consolidated these friendships with a range of exchange and observer programs. We will continue to build meaningful international networks with progressive political parties in the coming years. Our counterparts in Asia and the Pacific were greatly interested in the 2007 election, and we organised a series of programs to coincide with the Rudd Labor campaign. In November 2007, a high-level delegation of political party campaigners and strategists from eight major Indonesian political parties undertook a study mission to New South Wales and Queensland. Our people provided training and advice on the use of ‘campaign positioning’ to address themes of message development, party building, campaign structure, campaign logistics and communication strategies. The delegates observed at close quarters our leader Kevin Rudd and Labor’s successful campaign when they undertook field visits to the seats of Griffith, Page and Richmond, amongst others. This visit capped off a year of intensive democracy-building activities in which we provided technical assistance to the 10 major Indonesian political parties.
Mr Phil O’Donoghue, a senior member of our evaluation mission to Papua New Guinea in 2006, was loaned to the US-based National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, the NDI, for their evaluation team in Indonesia in September 2007. Following the success of Mr O’Donoghue’s mission to Indonesia, and building on the achievements of the past two years, the international unit has committed to providing democracy assistance programs to Indonesia’s political parties as they prepare for the 2009 legislative and presidential elections. International projects will focus on providing multi-party training programs and individual party-to-party consultations on a range of issues to promote and strengthen Indonesia’s burgeoning democracy.
Continuing with our theme of multiparty programs, we have launched two major initiatives for the region. In the first week of the campaign, we provided an intensive course to the region’s women political campaigners in Cairns and Brisbane. International projects course director Dr Lesley Clark—formerly the member for Barron River in the Queensland parliament—and her team delivered a world-class campaign and party-building school for women campaigners from Asia and the Pacific. The intake included some 20 women from Timor-Leste, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. The second major initiative was the launch of the political advisers course for Asia and the Pacific. This is a collaborative program designed and delivered in partnership with the University of Sydney’s Graduate School of Government, GSG. The GSG offers a premier learning environment for current and future leaders in public administration. Working with former Western Australian Premier Geoff Gallop, professor and director of the Graduate School of Government, international projects has developed a course tailored to the specific needs of political advisers in Asia and the Pacific. We received over 100 applicants from all around the world for the 15 scholarship positions. Two positions were also offered to self-funding applicants.
Having successfully launched these Australian based programs, we will continue to deliver programs on the ground in Asia and the Pacific in the coming year. Reports on all our programs can be found at our website: www.ip.alp.org.au. I look forward to reporting on our programs in future reports to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Australian Political Parties for Democracy</title>,Adjournment,27,1
