Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (09:32):  As we finished up last night, I was asking Senator Cormann about the tax commissioner clearly not wanting to anticipate the will of the Senate in respect of enabling these tax cuts before they have been enacted in legislation. Senator Cormann, the answer you gave last night was that there was bipartisan support for these tax cuts, and that was enough for the tax commissioner. Can you advise whether the shadow Treasurer, Mr Chris Bowen, wrote to you guaranteeing passage of these bills or wrote to the tax commissioner guaranteeing passage of these bills?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:33):  The shadow Treasurer in the opposition put out an unequivocal public statement of support. Since we met last night, let me give you another example to demonstrate that this is business as usual. This is a tax cut we are talking about, but you might remember that, in the 2014-15 budget, the government pursued a tax increase in the form of a budget repair levy, and in the precise same manner the tax office adjusted relevant schedules before the passage of the legislation, given that there was a public statement of bipartisan support for the budget measure. So this is the way these things are handled. This is the way it was handled when the government pursued the budget repair levy, which, for all intents and purposes, was a tax increase for higher income earners, and this is the way it was handled in relation to this tax cut for Australian workers on average full-time weekly earnings.

 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:34):  As the government has made clear, this tax cut for Australian workers on average full-time earnings is funded by a crackdown on tax avoidance, in particular a crackdown on multinational tax avoidance. All of the measures on the revenue and on the spending side of the budget are, of course, reflected in the budget.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (09:35):  Last night I asked whether the government had done any economic modelling on the impacts of these tax cuts. You confirmed they have not. I then asked whether the government had done any economic modelling in relation to the omnibus bill and the impacts on families, and you said they had not. I asked whether the government had done any combined analysis of the two bills together, and you said they had not. Of course, I then asked whether you were aware of gender inequality that this bill will continue to propagate. You would not answer my question on whether this benefited male income earners over female income earners. Did the Treasury look at disparities in income and income inequality between regional and rural areas and urban areas?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:36):  Senator Whish-Wilson is misrepresenting what I said yesterday. I did not say that no economic modelling was done by Treasury in relation to the impact of tax measures in the budget. As I indicated yesterday, these are matters that have publicly been well and truly ventilated and the relevant information was published some time ago. For the benefit of Senator Whish-Wilson and the Senate, I table some relevant information about the economy wide modelling for the 2016-17 budget in terms of the government's tax and superannuation plan that was in the budget. Of course, I answered a relevant question yesterday as well and Hansard will bear that out.


In relation to the other questions, no, the government has not conducted modelling to that level of granular detail that Senator Whish-Wilson is now asking about. That is not what normally would happen. Let me just say again that these tax cuts apply equally to all Australians. These tax cuts apply equally to all average full-time wage-earners in Australia, who, if we do not pass this legislation, would face a 37 per cent marginal tax rate this year instead of staying in the lower tax rate.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (09:37):  I thought it was really important because the Greens did actually look at the ATO data and I asked if you could confirm some of our conclusions last night, but you would not. In fact, in some cases you did not want to answer my questions. It is very important, especially given that Senator Hanson, who is in the chamber right now, represents a number of voters in rural and regional areas of Australia—and my understanding is that you probably will be voting for these tax cuts today, Senator Hanson, through you, Madam Chair. Eighty per cent of Australians, people on incomes less than $80,000, are going to miss out on this tax cut. I substantiated yesterday that that is not middle-income Australia; that is high-income Australia, on any sensible measure. It concerns me that a number of occupations will miss out on these tax cuts—the ones who need a tax cut probably more than a high-income earner like me, who does not need the extra $6 a week: clerks, registered nurses, sales assistants, office managers, storepeople, miscellaneous labourers, age and disability carers, check-out operators and office cashiers, receptionists, childcare workers, waiters, retail managers, commercial cleaners, contact staff, customer service managers, chefs, purchasing and supply logistics clerks, kitchen hands et cetera. I have the numbers here from the ATO. These are the top 20 occupations in which less than 20 per cent of wage-earners will receive tax relief. Senator Hanson represents a lot of voters in the bush and you cannot tell us here today, Minister, whether Treasury has considered whether this tax cut is going to be of benefit to rural and regional Australia, which needs a leg-up probably more than anywhere else.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2016-10-12,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:39):  The Greens really have no shame. You did Senator Hanson the great discourtesy of leaving this chamber when Senator Hanson was giving her first speech and now you are trying to get her on board with this sort of misleading rubbish. The Greens are against tax cuts for hardworking families. Just say it as it is. You are the high-taxing party of Australia. We are talking about hardworking Australian families who should not be pushed into the higher tax bracket, because it would be a serious disincentive for people to work harder and stretch themselves to get ahead—and that is all Australians. Australians in the cities and in regional Australia are incentivised to work harder without being hit with a higher tax rate as a result of their efforts.


You might try to polarise Australians; you might try to put a wedge in; you might try to run this really embarrassing little line that you have just run now, trying to ingratiate yourself with Senator Hanson after treating her with great discourtesy, but I know for a fact that Senator Hanson knows better than to go along with that sort of Greens tactic.


Senator Whish-Wilson, you are going around and around in circles. You are being repetitive. You are asking the same questions over and over again. I have done my absolute best to answer them. You do not like the answers and that is fine. You are entitled to that. You do know that there is a majority view in this chamber for hardworking Australian families to get these tax cuts and you are running a solitary filibuster here, trying to prevent Australian families from getting the tax cuts that they deserve. All Australians need to see the Greens for what they are. The Greens do not want Australians on average full-time wages to get the benefit of this tax cut. You want Australians on full-time average wages to get hit with a higher tax rate. That is your right. You are entitled to vote that way in this chamber, but you know that there is a comprehensive majority in this chamber that actually wants to do the right thing by hardworking Australian families and deliver these tax cuts, which are funded by a crackdown on tax avoidance, in particular a crackdown on multinational tax avoidance. Let's get on with it.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (09:42):  By your own admission, Senator Cormann, yesterday, average full-time wage earners will miss out on this tax cut—based on the numbers you gave us yesterday. When we include part-time wages, that number drops substantially below $80,000. If we use the correct economic statistics for middle-income earners in this country, we will use median income, and then, of course, it drops down to $52,000. So, by your own admission, middle-income families are going to miss out on this tax cut. Let me put it this way: how many hardworking Australian families in this country will miss out on your tax cut?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:43):  As I indicated yesterday—and we are going around and around in circles again—3.1 million Australians will benefit from this tax cut. And let me correct misleading and inaccurate statements that you have just made. The government is focusing on average full-time wage earners. No average full-time wage earner will miss out on this tax cut, as you falsely asserted. The average full-time wage is calculated using the average weekly ordinary times earnings determined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. We went through that yesterday. This measures the average wage of a full-time worker, and in 2014-15 it was $77,200 per annum and is forecast to exceed $80,000 in 2016-17. The Australian Bureau of Statistics classifies earnings as pre-tax earnings payable to award standard or agreed hours worked. It is calculated before deductions such as superannuation have been made. It does not include amounts that are salary sacrificed, overtime payments, bonuses not attributable to the reference period, governments payments or reimbursements for travel and entertainment. Conversely, regarding the average wage measures, for both part-time and full-time average incomes, average weekly earnings in 2014-15 were $59,100 per annum. But here is the point: the whole point is to provide an incentive for part-time—

Senator CORMANN:
  You are too comfortable, Senator Whish-Wilson. You do not understand the way these tax cuts actually impact on average working families. The whole purpose is to provide an incentive for part-time workers to work more hours without being penalised with a higher tax rate. That is the whole point. We want families to be encouraged to stretch themselves to put in an additional effort but not to be penalised with a higher tax rate as a result. That is why we are using the measure that we are using. The whole purpose is to incentivise part-time workers to put in that additional effort without being penalised by an additional tax.

This is a $4 billion tax cut—$4 billion of revenue you took off single parents, university students, Newstart recipients and clean energy only a few weeks ago, and now you want to give it back to high-income earners in this country. This has not gone to committee. We have not had witnesses come and give us evidence on this. This is the only opportunity, in committee now, for us to scrutinise this. It has received no scrutiny at all. Under a sweetheart deal between you and the Labor Party, this has been rushed through to where we are today, and the Greens are the only ones in here actually asking questions on this bill. You did not answer my question—very deliberately so. How many hardworking Australian families, for example on incomes of $37,000, will miss out on your tax cut?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:46):  Again, as I have previously indicated to you, we made the decision to keep the carbon tax compensation in place, in particular the increase of the income-free tax threshold to $18,200, on coming into government, which was, of course, a material tax cut for low-income earners. Senator Whish-Wilson is again misleading the Senate. This bill did go to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. So, when Senator Whish-Wilson says that it did not go to the committee, that is wrong; it did go to the committee. The committee provided a recommendation to the Senate that the Senate should pass the bill—and I will quote from the committee's report, the committee that you say did not consider this bill, misleading the Senate. Overall, the committee found that the majority of submissions supported the income tax relief measures proposed in the bill:


… commenting that the … amendments are a step in the right direction to addressing the effects of bracket creep on the Australian economy.


Further, the committee commented:


As well as maintaining the progressivity of the tax system, the committee is confident that the bill will positively influence taxpayer decisions to work, save and invest by offering rewards for effort and creating better incentives to work. The committee is also confident that the bill will better align the tax system with the emerging challenges Australia's economy will face in the years to come.


Three point one million Australian workers will benefit from this tax cut. Not every Australian will benefit from this tax cut—that is true. We would like to be able to do more, but this is as much as we can do and we have specifically targeted the measure at Australians on average full-time wages.

We did not have time to call witnesses and evidence and fully scrutinise this. That is very clearly what I said. This bill was rushed. There was a submission process for around a week; I think there were only seven submissions in the end given the limited time. This is our chance to scrutinise the bill, because we did not get a chance to before.


Senator Cormann, you said 3.1 million families will receive this income tax cut—or 3.1 million workers. Can you give me the exact number of working families or income earners who will not receive this tax cut? This is a genuine question because I actually do not know the total number of working families or income earners in this country. Can you clarify how many will not get this in exact terms? You have told us that 3.1 million will. What is the total number of working families that will not get this tax cut?

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (09:50):  I have been listening to this debate and I will be supporting the government on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Income Tax Relief) Bill 2016. I think Senator Whish-Wilson made a comment that I support those hardworking Australians in rural and regional Australia, and I do. I am concerned about all hardworking Australians. But I feel that this is very much nitpicking by the Greens senator. The country is in dire straits with the debt that we have and we need to address it. But I also know that Australians feel that they are taxed to the hilt. We have to show that those hardworking Australians are given some relief. You may talk about the others that will not come into this bracket—actually those ones that are not going to receive this tax break—but the fact is that those on lower incomes get tax relief in other areas. The government gives them tax relief with the family payments and other areas. Australians on this bracket, around $80,000 or $100,000, feel that they are constantly picking up the pieces and paying for costs for the lower-social-income earners in this country or those that are on a welfare payment. If we do not start giving them some incentive and something that shows we are thinking of them as well then they feel there is no hope. They are constantly being taxed to the hilt.


I think it is fair and it is a start by the government. Yes, we have to look after the lower-socioeconomic people in this country and help them wherever we can. The fact is, if we can rein in government debt and government spending, then we will be able to help more Australians. But I think that it is just a start to give some incentive to those that have worked hard. They have studied to get into a position to earn $80,000. By all means, with today's cost of living in this country, it is not a lot of money, especially when you are rearing a family. I understand that, but at least it is a start and that is what the government is trying to address. You cannot deny that. In other areas the government looks after people on low wages. But I feel that I will be supporting the government on this bill, and that is all I have to say.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",NXT,2016-10-12,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (09:53):  I want to indicate that I was not able to contribute to the second reading stages of this bill yesterday because I was, along with Senator Sterle and Senator Scullion, at the funeral for the brave and wonderful Michael Koren yesterday. He is someone who is well known to many people in this building. My colleague Senator Kakoschke-Moore indicated our position to the bill, coming from a slightly different perspective, and I hope I am not accused of nitpicking—or Nickpicking—in terms of the questions I will put to the finance minister. 


Further to the questions that Senator Whish-Wilson has been asking on modelling of the impact of this tax cut, the concern we have expressed—that Senator Kakoschke-Moore, as part of the Nick Xenophon Team, has expressed—is that we are worried about the future of manufacturing in this country. Assistance is needed, desperately, for Arrium; the automotive sector has up to 200,000 jobs falling off a cliff, potentially, by the end of next year, when car making in this country closes down; and manufacturing in this country is at a crisis point, down to six per cent of our GDP.


In respect of these tax cuts and the $4 billion in forgone revenue, has any economic modelling been done on spending that revenue on, for instance, providing loans or assistance to our steel industry or to our manufacturing industry; on job programs; on extending, for instance, the Automotive Diversification Program or on extending the Next Generation Manufacturing Investment Program, through the department of industry, for emerging manufacturers, manufacturers transitioning from the close of the auto sector? Has any modelling been done to say what the comparative benefits would be, in economic terms, if we took some of that $4 billion and spent it on programs that would generate or save jobs—the many tens of thousands of jobs we expect will be lost when car making in this country closes down?


Right now, I am struggling to see the assistance that is needed to ensure that jobs are saved in the steel and auto sectors, and in manufacturing more generally. The impact of those many tens of thousands of job losses will be a big increase in our welfare bill and decreased tax receipts from those corporations, those companies, that shut down. In Whyalla, if Arrium falls over, we are talking of a 'Detroit-level event', according to Professor John Spoehr of the University of Adelaide. I think what Professor Spoehr says is a salutary warning, if we do not get this right. In the context of this bill, was comparative analysis done on diverting some of the $4 billion worth of tax cuts to other expenditures to boost industry or manufacturing in this country?

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2016-10-12,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:57):  Firstly, I have tabled an outline of the economic modelling that was undertaken, which was, of course, published at the time of the budget. Secondly, the Australian government already spends too much. When we came into government, we inherited a spending growth trajectory as a share of the economy that was growing to 26.5 per cent by 2023-24 and rising—according to the Intergenerational report—to in excess of 30 per cent as a share of the economy. Obviously the tax as a share of GDP ratio has, for a very long time, been well below that. If we were to try and chase that level of increased public expenditure as a share of the economy with ever increased taxes, it would absolutely damage the economy. It would put us into a recession. It would drive Australians out of jobs. 


What we need to do in Australia is actually bring down public spending as a share of the economy in order to protect economic growth and job opportunities into the future. If we keep spending more than we have, if we keep ramping up the level of debt—debt is deferred taxation—it means that we would have to impose even higher taxes or deeper spending cuts down the track. That is something that would damage the economy, not help the economy, which is what I understand Senator Xenophon is seeking to do. Specifically, in terms of the economy-wide impacts of the government's tax package, as I have previously indicated, they have been assessed as contributing around one per cent to the size of Australian GDP over the long run. That includes, of course, the modest personal income tax cuts we are discussing here today and the Ten Year Enterprise Tax Plan.


Finally, I say to you, Senator Xenophon, what I said to Senator Whish-Wilson: these tax cuts are not funded through spending cuts; these tax cuts are funded through tax increases in other areas. We are funding these tax cuts for hardworking Australian workers, hardworking Australian families, through additional revenue from a crackdown on tax avoidance, which is laid out in the budget, and through a crackdown on multinational tax avoidance, which is also laid out in the budget. But the proposition that, somehow, in Australia we can continue to ramp up the proportion of public expenditure in the economy and chase that increasing share of public spending in the economy with ever-increasing tax burdens in the economy is not a proposition that the government supports, because we are very conscious of the fact that if we want to be as successful as possible moving forward then we need to be internationally competitive. We need to ensure that our tax system is as growth-friendly as possible, and we need to raise the necessary revenue for government in the most efficient and least distorting way possible, and in a way that least detracts from economic growth opportunities into the future, so that on the back of stronger economic growth we can generate more revenue for government to invest in the important benefits and services provided by government—not by increasing the share of taxes in the economy but by increasing the size of the economy and having more revenue at a lower share.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:01):  I have a genuine enormous regard for the Minister for Finance's intellect, his hard work, and his great work ethic, so that is why I am quite surprised that he has completely failed to answer the question. Perhaps I need to rephrase the question. There are $4 billion worth of tax cuts. ACOSS, the Australian Council of Social Services, is an organisation that worked in good faith and successfully with Minister Morrison, when he was the Minister for Social Services, to bring about changes to the tapering rates, which was something that was opposed by the Australian Labor Party and the Greens. So you cannot put ACOSS in the camp of saying that they are always against the government, because they worked constructively with the government on that piece of legislation. ACOSS says:


It is unconscionable that at the same time this Bill is being considered, Social Security Bills before the Parliament propose cuts to payments for the poorest households, including $50 a week for a sole parent with two teenage children with no private income and $47 for an unemployed 23 year old.


That is something that Senator Whish-Wilson has well traversed so I will not repeat that. But the particular question I have—and something that I think Senator Whish-Wilson would refer to as going into the 'granular details'— is that this modelling does not go into those granular details of what the economic impact would be. What would the impact be if some of that money was diverted to the Automotive Diversification Program, or the Automotive Transformation Scheme—which is due to be underspent by $1.24 billion—and was actually spent in stronger economic growth for those industries? What would the impact be if it was spent on businesses such as a SupaShock in Adelaide which, with a bit of assistance, could accelerate its economic growth and its business plan, to go from 20 to 120 employees much sooner than under its current business plan, and could get those export markets? The point is—and I worry that the minister is looking a bit bored—that in terms of stronger economic growth—




Senator Cormann:
  That is unfair.




Senator XENOPHON:
  Senator Cormann says that it is unfair. Maybe my question is a bit boring, so I will take that! All I am asking is this: has any modelling been done to consider what the economic benefits would be to increase funds such as the Automotive Transformation Scheme, the Next Generation Manufacturing Investment Programme, or the Automotive Diversification Program? Spending some money on doing that could reap significant dividends in terms of increased employment, more people paying PAYE tax, companies earning more money and paying more company tax, and the general multiplier effect on the economy of that economic activity. Right now, the modelling done by the University of Adelaide and the work done by the Bracks review in the auto sector show that we are going to face a multi-billion dollar hit to the economy, in the order of $22 billion, when the auto sector shuts down. Surely that is something that ought to have been considered in the balancing act between these tax cuts and issues of industry assistance.

):  I thank Senator Xenophon for that question. I was listening attentively to the question in a very interested fashion. Let me make this point, and I will do my absolute best to precisely answer the question. There are an infinity of ideas and suggestions that are brought to us for increased government expenditure. The propositions that you have just put on the table are a number out of a great plethora of propositions that are put to the government for additional expenditure, and all of them generally come with the proposition that if only the government were to spend more money on this, that and the other it would be good for economic growth. It is completely impractical for the government to model the potential implications of every single good idea that people think they might have for the government to spend more of the money that the government does not have. The government is in deficit; the government's expenditure as a share of the economy is too high. If we want the economy to be as strong as possible, if we want Australian families to have the best possible opportunity to get ahead, we have to bring public expenditure as a share of the economy down so that our revenue has a chance to catch up and we can get the budget back into balance.


This tax cut for hardworking families is not funded by spending cuts. This tax cut for hardworking families is funded by a crackdown on tax avoidance, in particular a crackdown on multinational tax avoidance, and a series of measures that are reflected in the budget. The important macro-economic point here is that we cannot increase the overall tax burden in the economy without limit to catch up ever-increasing levels of expenditure in relation to a whole series of good ideas that people bring to government from time to time, because it would force the tax burden in the economy up to a level that would damage economic growth. The better way to increase revenue for government is on the back of stronger economic growth. In order to achieve stronger economic growth you have to have, among other things, the right incentives for families across Australia to work harder, and lower tax rates focused very specifically, focused in laser sharp fashion, on Australians on average full-time wages is a way to provide that incentive. 


Our Ten Year Enterprise Tax Plan is part of providing that incentive—attracting additional investment, helping to boost productivity, helping to increase real wages over time, which in turn will have a flow-on effect on the level of income tax revenue generated. This will occur not on the back of a higher tax rate but on the back of stronger economic activity. That is what we are trying to achieve. Just keeping spending more money on all sorts of meritorious causes costs money that we do not have, because we cannot keep increasing spending as a share of GDP—that is not the right way forward for Australia. And, no, we have not modelled every single spending proposal that has been put to us; what we have modelled is the economic impact of the government's package in the budget and, as has been publicly disclosed on a number of occasions, it is expected to permanently add one per cent to the size of the economy over the long term.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:08):  I thank the minister for his answer. I apologise for saying that he looked bored—I think I do need some long-distance glasses in this cavernous chamber. The minister says there are an infinity of ideas and suggestions—it sounds like a Buzz Lightyear response: 'To infinity … and beyond!' When I received a briefing from senior officials of the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science yesterday, facilitated by Minister Hunt, they had a list of programs where firms received assistance, usually on the basis of a government grant, but the private company itself has to kick in at least 50 per cent and in many cases two-thirds and three-quarters of their own money, as their own investment, with the idea being that it creates jobs and it creates economic activity and there is a net economic benefit. Does the minister acknowledge that there can be a formula where sometimes if you have targeted government assistance alone, assisting a company to build its export markets for instance, there is a dividend back in the sense that it increases economic activity and there is a net economic benefit from that activity? Is there a mechanism for measuring that? 


For instance, I think the minister may be interested in what they do in Germany—the Fraunhofer model—in terms of targeted industry partnerships between government and industry in that country. In Germany, 22 per cent of the GDP of that nation is based on manufacturing, compared to six per cent in this country—down from 12 per cent a decade ago.


So that we can put each other out of our misery on this particular line of questioning, all that I ask is: does the minister concede that there is a process, that there is a mechanism, to determine when you put government money into a particular program that you can measure in a quantifiable manner the net economic benefit in terms of jobs created, economic activity, tax receipts—including PAYE and corporate tax—and the broader multiplier effect on the economy than if that targeted assistance were not provided? And, if that is the case, surely that is something that should be considered in the balancing act of whether we have a tax cut of this magnitude or whether we have some additional targeted government assistance that can be quantified?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:10):  In the broad, of course, there is a range of programs available across government that do the sorts of things that Senator Xenophon is suggesting. The question for government at all times is a question of competing priorities and balancing, and making judgements on those competing priorities. In the budget that is what we have done. In the budget we have made judgements on these priorities, according to what we believe is in the best interests of the Australian economy.


Now, these are matters of judgement. We have made the judgement that Australians on average full-time wages should get this tax cut. We are very grateful that the Labor Party has made the same judgement. We are very grateful that Senator Hanson and the One Nation Party have made the same judgement. We respect the fact that you have made another judgement and that the Greens have made another judgement. That is why, ultimately, these matters get resolved by a vote in the Senate. That is the way the process works.


We believe that the level of expenditure through the industry portfolio in relation to the matters that you raised is right, according to how it is reflected in the budget. We do not believe that we ought to increase expenditure beyond what is currently budgeted, based on what we know today. Down the track, at every budget update and in every budget, obviously there is an opportunity to reassess the fiscal discipline that we impose on ourselves—of course.


If we need to spend more on a higher priority it means that we have to find a saving, a spending reduction, in another part of the budget, because our spending overall is increasing too fast. Our spending as a share of GDP is too high and we have to continue to bring that down to make it more sustainable and more affordable in the economy. But, fundamentally, I agree: these are judgements. The government has made a judgement. On this occasion, the Labor Party supports our judgement—we are grateful for that. Others, like Senator Hanson-Young, support our judgements—we are grateful for that. You will pass a different judgement, and you are entitled to do that. Sorry—that was Senator Hanson!

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:13):  I have what I hope is a final follow-up question. With respect to the minister, he has fundamentally failed to answer the question. The point is this: does the minister say that, if we put government funds into a particular industry assistance program—loans, grants, export incentives—it can be quantified, it can be modelled? In broad terms, economic activity, increases in tax receipts, increases in employment and the multiplier effect? And if we did do that, the counterfactual is this: if, in the context of the auto sector, where the Bracks review and Professor John Spier are saying that upwards of 200,000 to 250,000 jobs could be lost by the end of next year, what the cost is to the community of the unemployment, increased levels of crime and increased levels of violence? By having a targeted approach to government assistance can we at least quantify whether we are getting good value for money for that, which of course means we can then do a comparator with these tax cuts? That is where I am and, hopefully, that can be the end of it.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:14):  It is Senator Hanson. I corrected that—sorry. Senator Xenophon is assuming that spending more and the impact that the additional expenditure has does not have flow-on consequences elsewhere given the higher deficit and the higher debt that it would generate or the higher tax burden it might require in order to fund it. There is a net effect. How you pay for something matters when it comes to the economic effect. How you pay for something matters. The level of tax—



Senator Xenophon interjecting—




Senator CORMANN:
  No. Again, you might disagree with my proposition, but you are asking: is it true that if we spend more this would have a beneficial impact? Sure. If we can keep spending more ad infinitum, it would have a great impact. But the point is that, if you spend more, you cannot just look at the effect of additional expenditure in isolation without considering the cost to the economy of either higher taxes or higher deficits and higher debt. I guess the government has to make these judgements, and the government has made these judgements. They are reflected in the budget. What is in front of the Senate here today implements a key feature of the government's economic plan.


Just in relation to the car industry, Senator Xenophon well knows that there are transitional arrangements in place and that there is significant funding provided by the Commonwealth for transitional arrangements. You might think it should be more, but there is transitional funding in place, and of course the Commonwealth is working with relevant state governments and relevant car manufacturers to ensure that people are assisted through the transition into finding other jobs.


I remember Paul Keating providing a very comprehensive interview to Kerry O'Brien a few years ago where he was questioned about the impact of lower tariffs on various manufacturing industries, and what he said was right. He said, 'Well, these people had bad jobs and they got new and better jobs.' There is always change in the economy, and we always have to focus on what we can be genuinely competitive at and where we can genuinely be successful. There is a need to assist workers that are impacted by that transition through the transition, and that is something that the government is doing. But to just willy-nilly throw more money at something is not the right way forward.

Senator ROBERTS
 (Queensland) (10:18):  Senator Cormann, I applaud Senator Xenophon's desire to protect his state by reducing electricity costs and looking at renewable energy and also his persistence now in seeking some protection for his state. However, I suggest that Senator Xenophon, instead of looking at you, needs to look to his left and look at the cause of the higher prices for electricity in South Australia, the Greens, and also the security implications there because of the destruction of the reliability of the electricity supply.


I can also empathise with Senator Cormann's dilemma. But perhaps, instead of shovelling assistance to South Australia, what we need to do is to release the burden of the renewable energy costs on that state and make the state more competitive. Right now, we have both the LNP opposition and the Labor Party government in Queensland wanting to increase renewables, yet they are both saying they want to stimulate the Adani coal project, yet neither are doing so, because they are afraid of the Greens pressure.


Senator Cormann, if we were to get the Adani project going, it would provide a lot of revenue for our federal government and our state government. If we made that coal—and Queensland coal is of very high quality—available to South Australia to burn, then we would also ease South Australia's energy costs. Instead of subsidising their industry, maybe they would attract more industry. That is a way out of your dilemma that would both increase revenue and reduce costs in South Australia. I would like your comment on that, and I would like your comment, Senator Cormann, on whether or not there is any hope of untangling the messy and counterproductive hodgepodge that is the tax system in this country, which is made even worse by a renewable energy target that seems to be driven by Greens ideology that is contrary to the facts.

I have great sympathy for the proposition from Senator Roberts. It is important to get projects like the Adani projects up in order to boost economic growth, so it is a very legitimate point that Senator Roberts has made. In relation to some of the other issues, I suggest that we might leave that for a future debate.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2016-10-12,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (10:21):  I will also wrap up now, but I would like to say a couple of things on the record. Firstly, Senator Hanson—through you, Chair: if this is nitpicking, it is a very big nit—$4 billion dollars worth—that is sucking a lot of blood, and it needs to be picked. We are here as a house of review to review legislation. That is our job. This is $4 billion of taxpayers' money that is being given in a tax cut to the wealthiest Australians—the wealthiest 20 per cent of Australians. That means that 80 per cent of Australians miss out on this tax cut. The most updated numbers that we have from the ATO show that 2.5 million Australians will get this tax cut and nine million will miss out. I am guessing, Senator Hanson—through you, Acting Deputy Chair, that most of those live in the bush and are your 'forgotten people'. They have certainly been forgotten here today. You have failed your first test. You have turned your back on them, and the Greens have stood in here and stood up for low-income Australians who we felt should have been given the assistance, instead of the wealthiest Australians.


I do believe that what we are debating here today—and Adam Bandt, MP, from the other house, said this as well—this is a political strategy we are dealing with today. This is all about votes. This is not an economic strategy. It is not targeted. I have not been able to get answers on any detail associated with this particular initiative to my satisfaction. For example, why didn't the government move to reduce bracket creep for those on the $37,000 upwards to $80,000 bracket? What is the impact of this bill beyond the forward estimates? What is the differential impact of this bill on regional Australia versus those in the cities? We have inequality between the bush and our cities, and this is going to make it worse because it is mostly high income earners in the cities who will be getting this tax cut, not those in the bush. What wage growth estimations did the government use to work out how many people will be impacted by the changes? There are no answers.


Are wages growing faster for those in the $80,000 to $87,000 range than for those on lower incomes? There are no answers. Presumably these would have been important things to determine before you gave the tax cut to people earning over $80,000. Has the government modelled the impact of these tax cuts specifically? Senator Cormann has talked about the overall package, and he has tabled something today. But it had no detail at all—no granular detail, a term that both he and Senator Xenophon have used. What evidence will we have that this will trickle down? Did the government look at taxation adjustments? There are all these things. Why are women in this country still being discriminated against in the sense that they are going to largely miss out on the benefits of these tax cuts versus men. What are we doing to tackle inequality?


I am disappointed with the answers I have got here today, and I think it is a real shame that we are giving away $4 billion worth of taxpayers' money and not targeting the really serious issues we should be targeting as senators, and that is tackling inequality in this country.

Senator Cormann, the answer you gave last night was that there was bipartisan support for these tax cuts, and that was enough for the tax commissioner. Can you advise whether the shadow Treasurer, Mr Chris Bowen, wrote to you guaranteeing passage of these bills or wrote to the tax commissioner guaranteeing passage of these bills?

 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:33):  The shadow Treasurer in the opposition put out an unequivocal public statement of support. Since we met last night, let me give you another example to demonstrate that this is business as usual. This is a tax cut we are talking about, but you might remember that, in the 2014-15 budget, the government pursued a tax increase in the form of a budget repair levy, and in the precise same manner the tax office adjusted relevant schedules before the passage of the legislation, given that there was a public statement of bipartisan support for the budget measure. So this is the way these things are handled. This is the way it was handled when the government pursued the budget repair levy, which, for all intents and purposes, was a tax increase for higher income earners, and this is the way it was handled in relation to this tax cut for Australian workers on average full-time weekly earnings.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:36):  Senator Whish-Wilson is misrepresenting what I said yesterday. I did not say that no economic modelling was done by Treasury in relation to the impact of tax measures in the budget. As I indicated yesterday, these are matters that have publicly been well and truly ventilated and the relevant information was published some time ago. For the benefit of Senator Whish-Wilson and the Senate, I table some relevant information about the economy wide modelling for the 2016-17 budget in terms of the government's tax and superannuation plan that was in the budget. Of course, I answered a relevant question yesterday as well and Hansard will bear that out.


In relation to the other questions, no, the government has not conducted modelling to that level of granular detail that Senator Whish-Wilson is now asking about. That is not what normally would happen. Let me just say again that these tax cuts apply equally to all Australians. These tax cuts apply equally to all average full-time wage-earners in Australia, who, if we do not pass this legislation, would face a 37 per cent marginal tax rate this year instead of staying in the lower tax rate.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (09:37):  I thought it was really important because the Greens did actually look at the ATO data and I asked if you could confirm some of our conclusions last night, but you would not. In fact, in some cases you did not want to answer my questions. It is very important, especially given that Senator Hanson, who is in the chamber right now, represents a number of voters in rural and regional areas of Australia—and my understanding is that you probably will be voting for these tax cuts today, Senator Hanson, through you, Madam Chair. Eighty per cent of Australians, people on incomes less than $80,000, are going to miss out on this tax cut. I substantiated yesterday that that is not middle-income Australia; that is high-income Australia, on any sensible measure. It concerns me that a number of occupations will miss out on these tax cuts—the ones who need a tax cut probably more than a high-income earner like me, who does not need the extra $6 a week: clerks, registered nurses, sales assistants, office managers, storepeople, miscellaneous labourers, age and disability carers, check-out operators and office cashiers, receptionists, childcare workers, waiters, retail managers, commercial cleaners, contact staff, customer service managers, chefs, purchasing and supply logistics clerks, kitchen hands et cetera. I have the numbers here from the ATO. These are the top 20 occupations in which less than 20 per cent of wage-earners will receive tax relief. Senator Hanson represents a lot of voters in the bush and you cannot tell us here today, Minister, whether Treasury has considered whether this tax cut is going to be of benefit to rural and regional Australia, which needs a leg-up probably more than anywhere else.

You did Senator Hanson the great discourtesy of leaving this chamber when Senator Hanson was giving her first speech and now you are trying to get her on board with this sort of misleading rubbish. The Greens are against tax cuts for hardworking families. Just say it as it is. You are the high-taxing party of Australia. We are talking about hardworking Australian families who should not be pushed into the higher tax bracket, because it would be a serious disincentive for people to work harder and stretch themselves to get ahead—and that is all Australians. Australians in the cities and in regional Australia are incentivised to work harder without being hit with a higher tax rate as a result of their efforts.


You might try to polarise Australians; you might try to put a wedge in; you might try to run this really embarrassing little line that you have just run now, trying to ingratiate yourself with Senator Hanson after treating her with great discourtesy, but I know for a fact that Senator Hanson knows better than to go along with that sort of Greens tactic.


Senator Whish-Wilson, you are going around and around in circles. You are being repetitive. You are asking the same questions over and over again. I have done my absolute best to answer them. You do not like the answers and that is fine. You are entitled to that.

All Australians need to see the Greens for what they are. The Greens do not want Australians on average full-time wages to get the benefit of this tax cut. You want Australians on full-time average wages to get hit with a higher tax rate. That is your right. You are entitled to vote that way in this chamber, but you know that there is a comprehensive majority in this chamber that actually wants to do the right thing by hardworking Australian families and deliver these tax cuts, which are funded by a crackdown on tax avoidance, in particular a crackdown on multinational tax avoidance.

And let me correct misleading and inaccurate statements that you have just made. The government is focusing on average full-time wage earners. No average full-time wage earner will miss out on this tax cut, as you falsely asserted. The average full-time wage is calculated using the average weekly ordinary times earnings determined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. We went through that yesterday. This measures the average wage of a full-time worker, and in 2014-15 it was $77,200 per annum and is forecast to exceed $80,000 in 2016-17. The Australian Bureau of Statistics classifies earnings as pre-tax earnings payable to award standard or agreed hours worked. It is calculated before deductions such as superannuation have been made. It does not include amounts that are salary sacrificed, overtime payments, bonuses not attributable to the reference period, governments payments or reimbursements for travel and entertainment. Conversely, regarding the average wage measures, for both part-time and full-time average incomes, average weekly earnings in 2014-15 were $59,100 per annum.

We want families to be encouraged to stretch themselves to put in an additional effort but not to be penalised with a higher tax rate as a result.

 (Tasmania) (09:45):  Senator Cormann, this bill did not go to committee. This is a $4 billion tax cut—$4 billion of revenue you took off single parents, university students, Newstart recipients and clean energy only a few weeks ago, and now you want to give it back to high-income earners in this country. This has not gone to committee. We have not had witnesses come and give us evidence on this. This is the only opportunity, in committee now, for us to scrutinise this. It has received no scrutiny at all. Under a sweetheart deal between you and the Labor Party, this has been rushed through to where we are today, and the Greens are the only ones in here actually asking questions on this bill. You did not answer my question—very deliberately so. How many hardworking Australian families, for example on incomes of $37,000, will miss out on your tax cut?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:46):  Again, as I have previously indicated to you, we made the decision to keep the carbon tax compensation in place, in particular the increase of the income-free tax threshold to $18,200, on coming into government, which was, of course, a material tax cut for low-income earners. Senator Whish-Wilson is again misleading the Senate. This bill did go to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. So, when Senator Whish-Wilson says that it did not go to the committee, that is wrong; it did go to the committee. The committee provided a recommendation to the Senate that the Senate should pass the bill—and I will quote from the committee's report, the committee that you say did not consider this bill, misleading the Senate. Overall, the committee found that the majority of submissions supported the income tax relief measures proposed in the bill:


… commenting that the … amendments are a step in the right direction to addressing the effects of bracket creep on the Australian economy.


Further, the committee commented:


As well as maintaining the progressivity of the tax system, the committee is confident that the bill will positively influence taxpayer decisions to work, save and invest by offering rewards for effort and creating better incentives to work. The committee is also confident that the bill will better align the tax system with the emerging challenges Australia's economy will face in the years to come.


Three point one million Australian workers will benefit from this tax cut. Not every Australian will benefit from this tax cut—that is true. We would like to be able to do more, but this is as much as we can do and we have specifically targeted the measure at Australians on average full-time wages.

We did not have time to call witnesses and evidence and fully scrutinise this. That is very clearly what I said. This bill was rushed. There was a submission process for around a week; I think there were only seven submissions in the end given the limited time. This is our chance to scrutinise the bill, because we did not get a chance to before.


Senator Cormann, you said 3.1 million families will receive this income tax cut—or 3.1 million workers. Can you give me the exact number of working families or income earners who will not receive this tax cut? This is a genuine question because I actually do not know the total number of working families or income earners in this country. Can you clarify how many will not get this in exact terms? You have told us that 3.1 million will. What is the total number of working families that will not get this tax cut?

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (09:50):  I have been listening to this debate and I will be supporting the government on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Income Tax Relief) Bill 2016. I think Senator Whish-Wilson made a comment that I support those hardworking Australians in rural and regional Australia, and I do. I am concerned about all hardworking Australians. But I feel that this is very much nitpicking by the Greens senator. The country is in dire straits with the debt that we have and we need to address it. But I also know that Australians feel that they are taxed to the hilt. We have to show that those hardworking Australians are given some relief. You may talk about the others that will not come into this bracket—actually those ones that are not going to receive this tax break—but the fact is that those on lower incomes get tax relief in other areas. The government gives them tax relief with the family payments and other areas. Australians on this bracket, around $80,000 or $100,000, feel that they are constantly picking up the pieces and paying for costs for the lower-social-income earners in this country or those that are on a welfare payment. If we do not start giving them some incentive and something that shows we are thinking of them as well then they feel there is no hope. They are constantly being taxed to the hilt.


I think it is fair and it is a start by the government. Yes, we have to look after the lower-socioeconomic people in this country and help them wherever we can. The fact is, if we can rein in government debt and government spending, then we will be able to help more Australians. But I think that it is just a start to give some incentive to those that have worked hard. They have studied to get into a position to earn $80,000. By all means, with today's cost of living in this country, it is not a lot of money, especially when you are rearing a family. I understand that, but at least it is a start and that is what the government is trying to address. You cannot deny that. In other areas the government looks after people on low wages. But I feel that I will be supporting the government on this bill, and that is all I have to say.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",NXT,2016-10-12,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (09:53):  I want to indicate that I was not able to contribute to the second reading stages of this bill yesterday because I was, along with Senator Sterle and Senator Scullion, at the funeral for the brave and wonderful Michael Koren yesterday. He is someone who is well known to many people in this building. My colleague Senator Kakoschke-Moore indicated our position to the bill, coming from a slightly different perspective, and I hope I am not accused of nitpicking—or Nickpicking—in terms of the questions I will put to the finance minister. 


Further to the questions that Senator Whish-Wilson has been asking on modelling of the impact of this tax cut, the concern we have expressed—that Senator Kakoschke-Moore, as part of the Nick Xenophon Team, has expressed—is that we are worried about the future of manufacturing in this country. Assistance is needed, desperately, for Arrium; the automotive sector has up to 200,000 jobs falling off a cliff, potentially, by the end of next year, when car making in this country closes down; and manufacturing in this country is at a crisis point, down to six per cent of our GDP.


In respect of these tax cuts and the $4 billion in forgone revenue, has any economic modelling been done on spending that revenue on, for instance, providing loans or assistance to our steel industry or to our manufacturing industry; on job programs; on extending, for instance, the Automotive Diversification Program or on extending the Next Generation Manufacturing Investment Program, through the department of industry, for emerging manufacturers, manufacturers transitioning from the close of the auto sector? Has any modelling been done to say what the comparative benefits would be, in economic terms, if we took some of that $4 billion and spent it on programs that would generate or save jobs—the many tens of thousands of jobs we expect will be lost when car making in this country closes down?


Right now, I am struggling to see the assistance that is needed to ensure that jobs are saved in the steel and auto sectors, and in manufacturing more generally. The impact of those many tens of thousands of job losses will be a big increase in our welfare bill and decreased tax receipts from those corporations, those companies, that shut down. In Whyalla, if Arrium falls over, we are talking of a 'Detroit-level event', according to Professor John Spoehr of the University of Adelaide. I think what Professor Spoehr says is a salutary warning, if we do not get this right. In the context of this bill, was comparative analysis done on diverting some of the $4 billion worth of tax cuts to other expenditures to boost industry or manufacturing in this country?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2016-10-12,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:57):  Firstly, I have tabled an outline of the economic modelling that was undertaken, which was, of course, published at the time of the budget. Secondly, the Australian government already spends too much. When we came into government, we inherited a spending growth trajectory as a share of the economy that was growing to 26.5 per cent by 2023-24 and rising—according to the Intergenerational report—to in excess of 30 per cent as a share of the economy. Obviously the tax as a share of GDP ratio has, for a very long time, been well below that. If we were to try and chase that level of increased public expenditure as a share of the economy with ever increased taxes, it would absolutely damage the economy. It would put us into a recession. It would drive Australians out of jobs. 


What we need to do in Australia is actually bring down public spending as a share of the economy in order to protect economic growth and job opportunities into the future. If we keep spending more than we have, if we keep ramping up the level of debt—debt is deferred taxation—it means that we would have to impose even higher taxes or deeper spending cuts down the track. That is something that would damage the economy, not help the economy, which is what I understand Senator Xenophon is seeking to do. Specifically, in terms of the economy-wide impacts of the government's tax package, as I have previously indicated, they have been assessed as contributing around one per cent to the size of Australian GDP over the long run. That includes, of course, the modest personal income tax cuts we are discussing here today and the Ten Year Enterprise Tax Plan.


Finally, I say to you, Senator Xenophon, what I said to Senator Whish-Wilson: these tax cuts are not funded through spending cuts; these tax cuts are funded through tax increases in other areas. We are funding these tax cuts for hardworking Australian workers, hardworking Australian families, through additional revenue from a crackdown on tax avoidance, which is laid out in the budget, and through a crackdown on multinational tax avoidance, which is also laid out in the budget. But the proposition that, somehow, in Australia we can continue to ramp up the proportion of public expenditure in the economy and chase that increasing share of public spending in the economy with ever-increasing tax burdens in the economy is not a proposition that the government supports, because we are very conscious of the fact that if we want to be as successful as possible moving forward then we need to be internationally competitive. We need to ensure that our tax system is as growth-friendly as possible, and we need to raise the necessary revenue for government in the most efficient and least distorting way possible, and in a way that least detracts from economic growth opportunities into the future, so that on the back of stronger economic growth we can generate more revenue for government to invest in the important benefits and services provided by government—not by increasing the share of taxes in the economy but by increasing the size of the economy and having more revenue at a lower share.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:01):  I have a genuine enormous regard for the Minister for Finance's intellect, his hard work, and his great work ethic, so that is why I am quite surprised that he has completely failed to answer the question. Perhaps I need to rephrase the question. There are $4 billion worth of tax cuts. ACOSS, the Australian Council of Social Services, is an organisation that worked in good faith and successfully with Minister Morrison, when he was the Minister for Social Services, to bring about changes to the tapering rates, which was something that was opposed by the Australian Labor Party and the Greens. So you cannot put ACOSS in the camp of saying that they are always against the government, because they worked constructively with the government on that piece of legislation. ACOSS says:


It is unconscionable that at the same time this Bill is being considered, Social Security Bills before the Parliament propose cuts to payments for the poorest households, including $50 a week for a sole parent with two teenage children with no private income and $47 for an unemployed 23 year old.


That is something that Senator Whish-Wilson has well traversed so I will not repeat that. But the particular question I have—and something that I think Senator Whish-Wilson would refer to as going into the 'granular details'— is that this modelling does not go into those granular details of what the economic impact would be. What would the impact be if some of that money was diverted to the Automotive Diversification Program, or the Automotive Transformation Scheme—which is due to be underspent by $1.24 billion—and was actually spent in stronger economic growth for those industries? What would the impact be if it was spent on businesses such as a SupaShock in Adelaide which, with a bit of assistance, could accelerate its economic growth and its business plan, to go from 20 to 120 employees much sooner than under its current business plan, and could get those export markets? The point is—and I worry that the minister is looking a bit bored—that in terms of stronger economic growth—




Senator Cormann:
  That is unfair.




Senator XENOPHON:
  Senator Cormann says that it is unfair. Maybe my question is a bit boring, so I will take that! All I am asking is this: has any modelling been done to consider what the economic benefits would be to increase funds such as the Automotive Transformation Scheme, the Next Generation Manufacturing Investment Programme, or the Automotive Diversification Program? Spending some money on doing that could reap significant dividends in terms of increased employment, more people paying PAYE tax, companies earning more money and paying more company tax, and the general multiplier effect on the economy of that economic activity. Right now, the modelling done by the University of Adelaide and the work done by the Bracks review in the auto sector show that we are going to face a multi-billion dollar hit to the economy, in the order of $22 billion, when the auto sector shuts down. Surely that is something that ought to have been considered in the balancing act between these tax cuts and issues of industry assistance.

Senator CORMANN

 (
Western Australia
—
Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate
) (
10:04
):  I thank Senator Xenophon for that question. I was listening attentively to the question in a very interested fashion. Let me make this point, and I will do my absolute best to precisely answer the question. There are an infinity of ideas and suggestions that are brought to us for increased government expenditure. The propositions that you have just put on the table are a number out of a great plethora of propositions that are put to the government for additional expenditure, and all of them generally come with the proposition that if only the government were to spend more money on this, that and the other it would be good for economic growth. It is completely impractical for the government to model the potential implications of every single good idea that people think they might have for the government to spend more of the money that the government does not have. The government is in deficit; the government's expenditure as a share of the economy is too high. If we want the economy to be as strong as possible, if we want Australian families to have the best possible opportunity to get ahead, we have to bring public expenditure as a share of the economy down so that our revenue has a chance to catch up and we can get the budget back into balance.


This tax cut for hardworking families is not funded by spending cuts. This tax cut for hardworking families is funded by a crackdown on tax avoidance, in particular a crackdown on multinational tax avoidance, and a series of measures that are reflected in the budget. The important macro-economic point here is that we cannot increase the overall tax burden in the economy without limit to catch up ever-increasing levels of expenditure in relation to a whole series of good ideas that people bring to government from time to time, because it would force the tax burden in the economy up to a level that would damage economic growth. The better way to increase revenue for government is on the back of stronger economic growth. In order to achieve stronger economic growth you have to have, among other things, the right incentives for families across Australia to work harder, and lower tax rates focused very specifically, focused in laser sharp fashion, on Australians on average full-time wages is a way to provide that incentive. 


Our Ten Year Enterprise Tax Plan is part of providing that incentive—attracting additional investment, helping to boost productivity, helping to increase real wages over time, which in turn will have a flow-on effect on the level of income tax revenue generated. This will occur not on the back of a higher tax rate but on the back of stronger economic activity. That is what we are trying to achieve. Just keeping spending more money on all sorts of meritorious causes costs money that we do not have, because we cannot keep increasing spending as a share of GDP—that is not the right way forward for Australia. And, no, we have not modelled every single spending proposal that has been put to us; what we have modelled is the economic impact of the government's package in the budget and, as has been publicly disclosed on a number of occasions, it is expected to permanently add one per cent to the size of the economy over the long term.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:08):  I thank the minister for his answer. I apologise for saying that he looked bored—I think I do need some long-distance glasses in this cavernous chamber. The minister says there are an infinity of ideas and suggestions—it sounds like a Buzz Lightyear response: 'To infinity … and beyond!' When I received a briefing from senior officials of the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science yesterday, facilitated by Minister Hunt, they had a list of programs where firms received assistance, usually on the basis of a government grant, but the private company itself has to kick in at least 50 per cent and in many cases two-thirds and three-quarters of their own money, as their own investment, with the idea being that it creates jobs and it creates economic activity and there is a net economic benefit. Does the minister acknowledge that there can be a formula where sometimes if you have targeted government assistance alone, assisting a company to build its export markets for instance, there is a dividend back in the sense that it increases economic activity and there is a net economic benefit from that activity? Is there a mechanism for measuring that? 


For instance, I think the minister may be interested in what they do in Germany—the Fraunhofer model—in terms of targeted industry partnerships between government and industry in that country. In Germany, 22 per cent of the GDP of that nation is based on manufacturing, compared to six per cent in this country—down from 12 per cent a decade ago.


So that we can put each other out of our misery on this particular line of questioning, all that I ask is: does the minister concede that there is a process, that there is a mechanism, to determine when you put government money into a particular program that you can measure in a quantifiable manner the net economic benefit in terms of jobs created, economic activity, tax receipts—including PAYE and corporate tax—and the broader multiplier effect on the economy than if that targeted assistance were not provided? And, if that is the case, surely that is something that should be considered in the balancing act of whether we have a tax cut of this magnitude or whether we have some additional targeted government assistance that can be quantified?

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2016-10-12,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:10):  In the broad, of course, there is a range of programs available across government that do the sorts of things that Senator Xenophon is suggesting. The question for government at all times is a question of competing priorities and balancing, and making judgements on those competing priorities. In the budget that is what we have done. In the budget we have made judgements on these priorities, according to what we believe is in the best interests of the Australian economy.


Now, these are matters of judgement. We have made the judgement that Australians on average full-time wages should get this tax cut. We are very grateful that the Labor Party has made the same judgement. We are very grateful that Senator Hanson and the One Nation Party have made the same judgement. We respect the fact that you have made another judgement and that the Greens have made another judgement. That is why, ultimately, these matters get resolved by a vote in the Senate. That is the way the process works.


We believe that the level of expenditure through the industry portfolio in relation to the matters that you raised is right, according to how it is reflected in the budget. We do not believe that we ought to increase expenditure beyond what is currently budgeted, based on what we know today. Down the track, at every budget update and in every budget, obviously there is an opportunity to reassess the fiscal discipline that we impose on ourselves—of course.


If we need to spend more on a higher priority it means that we have to find a saving, a spending reduction, in another part of the budget, because our spending overall is increasing too fast. Our spending as a share of GDP is too high and we have to continue to bring that down to make it more sustainable and more affordable in the economy. But, fundamentally, I agree: these are judgements. The government has made a judgement. On this occasion, the Labor Party supports our judgement—we are grateful for that. Others, like Senator Hanson-Young, support our judgements—we are grateful for that. You will pass a different judgement, and you are entitled to do that. Sorry—that was Senator Hanson!

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:13):  I have what I hope is a final follow-up question. With respect to the minister, he has fundamentally failed to answer the question. The point is this: does the minister say that, if we put government funds into a particular industry assistance program—loans, grants, export incentives—it can be quantified, it can be modelled? In broad terms, economic activity, increases in tax receipts, increases in employment and the multiplier effect? And if we did do that, the counterfactual is this: if, in the context of the auto sector, where the Bracks review and Professor John Spier are saying that upwards of 200,000 to 250,000 jobs could be lost by the end of next year, what the cost is to the community of the unemployment, increased levels of crime and increased levels of violence? By having a targeted approach to government assistance can we at least quantify whether we are getting good value for money for that, which of course means we can then do a comparator with these tax cuts? That is where I am and, hopefully, that can be the end of it.



The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  Minister, just before you go, Senator Whish-Wilson jumped up. It is always dangerous to assume here, but I think you mentioned Senator Hanson-Young—

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (10:14):  It is Senator Hanson. I corrected that—sorry. Senator Xenophon is assuming that spending more and the impact that the additional expenditure has does not have flow-on consequences elsewhere given the higher deficit and the higher debt that it would generate or the higher tax burden it might require in order to fund it. There is a net effect. How you pay for something matters when it comes to the economic effect. How you pay for something matters. The level of tax—



Senator Xenophon interjecting—




Senator CORMANN:
  No. Again, you might disagree with my proposition, but you are asking: is it true that if we spend more this would have a beneficial impact? Sure. If we can keep spending more ad infinitum, it would have a great impact. But the point is that, if you spend more, you cannot just look at the effect of additional expenditure in isolation without considering the cost to the economy of either higher taxes or higher deficits and higher debt. I guess the government has to make these judgements, and the government has made these judgements. They are reflected in the budget. What is in front of the Senate here today implements a key feature of the government's economic plan.


Just in relation to the car industry, Senator Xenophon well knows that there are transitional arrangements in place and that there is significant funding provided by the Commonwealth for transitional arrangements. You might think it should be more, but there is transitional funding in place, and of course the Commonwealth is working with relevant state governments and relevant car manufacturers to ensure that people are assisted through the transition into finding other jobs.


I remember Paul Keating providing a very comprehensive interview to Kerry O'Brien a few years ago where he was questioned about the impact of lower tariffs on various manufacturing industries, and what he said was right. He said, 'Well, these people had bad jobs and they got new and better jobs.' There is always change in the economy, and we always have to focus on what we can be genuinely competitive at and where we can genuinely be successful. There is a need to assist workers that are impacted by that transition through the transition, and that is something that the government is doing. But to just willy-nilly throw more money at something is not the right way forward.

Senator ROBERTS
 (Queensland) (10:18):  Senator Cormann, I applaud Senator Xenophon's desire to protect his state by reducing electricity costs and looking at renewable energy and also his persistence now in seeking some protection for his state. However, I suggest that Senator Xenophon, instead of looking at you, needs to look to his left and look at the cause of the higher prices for electricity in South Australia, the Greens, and also the security implications there because of the destruction of the reliability of the electricity supply.


I can also empathise with Senator Cormann's dilemma. But perhaps, instead of shovelling assistance to South Australia, what we need to do is to release the burden of the renewable energy costs on that state and make the state more competitive. Right now, we have both the LNP opposition and the Labor Party government in Queensland wanting to increase renewables, yet they are both saying they want to stimulate the Adani coal project, yet neither are doing so, because they are afraid of the Greens pressure.


Senator Cormann, if we were to get the Adani project going, it would provide a lot of revenue for our federal government and our state government. If we made that coal—and Queensland coal is of very high quality—available to South Australia to burn, then we would also ease South Australia's energy costs. Instead of subsidising their industry, maybe they would attract more industry. That is a way out of your dilemma that would both increase revenue and reduce costs in South Australia. I would like your comment on that, and I would like your comment, Senator Cormann, on whether or not there is any hope of untangling the messy and counterproductive hodgepodge that is the tax system in this country, which is made even worse by a renewable energy target that seems to be driven by Greens ideology that is contrary to the facts.

Firstly, Senator Hanson—through you, Chair: if this is nitpicking, it is a very big nit—$4 billion dollars worth—that is sucking a lot of blood, and it needs to be picked. We are here as a house of review to review legislation. That is our job. This is $4 billion of taxpayers' money that is being given in a tax cut to the wealthiest Australians—the wealthiest 20 per cent of Australians. That means that 80 per cent of Australians miss out on this tax cut. The most updated numbers that we have from the ATO show that 2.5 million Australians will get this tax cut and nine million will miss out. I am guessing, Senator Hanson—through you, Acting Deputy Chair, that most of those live in the bush and are your 'forgotten people'. They have certainly been forgotten here today. You have failed your first test. You have turned your back on them, and the Greens have stood in here and stood up for low-income Australians who we felt should have been given the assistance, instead of the wealthiest Australians.


I do believe that what we are debating here today—and Adam Bandt, MP, from the other house, said this as well—this is a political strategy we are dealing with today. This is all about votes. This is not an economic strategy. It is not targeted. I have not been able to get answers on any detail associated with this particular initiative to my satisfaction. For example, why didn't the government move to reduce bracket creep for those on the $37,000 upwards to $80,000 bracket? What is the impact of this bill beyond the forward estimates? What is the differential impact of this bill on regional Australia versus those in the cities? We have inequality between the bush and our cities, and this is going to make it worse because it is mostly high income earners in the cities who will be getting this tax cut, not those in the bush. What wage growth estimations did the government use to work out how many people will be impacted by the changes? There are no answers.


Are wages growing faster for those in the $80,000 to $87,000 range than for those on lower incomes? There are no answers. Presumably these would have been important things to determine before you gave the tax cut to people earning over $80,000. Has the government modelled the impact of these tax cuts specifically? Senator Cormann has talked about the overall package, and he has tabled something today. But it had no detail at all—no granular detail, a term that both he and Senator Xenophon have used. What evidence will we have that this will trickle down? Did the government look at taxation adjustments? There are all these things. Why are women in this country still being discriminated against in the sense that they are going to largely miss out on the benefits of these tax cuts versus men. What are we doing to tackle inequality?


I am disappointed with the answers I have got here today, and I think it is a real shame that we are giving away $4 billion worth of taxpayers' money and not targeting the really serious issues we should be targeting as senators, and that is tackling inequality in this country.


Bill agreed to.

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (12:45):  I rise to speak about an issue that I believe is the single greatest act of national reform that we can achieve together as a nation—that is, change is required to generate new jobs and increase national wealth in our rapidly changing world economy. That reform is reform of our highly dysfunctional federation. 


I believe that today our current intergovernmental arrangements are the single biggest drag on current and future prosperity. It is not a problem that will fix itself, but it is something that very few Australians notice and even fewer discuss. However, in this place we daily see the symptoms of a highly dysfunctional federation: the perpetual, unedifying and demeaning fights between states for Commonwealth funds to pay for the services they are responsible for providing. We also see the apparent perpetual inability of politicians to get things done and the increased disillusionment and cynicism with politics and politicians in our community inquiries, where we see so many circumstances where millions of Australians fall through bureaucratic chasms. These are all symptoms, I believe, of a greater national malaise. 


Australia has a magnificent Constitution—one that has served our democracy so well for the past 115 years. It is one of very few constitutions that were born out of decades of talk and very, very considered negotiations and not born out of war and conflict. Its simplicity is its greatest strength, but it is also its greatest vulnerability—a vulnerability that should never be ignored. Our own founding fathers very carefully and thoughtfully assigned specific accountabilities between state and Commonwealth governments—between sovereign governments. They did that based on which jurisdiction was best placed to deliver services to all Australians. They also very deliberately did not codify how it was to operate in practice. They left that responsibility to Australian citizens through their elected representatives—through us—to adapt and transform with changing times and changing social circumstances. But, as Prime Minister Robert Menzies wisely cautioned, there are inherent dangers for our nation if the health of these relationships and these processes that underpin our Constitution are not regularly reviewed and reformed. Sir Robert said in 1967: 


 … I cannot pretend that the growth of the Commonwealth power … does not present great problems of future adjustment for both Commonwealth and States if both are to co-exist and succeed.


…   …   …


The theoretical reason is that, as good Federalists, we would not wish to impair the autonomy of the States in the important functions for which they are responsible. Clearly the strictness with which this principal is applied will depend very much on political circumstances and contemporary pressures. 


But he also noted: 


But the practical reasons is that the Commonwealth knows that the States are better informed and better equipped administratively and technically in relation to their constitutional functions, their 'reserved' or 'residuary' powers, and that overall efficiency would suffer from too large a Commonwealth invasion— 


into their responsibilities. 


I have reflected a great deal on Sir Robert's cautionary note and I think sadly, today, for most Australians, if not all Australians, how prescient he was in those observations. Reform and centralisation of powers, particularly financial powers, have progressively occurred for over a century now in Australia, but rarely have we ever stopped to consider where these reforms are progressively taking us as a nation. Are they taking us somewhere better or are they taking us somewhere worse? 


In politics, money is power. Today's vertical and horizontal fiscal equalisation and our Byzantine COAG processes are some of the main drivers of our national dysfunction and national economic underperformance. Our founding fathers may have been great constitutional drafters but they were lousy with numbers and accounting in their estimation of what the cost of government would be to deliver services. 


Prior to Federation it was predicted that a federal government's responsibilities would only cost 25 per cent of total national revenue and that the delivery of state government responsibilities would be 75 per cent. Today, that is reversed: 75 per cent of revenue goes to the Commonwealth and 25 to the states, and state governments now rely on the Commonwealth for over half of their budgets, which are mostly tied to Commonwealth, not state priorities.


Greg Craven wittily noted that having a Prime Minister talk about states being sovereign is akin to Vladimir Putin turning up at the Ukrainian president's house with his wife and an esky—not very welcome, indeed! But I think that, if Australia is to succeed in a highly competitive global economy as a nation, all aspects of our nation, including all levels of our governments, must be agile and innovative. They must be empowered to respond rapidly to the demands of an increasingly interconnected and disruptive global economy—one that we all live in. These are all qualities that I think most Australians would say are not inherent in any of our bureaucracies today. 


So where do we start? I believe the answer lies in the most unexpected of areas and starts with an understanding of the difference between two little but profoundly important words that today are used interchangeably by Australians. Those two words are accountability and responsibility. So what is the significance of these two little words to our Federation? Benjamin Disraeli once famously explained the difference between two English words that are often used interchangeably—'misfortune' and 'calamity'. He described it thus: 'The difference between a misfortune and a calamity is this: if Gladstone fell into the Thames, that would be a misfortune. But if someone dragged him out again, that would be a calamity.' That is a wonderfully witty way of explaining the importance of the meaning between words.


Being responsible means not only being involved but being responsible for delivering a process. Conversely, being accountable means performance is actually judged on success; it means somebody can be held accountable for something happening or not happening. It is important because somewhere along our democratic journey as a nation an understanding of the difference between who is accountable for delivering the services outlined in our Constitution and who is responsible in a process sense for delivering them has been lost. I believe this is to the significant detriment of our nation. Today, it is almost impossible for any Australian to work out who is to be held accountable for individual government outcomes, which I think significantly increases the cynicism of Australians towards all of us in the federal and state parliaments.


The future prosperity and success of our nation is not predetermined, and growth is neither perpetual nor self-sustaining in a world where many countries and many societies are much hungrier for innovation, commercialisation, success and growth. To remain competitive and prosperous, we must reform Australia's Federation. But until we find a way to restore clear and transparent accountabilities to all of our sovereign governments, and the funding provisions to deliver that, we have little hope of reforming how we deliver government services to and on behalf of all Australians.


Reform of our Federation is hard, but it is possible. To do so, we must encourage all Australians to participate in the discussion and encourage and support reform. It is in all of our interests to do so. The last government, under both coalition prime ministers, engaged in good faith with state and territory leaders; and the conversation on Federation reform, while not widely publicised, has already begun. I believe it is now critically important that these conversations continue, with bipartisan support, in this chamber and in the other place. The time to restart this process is today. I do not believe our nation can wait any longer for the reforms that we so desperately need.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2016-10-12,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (15:02):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today relating to the Solicitor-General.


We, on this side of the chamber, keep returning to the Attorney's evasions on this matter because they raise fundamental questions of integrity, and questions of integrity go to the issue of fitness to hold office. In particular, no more could this be said than when it comes to the question of the first law officer of the Commonwealth. Integrity, of course, goes broader than that, to the wider legal system, which is tarnished when the principal officer lets it down.


The law is a noble profession. Some would say, of course, that it is the oldest of professions—bar one. Lawyers are sometimes denigrated as a profession, and we know that is unwarranted. The legal fraternity understands very well that duplicity will undermine public trust in the law. The late John Mortimer, an eminent practitioner at the English bar and creator of perhaps the greatest fictional lawyer, Rumpole of the Bailey, reported these remarks by his father when he was urging him to pursue a legal career, 


No brilliance is needed in the law. Nothing but common sense, and relatively clean fingernails … Learn a little law, won't you?


The young Mortimer explained his father's meaning in this way:


It was my father's way to offer the law to me—the great stone column of authority which has been dragged by an adulterous, careless, negligent and half-criminal humanity down the ages—as if it were a small mechanical toy which might occupy half an hour on a rainy afternoon.


Mortimer's point was very simple: the authority of law, the great stone column, is at risk if it is undermined by those who treat legal processes and the edifice of law as trifles to be manipulated for advantage. Sadly, that is exactly what has been happening.


We have heard numerous evasions from the slippery and oleaginous advocates that we have here—and we have the chief law officer of this land, the great law lord of this land, Lord Brandis himself. The Attorney-General has usurped the Solicitor-General's capacity to provide independent legal advice to senior officers of the Commonwealth. Even the Governor-General and the Prime Minister—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Point of order!



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Carr, resume your seat, please. Yes, Senator Macdonald?




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  This senator should know, having been here for some time, that you must refer to senators in their correct title. And a second point of order: can I draw the Deputy President's attention to the standing order which prohibits the reading of speeches—particularly by experienced people and particularly by people who cannot understand Mr Dreyfus's writing!



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Macdonald. I remind all senators to refer to senators, and others in the other place, by their correct titles.




Senator KIM CARR:
  The Attorney-General has misled the Senate by claiming Mr Gleeson was consulted on the changes that he had sought—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Carr, resume your seat. Senator Macdonald?




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Madam Deputy President, I raised two points of order. One of those was the one you have addressed. I wonder if you might address the other one about experienced members reading every note of their contribution.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Macdonald. I remind all senators of the standing order in relation to reading from notes.




Senator KIM CARR:
  The Solicitor-General has clearly advised this Senate, through its committee, that the claims made by the Attorney-General about consultation are incorrect. In fact, I think we should all be aware of this, because, on the basis of what the Attorney-General has said, any casual greeting in the corridor by this Attorney-General could be treated as consultation in the future!


What we know, of course, is simply this: we well know that this senator has misled the Senate, and we know that the misleading of the Senate is a very serious offence. This is not the first time. This is not the first occasion on which these issues have been raised. We have seen this not just in the question of the treatment of this chamber but also in the treatment of other judicial officers, such as the Human Rights Commissioner, who was simply doing her job. We know how, clearly, this Attorney-General offended the basic principles of his office by failing to defend the statutory officers in that particular matter.


What we know is that the Attorney-General has sought to undermine the independence of the Solicitor-General and his capacity to do his job properly. We know he has dissembled about that. We know that in fact this is a serious offence and that the Prime Minister should have intervened by now. If the Attorney-General does not resign, he should be sacked. We understand simply this: he will continue to undermine the integrity of our legal system and he will continue to undermine the authority of his own office unless he is brought to book for what has occurred in these matters.

"Duniam, Sen Jonathon",LP,2016-10-12,"



Senator DUNIAM
 (Tasmania) (15:08):  Maybe it is because I am young and new to this place, but every time I have come into question time in this chamber this week I have been continually disappointed by the tone of questions asked by those opposite. We are elected by Australians who live in hope that we might do things in the best interests of this country, that we might come in here and debate policy. But instead we have had three days of questions about something that, I have to say, I do not think most Australians are interested in; they are not interested in mudslinging that is going on from those opposite. The people who come into the public gallery and the students who come here each day for question time must be so disappointed by what they see in this group of people, the opposition, who are supposed to hold the government to account. What has been demonstrated every day this week is that the best they have got is 'gotcha politics': 'This is what someone said, we believe, and this is what someone else said'—and it does not quite match up. I do not think the Australian people think that is what politicians are here for, to be quite frank.


Those opposite have demonstrated that they are completely out of touch with average Australia, thinking that we really ought to come in here and land a blow—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Resume you seat, Senator Duniam. Senator Brandis?




Senator Brandis:
  Madam Deputy President, can I ask your guidance about whether it is within the standing orders and within the decorum of the Senate for one senator over there—Senator Carol Brown—to continually be referring to my colleague Senator Duniam as 'laddie'.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Brandis, I was unaware of those comments.




Senator DUNIAM:
  I do appreciate the protection being offered to me in relation to some of these comments, but, as Senator McKim pointed out, I have been called worse in my time—as has every other member of this chamber, I suspect. 


I have been disappointed at the questions asked every day this week—apart from one question on policy, tacked onto the end of question time today, when they thought they had scored all the political points they needed, so they ventured into the area of jobs policy. In his answer, the Attorney-General spoke about our track record on job creation. In the last year alone, there have been 180,000 new jobs under this government, with a jobs growth rate twice that of the last year of the Labor government.



Senator Sterle interjecting—




Senator DUNIAM:
  Thank you very much for your contributions. 


All I can call this is overreach. They flew into Canberra this week thinking they were going to get a scalp: 'We are going to prosecute this until we get what we want.' They have gone down every burrow and split every hair. They have been semantic and pedants on every level, using up their entire time in question time every day trying to land a blow—which they have not done. They cannot prosecute this issue. They really do miss the point of why they are here, which is one of the most disappointing things about having come here and listened to them today and every day this week.


Senator Carr in his contribution just prior to mine talked about fitness for office. If you want to talk about fitness for office, I think the Australian people got it right when they returned the government to this side of the chamber and the opposition to where they should be. It is incredibly disappointing that they think this is what the people of Tasmania or Western Australia want—that they really want to hear all of these ridiculous detailed questions. Where are the questions about health and education, about our defence strategy, about what is going on with the Bass Strait equalisation scheme? Where are those questions? They do not exist. The questions we get are all about detail, insider politics, the Canberra press gallery hype about trying to knock off a minister—as I say, completely disappointing. Then, from the entire opposition, there is one question on policy right at the end. I think Tasmanians deserve better and I think Australians deserve better. 


My colleagues from Tasmania have spent a lot of time interjecting on me. I challenge them to ask a question relevant to our state instead of allowing their questions committee to run these ridiculous political lines. Prove to the Tasmanian people that you want to stand up for them rather than just score political points. That is what I say to them. That is what we got elected to do. That is what senators in this place are paid well to do. I encourage the opposition, with one question time remaining this week, to talk about things that are relevant to the Australian people rather than try to score political points to get a headline here, a headline there, so they can go upstairs and do a Sky News interview afterwards. It is disappointing—I have said it a million times. I hope they lift their game.

Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (15:13):  I am a bit nervous to get up after that blast. Anyway, I will help you out, Senator Duniam. I know how it works, mate—you get the call; you got a take note. Congratulations, you had a good crack! Senator Duniam and I probably have a lot in common, because I think the standard of political representation in this nation is a disgrace, and a lot of it starts with those who have come straight out of school into a senator's or member's office as a staffer. They have never got dirt under their fingernails. They would not know what it is like to talk to a man in his mid-50s at five o'clock on a Friday afternoon who, through no fault of his own, has lost his job because of some restructure. Anyway, maybe I am getting a bit cynical and a bit old. Thank you for the advice, Senator Duniam. 


The independence of the position of the Solicitor-General and the nature of the relationship between him or her and the Attorney-General of the day has been spoken about before in this chamber. What we have seen here, unfortunately, with the abuse of power, or what could be the abuse of power, at the hands of Senator Brandis with respect to his dealings with the current Solicitor-General, is nothing but appalling.


Just for a little bit of history, I am going to refer to my notes here. The office of the independent Commonwealth Solicitor-General was created in 1916 with the appointment of Sir Robert Garran. Prior to this, from 1903 to 1913, Sir Charles Powers had served as the first Commonwealth Crown Solicitor. For more than 110 years, Australia has seen independent solicitors-general give frank—




Senator Brandis:
  No—100 years; it is the centenary this year.




Senator STERLE:
  And he is at work again—100? Okay, let us go for 100. Whether it is for 100 or 110 years, Australia has seen independent solicitors-general giving frank and independent—there is that word again, independent—legal advice to the government of the day, who have respected their advice and the independence of the office. Unfortunately, this appears to have all gone out the window since Senator Brandis has become the Attorney-General. I wish I could say this behaviour is unprecedented. However, Senator Brandis has a track record of bringing his role into some disrepute, as a member of parliament and as the nation's highest legal officer.


As we have seen, a number of Senator Brandis's colleagues have come out to defend him. I do not get a giggle too often from Senator Reynolds, because there is nothing to giggle about, but I have to admit I had one yesterday when she referred to the Senate inquiry into Senator Brandis's handlings on this issue as—I quote her words not mine, through you, Madam Deputy President—a 'witch-hunt'. Senator Reynolds may see it that way, just as many of her colleagues, unfortunately, are burying their heads in the sand on this issue. But the truth of the matter is that this whole scenario is far from being a witch-hunt.


If this had been the first time Senator Brandis had slipped up with his responsibilities as a senator or as the Attorney-General then fair enough—apologise, move on, correct the record. It is not a jailable offence in Australia to make a mistake and own up to it. However, Senator Brandis's petulant attitude and ignorant reluctance to accept that he has not only—




Senator Brandis:
  You didn't write that, Senator Sterle—




Senator STERLE:
  I was thinking this aloud, Senator Brandis—misled the parliament but also damaged the reputation of the independence of the office of the Solicitor-General can be added to the long list of transgressions unfortunately perpetrated by the Attorney-General. Let us go over a few of them, shall we? Senator Brandis claimed to have consulted—and this came out yesterday in question time—the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, Mr Mick Gooda, before establishing the Don Dale royal commission, when no such consultation occurred. Senator Brandis gave incorrect information to parliament about the letter to him from Lindt cafe gunman Man Haron Monis and, when made aware of this fact, delayed correcting the record for no less than three days. Senator Brandis failed to defend another independent statutory office holder, the President of the Australian Human Rights Commission, from political attacks and, unfortunately, bullying. The Attorney-General subsequently offered an inducement to the President of the Human Rights Commission to quit her position after the commission issued a report—




Senator Brandis:
  Madam Deputy President, on a point of order: I know Senator Sterle has been instructed to read out this rubbish, but the last point is a reflection on me. I point out that a complaint was actually made to the Australian Federal Police by the Labor Party in relation to that allegation and, having examined the matter, the Australian Federal Police concluded that there was absolutely no basis for that assertion.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Brandis. We will check the record and report back.




Senator Wong:
  If I may, Madam Deputy President, in considering that, I would ask that your attention be drawn to the very clear evidence from Professor Triggs before the committee that the Attorney-General did indeed, via Mr Moraitis, arrange for an inducement to be offered for her resignation, and that evidence stands.




Senator Brandis:
  Madam Deputy President, Senator Wong is now reflecting. The matter was investigated, and it was found to be absolutely without substance by the proper authority.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Brandis. I have undertaken to have a look at the record and report back.




Senator STERLE:
  Thank you, Madam Deputy President. Senator Brandis breached cabinet rules by disclosing publicly the contents of a confidential cabinet debate on national security legislation.



Senator Brandis interjecting—




Senator STERLE:
  I cannot believe we were such good friends 15 minutes ago, Senator Brandis, and now you are attacking me. That is very fickle. Senator Brandis famously sought to remove the Racial Discrimination Act's protection against speech that offends, insults or humiliates people on the basis of race. (Time expired)

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2016-10-12,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:20):  I too rise to take note of the answers from the Attorney-General to the questions put to him regarding the Solicitor-General. I would like to pick up on a point that Senator Sterle has just made. I have a great deal of respect for Senator Sterle. I appreciate the fact that he has researched the history. The fact is that, yes, the office of the Solicitor-General was created in 1916 for the very purpose of assisting the Attorney-General in the performance of his duties, including his role as the principal legal adviser to government. What that means, if he is the principal legal adviser to government, is that he is the person who the government goes to for legal advice.


If you go to the Law Officers Act 1964—which is the law which sets out the Solicitor-General's role and functions—section 12 sets out the statutory functions of the Solicitor-General. Paragraph 12(b) provides that one of the Solicitor-General's functions is 'to furnish his or her opinion to the Attorney‑General on questions of law referred to him or her by the Attorney‑General'. Except where the Solicitor-General is acting as a counsel under paragraph 12(a) of the act—which is actually irrelevant to the legal services direction which is at question here—the Law Officers Act explicitly provides only one circumstance in which the Solicitor-General may provide an opinion to the government on a question of law, and that is where the Attorney-General refers that question to him. So if we want to go to the basis of this whole discussion, which is around what has transpired and what the Attorney-General has done: he has actually issued a direction and a guidance note which reinforce a law which has been in existence since 1964.


That brings me to the point raised by my colleague Senator Duniam, which is: why are the Labor Party spending every question time prosecuting this point? I support the contention of Senator Duniam that one motivation is that they are looking for political headlines, possibly even a political scalp. It is like a pack of wolves surrounding what they hope is going to be a wounded person on the government side. That has not occurred.


There is a second reason why they would be seeking to dominate the media headlines with this kind of inside-the-Beltway argument, and that is to distract the media and the Australian public from the things that this government is doing. We have just heard today, in answers in question time from the Minister for Finance and others, that business confidence is up, exports are up by 9.6 per cent, over 180,000 new jobs have been created in the past 12 months and the rate of jobs growth under this Turnbull government is twice that of the last year of the Labor government. When I get out and speak to people in the community—and, having just been through an election, like most other senators in this place I have spent a lot of time engaging with the community, as I do on a regular basis—they are not concerned about the inside-the-Beltway issues. They are concerned about things like job security. They are concerned about future opportunities for their children.


So one of the reasons, politically, that the Labor Party do not want the media, and therefore the public, to be focusing on the achievements of the government is that they want to try and undermine the public's faith and confidence in the Turnbull government. They do not want us to be talking about the fact that we have managed to actually start the job of budget repair by getting legislation through this place, which was supposed to be an unworkable Senate. We have agreed $6.3 billion worth of savings measures to start that progress towards budget repair. They do not want us talking about the fact that, after six years of inaction by the Labor Party on things like making decisions about Australia's future submarine and commissioning new vessels for Australia—which has directly lead to the 'valley of death' in my home state of South Australia, where we are seeing workers laid off from ASC because of the lack of orders from the Labor government—we have now signed contracts with DCNS for the future submarine and we have signed contracts with Lockheed Martin to be the combat system integrator. They do not want us talking about the fact that we are taking steps to implement things like the RAND review and make strategic naval shipbuilding a long-term, sustainable option for growing skills and high-end manufacturing jobs in Australia. These are the sorts of things that this government is focused on, because these are the sorts of things that are important to our national security and to mums and dads and families and young people looking for a future. This inside-the-Beltway stuff is a waste of the Australian public's time.

Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (15:25):  If one were to listen to those opposite about the Labor questions during question time, one would suspect that the rule of law is something which they consider to be 'inside the Beltway' and something about which to score political points. We on this side of the chamber make absolutely no apology whatsoever for stridently seeking to hold the government to account on every aspect of the government's administration. When it comes to the rule of law, can there be any more grave issue for the opposition to hold the government to account over? It underpins everything.


The issue of the independence of the Solicitor-General and the actions of the Attorney-General is daily in the media. It is not just the opposition talking about this issue; it is a matter of conjecture in the media as to this unseemly and unedifying stand-off between the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General, the nation's first and second law officers. This is not something which should be happening in the first place, and it is a great disappointment to me that we have an Attorney-General who is not seeking to uphold the independence of the Solicitor-General and, in fact, is going in the opposite direction by seeking to constrain the Solicitor-General in the advice that can be given to various aspects and elements of the government. This surely is a very important matter of public discussion. It is definitely not a matter which is 'inside the Beltway'. It goes, as I say, to so many other aspects of what is going on in our society.


We know that the job of the Solicitor-General is to provide legal advice to the government. However, somehow Senator Brandis has managed to seriously disrupt the Solicitor-General's ability to carry out the role. In fact, it can be said, as I said yesterday, that he has hobbled the ability of the Solicitor-General to do his job. To make the Solicitor-General have to obtain written approval from the Attorney-General to advise the Governor-General or indeed any head of a government department can only be described as a power grab. It undermines the important role of the Public Service in offering independent advice to government departments and it undermines the quality of the advice provided by the Solicitor-General.


Today Senator Brandis continued to undermine the Solicitor-General, by not condemning the speech made by Senator Macdonald, a fellow Queensland senator. Again, it is a matter of great disappointment to me that we have a Queensland senator involved in seeking to undermine an independent statutory officer. I heard Senator Macdonald yesterday, in interjections, and again today stating that the cause of his concern about the Solicitor-General related back to the fact that he was a Labor appointment. This, surely, is an area in which the Attorney-General should rush to the defence of the Solicitor-General. Appointments occur on both sides of politics, and for a government senator to criticise the appointment of the Solicitor-General merely because he was appointed by this side of the chamber undermines the rule of law that we have in this country.



Australians need to be able to trust their Attorney-General and we need to have trust in our Public Service. However, Senator Brandis has managed to undermine both his position as Australia's first law officer and the Solicitor-General's position as the second law officer. As a conservative, Senator Brandis is supposed to preserve our institutions, not politicise or destroy them. This is a complete mess. Australians are entitled to think, based on the mythology put forward by those opposite, that the conservative parties are the upholders of our public institutions. Unfortunately we see, yet again, that it is the coalition which is rushing to smash conventions which have underpinned our rule of law and which are so important. This Attorney-General has brought disrespect to his office. (Time expired)

Leave granted.




The speeches read as follows—



REGULATORY POWERS (STANDARDISATION REFORM) BILL 2016


The Regulatory Powers (Standardisation Reform) Bill 2016 represents the first substantial tranche of Commonwealth Acts to trigger the operation of the Regulatory Powers (Standard Provisions) Act 2014.


The Regulatory Powers Act provides for a standard suite of provisions in relation to monitoring and investigation powers, as well as provisions regulating the use of civil penalties, infringement notices, enforceable undertakings and injunctions.


That Act commenced on 1 October 2014, but only has effect where Commonwealth Acts are drafted or amended to trigger the standard provisions in that Act.


By standardising regulatory powers across the Commonwealth, the Act is intended to:


significantly reduce the length of legislation governing each regulatory regime


provide greater clarity and consistency for agencies that need to exercise powers with respect to multiple regulatory regimes


make it easier for businesses that are subject to multiple regimes to understand and comply with the law, and


facilitate the development of a common body of law.


The Regulatory Powers Act also ensures that Commonwealth regulatory powers are sufficiently certain and predictable, while being flexible, to ensure that agencies with specialised functions can operate effectively.


This Bill will amend 15 Commonwealth Acts to repeal existing provisions providing for regulatory regimes and instead apply the standard provisions of the Regulatory Powers Act.


Those Acts fall within the portfolios of the Attorney General's Department and the Departments of Agriculture and Water Resources; Defence; Employment; Health; Industry, Innovation and Science; and Social Services.


In most instances, the Bill will not alter existing arrangements because application of the Regulatory Powers Act will result in either the substitution of an equivalent provision or a provision that is the same in effect with modernised terminology or minor technical changes reflecting current drafting standards. 


Where necessary, the amendments will modify the operation of the Regulatory Powers Act to retain existing regulatory powers that do not have equivalent provisions in the Regulatory Powers Act.


In a small number of instances, the Bill will alter existing arrangements because application of the Regulatory Powers Act will result in the acquisition of new provisions or additional powers or functions. This only occurs where such provisions are necessary for the effective performance of duties or functions and the effective exercise of powers under the Regulatory Powers Act.


Alignment with the Regulatory Powers Act also provides an opportunity to consider whether existing regulatory powers or functions are still relevant and appropriate. 


Accordingly, in some cases the Bill will either repeal or narrow existing regulatory provisions that do not have equivalent provisions in the Regulatory Powers Act on the basis that those existing provisions are no longer required or required in their current form.


The standard provisions of the Regulatory Powers Act represent best practice in relation to regulatory powers of general application. That Act also includes operational safeguards, and maintains Parliamentary scrutiny over application of that Act to specific regulatory regimes.


The Bill will also make minor amendments to the Regulatory Powers Act to clarify the operation of certain provisions and remove unreasonable administrative burdens on agencies exercising regulatory powers under the Regulatory Powers Act.


Those amendments relate to:


the ability to secure evidence of a contravention when exercising monitoring powers 


the age of photographs for identity cards


the time period for the making of a civil penalty order, and 


the cap on the amount to be stated in an infringement notice.


Implementing the Regulatory Powers Act supports the Government's regulatory reform agenda, as that Act intends to simplify and streamline Commonwealth regulatory powers across the statute book.


Over the last 20 years there has been an enormous proliferation of regulatory powers and associated provisions, across the Commonwealth statute book. Those powers and provisions vary in their breadth and detail, resulting in inconsistency or unnecessary duplication across regimes. 


Standardisation provides regulatory agencies with the opportunity to use more uniform powers, and increase legal certainty for businesses and individuals who are subject to those powers. 


PRIVACY AMENDMENT (RE‑IDENTIFICATION OFFENCE) BILL 2016


The Privacy Amendment (Re‑identification Offence) Bill 2016 is part of the Australian Government's endeavours to ensure that the considerable benefits associated with the release of public sector datasets can be realised whilst upholding the highest standard of information security and protecting the privacy of Australians.


The Bill will amend the Privacy Act 1988 to introduce prohibitions on the re‑identification of de‑identified information and disclosure of re‑identified information. 


The publication of major datasets is an important part of 21st century government, and is an important part of this Government's Digital Transformation Agenda. 


On the 7th of December 2015, the Australian Government released its Public Data Policy Statement. The Statement provides a clear mandate for Australian Government Agencies to optimise the use and re‑use of public sector data. The Statement provides that, when releasing datasets, Australian Government entities will uphold the highest standards of security and privacy.


The publication of government datasets, including de‑identified data, enables the government, policymakers, researchers, and other interested persons to take full advantage of the opportunities that new technology creates to improve research and policy outcomes.


By way of example, the Minister for Social Services, Minister Porter recently drew attention to the benefits of research with anonymised data, and how it can help break the cycle of welfare dependency by identifying the risk factors leading to such dependency.


To ensure that the datasets released by the Australian Government are protected to the highest standard, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet will put in place a process to govern the release of new anonymised datasets on data.gov.au.


However, in a rapidly changing digital environment it is important to recognise that methods that were sufficient to de‑identify data in the past may become susceptible to re‑identification in the future.


Of considerable concern is the potential to re‑identify personal information, particularly an individual's sensitive personal information. Such re‑identification has the potential to significantly affect an individual's privacy and to undermine the benefits associated with the release of public sector datasets. 




Prohibition of re
‑identification and disclosure of re
‑identified personal information



The Bill prohibits the re‑identification or attempted re‑identification of de‑identified information released by, or on behalf of, Australian Government Agencies, as well as prohibiting the disclosure of re‑identified personal information.


These prohibitions will only apply to information that has been published on the basis that it is de‑identified and in a generally available publication such as on data.gov.au.


The Bill introduces criminal offences and civil penalty provisions for the re‑identification of de‑identified personal information or the disclosure of such information. These penalties are intended to act as a strong deterrent against re‑identification and disclosure, and reflect the damage that can be caused to individuals by such actions.




Requirement to notify agencies of re
‑identification



Importantly, the Bill requires entities that have re‑identified de‑identified personal information to inform the responsible agency of this as soon as practicable. This ensures the agency can rapidly respond to protect individuals' privacy by taking down and de‑identifying the dataset using current techniques. The responsible agency can then direct the entity on how to handle the re‑identified information.


This notification requirement applies to both intentional and unintentional re‑identification—capturing, for example, circumstances where an entity has inadvertently re‑identified personal information, for example by comparing different datasets. Entities that contravene this requirement will face civil penalties but will not be subject to criminal sanction.




Retrospectivity of the Bill



The new offences in the Bill will operate retrospectively from the 29th of September 2016; the day after the Government announced its intention to introduce these offences. This creates a strong disincentive for entities to attempt re‑identification while Parliament considers the Bill. Releases of private information can have significant consequences for individuals beyond their privacy and reputation, which cannot be easily remedied. This warrants swift and decisive action by the Australian Government to prohibit such conduct. 




Application of the Bill



The Bill is intended to apply more broadly than the general provisions in the Privacy Act, and will apply to the actions of individuals, organisations and businesses, including small businesses. Importantly, exemptions will apply so that the Bill will not affect the legitimate actions of agencies and researchers working with public datasets.


Australian Government Agencies will be exempt when performing their functions or when authorised by law to ensure they can continue to perform their ordinary functions and activities such as matching a de‑identified dataset to another dataset or undertaking decryption activities to test information security.


Importantly, the Bill provides a power for the Minister to make a determination to exempt entities from the prohibitions and requirements of the Bill if it is in the public interest. This means entities engaging in valuable research in areas such as testing the effectiveness of de‑identification techniques, cryptology or information security can be granted an exemption so that this legitimate research may continue. Research into methods for effective de-identification of data is an important privacy protection strategy in an era of big data.


The Bill exempts determinations by the Minister from the disallowance scheme in the Legislation Act 2003. This will provide certainty about the application of the law and provide commercial certainty to entities who require exemptions in order to undertake research projects. Before making a determination the Minister must consult with the Australian Information Commissioner, which provides additional scrutiny and transparency.




Australian Information Commissioner powers



As part of the Bill's enhancement of privacy protections, the Bill provides additional powers to the Australian Information Commissioner. Where an agency is informed of the re‑identification of information it must inform the Australian Information Commissioner. This will allow the responsible agency to engage with the Australian Information Commissioner on the issue and provide the Australian Information Commissioner with the opportunity to investigate the matter. To this end the Bill also provides investigation powers to the Australian Information Commissioner in relation to contraventions of the Bill to support the Commissioner's existing power to seek civil penalty orders in relation to civil penalty offences under the Privacy Act.




Conclusion



The Bill will provide stronger safeguards for the privacy of individuals whilst supporting the Australian Government's commitment to the release of de‑identified public sector datasets.


It will do so by deterring the re‑identification of de‑identified personal information in government datasets as well as the disclosure of such re‑identified information and by ensuring that agencies are notified of re‑identification so that they can take any necessary steps to rapidly address issues with published datasets.


Importantly, the Bill will not affect the legitimate acts of government or researchers.


The Bill will act in tandem with administrative processes to be developed by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to govern the release of new anonymised datasets on data.gov.au to ensure the integrity of public datasets published by the Commonwealth.

 (South Australia) (15:41):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I table an explanatory memorandum relating to the bill and seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—





It is with a deep sense of honour, great sorrow and continuing frustration that I rise to speak on this Bill today. 





This is a Bill to deal with what I, my colleagues, parents and the wider community believe is an issue of great importance to the safety of our children.





My colleague Senator Xenophon has introduced prior versions of this Bill in previous Parliaments.





This version of the Bill mirrors the Bill introduced in the 44
th
 Parliament aside from some stylistic changes to reflect current drafting methods.





The reason the Bill exists is because of Carly Ryan. Next year marks ten years since her brutal murder at the hands of a paedophile.





When Carly was fourteen, she started chatting online to what she was made to believe was a twenty year old man named Brandon Kane. Brandon was Carly's ideal boyfriend who portrayed himself as a young guitarist, and she fell in love with him as their online relationship grew closer. 





But what Carly didn't know, and what was purposely concealed from her, was that 'Brandon' was actually a forty seven year old predator, Gary Francis Newman. He masqueraded as Brandon, Carly's teenage dream, in a perverted plan to secure the trust of Carly and her mother who were completely innocent to his sinister and sickening motivations. Appallingly, the fictitious 'Brandon' was one of up to two hundred fake online identities Newman had created in a bid to communicate and have sex with young girls. 





When Carly turned fifteen, she invited Brandon to her birthday party. He told her he would be overseas and that he couldn't make it, so his adopted father Shane would go in his place, another fake persona. Carly had already been chatting to Shane online, and she convinced her mother that it would be okay for him to come along to her party. 





Newman, in his role as Shane, turned up. Carly's mother, horrified that her daughter had become close to a stranger so much older than she was, warned him to stay away from her daughter. 





But Newman convinced Carly she would get to meet her beloved Brandon in person. He eventually lured her to a meeting, on 19 February 2007, at Horseshoe Bay in South Australia. There, he brutally assaulted her and left her to die. 





It took police eleven days to track Newman down. When they found him, on the day of his arrest, he was logged on to his computer as Brandon Kane, chatting to a fourteen year old girl in Western Australia. Police also found a stash of child pornography on his computer, and discovered he had already pursued many other young girls overseas. 





Newman was found guilty of Carly's murder, and is now serving a life sentence, with twenty nine years non-parole.





The aim of this Bill is to make it an offence for a person over eighteen years of age to lie about their age in online communications to a person under sixteen years of age for the purposes of facilitating a physical meeting. 





This Bill also makes it an offence for an adult to misrepresent their age in online communications with a minor with the intent of committing another offence. 





These two items close an important loophole in the law. There is no reason for an adult to knowingly misrepresent their age to someone they believe is under sixteen, particularly if they believe doing so will make it easier to meet or commit another offence. 





The Bill also contains specific provisions to clarify how this offence can be prosecuted and defended. 





My colleague, Senator Xenophon, attempted to address this serious issue with earlier versions of this Bill. This version of the Bill will ensure that there are no unintended consequences of enforcing this law. Instead, this Bill creates offences specifically aimed at the circumstances - a person lying to a minor about their age to facilitate a meeting or to make themselves seem 'more approachable' - that need to be addressed. This Bill uses the age of sixteen years to define a minor as it is consistent with the age of sexual consent in the majority of Australian jurisdictions. 





The internet is impossible to pin down, constantly evolving and growing. The pace of technological growth means children are almost always much more comfortable with online communication than their parents: what we still see as new and different is as essential to them as breathing. 





We know that there is an ever increasing online presence of Australian youth and therefore a concomitant threat from online predators. 
New forms of communication mean we need new laws to protect our children. Research conducted by the e-Safety Commissioner showed that teenagers spend thirty three hours per week online, outside of school.





In cyberspace, we can't stand by their side as they explore the world. We can't always set rules and curfews, because our kids can be sitting safe in their rooms even while they're in danger. 





This Bill is an attempt to address some of the techniques used by online predators, so that we can put an additional safeguard in place for our children.







Current laws are too narrow, and we do not have anything to directly address the situation where an adult lies about their age to a child online for the purpose of encouraging that child to meet them in person. Existing laws require prosecutors to prove that adults who groomed children online had a 'sexual purpose'.





This law would mean that police can intervene at an earlier stage and that will save children from abuse.





Sonya Ryan, Carly's mother, has been pushing for these changes in the law since her daughter's death. Sonya, who was nominated as South Australia's Australian of the Year in 2013, has dedicated her life to raising awareness of online dangers among young people with the Carly Ryan Foundation. 





If her actions stop just one young person from becoming a victim, then it's worth it. 





That is something we should keep at the forefront of our minds when considering this Bill. 



I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

  Australia has investor-state dispute settlement provisions in seven free trade agreements and 21 investment agreements. We have had ISDS agreements for almost 30 years. ISDS mechanisms provide valuable protections for Australian investors in markets that do not have the same legal standards as our own. ISDS mechanisms do not restrict Australia's sovereignty or ability to fairly regulate and legislate in the public interest. ISDS mechanisms do not prevent the government from changing policies and do not freeze existing policy settings. The government is opposed to signing agreements which include provisions that would restrict our capacity to govern and/or regulate in the public interest.

Senator LAMBIE:
  Investor-state dispute settlement clauses give multinational corporations the opportunity to dress up as cowboys and take the law into their own hands. I do not need to lecture this chamber as to the importance of democracy in the vital checks and balances that parliament provides. These clauses give these cowboys a recipe book on how to sue the government if it creates legislation in the public interest that might cause a drop in their profit margins. This gives them a way to get around the checks and balances that form the foundations of our democracy and it undermines our sovereignty.


We do not have to imagine the impact that these ISDS clauses may have, as Germany has been recently sued for 1.4 billion euros due to an ISDS claim and one multinational is seeking $300 million in damages in Canada. What would a suit like that do to Australia's budget deficit?

The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator McGRATH:
  Through the COAG Energy Council, the government, working with the states and territories, has developed a substantial work program to facilitate the rollout of distributor generation and storage. This includes the development of standards, training and accreditation for battery installation, putting in place appropriate consumer protections for new technologies and ensuring standalone power systems, such as microgrids, are effectively incorporated into the wider regulatory framework. Further, at the meeting on 7 October the council established an independent inquiry to develop a national reform blueprint to maintain energy security and reliability in the national electricity markets.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (15:46):  I move:


(1) That a select committee, to be known as the Select Committee into the Resilience of Electricity Infrastructure in a Warming World, be established to inquire into and report on, by 10 February 2017, the following matters:


(a) the role of storage technologies and localised, distributed generation to provide Australia's electricity networks with the resilience to withstand the increasing severity and frequency of extreme weather events driven by global warming;


(b) recommend measures that should be taken by federal, state and local governments to hasten the rollout of such technologies in order to:


   (i) create jobs in installation, manufacture and research of storage and distribution technologies,


   (ii) stimulate household and business demand for storage technologies,


   (iii) anticipate the rapid deployment of localised distributed generation through changes to market rules,


   (iv) drive the reduction in technology costs through economies of scale, and


   (v) seize on the opportunities to be a global leader in deploying storage technologies because of Australia's high fixed electricity tariffs and significant penetration of rooftop solar; and


(c) any other relevant matters.


(2) That the committee consist of 7 senators, 2 nominated by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, 3 nominated by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, 1 nominated by the Leader of the Australian Greens and 1 nominated by minority groups and independent senators.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2016-10-12,"



Senator CAMERON

 (New South Wales) (16:09):  I have 15 minutes, but I think it will take me a lot longer than 15 minutes to get through the lack of achievement of this rabble of a government that we have here now. What do the general public see of this government? They see 100 days of disappointment. The great new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was going to change everything. He was going to deliver all these great things for the Australian public, but what has he delivered? Absolutely nothing. He has delivered nothing. There have been 100 days of disappointment in Malcolm Turnbull. There have been 100 days of political cowardice from the Prime Minister. He will not stand up to the National Party. The National Party were the doormats in this place. The Liberal Party used to walk all over them. 




Senator Williams:
  Not anymore.




Senator CAMERON:
  Now you have got Senator Williams out talking about the National Party government. It is the National Party that is running the show, according to the Nationals. It is the Joyce-Turnbull government that they are now talking about. Then somebody got onto him. Senator Williams was talking about it the day before, and the next day he was talking about the Turnbull-Joyce government. 




Senator Williams:
  That's it.




Senator CAMERON:
  Then it was the Turnbull government. Senator Joyce was flicked off the planet altogether. We know that after 100 days of disappointment, 100 days of political cowardice by the Prime Minister and 100 days of backflips by this Prime Minister that all this Prime Minister is doing is thinking about self-preservation. That is the big thing this Prime Minister is looking at: self-preservation. He wakes up in the morning and goes: 'How am I going to survive this day?' It is one day at a time for this weak, jelly-backed Prime Minister. It is one day at a time for the Prime Minister. It has been 100 days of a Prime Minister with no backbone, no ticker and absolutely no authority. That is the problem for this Prime Minister—no ticker, no backbone, no authority and no capacity to be a real Prime Minister. 


When I heard I was going to be talking on this matter of public importance, I thought I will look at the dictionary and see what 'achievement' means in the context of Malcolm Turnbull. The definition of achievement is a thing done successfully, with effort, skill and courage. Well, isn't it an oxymoron then to put Turnbull and achievement in the same sentence? He has absolutely no skill. You have only got to look at his political judgement to see his lack of political judgement. He has no skill at all. Courage? Well, I do not think anyone in this country thinks the Prime Minister has either political courage or personal courage. He has absolutely no courage whatsoever. He has certainly got no courage of his own convictions. He has no courage for the things that he thought he would tell people that he stood for. He has absolutely no courage of his convictions. The days of the smart little leather jacket on Q&A are long gone. Those days are long gone for this Prime Minister. He has to get the stetson on, he has to get the R.M. Williams on and he has got to walk to New England and say, 'Barnaby, what next?' That is what he has to do. We know that the National Party will cave in eventually, but they have got a bit going for them at the moment. 


We have got a Prime Minister who is a hostage of the extreme right in this country, a hostage of the National Party, and a hostage of people like George Christensen in the lower house. Mr Christensen seems to be calling the shots in the lower house. The Prime Minister is an absolute hostage of the extreme right—a wholly owned subsidiary of the right wing and the extremists in the Liberal-National Party. He has no conviction. He has given up on marriage equality. He has given up on climate change. He has given up on tax. He has given up on the backpacker tax. He has given up on health. He has given up on education.


Let us understand what has really happened here. The policies have not changed. We had this great big knifing of the former Prime Minister Tony Abbott. Tony Abbott got knifed by Malcolm Turnbull, but I am not sure how he got the courage to do it. He must have had lots of support to do it. I bet he was at the back of the queue when the knives were going in. Other people were doing it. Anyway, the former Prime Minister got knifed, and now the only problem is that former Prime Minister Abbott's policies still reign supreme. The policies are still the same. They are the same policies, which means that all of those opinion polls that showed the Liberal-National Party were all on the nose—those policies are still there, and those opinion polls are still there, because the Liberal-National Party have not changed one jot. Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott's policies are still the policies that are reigning.


When you look at the Prime Minister you see this defeated person. You see this husk of a politician, who was so devastated on election night he did not have any dignity at all. After the election campaign he got up and, because his ego was so battered, his ego was so bruised, his ego was so diminished, he gave the worst speech ever of anyone on election night in the country. It was the worst we have ever seen!


If I watch him now—this diminished Prime Minister, this husk of a politician with nothing left inside—I think of the Stockholm syndrome. He is hostage to the right wing—under absolute, complete control of the worst elements in the National Party and the Liberal Party. Stockholm syndrome is where whoever is held hostage ends up being sympathetic with their captors. Prime Minster Turnbull: the Patty Hearst of the 45th Parliament. That is what he is. Prime Minister Turnbull is the highest profile hostage since Patty Hearst. He is just a hostage of the worst elements in this parliament.


Go and look at the term 'Stockholm syndrome', because that is what is affecting Malcolm Turnbull. He is an absolute captive of the Stockholm syndrome. Patty Hearst's defence lawyer said she suffered from the Stockholm syndrome. So whenever you hear 'Patty Hearst' think of Malcolm Turnbull. Stockholm syndrome was:


… a term that had been recently coined to explain the apparently irrational feelings of some captives for their captors.


Prime Minister Turnbull has said some weird things about some of the right wingers that have got him under complete control. He has said some weird things, so that fits in with the Stockholm syndrome term.


There are a number of criteria established by psychiatrist Dr Frank Ochberg. He has advised both Scotland Yard and the FBI about the Stockholm syndrome. If you listen to what this is, you just think: 'This is Malcolm Turnbull. This is the Prime Minister.' Criteria No. 1:


… people would experience something terrifying that just comes at them out of the blue. They are certain they are going to die.


Malcolm Turnbull was certain he was going to die on election night, or he would not have behaved in the base fashion that he did. It then goes on to say:


… they experience a type of infantilisation—where, like a child, they are unable to eat, speak or go to the toilet without permission.


Well, that is exactly where this Prime Minister is. He has got to go to George Christensen and say: 'Please can I go to the toilet? Please can I get this policy through? Please can I do anything that might even be the semblance of a progressive policy?' And George Christensen says, 'No.' Mr Joyce says, 'No, you can't.' The Prime Minister cannot do anything without getting approval from the worst elements in this parliament. Then it says:


Small acts of kindness—such as being given food—prompts a ""primitive gratitude for the gift of life"" …


Well, every day the Prime Minister has to go cap in hand to the right wing of the Liberal-National Party just to get the gift of life, to survive as the Prime Minister. What a weak, hollow husk of a politician this man is. 


It says:


… hostages—


and think Prime Minister Turnbull—


experience a powerful primitive positive feeling towards their captors. 


So he goes up to say, 'I might even try and like George Christensen today'. So they get this primitive positive feeling towards their captor. They are in denial that this is the person that put them in that situation. In their mind they think this is the person who is going to let them live: 'George Christensen, please let me live.'




Senator Williams:
  Point of order.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Sterle
):  Senator Cameron, resume your seat. Senator Williams?




Senator Williams:
  During this presentation by Senator Cameron several times now he has referred to those in the other place just by their Christian name and surname. Will you please ask him to refer to those in the other place by their correct titles. 



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Williams. I will remind you, Senator Cameron, to refer to those in the other place by their correct titles. 




Senator CAMERON:
  I accept the admonishment from the National Party—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  No, no—Senator Cameron. 




Senator CAMERON:
  but I certainly will not accept any instructions, like the Prime Minister does. I accept the admonishment but will not be accepting instructions. It goes on, 'They are in denial'. And this is the person who put them in that situation. In their mind they think this is the person who is going to let them live. So Mr Christensen is the guy who lets the Prime Minister live. 


Senator Joyce, now the Deputy Prime Minister—the Deputy Prime Minister of this country! I never thought I would see the day. But that is how bad things get in politics from time to time. So they go, 'Please, let me live.' Day by day, this husk, this empty vessel of a Prime Minister gets up every day. Then it goes on to say that Kristin Ehnmark, one of the hostages, said:


It's some kind of a context you get into when all your values, the morals you have change in some way. 


It is clear that this Prime Minister has got no morals. This Prime Minister has got no values. They are all gone because Stockholm syndrome has got this guy holus bolus. There is nothing left. There is absolutely no way that he can develop any progressive policies. The leather jacket is on the back of the door, never to be seen again. He will never be a Prime Minister of this country with any standing. 


We talk about the gains. We talk about 100 values or 100 things that this guy has done. He has done nothing in the first 100 days. He has done absolutely nothing except capitulate to the worst elements in this country. He does not stand up for his values on marriage equality. He does not stand up for his values on climate change. He does not stand up for his values on the republic. He has absolutely capitulated; a weak, jelly-backed, no backbone Prime Minister, absolutely stood-over by the National Party and the right wing. It is a disgrace. (Time expired)

Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland) (16:25):  Let me open by telling you what I have been doing for the last 100 days. I have been bunkered down in my office, on my knees, praying—praying, Doug—that you would ask this question. That is what I have done. You have given me all my Christmases and birthdays in one day. Even Ripley would not believe the work we have done. Do not go, Doug. Loosen your tie, kick your shoes off, put your feet on the desk and have a listen. 


We have put $3 billion—we have committed it through the Agricultural Competitiveness White Paper. Every Labor supporter in this country and every member of the CFMEU and every tofu-sucking Green can take their shoes and socks off and count their fingers and toes and they would not even know what $3 billion was. That is an enormous investment in agriculture in this country. We have put $7 million into the rural financial counselling service. So it will come as no surprise to my colleagues on the other side that I am going to concentrate on what we have done in 100 days in this Turnbull government for agriculture around the country. 


We listened to that. He talked about a husk. We listened to that hollow presentation then by Senator Cameron. It sounded like—do you remember the Proclaimers from back in the seventies? 'I will walk 100 days' —a repeat. It was one song that just had the one verse that just went round and round and round. All he talked about was Patty Hearst the Stockholm syndrome and husks. He sounded like an old aluminium boat that was washed up. You know: that wave hits it, you sit there quietly and listen, and the wave hits it again. It is the same sound. But when you walk over and you look in it, it is an empty vessel. There is nothing in it. That is Senator Cameron and his contribution.


We extended $35 million to the Drought Communities Program. I can take you—if you have five minutes, come up to my home state of Queensland. I will take you out to Charleville and I will take you to Quilpie and I will take you to Longreach and Chinchilla, and they will tell you what an enormous benefit that was that the Turnbull government provided to them and their communities. 


We put $18.6 million into drought community project proposals; $1.5 billion on water infrastructure modernisation. We put $15 billion into water reform agenda across Australia. Just yell out when you have had enough. Put your hand up, just yell out, and I will pull up. We brought in the Water Amendment Act. We put $2 billion into the National Water Infrastructure Loan Facility that provides loans for growers and producers all across the country. We put another $13 million shared between 25 projects into the irrigation industry improvement scheme. All of these are designed to improve the performance of the Murray-Darling Basin, having very high regard to the environmental issues, making sure that we got the balance right—the sustainability with agricultural production. 


So we had $13 million shared with the irrigation industry in the improvement program. We brought in the Water Amendment (Review Implementation and Other Measures) Bill. We put $103 million into Sunraysia, a modernisation project, to keep manufacturing in one of Australia's iconic agricultural companies alive. 


You talk over there about the fact that we have not supported particular industries. These are all support measures for industries. 




Senator Williams:
  They just banned the live exports. 




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  They banned live export, cutting a billion dollars. Now, what have we done in the last 100 days? We have reinstated the live cattle job. We have now got nearly—help me out; I think it is a million head exported in the 12-month period to about seven destinations around the world. We have created an environment for agriculture, particularly beef producers—listen carefully—their income has gone up by 500 per cent under this government. And we have done that because we have promoted the live export trade. We have done that because we are introducing reforms right across the sector. We have done that because we have continued to support Meat and Livestock Australia. We continue to support all of R&D in agriculture to the tune of hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of million dollars every year, particularly in the last 100 days. Do you know what? I hope one of you is taking notes. I do not want to have to come back in here and do this again, so someone needs to take some notes over there. 


We made $50 million available to irrigators in South Australia. Of course, the irrigators have a problem now because they cannot get power to run their pumps, but I am sure that over the next 30 years the Labor government there will make changes. We put $1.7 million into the New South Wales government for projects under phase 4 of the Great Artesian Basin Sustainability Initiative—what a great initiative. We did phase 3 in my home state of Queensland and phase 4 in New South Wales, where we have capped off millions and millions of litres of water that each day were running down bore drains all across agricultural enterprises. We talk about it, and we get challenged on our sustainability and environmental credentials, but no-one makes mention of that when it happens. We put $53 million worth of funding into the Queensland irrigators. We provided $18 million to upgrade and augment the Chaffey Dam, $59.5 million to funding the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund and $12½ million into the Hay Private Irrigation District. Some of these areas are supported by some of the senators here in this chamber. We made $238 million available for Murrumbidgee Irrigation Limited and $25 million in funding for irrigators across the Murrumbidgee. Through you, Acting Deputy Chair Ketter: Senator Williams, please pay attention. You need to get ready to get up and move an extension because I have about 10 pages of achievements here— 




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Ketter
):  I do remind senators to address their remarks to the chair. 




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  I apologise. We put $15 million into the National Carp Control Plan—another great environmental measure in our waterways in country Australia. Three million dollars was provided for pest and weed management in New South Wales in this 100 days. We put in place the Australian Pest Animal Strategy to improve and create the environment for increased productivity across agriculture in the country. In 100 days, we have put a total of $50 million over the period to establish pest, animal and weed control right across the country. Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President: Senator Sterle, a million dollars went into Western Australia and $12 million to Queensland—there is a bit of parity issue there, but I think it is a reflection of the standards. There has been $1.5 million to combat pest animals and weeds and $1 million to the Victorian government in this space; we have provided $6 million to assist landowners in the Balonne Shire to build cluster fencing. 


This list goes on and on and on—in fact, my printer got overheated and I could not get all of the pages out of the printer and bring them here today. I am having the printer fixed and, if I get another opportunity, I would ask my colleagues on the other side to ask this question again tomorrow and the next day and the next day. I promise you will give up by the end of the sittings. 


We have invested $330,000 under the Agricultural Trade and Market Access Cooperation program. 


Colleagues, we listened to Senator Cameron. We listened to his presentation. He had 15 minutes. It was a hollow presentation. He did not put one fact on the table. He did not address one issue of policy. He did not recognise one thing that this government has done and, in fact, more importantly—and this is a feature of the Australian Labor Party in this place and in the other place—he had nothing to offer. There were no alternatives for us to sit and consider that perhaps there was a better way. We listened in question time, and there was not one question on the economy, not one question on education, not one question on health, not one question on agriculture and not one question on Aboriginal and islander affairs. Through you, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker: the Australian Labor Party is a hollow vessel. It has nothing to offer. It poses the question and leaves the answer open because it cannot make the case and it cannot make the pitch. 


If I ever find myself in trouble and before a court, I honestly hope—I will beg for it; it will be the other thing that I ask for—that Senator Cameron is qualified to prosecute me, because I will walk out of there a free and proud man! Thank you. 

",Senate,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Turnbull Government</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,18,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2016-10-12,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (16:34):  The proposition before the chamber today is to reflect upon the first hundred days of the new Turnbull government since the last election. 


This is an interesting concept for us to consider given the government's fortunes have fallen so dramatically even after their crushing electoral fiasco that we saw in July. We know that this is a Prime Minister who has been very keen to tell us ad nauseam that we live in the 'most exciting times'. Do you remember that? These are the 'most exciting times' this country has ever seen. These are the most agile times this country has ever seen—times in which we should be brimming with confidence. The unfortunate fact of life is that the electorate, the public, the Australian people do not feel very excited about this government. They do not feel that is a very agile government. They do not think that this is a government that has many opportunities before it. What we have seen is that this is a government that is weak, it is directionless and it is in fact captive of the most extreme right-wing elements of the coalition in this country. 


We know that a coalition of town and country capital in this parliament over the years has enjoyed quite a wide range of opinions and differences, as you would expect in a great political organisation like the coalition has been since Menzies created it in the late forties. But never have we seen a period of government dominated by the IPA and the allies of the most extreme right-wing, quasi-fascist organisations in this country. Even the once great National Party has fallen into this. They are now pandering to One Nation. Isn't that an extraordinary proposition? Do you remember Ron Boswell? He used to stand up to One Nation because he understood the consequences of pandering to these extreme right-wing, racist and xenophobic views, but what we see, of course, under this coalition is that anything goes. Why has that happened? It is because this is a government that has lost its authority. It has lost its legitimacy. It has lost its sense of direction. This is a Prime Minister who just over a year ago was elected by the Liberal Party 54 votes to—was it 44? Remember, in the polls at that time, there was the sense that they could roll all before them. Now what has happened? There has been a disastrous election result and a disastrous political strategy to adopt changes to the Senate, aided and abetted by the Greens—I accept that. This is a reasonable criticism to make. We have seen an election result in which this government effectively lost its majority, a Senate transformed and a government now obliged to follow a much more conservative direction. Some people might think that is great. But that is not what this Prime Minister made his name for, is it? Throughout his time in public life—and this is why I think so many people had such hopes for him last year—he has presented himself as a progressive, a person who is actually interested in the Enlightenment! For many people on the other side of this chamber, the Enlightenment is a very dangerous thing. In fact, they are having a lot of trouble even catching up with the very principle of it. We have met many of them in the past for whom the reading of books, for instance, was something they frowned upon! But now we have circumstances where those from the Dark Ages have come to dominate this government.




Senator Paterson:
  Just your books, Kim!




Senator KIM CARR:
  You would learn something from my books, I must say. In fact, you might learn a great deal. What I would suggest is this: the Prime Minister has mortgaged himself to the extreme right wing of the Liberal Party and, worse still, the extreme right wing of the National Party to get the keys to the Lodge. This is a mortgage that he now finds crippling. And that is now showing up in the public's attitude to this government. The people of this country, who had such high hopes and high expectations about what Mr Turnbull would bring to the job, have now been thoroughly disappointed. In fact, I think they are quite horrified. He is a man who has presented himself as being an ideas person. In the past, he was interested in an Australian republic, for instance. He has abandoned that. He is a person who said he was interested in equality before the law in terms of same-sex marriage and the like. He has abandoned that. Remember that he said they could never tolerate Tony Abbott's climate change policies—because they were fraudulent. Many years ago now, he made the point that it was a policy position that would not produce the changes we actually need to protect this country. But now, of course, he adopts it holus bolus. We have seen this in so many areas—a government divided, a government weak, a government directionless, a government that has no central commitment to the welfare of the Australian people—because the government's only obsession now is survival.


We have talked a lot about how they recovered from the disaster of the election result. What we know is that, in two years time, we will be at it again—because they cannot sustain the internal contradictions of this government. Given this Prime Minister's position in terms of popular attitudes he will either be rolled or he will be obliged to go to an early election. We know the circumstances in terms of when a writ is supposed to be issued for this chamber. We know that that circumstance means we have to have another election by 2019. If we are to maintain the joint proposition of House elections being held at the same time as Senate elections, an election for the Parliament of Australia will occur again in the early part of 2019 at the very latest. But, of course, we know that there is a New South Wales election at that time, so it is unlikely that the election will be occurring at the same time. It is very unlikely, though technically possible, that we will have an election over the summer period, in January. We could have it just before Christmas. That is possible but unlikely.




Senator McAllister:
  And unpopular.




Senator KIM CARR:
  It has never worked before. We could have it in November, but there is a Victorian election then. So we get pushed back a little further. We know we cannot hold an election for the Senate until 4 August. And we cannot let the football finals get in the way of any serious discussion with the Australian people. So sometime between August 4 and maybe the second week of the finals we will have another election. On the very best calculation, this government has less than two years to run. This government is so badly divided it may be possible for it to find a way to resolve this contradiction by having a House election only. Just think of the chaos that would bring with it—the idea of Senate elections being held on their own! I do not see that as a likelihood. So it is likely that around Spring 2018 we will be off to an election again.


The Australian people will get a chance to assess the performance of the government in that time. We will see a Prime Minister who promised much deliver very little. With a government so badly divided, so directionless, so lacking in authority and legitimacy, we are likely to see the return of a Labor government. The Labor Party will be called upon to deal with problems that you will be unable to deal with, that you are incapable of dealing with, because of the divisions within your own ranks, your lack of commitment to principle and your failure to understand the needs of the Australian people. While we are committed to serving the Australian people, you are committed to trying to work out the conflicts within your own house—and a house divided will inevitably fall.

Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (16:44):  I spent a good deal of my professional career in the horseracing industry. Do you know what I see when I look opposite at the Labor senators and others? I see owners who could not buy a horse but could win a race, trainers who cannot train a vine up a toilet wall and jockeys who do not know where the finishing line is. The fact of the matter is that this mob over here cannot win. They resent bitterly the fact that they cannot win. They resent the fact that we are a winning team on a winning horse that is kicking on over the next three years, the three years after that and, following that, the three years after that. We will have all of that victory. That is where the coalition finds itself.


I can tell you: we will continue to whip home the winners, so let me get started. The omnibus bill saves $6 billion, with support from the Labor Party, I must admit. But just remember: Mr Ken Henry, the then secretary of the Treasury, now the head of the National Bank, said, 'Don't get too proud of yourselves, boys, because you've actually got $350 billion to wind back.' And whose debt was it that we are winding back, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, to Senator Williams? You know, Senator Williams; you know, Senator Paterson. It is the $350 billion that Labor squandered in raising debt in this country.


Only today—talk about success; I need nine hours, not nine minutes—have we made a major tax saving for 3.1 million taxpayers in Australia by changing the rate at which they get to the maximum tax rate. There are 3.1 million people better off today as a result of the hundred days of this government. We go then to Medicare. I will not today explain in any great detail what a losing jockey does when he is that far behind the field in getting towards the finishing line. He comes up with every scare campaign he can. In the case of the election, it was called 'Mediscare'. And, of course, with 'Mediscare' we were going to end up selling Medicare. There was going to be no financial support for the aged people of Australia. How that party over there could have got to the finishing line, well behind, of course, as they were, and then go to chairman of stewards and say to him, 'We were honest in this campaign'! They should have been rubbed out for five years.


Speaking of Senator Carr going on about how we did, Senator Carr did not tell you, in the gallery, through you, Acting Deputy President, that the Labor Party had its second-lowest performance in its history in the 2016 election. So do not get too worried about the performance of the Turnbull government. But let's talk a little bit about Medicare and bulk-billing. Under this government, led by Mr Abbott and now Mr Turnbull—the last hundred days we are talking about in detail—85 per cent of bulk-billing is undertaken. What was the figure under Labor—the mob who reckoned that we were engaging in 'Mediscare'? Seventy-nine per cent. Isn't it amazing? Less than 85 per cent. More importantly, under this government, with the confidence that we have of being owned and trained and ridden by our excellent leadership, we have 17 million more people using bulk-billing. Isn't that an incredible thing for what is apparently called 'Mediscare'?


Pharmaceutical benefits—what have we done with the excellent minister, Minister Susan Ley? We have more than three times the number of pharmaceuticals now registered in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. If that is failure, I will own it. I will own that failure every time. As of 1 October 2016—I think that fits within the hundred-day envelope, doesn't it, Senator Paterson, through you, Acting Deputy President; I think 1 October fits in—another 2,000 medicines have been included in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, reducing the cost by millions of dollars to the Australian taxpayers, who I hope are listening to this presentation this afternoon.


Our defence industry plan brings defence manufacturing back to Australia. Excellent work will go on in Western Australia. And, if ever the South Australians get rid of their Labor government, get rid of their nonsensical attitude to their renewable energy electricity, which sends their state into darkness, they will have some chance of spending $50 billion on new submarines. Most likely, they will end up being built also in Western Australia. I could go on for the entire nine minutes about what we are doing in defence industry: new submarines, new air warfare destroyers, new offshore platform vessels et cetera.


I could speak about the free trade agreements which we are negotiating at the moment with 11 other countries—the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Forty per cent of the world's economy is tied up in those 12 countries. This, of course, is after the apparent failure—I would call it the immense success—of then trade minister Andrew Robb, now being undertaken in this hundred days by Minister Steve Ciobo, the trade minister. Free trade agreements with a few miserly little countries: China, Korea, Japan. Do not know much about them.



Senator Lambie interjecting—




Senator BACK:
  I will talk to you one day, Senator Lambie, about free trade agreements. You understand nothing about the investor dispute-state service. I will explain it to you one day in simple terms so you too can understand it.


We come now to the work of Senator Birmingham and what he has been doing in reversing the shocking Labor failure under VET FEE-HELP. I sat—Acting Deputy President Ketter, before you were in the Senate—in the Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Committee and I said at that time in those committees, 'You will set up another pink batts disaster. You will set up another Gillard memorial halls disaster.' And we have seen the wastage of billions of taxpayers' dollars on VET FEE-HELP, which of course Senator Birmingham—in the hundred days that was the subject of this question from Senator Gallagher—is now trying to wind back. He is winding back that corrupt loss. When I talk about people who cannot buy a horse, train a horse or ride a horse, the Labor opposition fits right into that analogy.


In my own industry, that associated with livestock, I look at the strength of livestock prices—beef prices, sheepmeat prices, live animal prices—as a result of this coalition government. Remember, we came off a pretty low base, I must admit. That was after Labor in government banned the live export trade and destroyed the live export of sheep and cattle out of this country. So I do admit we are coming off a low base. There is tremendous confidence now in the agricultural industries of this country as a result of the decisions of our coalition government. There is employment in Australia through processing, through live exports, through production. Senator Williams knows as well as I do the tremendous investment that is now going back into agriculture.


I will talk about another industry with which I am wonderfully familiar, and that is LNG. We have failed so badly that in 2018-19 we will go past Qatar as the biggest exporter of LNG in the world. I was in the country of Azerbaijan only two weeks ago and they were saying to us, 'Look at what you in Australia have done.' Chevron and their partners—US$100 billion of investment. Is that some failure? You call it failure; I do not. Only yesterday, we had the first cargo of liquefied natural gas from the second of the two 4½ million tonnes per annum projects out of Gladstone. What wonderful performance we have had in that industry! Again, in only the last couple of days, Senator Paterson—through you, Acting Deputy President—there has been a whole stack of new interest in the sale of and increased pricing for coking coal. And for those who get concerned about coal: no, it is not the thermal coal that produces electricity; it is the best quality coal in the world, which is used for steel production. I hope that even those who are opposed to the generation of electricity from hydrocarbons at least recognise that we do need steel.


It has been 800 days without a single person coming to Australia through that shocking trade of people smuggling. How much longer can I go on for? I am proud to be on the horse that is going to win the Melbourne Cup year after year after year.

"Lambie, Sen Jacqui",JLN,2016-10-12,"



Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (16:53):  Well, I have to say I am divided; I have mixed emotions. Part of me would like to side with Labor and condemn the Turnbull government for their lack of achievement. There have been some achievements for Tasmania, which I will speak to shortly, but there is still a bad taste in my mouth over the dishonest way the Liberals conducted their election campaign.


Everyone will remember that the Liberals were complaining about the lies and unfair comments being made about their health policy, but the reality is that they deserved every bit of that criticism. In Tasmania right now the public health system is in utter chaos and near failure, not because of the great efforts of our nurses, doctors and paramedics but because of the negligent management provided by state Liberal ministers and their senior bureaucrats.


While the Liberals were complaining about so-called Labor lies, the Tasmanian Liberal Party director, Sam McQuestin, told barefaced lies in newspapers about JLN voting preferences. During the election campaign I had—I state again—an open ticket. Despite what the Tasmanian Liberal Party director, Sam McQuestin, said during the election campaign, at no stage did the JLN ever preference any political party on its how-to-vote cards. But it is not unusual for Liberal Party state directors to be dishonest, is it? Who could forget the performance of former Tasmanian Liberal Party executive Damien Mantach, a proven liar and close colleague of Sam McQuestin, who, as the state director for Victoria, was found guilty of theft after he embezzled $1.5 million in party funds. Mr Mantach was also found guilty of deception to gain political advantage. According to an ABC report:


Mr Mantach was forced to resign after using a party credit card for $48,000 worth of personal expenses.


The report also said:


Tasmanian Liberal Party state director Sam McQuestin will not resign over the handling of former director Damien Mantach's resignation in 2008.


The Sam McQuestin mentioned in this ABC news report of 28 August 2015 is the same Sam McQuestin and Tasmanian Liberal Party director who told blatant lies to the media and Tasmanians about my voting preferences.


The fact that this man has been allowed to remain the Tasmanian Liberal Party state director just goes to show what sort of leadership controls the Liberal Party in Tasmania has. It also shows why we need a federal anti-corruption body established as soon as possible. Mr McQuestin, like all high-ranking Liberals and Prime Minister Turnbull, opposes a federal ICAC. I will let Tasmanians draw their own conclusions on that. In the first 100 days since the election a federal ICAC should have been established.


For Tasmania, the Liberal government made 21 election promises totalling $3.138 billion, including $2 billion in funding for Tasmanian hospitals over the next four years and $150 million for the relocation and northern expansion of the University of Tasmania campus. The key question that I have put to the PM and his ministers is: when will these promises be delivered?


I am happy to say that my strong opposition to the Liberals' university deregulation plans—and, of course, Labor's—was vindicated when Prime Minister Turnbull signed an MOU with the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Tasmania for $150 million. Many people will recall that I received the blame from Liberal Party members for Tasmania missing out on university funding or investment after I voted down the former government's plan to deregulate our unis. With the formal signing of the MOU, my stance has been formally vindicated. Tasmania now has an extra $150 million in uni investment without our uni students facing the prospect of $100,000 degrees.


Tasmania's St Helens community has been working for three years to win the right to have HMAS Tobruk relocated to its waters and scuppered.    Tasmania is the only state that does not have an ex-naval ship as a dive site. Three states have been gifted, on average, $5.3 million to relocate and scupper former naval ships. Tasmania wants the same deal as those other states. The project would deliver a positive economic impact of at least $5 million per year extra and up to 16 new jobs in the dive tourism industry on the east coast. That equates to $50 million over a decade. I would like to hear that Tasmania has been successful in its application. That is about the only thing I am waiting for, and it would be a real morale boost for Tasmanians to have, for the first time, a former naval ship, HMAS Tobruk, sunk in Tasmanian waters.

Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (16:57):  I rise to contribute to this debate with great sympathy for those opposite. I imagine that when their Senate tactics team sat down and devised the MPI question for today it would have seemed quite a good idea at the time. It might have been when Senator Dastyari was still a member of the tactics team and they thought, 'We'd better make sure, on the hundredth day of the Turnbull government, that we have a motion to debate their failure in their first 100 days.' Unfortunately, timing is everything in politics. Who could have imagined that the day on which they brought a motion to the chamber to debate our failures would be the same day that we had a great success in this chamber—that is, passing a tax cut for 500,000 Australians.


I do not want to appear ungrateful. I love it when the parliament passes tax cuts, but I do have one small complaint to make, one quibble, which is that on this occasion, with this tax cut, we did not go to a division. I was looking forward to sitting on this side of the chamber to vote in favour of a tax cut. But I am sure there will be many more to come in the parliament in years ahead.


Unfortunately for the Labor Party, this has also been a very good week for the Turnbull government, because that was not the only momentous bill we passed this week. We also passed a bill to protect CFA volunteers, something very important to people in my home state of Victoria and something very important to the 60,000 people who volunteer for that service. It of course follows our great success in the previous sitting week, when we were able to pass, thanks to those opposite—thanks for your support—$6 billion of savings in the omnibus bill. Again, that is another great achievement of this government in this parliament, something I very much enjoyed participating in and hope to participate in many times to come.


I realise as the chamber is filling that it is not to hear my scintillating contribution to this MPI debate, although I am flattered. I might yield the rest of my time so that we can get to maiden speeches.

Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (18:03):  It is with great pleasure that I rise today to talk about the Turnbull government's first 100 days in office since the federal election. I am really pleased that the Labor Party has raised this MPI. It is really important to reflect on what we have achieved in the first 100 days of this parliament. 


In just 10 sitting days since the election, we have seen a lot happen. But let's remember that what we have seen achieved in this parliament has been achieved largely through the support of the Labor Party. Together, Liberal and Labor have joined together to pass a range of cuts that affect the most vulnerable people across the community through the passage of the omnibus bill. They have expanded the growing gap between the rich and the poor at a time when the shadow Treasurer said that growing income inequality is one of the great challenges of this parliament. They have helped drive more investment away from Australia by slashing $800 million from the Clean Energy Innovation Fund and $500 million from ARENA. Again what we have seen is Labor and Liberal getting together to lump more debt and faster repayments on students and on recent graduates.


When it comes to superannuation, we have seen a rabid backbench within the coalition, egged on by the Labor party, ensure that the government drops its superannuation policy on after-tax contributions which only affects the top one per cent of people with super funds. And, to add insult to injury, we have seen just this week Labor and Liberal joining together to give the wealthiest 20 per cent of all Australians a tax cut at the same time as taking away support and valuable services from the great majority of the Australian community, stripping people who care for loved ones of eligibility for back payments in their carer's allowance, booting 383,000 families off family tax benefit supplements, boosting interest payments for people with Centrelink debts and cutting research and development investment. 


This MPI should be more accurately entitled, 'What has the Turnbull Government, with the support of the Labor Party, achieved in its first 100 days?' There are quite a lot of shared achievements in a short period of time. Can you just imagine the outpouring and the faux outrage from the Labor Party towards the Greens if the Greens had sided with the government and supported just one of these measures? This is the Labor Party, champions of income inequality, saying, 'We are going to stand up for more fairness in this country,' yet they are joining with the coalition government—we know what they stand for—to slash support for some of the most vulnerable people in the community and to give tax cuts to the wealthy. 


The PM has described his great personal moral challenge—other than, of course, keeping his leadership by trying to appease a rabid right wing—as reducing the deficit. He did not mention this moral challenge for four weeks and then he shoved through a tax cut which my Senate colleague Peter Whish-Wilson described as 'an untargeted missile'—and he is right. It is six dollars a week into the pockets of banking executives and MPs. We all get it to get an extra coffee and a bite out of a muffin. And what is that supposed to do to our economy at a cost of $4 billion in lost revenue? It is revenue that could go to hospitals, to schools, to provide more support for new medications. Yet we have got both of the old parties in this place, the Coles and Woolies of politics, saying: 'We're prepared to give a tax cut to the wealthiest Australians. The government ignored all other options to reduce the deficit. It had so many of them. We had CEDA saying that neither the government nor the opposition are embracing the ideas put forward to them. Actually, we would get behind many of those ideas: progressive super contributions; taking the axe to the fuel tax credit; redirecting the private health insurance rebate into the public health system; raising taxes on luxury cars; negotiating better deals for PBS drugs; and negative gearing—which is one of those measures, it must be said, the Labor Party does support. We have got to tackle the myth of trickle-down economics—that somehow putting money in the pocket of the wealthy helps everyone. It does not. The great challenge for us is to ensure that we tackle income inequality by raising revenue from those who can most afford it and not cutting services. (Time expired)

 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (18:09):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


I would like to take note of document 8 on the Red, which is the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet's Review of the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Act (2012), the review by KPMG. For people who for some reason may be unaware, the Stronger Futures legislation is the legislation that replaced the Northern Territory intervention—the legislation that the Labor government brought in, continuing the top-down punitive approach of the Northern Territory intervention. For some reason, it does not include a review of the income management measures.


The context of the review is that it is primarily 'a desktop analysis of existing data and reports, complemented by selected consultations with Australian and NT government officials'. The review takes place in three phases: reading of the legislation; literature review, consultation and data collection; and report and finalisation. The review notes—and this is particularly important—there being 'a lack of data'. They then say: 'Assessed against the overarching objective of the act, which is to support Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory to lead long, strong independent lives where communities, families and children are safe and happy, this review finds overall that the first three years of the operation of the act have been largely effective.' I fail to see, through this review, how they could say that when there is no evidence to back up that statement and they themselves comment that there is a lack of data.


A whole 11 stakeholders were consulted, seven of which are government agencies—either NT government departments or the Commonwealth! To Commonwealth agencies: 'Do you think your operation under the Stronger Futures Act has been effective?' 'Yes, I do!' Of course they are going to say that! And who else was consulted? Outback Stores. Is that the same Outback Stores who have been pinged a couple of times very recently for supplying cheap sugary drinks, when their own protocols outline that they should not be putting cheap sugary drinks on sale and they are trying to promote healthy foods? In fact, that is why under the Northern Territory intervention the government said they were putting in place Outback Stores—so they could sell healthy food. If you are consulting government agencies, of course they are going to say they are doing a good job.


I am not surprised that they talk about a lack of data because it is quite obvious that there was not a proper evaluation of these measures under this review. Under 'Tackling alcohol' they say: overall, there is insignificant data available to the reviewers that would evidence comprehensive and robust links between the act and changes in key indicators of alcohol related harm over the period 2012 to 2015.' That is hardly being 'largely effective'. Under 'Land reform' they say: 'There is evidence to suggest that there has been some increase in take-up and investments made in communities by the government that would not otherwise have occurred.' Take-up by the government? You did not need this act to do that. Under 'Food security' it says: 'While it is not possible for this review to quantify the extent of the contribution made by recent store licensing measures to health and wellbeing outcomes in communities, the review finds that the response of stakeholders to the reforms was broadly positive.' Oh, that would be the seven government agencies that they have talked to and Outback Stores!


This is a fraud of a review. When you look at the very comprehensive review of the Northern Territory evaluation, it shows that the Northern Territory evaluation did not meet any of its objectives. Now we have this 'desktop review'—and I will be exploring in estimates how much it cost to get KPMG to carry out a desktop review. By doing a desktop review, they were obviously limited in the scope of what they could do. When is this government going to take seriously what it is doing in Aboriginal communities, and address Aboriginal disadvantage seriously, when it can't even be bothered funding a proper review of Stronger Futures and the measures they helped put in place? It is time to abandon that approach. It is time to abandon the top-down, income management, punitive,  paternalistic process. It has been almost 10 years. It has failed. Admit it and do something better.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (18:14):  Senator Siewert is quite critical about this report, but I have to say to the chamber and to anyone listening that it is a question of who you would believe on assessing these issues: either KPMG, an organisation with a wide and high reputation for accuracy and common sense, or the Greens political party. I would suggest that most Australians would go to KPMG. I thought Senator Siewert's quite unfortunate criticism of the report emphasises the shallowness of the Greens' approach to most of these issues.


I did not want to refer to the whole of this particular document but to the part of the document relating to land reform. I have said a number of times that, for Indigenous people to reach their potential, they really need to have some form of land titles system which actually benefits them. I appreciate the Northern Territory is slightly different, but we have had native title legislation for 20 years and I cannot really see where it has benefited anyone—most importantly, Indigenous people. What the government should be really looking at is how Indigenous people can be given the opportunity, which every other Australian has, of using their land for their benefit and to improve their lives. To me, for all of the debate that has gone on over many years—mainly, I might say, by people living in Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne and Perth who, with respect to them, I think never really understand these situations—we really need to get some sort of system in relation to land titles that actually brings benefits and a better lifestyle to Indigenous people.


Regarding the Northern Australia white paper, which is now a year old, about which the minister delivered the first annual report just yesterday, there was a lot in that document which attempted to address the issue of land titles generally, but importantly in relation to Indigenous people and land in the Northern Territory. This report, of course, refers to the reforms under the Stronger Futures program in the Northern Territory specifically. Under the act, the Australian government enacted a package of land reform measures which were intended to extend opportunities for voluntary long-term leasing, particularly in relation to community living areas and town camps. Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Regulation 2013 amends the Northern Territory legislation to allow the community living areas landowners to grant leases and licences for a broader range of purposes and to increase the threshold requirements for ministerial consent from 12 months to 10 years. By easing leasing restrictions and broadening the categories of habitable land use to enable economic participation, the Stronger Futures act measures are regarded to be compatible with human rights and the rights of Indigenous people to self-determination.


The report goes on and it is worth reading. It is taking steps towards what the government believes, and I believe, is a better arrangement for Indigenous people and the land that is theirs. It enables them to treat a parcel of land as theirs that they can build upon, be proud of, improve and, perhaps in cases, even make profits out of. That is where I think, in the interests of our First Australians, we have to look at it and try to advance that so that land ownership means something in a tangible form to Indigenous people and leads to a better lifestyle, more independence and greater pride for these Australians.

Now we have this 'desktop review'—and I will be exploring in estimates how much it cost to get KPMG to carry out a desktop review. By doing a desktop review, they were obviously limited in the scope of what they could do. When is this government going to take seriously what it is doing in Aboriginal communities, and address Aboriginal disadvantage seriously, when it can't even be bothered funding a proper review of Stronger Futures and the measures they helped put in place? It is time to abandon that approach. It is time to abandon the top-down, income management, punitive,  paternalistic process. It has been almost 10 years. It has failed. Admit it and do something better.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2016-10-12,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (18:14):  Senator Siewert is quite critical about this report, but I have to say to the chamber and to anyone listening that it is a question of who you would believe on assessing these issues: either KPMG, an organisation with a wide and high reputation for accuracy and common sense, or the Greens political party. I would suggest that most Australians would go to KPMG. I thought Senator Siewert's quite unfortunate criticism of the report emphasises the shallowness of the Greens' approach to most of these issues.


I did not want to refer to the whole of this particular document but to the part of the document relating to land reform. I have said a number of times that, for Indigenous people to reach their potential, they really need to have some form of land titles system which actually benefits them. I appreciate the Northern Territory is slightly different, but we have had native title legislation for 20 years and I cannot really see where it has benefited anyone—most importantly, Indigenous people. What the government should be really looking at is how Indigenous people can be given the opportunity, which every other Australian has, of using their land for their benefit and to improve their lives. To me, for all of the debate that has gone on over many years—mainly, I might say, by people living in Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne and Perth who, with respect to them, I think never really understand these situations—we really need to get some sort of system in relation to land titles that actually brings benefits and a better lifestyle to Indigenous people.


Regarding the Northern Australia white paper, which is now a year old, about which the minister delivered the first annual report just yesterday, there was a lot in that document which attempted to address the issue of land titles generally, but importantly in relation to Indigenous people and land in the Northern Territory. This report, of course, refers to the reforms under the Stronger Futures program in the Northern Territory specifically. Under the act, the Australian government enacted a package of land reform measures which were intended to extend opportunities for voluntary long-term leasing, particularly in relation to community living areas and town camps. Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Regulation 2013 amends the Northern Territory legislation to allow the community living areas landowners to grant leases and licences for a broader range of purposes and to increase the threshold requirements for ministerial consent from 12 months to 10 years. By easing leasing restrictions and broadening the categories of habitable land use to enable economic participation, the Stronger Futures act measures are regarded to be compatible with human rights and the rights of Indigenous people to self-determination.


The report goes on and it is worth reading. It is taking steps towards what the government believes, and I believe, is a better arrangement for Indigenous people and the land that is theirs. It enables them to treat a parcel of land as theirs that they can build upon, be proud of, improve and, perhaps in cases, even make profits out of. That is where I think, in the interests of our First Australians, we have to look at it and try to advance that so that land ownership means something in a tangible form to Indigenous people and leads to a better lifestyle, more independence and greater pride for these Australians.

Senator LINES
 (Western Australia—Deputy President and Chair of Committees) (18:22):  As Chair of the Senate Standing Committee on Procedure, I present the committee's First report of 2016.

That consideration of the report be made a Business of the Senate order of the day for Tuesday, 8 November 2016.


Question agreed to.




Senator LINES:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


This report addresses three matters that have been considered recently by the Procedure Committee. The motion I have just moved means that no decisions will be made on the report until the next sitting period so that senators may examine the two recommendations the committee has made for changes to the standing orders.


The first matter addressed in the report is the order of 21 March 2002 about photography in the chamber. Senator Hinch has a notice of motion for tomorrow to revoke the order, something that the committee recommended in 2014. The recommendation did not proceed at the time, when some senators expressed concerns. The committee respects that senators have different views and leaves it for the Senate as a whole to determine the matter when Senator Hinch moves his motion tomorrow.


The two recommendations made by the committee relate to ministerial statements and caring for infants.


The committee notes that the temporary order providing a right for senators to move to take note of ministerial statements without notice is working well and should now be incorporated into standing orders. That is its first recommendation.


The second recommendation arises from a proposal by Senator Waters in February this year for the rules prohibiting visitors on the floor of the chamber to be expanded to exclude infants being cared for by a senator. The current exclusion is for infants being breastfed. The committee felt that Senator Waters' proposal was a little too broad and involved difficult issues of definition. It revised a proposal examined (but rejected) in 2009, and decided that the 2009 proposal contained the necessary qualifications to provide senators caring for infants with a degree of flexibility, while recognising the essential character of the Senate as a forum for national debate and legislative deliberation.


The committee is recommending that standing order 175 be amended to provide that the prohibition against visitors on the floor does not apply in respect of a senator breastfeeding an infant or, at the discretion of the President, a senator caring for an infant briefly, provided the business of the Senate is not disrupted.


The committee thinks this strikes the right balance but understands that senators will want time to think about the proposal.


I commend the report to the Senate.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2016-10-12,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (18:35):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the report of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee.


The report of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee is tabled. I again thank the very hardworking—albeit new since the new parliament—staff of the committee secretariat for their work in producing this report, subject of course to oversight by the committee. I thank them for their efforts to date. I also thank the harmony of the committee—albeit, again, that it has only been in place for a couple of meetings. But it is good to see this relatively new committee working well together in the responsibilities the committee has.


These annual reports place a great deal of information about government departments and agencies on the public record. They are an important element in the accountability of these departments to the parliament and, through parliament, to the people of Australia. What committees looking at these annual reports of the various government departments and agencies are required to do is to report to the Senate whether the reports are 'apparently satisfactory'. In making this assessment the committee considers such aspects as compliance with relevant reporting guidelines.


The committee found all the reports submitted to be in 'apparently satisfactory condition', describing the functions, activities, performance and financial positions of the department and agencies, and I congratulate the Attorney-General's Department, the minister himself and all of the agencies in that portfolio for their work in producing annual reports that comply with the requirements and give information to the parliament and to the people of Australia on what those particular agencies are doing.


Whilst our committee considered all reports presented during the period, on this occasion it was decided to examine in detail the reports of the Australian Law Reform Commission and the Australian Institute of Criminology, because these agencies had not been covered by the committee in recent years. It has been the committee's practice over the years to pick one, two or three agencies—to look more closely at their reports and to report on them in detail.


Those two agencies—the Australian Law Reform Commission and the Australian Institute of Criminology—were considered by the committee, and the committee found that both reports were apparently satisfactory. I congratulate both agencies on getting their reports in, providing information to the parliament and doing it in the right way.


The committee also decided to look into another agency, the Australian Human Rights Commission and its report. The committee did this and found that the information provided in the annual report gives a good overview of the commission's role, functions and work throughout the reporting period. However, the committee wishes to express its disappointment—and I am quoting from our report here, 'at the commission's continued disregard for some of the reporting obligations in orders and for the advice of the committee. In particular, the committee is concerned about the repeated omissions of a mandatory compliance index as prescribed in the orders and available in the annual requirements for annual reports issued by the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet.'


Interestingly, these concerns have been raised in the committee's previous reports on annual reports, in August 2011, at the time of the previous Labor government, and in March 2014. The committee reiterates the mandatory nature of the compliance index and urges the commission that it be included in future reports. The committee also noted that in previous years performance information was not always evaluated against deliverables and KPIs as presented in the portfolio budget statements.


The committee considers the 2014-15 report of the Australian Human Rights Commission to be apparently satisfactory, but expresses an ongoing concern about the absence of some reporting requirements and the disregard of the committee's previous advice. The committee strongly recommends that the commission take the opportunity to review the structure and contents of its annual report in the light of new guidelines for annual reports for corporate Commonwealth entities from the 2015-16 year onwards, with particular focus on compliance with mandatory reporting requirements and improved performance reporting against deliverables.


One would expect that all government agencies would comply with the mandatory compliance index, which has been drawn to this commission's attention on two previous occasions—one, I think, when I may have been chairman, in March 2014, and one in August 2011, when I certainly was not the chairman. It distresses me that there are some agencies that seem to think they do not have to comply with the rules. I am disappointed that this is so with the Human Rights Commission, which is often very quick to give advice on the conduct and operations of Australian citizens and others, and yet this commission itself does not seem to think it is bound by those laws.


Unfortunately, there have been instances with other statutory officers who seem to think the normal rules do not to apply to them. There will be more said about that and particular instances—it has been a matter of some comment in recent days. But these officers should understand that politicians—that parliamentarians and ministers—are elected by the people of Australia and are answerable to them.


Some of these statutory officers seem to think that they hold the final view—the final opinion—on what is right, wrong, good or indifferent. But they should always remember that they are giving, in many cases, advice to people who are elected to discharge roles and who are accountable to the Australian public, whereas some of these statutory officers are not accountable to the Australian public and in some cases do not seem to be accountable to anyone at all.


It is an important principle of our governance that everyone understands their roles. Just because a paid permanent official gives advice, it does not necessarily mean that advice has to be accepted—those are not the rules. The giving of advice to an elected minister or parliamentarian is simply that—giving advice. It is well within the role of parliamentarians and ministers to seek other advice as well, as should be the case, because not all wisdom sits in one person's mind or in one person's view of the world or of a particular issue. For the whole system to work it is important that everyone understands their role and what part they play in the system of governance—remembering that in the end, in a democracy such as ours, elected politicians are there to make the decisions and they are answerable for their decisions to the Australian public. To the Australian voter that is what the system is all about. I urge all those that this might involve to understand that principle.


The Human Rights Commission is the only agency in this department where the committee has found it necessary to, for the third time, draw attention to the rules and the fact that the rules should be followed—even though in many cases they are only technical rules or rules that are there for a particular purpose. They are not the rules that will bring down the nation, but they should be followed. I would urge the relevant agencies to comply in the future.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (18:46):  On the Legal And Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee report, I am glad I was here to listen to Senator Macdonald's contribution as chair of this report. Senator Macdonald's comments have to be taken in the context of his behaviour when dealing with the Human Rights Commission, especially Ms Gillian Triggs, the Human Rights Commissioner. It is clear, and it is on the public record, that Senator Macdonald has a particular dislike for the commissioner. Senator Macdonald was reported in the press as to be bullying in his approach towards the commissioner. When you talk about rules being followed and when—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  That is a lie.




Senator CAMERON:
  Senator Macdonald, you might say it is a lie. Certainly, it was quite clear in relation to the reports that were out there, and it was quite clear by the vision of that meeting, that you did behave in an extremely aggressive, bullying manner towards the commissioner. It did not do you any credit. It certainly did not do the Senate any credit. I would hope that you consider your position on that in the future—



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—




Senator CAMERON:
  I am entitled to have a point of view on it, Senator Macdonald.



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—




Senator CAMERON:
  You can interject as much as you like. Through the chair, when we talk about rules being followed, when Senator Macdonald has to get in there and nitpick against the Human Rights Commissioner, when Senator Macdonald still has to get his bias and dislike for the whole Human Rights Commission on the public record—as he has done tonight—and when he simply looks to nitpick in the report, then I find it a bit hard to take.


I agree with Senator Macdonald that if there are rules there then they should be complied with. I do not disagree with Senator Macdonald on that point. If the Human Rights Commission is not following the rules to the letter of the law about what their obligations are, then they should. I hope that the next time the fair work building commission are criticised for not following the rules, for not providing enough support to the public servants that are in that commission, when they are identified in the context of the ombudsman's report for not following the rules that apply to them, then maybe we will see Senator Macdonald stand and deal with that issue on the same principle that he has outlined here.


He has said: 'Here is a principle. There are rules and regulations to be followed, and the Human Rights Commission should follow them'—I agree. That is the principle that Senator Macdonald has outlined. I will have a bet that Senator Macdonald will not go and have a look at the ombudsman's report into the fair work building commission and then do a speech in the same terms that he has outlined here, because it is one rule for the Human Rights Commissioner and another rule for the fair work building commission. I think that is hypocrisy. It is outrageous that you can come here and get a sermon from Senator Macdonald about following the rules and following the law when he turns a complete blind eye to the breaches of rules, to the breaches of law and to the contempt for parliamentary process by Mr Nigel Hadgkiss from the fair work building commission.


I hope that there will be some balance and a lack of hypocrisy. I hope I am wrong about Senator Macdonald and this approach, but I doubt I will be, because there have been many examples of the fair work building commission and the commissioner, Mr Nigel Hadgkiss, not playing by the rules and not following what is laid out in the act. In fact, there are examples of ignoring a whole range of responsibilities that the fair work building commission has under the act so that it can—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Back
):  A point of order, Senator Macdonald?




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I hate to interrupt Senator Cameron, and I know we do allow a bit of—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Flexibility, yes.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  wide-ranging debate, but this is about the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee's report on annual reports. It has nothing to do with Mr Hadgkiss or the Fair Work commission.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  So your point of order is on relevance?




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Yes.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you. Senator Cameron, would you resume and perhaps make sure you confine your discussion to the topic before the chair.




Senator CAMERON:
  Thank you, Chair, and thank you for that help and direction. I would argue that what I am talking about here is a principle that Senator Macdonald has applied to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee report. I am entitled, I think, to point out that I support Senator Macdonald on that principle. I wholly support Senator Macdonald on that principle. I am simply saying that Senator Macdonald has not applied that principle to other areas where public servants and independent organisations under government auspices have not followed that principle. I think I am entirely on point. I accept the position that you have adopted in relation to the report, I must say, apart from the nitpicking approach. I agree, even though it is nitpicking, that the commission should ensure that it complies with its obligations.


All I am saying is that the next time we get an Ombudsman's report into the Fair Work building commission on its lack of adherence to the rules and regulations that apply to the Fair Work building commission, maybe, just maybe, Senator Macdonald will be on his feet about the Fair Work building commission and Mr Nigel Hadgkiss—probably the most incompetent public servant I have come across in my experience in almost a decade in this place—and point out how incompetent that commissioner is in relation to his adherence to the principles that Senator Macdonald is espousing should apply to the commissioner of the Human Rights Commission.


I must say that I would probably have differences with Commissioner Triggs from time to time on some of the issues, but I think generally she is seen to be an extremely competent, an extremely diligent and an extremely effective commissioner for the Human Rights Commission. There are those from the extreme Right in the Liberal-National party who, every time they see the commissioner, see that their weird and misconstrued views about how the commission should work are epitomised in the commissioner, so they take every chance to have a go at her. It was clear that Senator Macdonald's publicly displayed behaviour—on the record—in relation to Commissioner Triggs did no service to the committee process in this parliament, did no service to the Senate and did no service to Senator Macdonald himself. It was full of bullying. It was full of standover tactics. It was an absolute disgrace.


Senator Macdonald continues to look for every opportunity to have a go at the Human Rights Commission and Commissioner Triggs, and this is just one of them. It shows how petty Senator Macdonald is getting. The longer Senator Macdonald is here the more petty he becomes, the more narrow he is in his views and the more reviled he is by even his own side on some of the issues that he raises. But that is Senator Macdonald. I have absolutely no argument about Senator Macdonald's work ethic, no argument about that at all. I just wish his work ethic was used for the good of the parliament and the good of the community, and that he stopped the nitpicking and he stopped the bullying. That would be good for the Senate.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The question is that the motion be agreed to. Those of that opinion say aye, to the contrary no. I believe the ayes have it. The ayes have it. Senator Macdonald.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Under standing order 191, which says in part: 'A senator who has spoken to a question may again be heard, to explain some material part of the senator's speech which has been misquoted or misunderstood', I seek to just inform the Senate that Senator Cameron's representation—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald, you must seek leave. I will inquire of the chamber whether or not you have leave. It is a point of explanation only?




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Not 190.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  You are seeking leave for an explanation statement only? I haven't yet called the motion. Senator Macdonald has sought leave to speak for one minute.




Senator Cameron:
  Leave is not granted.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Leave is not granted, Senator Macdonald, thank you. A point of order, Senator Macdonald?




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  With due respect, under 'Personal explanations', standing order 190, by leave of the Senate a senator may explain something. I am talking about standing order 191, which says:


A senator who has spoken to a question may again be heard, to explain some material part of the senator's speech which has been misquoted or misunderstood—


And leave is not required.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Only that the debate has finished, Senator Macdonald, and on that basis I cannot call you to speak on standing order 191, so I do ask you to resume your seat. It is on the basis that the question has been put. So I will now put that question. Those in favour say aye, to the contrary no.


Resume your seat, Senator Macdonald. Senator Cameron, on a point of order?




Senator Cameron:
  Yes; it is quite clear: the point of order is that the debate had finished. That means that the debate cannot go on, and everything that Senator Macdonald has argued is nullified, in terms of the debate.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Cameron, but it is the case that when Senator Macdonald rose to his feet I had actually not yet at that point in time put the question. Senator Macdonald, I am going to allow you one minute, under standing order 191, to give your point of explanation.



Senator Cameron interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Cameron, that is my adjudication.




Senator Cameron:
 Acting Deputy President, that might be your adjudication—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  It is.




Senator Cameron:
  but I would certainly ask that this part of the Hansard is reviewed, because it is quite clear that this debate had been finalised. So I would ask you to have a review and have a look at this decision.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I will request that the President does that, but I come back to the point that, at the time that Senator Macdonald rose, I had not put the question. Therefore, under standing order 191, I am allowing you one minute for your explanation, Senator Macdonald, after which time I will put the question.

  That's how important it is—they didn't turn up!



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  A point of order Senator Rhiannon; it is actually your speaker who should be speaking but is not in the chamber. Senator Macdonald.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, you make the point that I was just about to make: Senator Rhiannon, according to the list, it is a Greens senator who is supposed to be speaking. But I think this demonstrates to those who might be listening to this debate that on an important issue like the National Cancer Screening Register Bill, the Greens' scheduled speaker just does not turn up—




Senator Moore:
  On a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President, I think that comment from Senator Macdonald is reflecting on the Greens' speaker. I would think that his statement drawing attention to the Greens speaker was inappropriate.

Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Yes, I will, Mr Acting Deputy President—but I might say, for Senator Moore's benefit, that it was the Greens senator that raised the issue and accused a government senator of not being here—unfortunately, Senator Moore did not choose to take a point of order on the Greens senator's interjection. But I see that the Greens speaker is now here, and I will accordingly conclude my contribution to this important piece of legislation. It is an important piece of legislation and I urge the Senate to support it.

Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (19:04):  I rise today to speak to the National Cancer Screening Register Bill 2016 and the National Cancer Screening Register (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2016. Let me start by saying the Australian Greens are very strong supporters of a national cancer screening register; we are very strong supporters of that. Screening is an important public health tool. It saves lives. When it is done properly, we are able to pick up disease early, we are able to treat it, and we are able to prevent people from developing serious complications and, indeed, from losing their lives. So it is a very important public health tool.


We certainly understand the importance of this reform, bringing together the eight state and territory registers for cervical and bowel cancer screening into one national register, and improving Australia's cancer screening programs, providing a national approach, giving patients and their doctors the opportunity to access cervical and bowel cancer information wherever they are in the country. We absolutely support the register, in line with our support for other improvements to our cancer screening programs for cervical and bowel cancer, to introduce the five-yearly human papillomavirus test and to accelerate the introduction of two-yearly screening for all Australians aged 50 to 74. They are good reforms. They are important reforms. They are positive reforms which bolster Australia's response to these life-threatening cancers. So that is a good thing.


What concerns us with this legislation is the fact that the government saw fit, before the legislation was passed or scrutinised by this parliament, to sign a contract with Telstra Health for its delivery. It is of huge concern to us—a $220 million contract which delivers Telstra sensitive data about the health of Australian women and men. They did this before the legislation was able to be scrutinised by the parliament. So we have grave concerns that this contract was signed prior to any scrutiny. It turned out during a recent community affairs inquiry that such scrutiny was necessary to show up major holes in the data protections within this legislation. 


Let me also say that we have concerns about the decision by this government to outsource Australia's highly sensitive data—let's be really clear about this: this is very sensitive data about the health of Australian men and women—to a for-profit telecommunications company. A bit of background is important here. To date, state governments and specific not-for-profits that have this particular purpose have been the only entities to deliver and manage these registers. These have always been the domain of governments and for-purpose not-for-profits. We are moving into uncharted territory here. The current system exists because these organisations have the skills and expertise to do so and because they do not have potential conflicts of interests in holding that data. So we are seeing a big shift here, and we need to pause and reflect on whether in fact this is a shift that we want to make. What sometimes happens in this space is that we see incremental changes, so we could soon see other important health information being managed by for-profit companies. We will look back at the passage of this legislation and ask, 'Did we make the right decision about handing over that sensitive information and outsourcing it from government?' It is a big question, and one that needs to be asked. I will speak to that in a moment when we discuss some of the amendments that have been put forward. 


What does the bill do? It establishes a national cancer register for cervical and bowel cancer data. It authorises the collection, the use and the disclosure of information for the purposes of the register and for other purposes such as providing health care. It changes the current system in which there are eight separate state and territory cervical screening registers and a paper based bowel screening register. It establishes a register involving large-scale data migration and merging to create a national database of records for cancer screening information. The existing registries, which will be migrated into the national register and managed by Telstra Health, contain personally identifying information—names, addresses and the results of pap smears, for example, which can allow specific inferences to be made about a person's sexual status. Let's remember that the human papillomavirus is a sexually transmitted virus. We need to recognise here that what we are handing over is information—the names and addresses of individuals and the results of pap smears. People will draw all sorts of inferences about the data that has been provided. So it is absolutely critical that this data be protected and be used for the most limited purposes possible to deliver the national register. 


Again, I reiterate our support for a national register. We think it is good idea to consolidate this data and to give people the opportunity to use it in a way that is going to be more beneficial to population health, but we do have concerns about the government's approach to this legislation. What is remarkable is that, initially, the government suggested that we do not undertake what is a core function when it comes to most pieces of legislation, and that is conduct an inquiry so that we can look for some of the potential complications associated with the legislation. This is one of the core functions of the Senate. We have a duty, indeed, an obligation on behalf of the Australian people to examine legislation in detail through our committee process—one of the most important parts of what we do here in the Senate. Only a few weeks ago, indeed, in the last sitting week, we saw the passage of the omnibus bill, which is a piece of legislation so broad in its scope that it included cuts to renewable energy, cuts to family support, cuts to student assistance and a proposed cut to Medicare funded dental care. It is a piece of legislation so broad in its scope that it cuts across many portfolios, yet we had a proposal that that legislation would not be put to a Senate committee. This is a worrying trend. The role of the Senate is to provide scrutiny to legislation, to examine it for consequences both intended and unintended. This is particularly important when we are talking about legislation that delivers Australians' sensitive data to a for-profit company. 


So, despite some opposition from government, we moved a motion, together with the Labor Party, to ensure that there was an inquiry held into this bill. We had that inquiry, and we found that there were some substantial flaws within the legislation. The government's own Information Commissioner highlighted a string of recommendations to bring the data protections in the bill up to scratch. There were gaping holes within this legislation. Thanks to the valuable evidence provided by the Information Commissioner, we were able to see some very sensible recommendations emerge from the report into this legislation. We are pleased—we are very pleased—that the government have in the main heeded the advice of the Information Commissioner and are now moving a raft of amendments to their own legislation. 


These amendments will tighten up the restrictions on the use of the data, make it explicit that a breach of the data interferes with the Privacy Act and restrict the data available to the register operator. These are really important changes—changes that should have been developed much earlier in the course of this legislation. While it is a good outcome, it does raise questions about why the government fought so hard to avoid the inquiry, which, in the end, has led to improvements and further protections in this legislation. It seems that the government are not only outsourcing the contract to Telstra but also outsourcing some of the responsibilities of drafting legislation and protecting important and private information to the Senate. 


The Information Commissioner made it clear at the inquiry that the data protections in the legislation should reflect the protections that are included in the My Health Record legislation. They said that we need to see the protections in this bill reflect the protections that are included in the My Health Record. So, while the government's amendments do reflect that this advice was provided by the Information Commissioner—and they have sought to align a number of requirements in the legislation to the My Health Record legislation—they do not go far enough in terms of some aspects of the My Health Record. For example, increasing the penalties for breaches of data, and requiring the people who are affected by a breach to be notified. They are two things that make up part of the My Heath Record legislation that were not included in this bill. We are pleased that there are amendments to this effect coming before the parliament, and that is why we will be supporting those opposition amendments to improve those protections.


Being frank, if it was my data, or the data that belongs to one of my family members, and there was a breach—no matter how insignificant—I would like to know. That is also another important incentive for the people who are managing this data to ensure that breaches do not occur. It is another protection within the legislation that provides further incentives to avoid data breaches. If there is a significant data breach, no matter how broad, no matter how many people are affected, those people will need to know. And they have a right to know. They absolutely have a right to know the data they have given has been compromised.


On the second aspect, which is that aspect of penalties to try and ensure that the legislation reflects My Health Record, we do take the comments of Professor Stephen Duckett from the Grattan Institute very seriously when he says that the penalties in this legislation for a company like Telstra are laughably insufficient. The government amendments do not do enough to fix the problem, and the opposition amendments, which lift the penalties, are something we will support.


Let me also take the opportunity to talk about the government's process, which I think has seen what is unprecedented in the area of health care—that is, handing over sensitive information to a for-profit company before the legislation has even been passed; to say to Telstra: 'We want you to manage this sensitive information. We need legislation to do it, but we're going to sign a contract with you anyway, because we think we'll get it through.' The government's arrogance is remarkable in assuming that this would simply be waved through the parliament and to sign on to those contracts with Telstra. It was a $220 million contract. Just remember that we are not talking small beer here; we are talking about a $220 million contract over five years, with the possibility to extend, without first getting legislation through the parliament and without having the opportunity to scrutinise that legislation. As I said earlier, we have now discovered that there are a number of flaws with the legislation as it was drafted.


There is a fundamental philosophical point here—that is, should sensitive information belonging to individuals be maintained by a for-profit telecommunications company when what we have seen up until this point is an understanding that the appropriate place for that is within government and for-purpose, not-for-profit organisations. The Australian Greens think this is the core business of government and it should be delivered in-house. We think it should be the responsibility of government or for-purpose NGOs who are established precisely for the reason of delivering and maintaining these registers. We do not like the idea of this information being held within a for-profit company. It does set a precedent that at the very least the government should have waited until the legislation had been passed. The Australian Greens want to see good legislation passed that sets up a strong record. For that reason, we will support the opposition's amendments to increase those penalties and we look forward to the implementation of a robust national screening register that will ensure that we improve the health care of all Australians.

 (Queensland) (19:02):  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. This bill, the National Cancer Screening Register Bill 2016 and the related bill, is another important bill which the government brings to this chamber.




Senator Rhiannon:
  That's how important it is—they didn't turn up!



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  A point of order Senator Rhiannon; it is actually your speaker who should be speaking but is not in the chamber. Senator Macdonald.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, you make the point that I was just about to make: Senator Rhiannon, according to the list, it is a Greens senator who is supposed to be speaking. But I think this demonstrates to those who might be listening to this debate that on an important issue like the National Cancer Screening Register Bill, the Greens' scheduled speaker just does not turn up—




Senator Moore:
  On a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President, I think that comment from Senator Macdonald is reflecting on the Greens' speaker. I would think that his statement drawing attention to the Greens speaker was inappropriate.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Moore. I will invite Senator Macdonald to withdraw that inference.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Yes, I will, Mr Acting Deputy President—but I might say, for Senator Moore's benefit, that it was the Greens senator that raised the issue and accused a government senator of not being here—unfortunately, Senator Moore did not choose to take a point of order on the Greens senator's interjection. But I see that the Greens speaker is now here, and I will accordingly conclude my contribution to this important piece of legislation. It is an important piece of legislation and I urge the Senate to support it.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2016-10-12,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (19:04):  I rise today to speak to the National Cancer Screening Register Bill 2016 and the National Cancer Screening Register (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2016. Let me start by saying the Australian Greens are very strong supporters of a national cancer screening register; we are very strong supporters of that. Screening is an important public health tool. It saves lives. When it is done properly, we are able to pick up disease early, we are able to treat it, and we are able to prevent people from developing serious complications and, indeed, from losing their lives. So it is a very important public health tool.


We certainly understand the importance of this reform, bringing together the eight state and territory registers for cervical and bowel cancer screening into one national register, and improving Australia's cancer screening programs, providing a national approach, giving patients and their doctors the opportunity to access cervical and bowel cancer information wherever they are in the country. We absolutely support the register, in line with our support for other improvements to our cancer screening programs for cervical and bowel cancer, to introduce the five-yearly human papillomavirus test and to accelerate the introduction of two-yearly screening for all Australians aged 50 to 74. They are good reforms. They are important reforms. They are positive reforms which bolster Australia's response to these life-threatening cancers. So that is a good thing.


What concerns us with this legislation is the fact that the government saw fit, before the legislation was passed or scrutinised by this parliament, to sign a contract with Telstra Health for its delivery. It is of huge concern to us—a $220 million contract which delivers Telstra sensitive data about the health of Australian women and men. They did this before the legislation was able to be scrutinised by the parliament. So we have grave concerns that this contract was signed prior to any scrutiny. It turned out during a recent community affairs inquiry that such scrutiny was necessary to show up major holes in the data protections within this legislation. 


Let me also say that we have concerns about the decision by this government to outsource Australia's highly sensitive data—let's be really clear about this: this is very sensitive data about the health of Australian men and women—to a for-profit telecommunications company. A bit of background is important here. To date, state governments and specific not-for-profits that have this particular purpose have been the only entities to deliver and manage these registers. These have always been the domain of governments and for-purpose not-for-profits. We are moving into uncharted territory here. The current system exists because these organisations have the skills and expertise to do so and because they do not have potential conflicts of interests in holding that data. So we are seeing a big shift here, and we need to pause and reflect on whether in fact this is a shift that we want to make. What sometimes happens in this space is that we see incremental changes, so we could soon see other important health information being managed by for-profit companies. We will look back at the passage of this legislation and ask, 'Did we make the right decision about handing over that sensitive information and outsourcing it from government?'

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2016-10-12,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (19:19):  It gives me a huge amount of pleasure to stand tonight to inform the Senate about a very exciting event that is going to be happening in Australia on Sunday. It is national Gone Fishing Day. Many may not realise that we have in excess of five million recreational fishers in Australia. In fact, it is Australia's most popular outdoor activity. It is not just something that many Australians enjoy partaking and participating in, but it is also worth billions and billions of dollars to our economy. As you would probably be well aware, Mr Acting Deputy President Back, much of that money is spent in our regional communities around Australia's vast coastline.


The great thing about fishing is that it does not take very much to get involved: you can drop a line over the side of your tinnie; you can head down to the local jetty; you can chuck on your runners and go for a walk out on the rocks at low tide to see if you can find a crab; or, as in my case, you can just chuck a piece of chewie on the end of a string and try and con a yabby into bitting on it. All of these things are fishing. They cost very little, but they are an intrinsic part of the Australian way of life. Australia's national Gone Fishing Day serves to remind us all about how much fun it is to get outdoors.


On Sunday this event will be nationwide. Every part of Australia can participate in Gone Fishing Day. I am advised that there are in excess of 100 events that have already been registered to be a part of Gone Fishing Day. They extend from Sydney to Perth, from Hobart to Darwin and everywhere in between. But you do not have to participate in one of these formal events to be part of national Gone Fishing Day. What the event seeks to do is encourage you to just grab a line and head off down to your local waterway—whether it be a river, a lake, an ocean or just a creek trickling down the back of your property—because it is really good fun to catch a fish. And it is not just fun; it is healthy. You can do it with your family; you can do with your friends. It is one of those things that I think all Australians aspire to do, but many of us may have forgotten what it is like to actually go fishing, because it has been so long since we have done it.


The Australian recreational fishing community also wants Sunday to be a reminder to everybody about being responsible fishers. The Australian recreational fishing sector has over recent times taken a real pride in the responsibility that they take in looking after what they believe is a very valuable pastime that they do not want to lose. They believe it is very important to maintain their social licence and, as such, they are intending to formally announce on Sunday—and it gives me great pleasure to be participating in this announcement—that they are going to enter into a voluntary code of conduct for all recreational fishers acknowledging the importance of their environment and what they are doing. 


What they are seeking to do is tell Australians that they believe that everybody who goes fishing needs to be respectful. They need to respect the fish. They need to respect fellow fishers and other people who use the water that the fish live in. They also believe that you need to respect the environment. So, on Sunday, the Australian recreational fishing community intends to endorse a mantra that says you have to be respectful when you go fishing. 


 I will be chucking a line in on Sunday. I will be chucking a line over the side of a boat in Sydney Harbour with the national ambassador for Gone Fishing Day, Mark Taylor. So he will not be wielding his willow; he will be wielding a rod. My NSW colleague the NSW Minister for Fisheries, Niall Blair will also be there. I do not have a great track record of being a great fisher. In fact, I have often been accused of being probably the worst fisher in the world. So I am very hopeful that on Sunday I am going to break my drought and catch a fish. 


The federal government is really proud and pleased to be in partnership with Australia's recreational fishing sector in this particular event, because we believe it is a very important event to represent and to showcase to Australia the benefits and values of getting outside, being healthy, having fun and doing something active on a Sunday. 


We must commend the Australian Recreational Fishing Foundation and their partners for putting on this event. I would encourage anybody in this chamber who has not got anything planned on Sunday to maybe go for a scrabble in the back shed, see if you can find yourself a line, go down the river with some friends or some family, go down to the sea, chuck a line off a jetty. On Sunday, think about the importance that the recreational fishing sector has and plays in the Australian economy and the Australian lifestyle—and just having fun in Australia. I urge everybody to participate in this great event for all Australians.
