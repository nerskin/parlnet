Senator THORP
 (Tasmania) (12:31):  One of the first referendums was the 1967 referendum, where the Australian people were asked whether Aboriginal people should be counted in the national census and be subject to Commonwealth laws rather than just state laws. This referendum was a landslide, winning close to 91 per cent of all votes cast. No referendum before or since has been so heartily endorsed by the Australian people. The overwhelming result gave the government at the time a clear mandate to enact policies that would benefit Aboriginal people. 


Another nation-defining event was the historic 1992 Mabo decision. Here the High Court ruled that the Meriam people of the Murray Islands in the Torres Strait were 'entitled as against the whole world to possession, occupation, use and enjoyment of most of the lands of the Murray Islands'. In doing so, they rejected the longstanding, but patently false, concept of terra nullius—land belonging to no-one. That was a big step, indeed, and one which led to the drafting of the 1993 Native Title Act by the Keating government.


Keating reinforced the need to admit the truth of our history in the now famous Redfern speech of 1992. This watershed speech was the first time that an Australian Prime Minister had acknowledged the impacts of government policies since Federation on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It clearly placed reconciliation on the national agenda and has since been referred to as one of the most powerful and important speeches of all time. But, more than that, it reflected a commitment to make the future better. In Keating's words: 


This is a fundamental test of our social goals and our national will: our ability to say to ourselves and the rest of the world that Australia is a first rate social democracy, that we are what we should be—truly the land of the fair go and the better chance.


Sixteen years after Keating's message of acknowledgement and respect came another unforgettable speech and another milestone on the path to reconciliation. The 2008 National Apology to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples by then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd was one of those very rare speeches that united the House and the nation. I daresay there are many Australians who will remember exactly where they were that day and how moved they were. In Mr Rudd's words, the apology was a recognition that:


The time has now come for the nation to turn a new page in Australia's history by righting the wrongs of the past and so moving forward with confidence to the future.


This was a truly defining moment in our national history, of which I am immensely proud. The speech went to the very heart of the Labor values that are so close to my heart: fairness, equality, inclusiveness, opportunity and respect. Since Kevin Rudd's watershed apology, this government has been working very hard, in partnership with the states, to achieve better outcomes for Indigenous Australians. In 2008 the Council of Australian Governments agreed to six ambitious targets to address the disadvantage faced by Indigenous Australians in life expectancy, child mortality, education and employment.


But despite all the hard work and commitment towards rectifying inequality and creating opportunity for all, we still have one major hurdle to leap. That is, the formal recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people within our Constitution. To this end, the bill enshrines some very important elements. It recognises that the continent and its islands, now known as Australia, were first occupied by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and acknowledges the continuing relationship of Indigenous people with their traditional lands and waters. It also formalises respect for the continuing cultures, languages and heritage and acknowledges the need to secure the advancement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. It also recognises that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages are the original Australian languages and are part of our national heritage.


The will for this recognition is clearly there in the community. We only need to look at the groundswell of public support across the nation. Political representatives on both sides of this chamber also agree. But we must face the reality that constitutional amendments are notoriously difficult to achieve. Of 44 referendums held since Federation, only eight have passed. And we know that failed referendums can lead to important decisions being discarded for decades—one springs to mind, Mr Deputy President. If we were to rush into this, we would risk condemning this important acknowledgement to just another footnote in history.

"Smith, Sen Dean",LP,2013-03-12,"



Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (12:39):  I rise today to add my thoughts to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012. The purpose of this bill is to give expression to the parliament's recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders as the original inhabitants of Australia and also their ongoing connection with their traditional land and waters, cultures, languages and heritage. It establishes a mechanism to review the preparedness of the Australian community to support a referendum giving constitutional recognition to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and the preferred form of these proposed constitutional changes.


My own party's record regarding Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues and representation is a proud one, most notably the election of the first Aboriginal Australian to sit in federal parliament and the election of the first Aboriginal Australian to sit in the House of Representatives. There are of course many other achievements and milestones that have been characterised by strong bipartisanship. I begin by echoing the comments of the shadow Attorney-General, my colleague Senator the Hon. George Brandis, in regard to the care and caution that must be shown in this debate as we move towards the finer detail of a proposition. He has said in this debate that it is 'just as important to persuade people with conservative views as people who consider themselves to be progressive. If this is to happen, the proposal must be modest and the tone of the debate must be respectful.'


I come to this issue with a great deal of caution, indeed some apprehension. I am very cautious about the merit of recognition in our constitutional document. That said, I believe there to be tremendous merit and popular support for two of the proposals contained in the expert panel report, Recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Constitution; namely, those proposals that seek to remove reference to race. I also recognise that others have started from a similar position to my own and have been able to reconcile their concerns and are now prepared, while remaining cautious, to modest proposals. 


The difficulty in finding an appropriate form for securing recognition in our Constitution and the legal uncertainty it introduces should not come as a surprise to anyone who has taken the time to properly understand the report of the expert panel. I have been drawn to the more conservative and cautionary analysis and scrutiny given to this issue by accomplished constitutional experts. I think it is a shame and an ominous sign that their views have not been given more coverage. 


It is worth reminding ourselves how we got to the debate on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012. As a preface, I would add that I do not believe we are close to a point where there is a clear, concise and popular proposition. The expert panel reported to the Prime Minister on 19 January 2012, recommending a referendum on five constitutional changes. The first would remove section 25, which contemplates the possibility of state laws disqualifying people from voting at state elections on the basis of their race. The second would remove section 51(xvi), which can be used by the Commonwealth to enact legislation to discriminate for or against people on the basis of race. The third involves the insertion of a new section 51(a) that would recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and preserve the Australian government's ability to pass laws for the advancement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The fourth would insert a new section 16(a), banning racial discrimination by the Commonwealth. Finally, the fifth would insert a new section 127(a), recognising that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages were the country's first tongues while confirming that English is Australia's national language.


Recognising that there was not yet enough community awareness or support for change and wanting to maintain momentum for change, this bill was prepared to assist Australians to become familiar with formal recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples ahead of constitutional change. I note that this approach has a parallel in our history and was used in the 1890s to build and maintain momentum amongst the colonies for Federation. The comments of the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples in its interim report in January this year makes a salient point that is worth emphasising. The committee cautions that if the proposal is the victim of overreach it will fail. While the committee does not seek to limit the scope of public discussion, it nevertheless considers that only a relatively modest proposal is capable of engendering the bipartisan consensus which is a prerequisite to success.


My caution has two root causes. Firstly, in my mind the link between constitutional recognition of Indigenous peoples and better outcomes for them, their families and communities has not yet been established. I think constitutional recognition is unfounded if there is not an expectation of some tangible, practical improvement in the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. As we embark upon this public discussion on the merits of any constitutional amendments, I believe Australians have a clear view of what their Constitution has been designed to do, or more accurately what it has not been designed to do. In the simplest terms, I believe they see their Australian Constitution as a rule book, established as a set of guidelines for how a newly created Federation was to govern itself and conduct its activities. I accept that for a smaller group of Australians, the Australian Constitution may be seen not so much as a rule book but as a mission statement, a catalogue of intent, ideals and statements about where we want to be heading as a nation. I am not opposed to any of those things; aspiration is a virtue. No nation can be secure for long without a clear notion of its identity or purpose. For me, as a self-confessed constitutional conservative, I am not persuaded that the ideal place to be giving expression to these aspirations for reconciliation and recognition should be in the text of the Australian Constitution. 


Secondly and more substantively are the serious but conveniently ignored legal considerations. Of all the commentary and analysis, I am most inclined to trust the work of Professor Anne Twomey, Director of the Constitutional Reform Unit at the University of Sydney, who has given careful and dispassionate accounts of the possible legal pitfalls and shortcomings of various forms of recognition canvassed to date. I particularly agree with her comment that a lack of clarity about the purpose of Indigenous recognition will always leave the issue open to accusations of it being a 'false promise or a Trojan Horse'. For this reason, I am particularly pleased the bill has been silent on what form recognition should take. It is a wise course that this bill lacks a form of words for agreement and is silent on whether recognition should be incorporated in a preamble or in the substantive provisions of the Constitution.


I believe progress can easily be made in two areas proposed by the expert panel while others, with sound reason, are more contentious and should be treated with great suspicion. The propositions to remove section 25 and section 51(xvi) should be agreed to. Section 25 has been regularly recommended for repeal by many constitutional review bodies since 1959. In the words of Professor Twomey: 


It is therefore appropriate to repeal it – not as a racist provision, but one whose work is now done.


Section 51(xvi) should be repealed on the basis that there should be no provisions in our Constitution that permit laws to be enacted by reference to race. A repeal of this section would also be acceptable to many. A difficulty arises here because this particular section underpins the Native Title Act 1993 and the heritage protection of sacred sites. I do remain confident that there is an answer to this dilemma. It may be that a refined and carefully worded new power could be substituted. However, the remedy proposed by the expert panel is most definitely unacceptable. It has proposed, firstly, that a new section 51A to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and to preserve the Australian government's ability to pass laws for the benefit of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples should be treated with great caution; and, secondly, a new section 116A that would introduce into the Constitution a prohibition of racial discrimination. This suggested remedy has been construed by some as giving effect to a small bill of rights, the essence of which will be to give a greater role to the courts than to parliament in determining the meaning of 'advancement' and 'discrimination'. On these points I encourage the reading of analysis by Professor Twomey again, who has suggested:


The greatest controversy will hang on the fact that it would ultimately be a matter for a court to decide what was, or was not, for the advancement of Indigenous Australians


In regards to the new section 16A, she has commented:


… such a provision can be interpreted by the courts in ways that were not intended and there is no option of reversing such an interpretation by legislation.


And further:


The level of discretion left to the courts in determining what amounts to discrimination, who is protected and whether a law or executive act is for the purpose of overcoming disadvantage etc, is significant.


On this point, I am confident Australians will treat with great reluctance the shift of these judgements from parliament to the courts. If we stay on this course of approach to constitutional recognition the proposal will fail, not because people do not endorse the principles inherent but because they object to a shift of power on matters of definition from parliament to the courts. This is a concern shared by even Aboriginal commentators who have correctly identified that this could open a Pandora's box of litigation and dispute. 


Above all else, I am curious that in a modern era like this with all the high hopes for a brighter reconciled future between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and other Australians, our constitutional remedy still involves at its core the acknowledgement of one group of Australians to the exclusion of others. I believe the only acceptable constitutional reform for a modern, progressive nation such as ours is one that seeks to remove all reference to race. 


My final comment goes to the purpose of the review and its role in assessing the readiness of the community to support a referendum and the identification of proposals most likely to be supported. I agree with the sentiments of some others that there is a more important question than one of success or popularity. I think again the comments by Professor Twomey deserve greater appreciation by many. She says:


The more important question is what form of amendment is right, appropriate and consistent with the operation of the rest of the Constitution. There should be scope for the making of some kind of judgement as to what the best form of amendment would be, as well as would attract the most popular support.


She adds:


It may be inappropriate for example to make an amendment that is popular if it causes unresolved conflicts with other constitutional provisions potentially giving rise to unanticipated and unwanted consequences. More thought needs to be given to the long-term operation of any constitutional amendment and how it will operate consistently with the rest of the Constitution.


To end, I agree that popularity can only be part of the measure of a proposal's suitability.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2013-03-12,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (12:51):  I rise also to speak to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill and to commend it to the Senate. This bill delivers our nation a very clear path towards amending the Australia Constitution to ensure we rightfully recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. I can say with certainty that the Gillard Labor government is committed to respectfully recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in our Constitution.


I believe that constitutional change is a necessary and important act that all members of parliament should be committed to delivering. It is through this change that we can create a better future, a future of recognition, respect and acknowledgement of the inhabitants of Australia and their ongoing connection with their traditional land, waters, cultures, languages and heritage. It is my belief that our nation should be proud to embrace and acknowledge the longstanding heritage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples within the Constitution, as it is only by recognising our country's first people that we as a nation can build a strong future together. 


This is an issue that I have been passionate about since before I became a senator in this place. Australia has always prided itself on being a multicultural nation, one that welcomes people from faraway shores, one that appreciates diversity and respects the influence and beauty each culture delivers to our social fabric. Yet our Constitution does not reflect our heritage. It does not reflect or recognise the powerful role our first Australians played in our future. I believe that it is time we moved to right those wrongs of our past and move towards a Constitution that reflects the dignity of all Australians, especially Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.


I would like to acknowledge the substantial work that has been done to prepare for this change. In 2010 Labor established the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples. This panel was co-chaired by Professor Patrick Dodson and Mr Mark Leibler AC, as well as Indigenous leaders, parliamentary members and constitutional experts, including a member from my home state of Tasmania, Bill Lawson, with whom I have met to discuss the significance of these reforms.


The panel was given the task of leading wide-ranging public consultation and through this consultation the panel was able to deliver a report to the Prime Minister. This report provides a clear proposal on how best to proceed in recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The expert panel's recommendation is that the best way forward is to achieve constitutional change. On 20 September 2012, in response to the expert panel's report, the government committed to constitutional change. That includes: a statement of recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and their unique history, culture and connection to this land; removal of references to race, reflecting the nation's fundamental belief in the importance of equality and nondiscrimination; and acknowledgement that additional effort is needed to help close the gap in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's disadvantage.


Cross-party support, though, is required to achieve this result, and with that in mind the government made a commitment to establish a Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples. The joint select committee takes on the role of engaging with the broader community and discussing referendum proposals for constitutional change.


Among the Tasmanian Aboriginal leaders from my home state I know that my friend and stalwart advocate of human rights with Amnesty International, Rodney Dillon, has been awaiting the day that this recognition could take place. Speaking with Rodney about this bill, there is no doubt that he and many other Tasmanian Indigenous people believe that constitutional recognition is an essential part of a prosperous future for Australia. Like me, he believes that it is important that when Australians stand up for our nation and our country we all stand up for the same reasons. It is time that the patriotic songs Australians sing and the nation for which we all come together are carried on through the voices of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. And while we cannot and should not attempt to bury the past, we can certainly go ahead as a new and united Australia.


This bill sends an important signal to the broader Australian community. Not only does it begin the parliamentary and electoral process towards a referendum, a very important process as part of any reform to our Constitution, but it also marks the beginning of a campaign to build community support in earnest. That is a very significant step because without community support, as we know through various referenda in the past in our nation, we simply do not receive a change to our Constitution. The history of Australian referenda shows that broad and bipartisan community support is necessary to make any Constitutional amendments. A Constitution is only a document unless its spirit is reflected in our actions. Recognition is something that we must do as a community as much as a polity and, if we are to achieve this change, we will need to have that support of the community.


This bill is also an important act of recognition, an act that begins a process here that will be concluded by the next parliament and then by Australian voters and citizens. It will be the most significant of a number of landmark acts of reconciliation in recent decades. I am sure that many senators in this place will recall that some 10 years ago 300,000 people walked proudly across Sydney Harbour Bridge in recognition and support of Indigenous Australians. This walk was soon replicated in other capital cities across Australia and it generated a strong awareness of the need for reconciliation. Indeed, I remember in my home state of Tasmania walking across the Tasman Bridge with thousands of local Tasmanians all in support of reconciliation.


Of course, further back than that one only has to remember that in 1992 our nation witnessed Paul Keating speak so strongly on the need for healing in his watershed Redfern speech. Keating's speech put reconciliation on our nation's agenda. Then in 2009 Kevin Rudd made a national apology to the forgotten Australians, the half a million children who were raised in institutions. This bill will move Australia even closer to repairing the bonds between Australians with a formal recognition of our Indigenous peoples. The Gillard Labor government has invested some $10 million to help educate people about this change and build the momentum for that change. Over the next two years, Reconciliation Australia will be helping to promote awareness about this issue as well as play a role in educating Australians of its importance. I commend the work of Reconciliation Australia. I know they are already undertaking that role right across our nation. They have quite a task ahead of them and need all of our support as they go about our nation educating Australia.


I believe that as parliamentarians and senators in this place we are all tasked with the responsibility to lead this change. By supporting the passage of this bill through the Senate we are ensuring that constitutional recognition for all Australians is placed firmly on our nation's agenda—somewhere it certainly should be placed.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2013-03-12,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (13:00):  I make it clear that I support the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012, but I also think we should be going much further much more quickly. I believe our laws and our Constitution, the supreme law under which our government operates, should apply equally to all.


A century ago, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were excluded from shaping our Constitution. Indigenous Australians were not even considered citizens until 1967. We cannot go back and right the wrongs that have occurred since European settlement but we can make a change today. Our Constitution currently excludes Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and as a result our nation has failed to acknowledge their role and the fact that they are the first peoples of this nation. It is a basic fact, but a brutal flaw. I find it hard to believe that anyone could think that we need to take more time before we decide to take action. It is time to move on from the politics of this issue and take it to the Australian people. My preference is that this matter should go to the Australian people at a referendum. I think there is enough understanding in the community and enough compassion for a change of this sort.


There is no question we have come some way. In 1988, the landmark Mabo case gave recognition to native title in Australia for the first time. In 1992, then Prime Minister Paul Keating delivered his historic Redfern address—and I note that Senator Singh made reference to that. Keating poignantly argued:


We cannot imagine that the descendants of people whose genius and resilience maintained a culture here through 50,000 years or more, through cataclysmic changes to the climate and environment, and who then survived two centuries of dispossession and abuse, will be denied their place in the modern Australian nation.


In 2008, then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd delivered an apology to Indigenous Australians for the stolen generations—a significant, watershed moment. We have come some way, even in the last few years, but I think we ought to go further.


I understand there is a fear that if a referendum were held it would not succeed. My view is that with good will and bipartisanship such a referendum could succeed. Simply having a review at this time is not the brave course to take forward. We need to be brave; we need to take a step, to make a move, to hold a vote. I usually believe that when it comes to change you have to work on bringing people with you, but I think we have brought people with us over the years. We need to have a vote on constitutional recognition sooner rather than later. A review, whilst welcome, does not take the step we ought to be taking. I only hope that what this bill represents will be the beginning of change that is long overdue.

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2013-03-12,"



Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (13:03):  The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012 represents a clear step forward towards holding a successful referendum to change the Australian Constitution to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. This bill will establish an act of recognition acknowledging the unique and special place of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the first peoples of our nation. This government is committed to recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Australian Constitution. We believe that the Australian Constitution should, firstly, recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and their unique history, culture and connection to this land; secondly, reflect our country's fundamental belief in the importance of equality by removing all references to race; and, thirdly, acknowledge that additional efforts are needed to close the gap on Indigenous disadvantage in this country.


The government appointed an expert panel to consider, consult and advise on how best to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Constitution, and on possible options for change that would likely get the support of the majority of Australians at a referendum. The expert panel consisted of a range of respected and accomplished individuals, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and community leaders, constitutional law experts and parliamentary members. Following wide-ranging consultation in 2011 the government received the final report of the expert panel in January 2012. We publicly acknowledge the hard work and dedication of expert panel members which have led to us having, for the first time, a proposal for constitutional change.


We recognise that there is not yet enough community awareness or support for change to hold a successful referendum at or before the next federal election. The act of recognition that this bill establishes will continue to build the momentum we need for a successful constitutional change. To maintain momentum towards a referendum, a sunset provision in the bill limits the effects of the act to two years. The sunset date ensures that legislative recognition does not become entrenched at the expense of continued progress towards constitutional change. The sunset provision will provide an impetus for a future parliament to reassess how the campaign for change is travelling and the appropriate timing for a successful referendum. The bill also provides for a review to consider and advise a future parliament on proposals to submit a referendum, taking into account the valuable work done by the expert panel.


This bill is not a substitute for constitutional recognition; legislation is not the appropriate forum to address all of the recommendations of the Expert Panel for constitutional change. We are pleased there is strong commitment across the parliament to supporting this bill. We are also pleased that the new Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples considered this bill as its first order of business and recommended it be passed unamended.


The government is committed to building stronger relationships with Indigenous people based on mutual respect as well as a reconciled future where all Australians are equal partners with equal opportunities in shaping the future of our country. That is why the government funds Reconciliation Australia: to improve relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. And that is why the government delivered the national apology to Indigenous Australians, which helped build a bridge of respect between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples.


Meaningful constitutional recognition of the nation's first peoples is another step—a crucial step—in Australia's journey toward reconciliation. The Australian Constitution is the foundation document for our law and for our government, but it is silent in respect of the special place for our first Australians. This bill in an important step toward a meaningful recognition in our Constitution of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.

Senator THORP
 (Tasmania) (12:31):  One of the first referendums was the 1967 referendum, where the Australian people were asked whether Aboriginal people should be counted in the national census and be subject to Commonwealth laws rather than just state laws. This referendum was a landslide, winning close to 91 per cent of all votes cast. No referendum before or since has been so heartily endorsed by the Australian people. The overwhelming result gave the government at the time a clear mandate to enact policies that would benefit Aboriginal people. 


Another nation-defining event was the historic 1992 Mabo decision. Here the High Court ruled that the Meriam people of the Murray Islands in the Torres Strait were 'entitled as against the whole world to possession, occupation, use and enjoyment of most of the lands of the Murray Islands'. In doing so, they rejected the longstanding, but patently false, concept of terra nullius—land belonging to no-one. That was a big step, indeed, and one which led to the drafting of the 1993 Native Title Act by the Keating government.


Keating reinforced the need to admit the truth of our history in the now famous Redfern speech of 1992. This watershed speech was the first time that an Australian Prime Minister had acknowledged the impacts of government policies since Federation on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It clearly placed reconciliation on the national agenda and has since been referred to as one of the most powerful and important speeches of all time. But, more than that, it reflected a commitment to make the future better. In Keating's words: 


This is a fundamental test of our social goals and our national will: our ability to say to ourselves and the rest of the world that Australia is a first rate social democracy, that we are what we should be—truly the land of the fair go and the better chance.


Sixteen years after Keating's message of acknowledgement and respect came another unforgettable speech and another milestone on the path to reconciliation. The 2008 National Apology to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples by then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd was one of those very rare speeches that united the House and the nation. I daresay there are many Australians who will remember exactly where they were that day and how moved they were. In Mr Rudd's words, the apology was a recognition that:


The time has now come for the nation to turn a new page in Australia's history by righting the wrongs of the past and so moving forward with confidence to the future.


This was a truly defining moment in our national history, of which I am immensely proud. The speech went to the very heart of the Labor values that are so close to my heart: fairness, equality, inclusiveness, opportunity and respect. Since Kevin Rudd's watershed apology, this government has been working very hard, in partnership with the states, to achieve better outcomes for Indigenous Australians. In 2008 the Council of Australian Governments agreed to six ambitious targets to address the disadvantage faced by Indigenous Australians in life expectancy, child mortality, education and employment.


But despite all the hard work and commitment towards rectifying inequality and creating opportunity for all, we still have one major hurdle to leap. That is, the formal recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people within our Constitution. To this end, the bill enshrines some very important elements. It recognises that the continent and its islands, now known as Australia, were first occupied by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and acknowledges the continuing relationship of Indigenous people with their traditional lands and waters. It also formalises respect for the continuing cultures, languages and heritage and acknowledges the need to secure the advancement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. It also recognises that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages are the original Australian languages and are part of our national heritage.


The will for this recognition is clearly there in the community. We only need to look at the groundswell of public support across the nation. Political representatives on both sides of this chamber also agree. But we must face the reality that constitutional amendments are notoriously difficult to achieve. Of 44 referendums held since Federation, only eight have passed. And we know that failed referendums can lead to important decisions being discarded for decades—one springs to mind, Mr Deputy President. If we were to rush into this, we would risk condemning this important acknowledgement to just another footnote in history.

If this is to happen, the proposal must be modest and the tone of the debate must be respectful.'


I come to this issue with a great deal of caution, indeed some apprehension. I am very cautious about the merit of recognition in our constitutional document. That said, I believe there to be tremendous merit and popular support for two of the proposals contained in the expert panel report, Recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Constitution; namely, those proposals that seek to remove reference to race. I also recognise that others have started from a similar position to my own and have been able to reconcile their concerns and are now prepared, while remaining cautious, to modest proposals. 


The difficulty in finding an appropriate form for securing recognition in our Constitution and the legal uncertainty it introduces should not come as a surprise to anyone who has taken the time to properly understand the report of the expert panel. I have been drawn to the more conservative and cautionary analysis and scrutiny given to this issue by accomplished constitutional experts. I think it is a shame and an ominous sign that their views have not been given more coverage. 


It is worth reminding ourselves how we got to the debate on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012. As a preface, I would add that I do not believe we are close to a point where there is a clear, concise and popular proposition. The expert panel reported to the Prime Minister on 19 January 2012, recommending a referendum on five constitutional changes. The first would remove section 25, which contemplates the possibility of state laws disqualifying people from voting at state elections on the basis of their race. The second would remove section 51(xvi), which can be used by the Commonwealth to enact legislation to discriminate for or against people on the basis of race. The third involves the insertion of a new section 51(a) that would recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and preserve the Australian government's ability to pass laws for the advancement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The fourth would insert a new section 16(a), banning racial discrimination by the Commonwealth. Finally, the fifth would insert a new section 127(a), recognising that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages were the country's first tongues while confirming that English is Australia's national language.


Recognising that there was not yet enough community awareness or support for change and wanting to maintain momentum for change, this bill was prepared to assist Australians to become familiar with formal recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples ahead of constitutional change. I note that this approach has a parallel in our history and was used in the 1890s to build and maintain momentum amongst the colonies for Federation. The comments of the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples in its interim report in January this year makes a salient point that is worth emphasising. The committee cautions that if the proposal is the victim of overreach it will fail. While the committee does not seek to limit the scope of public discussion, it nevertheless considers that only a relatively modest proposal is capable of engendering the bipartisan consensus which is a prerequisite to success.


My caution has two root causes. Firstly, in my mind the link between constitutional recognition of Indigenous peoples and better outcomes for them, their families and communities has not yet been established. I think constitutional recognition is unfounded if there is not an expectation of some tangible, practical improvement in the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. As we embark upon this public discussion on the merits of any constitutional amendments, I believe Australians have a clear view of what their Constitution has been designed to do, or more accurately what it has not been designed to do. In the simplest terms, I believe they see their Australian Constitution as a rule book, established as a set of guidelines for how a newly created Federation was to govern itself and conduct its activities. I accept that for a smaller group of Australians, the Australian Constitution may be seen not so much as a rule book but as a mission statement, a catalogue of intent, ideals and statements about where we want to be heading as a nation. I am not opposed to any of those things; aspiration is a virtue. No nation can be secure for long without a clear notion of its identity or purpose. For me, as a self-confessed constitutional conservative, I am not persuaded that the ideal place to be giving expression to these aspirations for reconciliation and recognition should be in the text of the Australian Constitution. 


Secondly and more substantively are the serious but conveniently ignored legal considerations. Of all the commentary and analysis, I am most inclined to trust the work of Professor Anne Twomey, Director of the Constitutional Reform Unit at the University of Sydney, who has given careful and dispassionate accounts of the possible legal pitfalls and shortcomings of various forms of recognition canvassed to date. I particularly agree with her comment that a lack of clarity about the purpose of Indigenous recognition will always leave the issue open to accusations of it being a 'false promise or a Trojan Horse'. For this reason, I am particularly pleased the bill has been silent on what form recognition should take. It is a wise course that this bill lacks a form of words for agreement and is silent on whether recognition should be incorporated in a preamble or in the substantive provisions of the Constitution.


I believe progress can easily be made in two areas proposed by the expert panel while others, with sound reason, are more contentious and should be treated with great suspicion. The propositions to remove section 25 and section 51(xvi) should be agreed to. Section 25 has been regularly recommended for repeal by many constitutional review bodies since 1959. In the words of Professor Twomey: 


It is therefore appropriate to repeal it – not as a racist provision, but one whose work is now done.


Section 51(xvi) should be repealed on the basis that there should be no provisions in our Constitution that permit laws to be enacted by reference to race. A repeal of this section would also be acceptable to many. A difficulty arises here because this particular section underpins the Native Title Act 1993 and the heritage protection of sacred sites. I do remain confident that there is an answer to this dilemma. It may be that a refined and carefully worded new power could be substituted. However, the remedy proposed by the expert panel is most definitely unacceptable. It has proposed, firstly, that a new section 51A to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and to preserve the Australian government's ability to pass laws for the benefit of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples should be treated with great caution; and, secondly, a new section 116A that would introduce into the Constitution a prohibition of racial discrimination. This suggested remedy has been construed by some as giving effect to a small bill of rights, the essence of which will be to give a greater role to the courts than to parliament in determining the meaning of 'advancement' and 'discrimination'. On these points I encourage the reading of analysis by Professor Twomey again, who has suggested:


The greatest controversy will hang on the fact that it would ultimately be a matter for a court to decide what was, or was not, for the advancement of Indigenous Australians


In regards to the new section 16A, she has commented:


… such a provision can be interpreted by the courts in ways that were not intended and there is no option of reversing such an interpretation by legislation.


And further:


The level of discretion left to the courts in determining what amounts to discrimination, who is protected and whether a law or executive act is for the purpose of overcoming disadvantage etc, is significant.


On this point, I am confident Australians will treat with great reluctance the shift of these judgements from parliament to the courts. If we stay on this course of approach to constitutional recognition the proposal will fail, not because people do not endorse the principles inherent but because they object to a shift of power on matters of definition from parliament to the courts. This is a concern shared by even Aboriginal commentators who have correctly identified that this could open a Pandora's box of litigation and dispute. 


Above all else, I am curious that in a modern era like this with all the high hopes for a brighter reconciled future between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and other Australians, our constitutional remedy still involves at its core the acknowledgement of one group of Australians to the exclusion of others. I believe the only acceptable constitutional reform for a modern, progressive nation such as ours is one that seeks to remove all reference to race. 


My final comment goes to the purpose of the review and its role in assessing the readiness of the community to support a referendum and the identification of proposals most likely to be supported. I agree with the sentiments of some others that there is a more important question than one of success or popularity. I think again the comments by Professor Twomey deserve greater appreciation by many. She says:


The more important question is what form of amendment is right, appropriate and consistent with the operation of the rest of the Constitution. There should be scope for the making of some kind of judgement as to what the best form of amendment would be, as well as would attract the most popular support.


She adds:


It may be inappropriate for example to make an amendment that is popular if it causes unresolved conflicts with other constitutional provisions potentially giving rise to unanticipated and unwanted consequences. More thought needs to be given to the long-term operation of any constitutional amendment and how it will operate consistently with the rest of the Constitution.


To end, I agree that popularity can only be part of the measure of a proposal's suitability.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2013-03-12,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (12:51):  I rise also to speak to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill and to commend it to the Senate. This bill delivers our nation a very clear path towards amending the Australia Constitution to ensure we rightfully recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. I can say with certainty that the Gillard Labor government is committed to respectfully recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in our Constitution.


I believe that constitutional change is a necessary and important act that all members of parliament should be committed to delivering. It is through this change that we can create a better future, a future of recognition, respect and acknowledgement of the inhabitants of Australia and their ongoing connection with their traditional land, waters, cultures, languages and heritage. It is my belief that our nation should be proud to embrace and acknowledge the longstanding heritage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples within the Constitution, as it is only by recognising our country's first people that we as a nation can build a strong future together. 


This is an issue that I have been passionate about since before I became a senator in this place. Australia has always prided itself on being a multicultural nation, one that welcomes people from faraway shores, one that appreciates diversity and respects the influence and beauty each culture delivers to our social fabric. Yet our Constitution does not reflect our heritage. It does not reflect or recognise the powerful role our first Australians played in our future. I believe that it is time we moved to right those wrongs of our past and move towards a Constitution that reflects the dignity of all Australians, especially Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.


I would like to acknowledge the substantial work that has been done to prepare for this change. In 2010 Labor established the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples. This panel was co-chaired by Professor Patrick Dodson and Mr Mark Leibler AC, as well as Indigenous leaders, parliamentary members and constitutional experts, including a member from my home state of Tasmania, Bill Lawson, with whom I have met to discuss the significance of these reforms.


The panel was given the task of leading wide-ranging public consultation and through this consultation the panel was able to deliver a report to the Prime Minister. This report provides a clear proposal on how best to proceed in recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The expert panel's recommendation is that the best way forward is to achieve constitutional change. On 20 September 2012, in response to the expert panel's report, the government committed to constitutional change. That includes: a statement of recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and their unique history, culture and connection to this land; removal of references to race, reflecting the nation's fundamental belief in the importance of equality and nondiscrimination; and acknowledgement that additional effort is needed to help close the gap in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's disadvantage.


Cross-party support, though, is required to achieve this result, and with that in mind the government made a commitment to establish a Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples. The joint select committee takes on the role of engaging with the broader community and discussing referendum proposals for constitutional change.


Among the Tasmanian Aboriginal leaders from my home state I know that my friend and stalwart advocate of human rights with Amnesty International, Rodney Dillon, has been awaiting the day that this recognition could take place. Speaking with Rodney about this bill, there is no doubt that he and many other Tasmanian Indigenous people believe that constitutional recognition is an essential part of a prosperous future for Australia. Like me, he believes that it is important that when Australians stand up for our nation and our country we all stand up for the same reasons. It is time that the patriotic songs Australians sing and the nation for which we all come together are carried on through the voices of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. And while we cannot and should not attempt to bury the past, we can certainly go ahead as a new and united Australia.


This bill sends an important signal to the broader Australian community. Not only does it begin the parliamentary and electoral process towards a referendum, a very important process as part of any reform to our Constitution, but it also marks the beginning of a campaign to build community support in earnest. That is a very significant step because without community support, as we know through various referenda in the past in our nation, we simply do not receive a change to our Constitution. The history of Australian referenda shows that broad and bipartisan community support is necessary to make any Constitutional amendments. A Constitution is only a document unless its spirit is reflected in our actions. Recognition is something that we must do as a community as much as a polity and, if we are to achieve this change, we will need to have that support of the community.


This bill is also an important act of recognition, an act that begins a process here that will be concluded by the next parliament and then by Australian voters and citizens. It will be the most significant of a number of landmark acts of reconciliation in recent decades. I am sure that many senators in this place will recall that some 10 years ago 300,000 people walked proudly across Sydney Harbour Bridge in recognition and support of Indigenous Australians. This walk was soon replicated in other capital cities across Australia and it generated a strong awareness of the need for reconciliation. Indeed, I remember in my home state of Tasmania walking across the Tasman Bridge with thousands of local Tasmanians all in support of reconciliation.


Of course, further back than that one only has to remember that in 1992 our nation witnessed Paul Keating speak so strongly on the need for healing in his watershed Redfern speech. Keating's speech put reconciliation on our nation's agenda. Then in 2009 Kevin Rudd made a national apology to the forgotten Australians, the half a million children who were raised in institutions. This bill will move Australia even closer to repairing the bonds between Australians with a formal recognition of our Indigenous peoples. The Gillard Labor government has invested some $10 million to help educate people about this change and build the momentum for that change. Over the next two years, Reconciliation Australia will be helping to promote awareness about this issue as well as play a role in educating Australians of its importance. I commend the work of Reconciliation Australia. I know they are already undertaking that role right across our nation. They have quite a task ahead of them and need all of our support as they go about our nation educating Australia.


I believe that as parliamentarians and senators in this place we are all tasked with the responsibility to lead this change. By supporting the passage of this bill through the Senate we are ensuring that constitutional recognition for all Australians is placed firmly on our nation's agenda—somewhere it certainly should be placed.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2013-03-12,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (13:00):  I make it clear that I support the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012, but I also think we should be going much further much more quickly. I believe our laws and our Constitution, the supreme law under which our government operates, should apply equally to all.


A century ago, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were excluded from shaping our Constitution. Indigenous Australians were not even considered citizens until 1967. We cannot go back and right the wrongs that have occurred since European settlement but we can make a change today. Our Constitution currently excludes Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and as a result our nation has failed to acknowledge their role and the fact that they are the first peoples of this nation. It is a basic fact, but a brutal flaw. I find it hard to believe that anyone could think that we need to take more time before we decide to take action. It is time to move on from the politics of this issue and take it to the Australian people. My preference is that this matter should go to the Australian people at a referendum. I think there is enough understanding in the community and enough compassion for a change of this sort.


There is no question we have come some way. In 1988, the landmark Mabo case gave recognition to native title in Australia for the first time. In 1992, then Prime Minister Paul Keating delivered his historic Redfern address—and I note that Senator Singh made reference to that. Keating poignantly argued:


We cannot imagine that the descendants of people whose genius and resilience maintained a culture here through 50,000 years or more, through cataclysmic changes to the climate and environment, and who then survived two centuries of dispossession and abuse, will be denied their place in the modern Australian nation.


In 2008, then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd delivered an apology to Indigenous Australians for the stolen generations—a significant, watershed moment. We have come some way, even in the last few years, but I think we ought to go further.


I understand there is a fear that if a referendum were held it would not succeed. My view is that with good will and bipartisanship such a referendum could succeed. Simply having a review at this time is not the brave course to take forward. We need to be brave; we need to take a step, to make a move, to hold a vote. I usually believe that when it comes to change you have to work on bringing people with you, but I think we have brought people with us over the years. We need to have a vote on constitutional recognition sooner rather than later. A review, whilst welcome, does not take the step we ought to be taking. I only hope that what this bill represents will be the beginning of change that is long overdue.

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2013-03-12,"



Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (13:03):  The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Recognition Bill 2012 represents a clear step forward towards holding a successful referendum to change the Australian Constitution to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. This bill will establish an act of recognition acknowledging the unique and special place of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the first peoples of our nation. This government is committed to recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Australian Constitution. We believe that the Australian Constitution should, firstly, recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and their unique history, culture and connection to this land; secondly, reflect our country's fundamental belief in the importance of equality by removing all references to race; and, thirdly, acknowledge that additional efforts are needed to close the gap on Indigenous disadvantage in this country.


The government appointed an expert panel to consider, consult and advise on how best to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Constitution, and on possible options for change that would likely get the support of the majority of Australians at a referendum. The expert panel consisted of a range of respected and accomplished individuals, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and community leaders, constitutional law experts and parliamentary members. Following wide-ranging consultation in 2011 the government received the final report of the expert panel in January 2012. We publicly acknowledge the hard work and dedication of expert panel members which have led to us having, for the first time, a proposal for constitutional change.


We recognise that there is not yet enough community awareness or support for change to hold a successful referendum at or before the next federal election. The act of recognition that this bill establishes will continue to build the momentum we need for a successful constitutional change. To maintain momentum towards a referendum, a sunset provision in the bill limits the effects of the act to two years. The sunset date ensures that legislative recognition does not become entrenched at the expense of continued progress towards constitutional change. The sunset provision will provide an impetus for a future parliament to reassess how the campaign for change is travelling and the appropriate timing for a successful referendum. The bill also provides for a review to consider and advise a future parliament on proposals to submit a referendum, taking into account the valuable work done by the expert panel.


This bill is not a substitute for constitutional recognition; legislation is not the appropriate forum to address all of the recommendations of the Expert Panel for constitutional change. We are pleased there is strong commitment across the parliament to supporting this bill. We are also pleased that the new Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples considered this bill as its first order of business and recommended it be passed unamended.


The government is committed to building stronger relationships with Indigenous people based on mutual respect as well as a reconciled future where all Australians are equal partners with equal opportunities in shaping the future of our country. That is why the government funds Reconciliation Australia: to improve relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. And that is why the government delivered the national apology to Indigenous Australians, which helped build a bridge of respect between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples.


Meaningful constitutional recognition of the nation's first peoples is another step—a crucial step—in Australia's journey toward reconciliation. The Australian Constitution is the foundation document for our law and for our government, but it is silent in respect of the special place for our first Australians. This bill in an important step toward a meaningful recognition in our Constitution of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.

 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (14:01):  My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer to the need for Australia's Minister for Foreign Affairs to have an unblemished reputation for probity. Accordingly, I refer to the statement by former New South Wales Premier Morris Iemma: 'It took Eddie Obeid 20 years to build the power and influence that he had and, for 17 of those, Bob was leader.' I also refer to Mr Iemma's statement that he, former Premier Carr, made Obeid a cabinet minister:


… he waltzed into the caucus room when the vote was happening and very publically voted for him … To send a message …


Don't Mr Iemma's statements cast serious doubts on the minister's claims on Four Corners last night that he saw Eddie Obeid as a 'marginal figure, never to be taken seriously' and therefore reflect on the minister's reputation and our reputation overseas?

  Mr President, on a further point of order: whilst I have no doubt Senator Carr is quite capable of answering this question very well, I would ask you to consider whether any aspect of that question in fact related to his portfolio.



The PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order. The ruling is that I draw the minister's attention to the question and the minister has one minute 41 seconds remaining to answer the question.




Senator BOB CARR:
  This is a disgraceful attempt to embarrass a factional figure in the Liberal Party, who was nothing less than chair of an Obeid family company. Senator Sinodinos had Obeids on his payroll. He was chair of a company.




Senator Brandis:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order. The minister entirely disregarded your ruling that he address the question, from the moment he resumed his answer. And I might point out, Mr President, that when you ruled against Senator Wong's point of order she continued from her seat to shout at you and dispute your ruling. You must assert your authority, Mr President.

  One of the saddest things we witness in this chamber, or any other parliamentary chamber, is the sad effect of factionalism on a once great political party.

  I raise a point of order, Mr president. With great respect, sessional orders do require direct relevance. And direct relevance would require the minister not to seek to obscure the question by referring to others, but deal with the issue as to whether this minister can be treated internationally as a person of probity if he is not telling the truth about his conduct as Premier of New South Wales.

  Mr President, on the point of order, the question from Senator Abetz was barely within standing orders. It has a clear imputation that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had been misleading and not telling the full truth, and I think Senator Bob Carr is absolutely entitled to treat a question that broad with the contempt with which I think he is treating it. He is well within relevance to the question that he was asked, and I ask you to dismiss this frivolous point of order.



The PRESIDENT:  Wait a minute, Senator Brandis. I had Senator Joyce on his feet before you wanting to take a point of order.



Honourable senators interjecting—




Senator Joyce:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order—Senator Faulkner was referring to an Ian Macdonald as a grub. I just wanted to make sure that he was referring to his former colleague and not imputing the character of Senator Macdonald, who we know is not. I can understand his factional ally is a grub. I can understand that particularly.



The PRESIDENT:  That is debating the issue. There is no point of order.



Honourable senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  I am waiting for silence on both sides. Senator Brandis.




Senator BRANDIS:
  Mr President, you have not, I do not think, ruled on the previous point of order previous to Senator Joyce's. On the point of order, two things. Firstly, Senator Conroy in his contribution concedes that the question was within standing orders by conceding that it was barely within standing orders; it either is or it is not.



The PRESIDENT:  That is debating.




Senator Brandis:
  Secondly, in your ruling I ask you to make it clear to all senators—but particularly the Leader of the Government—that it is not within sessional or standing orders for a minister to respond to a question by, to use Senator Conroy's words, 'treating it with contempt'. It must be answered.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Mr President, on the point of order, this is the third occasion—and to countless points of order from the opposition—that this issue has scurrilously been raised. There is no issue of contempt for the chair.



Honourable senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  It would assist question time if people on both sides settled down. If people feel so passionately about this they can debate it at the end of question time, that is the appropriate time. There is no point of order.




Senator BOB CARR:
  There is only one international implication of the career of Mr Eddie Obeid—late of the New South Wales parliament—and that is that a member of the Australian Senate was in business with him, in deep business with him. A member of the Australian Senate had a five per cent interest concealed and hidden from the public gaze in a company— (Time expired)

Senator BOB CARR
 (New South Wales—Minister for Foreign Affairs) (14:21):  I thank you for your guidance, Mr President. The international implications of this, the international reputation involved here, are probity and falsity. For a member of the Australian Senate to conceal a five per cent shareholding in a company one-third owned by Mr Eddie Obeid, now the subject of some public attention, does raise matters of repute and matters of credibility.



Honourable senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! When the Senate is ready on both sides we will proceed.




Senator Fifield:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order on relevance. There is only one senator in this chamber who appointed Eddie Obeid as a minister.



The PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order. That is debating the issue. You have the time after question time to debate it.




Senator BOB CARR:
  To confirm that, I can reveal to the Senate that the ICAC has seized records of Australian Water Holdings relevant to the chairmanship of this company, an Obeid family company one-third owned by Mr Obeid, of the secretary to the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Sinodinos.




Senator Abetz:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order. Sessional orders are very clear: answers need to be directly relevant. Could you please explain to the Senate and the viewing public how that answer in any way, shape or form is relevant, let alone directly relevant?



The PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order.




Senator BOB CARR:
  And, when asked about this by the Sydney Morning Herald, Senator Sinodinos's response about not revealing the shareholdings, as he was required by law, was, 'I had a gentlemen's agreement with Mr Obeid.' I think that speaks for itself. Thank you for the question.




Senator Heffernan:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order. For the record: those shares were declared on the pecuniary interest register.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:03):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Bob Carr) to a question without notice asked by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Abetz) today relating to ministerial conduct.


Australia is entitled to be assured that its senior representative on the international stage is a respectable and credible person. Putting political differences aside, nobody could doubt that Mr Kevin Rudd, when he was the foreign minister, was a respectable and serious person. Nobody could doubt that his predecessor as foreign minister, Mr Stephen Smith, was a serious and reputable person. But I am sorry to say that the current foreign minister, who likes to posture and present an urbane face to the world, is not, on inspection, a serious and reputable person. All that glisters is not gold, and, although Senator Bob Carr is so intellectually vain that he even wrote a book about how many books he has read, when you look at Senator Bob Carr's record as a public figure in New South Wales, and when you consider the response today in the Senate when he was taken to task for it, that record is one of shame and disgrace. This is what his successor as the Labor Premier of New South Wales, Mr Morris Iemma, said yesterday:


It took Eddie Obeid 20-odd years to build the power and influence he had and for 17 of those Bob—


that is, Senator Bob Carr—


was leader.


He said further:


Well he made him a cabinet minister and not only did he make him a cabinet minister, he waltzed into the caucus room when the vote was happening and very publically voted for him. To send a message that, 'Not only am I gonna vote for Eddie, but here, look at this, all of you should vote for him as well.' And why was he made a cabinet minister? For services rendered and support given.


Those are not the words of a Liberal politician. Those are the words of Mr Morris Iemma, Senator Bob Carr's successor as the Premier of New South Wales.


Such was the cesspit of corruption in New South Wales politics during the time of Mr Bob Carr's premiership, such was the Sumerian gloom into which that state had descended when he led it, that counsel assisting the ICAC inquiry before Justice Ipp, which is sitting in Sydney at the moment, described it as 'the most corrupt government of New South Wales since the Rum Corps'—again, not a politician, not a political opponent, but the QC assisting the Ipp inquiry.


The person who presided over that corrupt government—the person who fostered the political career of the source of the corruption, as we now know, Mr Eddie Obeid—was none other than Senator Bob Carr. Senator Carr might mock his accusers on the floor of the Senate today and he might mock the President of the Senate, who seeks to call him to order, but one thing he cannot escape is the stain on his reputation: that he, Senator Bob Carr, as the Premier of New South Wales, presided over the most corrupt government of New South Wales since the Rum Corps and that he, Senator Bob Carr, promoted, fostered, advanced and protected the political career of Mr Eddie Obeid, in the words of Mr Morris Iemma, 'for services rendered and support given'. That is Senator Bob Carr's legacy, and all the honeyed words, all the courtly phrases and all the intellectual grace and charm which Senator Bob Carr affects with all the credibility of a kabuki actor cannot conceal his record, now exposed for the public of New South Wales and the public of Australia to see: that corruption flourished like a forest plant under Senator Bob Carr's premiership. This, embarrassingly, is the face Australia now presents to the world.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2013-03-12,"



Senator CROSSIN
 (Northern Territory) (15:08):  I rise this afternoon in response to the answers that were given in question time and in response to Senator Brandis and, no doubt, speakers that will follow him. I take offence at some of the comparisons that Senator Brandis used then in relation to one of my colleagues—in fact, in relation to any senator in this chamber. It is an unfortunate position you find yourself in when you cannot actually take note and debate the facts and you have to resort to some personal intimations. I think people listening to this do not appreciate that.


There are just two things I want to say before I talk about foreign affairs. One is that, of course, Senator Bob Carr has not been Premier of New South Wales for nearly seven years now, so people out there will probably be thinking, 'What is this all about now that he is not only a member of the federal parliament but also Australia's foreign minister?' So let us get that on the record.


Secondly, I just want to say something in relation to what happened today, when we spent 15 minutes on this first question in the Senate—which, of course, was not related at all to any policy matter or any significant area of reform that this government is trying to undertake. One thing I know is that, when we all come into this chamber as senators, we are asked to complete accurately—always accurately and truthfully—our declaration of senators' interests. One of the things we know, which is now fact, is that one senator in this place, Senator Arthur Sinodinos, did not complete his register of senators' interests correctly—surprisingly, you may say, because he was former Prime Minister John Howard's chief of staff. Why would he not have done that? Surely it was not because he did not know to do it; he clearly did.




Senator Brandis:
  Mr Deputy President, on a point of order on relevance: the question was directed entirely to Senator Carr's conduct and reputation as the Premier of New South Wales. I might remind you, Mr Deputy President, that when Senator Carr, in answer to that question, sought to do what Senator Crossin is now doing—that is, cast aspersions at another senator—the President drew him to the question and, by doing so, ruled that that matter was not responsive to the question.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Brandis. There is no point of order, as Senator Crossin is responding to the answers given—whether they be in order or not in order—by Senator Carr.




Senator CROSSIN:
  You see, it is relevant, because all roads in relation to the declaration of interests by Senator Sinodinos lead to Mr Obeid and to the fact that Senator Sinodinos had shares in a business that was owned significantly by that gentleman and they were not declared on his interests. The point I simply want to make here is that we can spend forever and a day trying to throw aspersions at Senator Carr, throw mud at Senator Carr and malign his nature and his character, but he has been out of New South Wales politics as the Premier for seven years now. He is Australia's foreign minister and, as much as you want to argue about Mr Obeid and what has happened with ICAC in New South Wales, if you are going to have a look at what is going on at this side of the chamber—or purport to look at what happened on this side of the chamber—then you want to have a really good look at what is happening a couple of seats down from you and the failure to declare in your declaration of interests any interests you might have had in this matter at all.


But last week we celebrated International Women's Day, so let us try and turn this debate now to something positive that Foreign Affairs is doing in this country. It gives me a chance in relation to Senator Carr and his portfolio to talk about what work we are doing overseas in supporting women. In the context of International Women's Day, we have through AusAID made a significant commitment to—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Crossin, I did rule that you were in order in the first part when there was a point of order taken, but now I think you are straying from the topic, as Senator Carr did not mention that in any of his answers at all. So I just draw you to the fact that we are taking—



Government senators interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! We are taking note of the answers given by Senator Carr. So you cannot have it both ways, Senator Crossin.




Senator CROSSIN:
  I do not want to reflect on the decision of the chair, but what the coalition is clearly trying to do is suggest that somehow, in some way, Senator Carr at some stage in his past has been involved in activities that are not scrupulous. That is seriously not the case. It is seven years ago. We have debated this topic, and no doubt it has been raised in the media. But, if we want to talk about Senator Carr and his performance, let us talk about his performance as foreign affairs minister. Why are we not talking about that during question time? Why are we not asking Senator Carr, on the back of International Women's Day, about the role we play for women overseas—




Senator Brandis:
  Mr Deputy President, on a point of order, it can hardly be relevant for a senator, in addressing a question before the chair, to ask rhetorically why we are not talking about a different question which she then poses to herself.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you. Senator Crossin, you have the call, and I will remind you of the matter that we are taking note of: the answers given by Senator Carr.




Senator CROSSIN:
  What we are taking note of, I would have thought, is the foreign minister's integrity. As often as Senator Brandis might want to pop up like a jack-in-a-box and suggest that we ought to talk about some negative aspect of this person's integrity and his judgement, we can also talk about the positive role this foreign minister has played. We could also talk about some of the outstanding achievements we have made, particularly when we talk about our commitment to women overseas on the back of International Women's Day. Or we could talk about all of the other senators in this place who actually do lodge a declaration of interest when they are required to, and it is accurate and it is truthful and it does not miss out aspects of our lives that we know have to be recorded in this parliament.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (15:15):  I also rise to take part in the debate on the motion to take note of answers by Senator Bob Carr to questions from Senator Abetz. Although I am a Victorian senator, I actually feel well qualified to take part in this debate. I used to work for a New South Wales government; I used to work in the New South Wales parliament. I used to work for a government that was led by a good, decent and honest premier in Mr Nick Greiner. I did work for that outstanding minister Mr Bruce Baird. And I did have the opportunity to observe closely the then Mr Carr and the way that New South Wales Labor operated. You might recall a fellow by the name of Rex 'Buckets' Jackson, who was a minister in a government in which Mr Carr himself served. Mr Jackson was the corrections minister in New South Wales—




Senator Carol Brown:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order: as much as I am very interested in the CV of Senator Fifield, I do not think that was part of Senator Bob Carr's response today. If you could bring Senator Fifield back to order, that would be good.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I will remind Senator Fifield of the matter before the chair.




Senator FIFIELD:
  I am coming to the point. Mr Jackson went to jail for selling early releases for prisoners, as a prison minister. We are always told that these are aberrations, that these are isolated instances, and that they do not go to the very heart of the culture of the New South Wales Labor Party. Mr Carr used to straddle New South Wales as some sort of political colossus, so I must say that it did bring a smile to my face when Senator Carr, on Four Corners, in reference to Eddie Obeid, said that he was:


… a marginal figure, someone lurking in the corridors, never to be taken that seriously…


That is the old Deidre Chambers defence. You might recall Bill Hunter in the movie Muriel's Wedding, when he was the mayor of Porpoise Spit, walking into a restaurant and his mistress, Deidre Chambers, was there. He saw her and he said: 'Oh, Deidre Chambers. What a coincidence!' We are meant to believe that every time Bob Carr had any association, or was even in the same room as Eddie Obeid, it was: 'Eddie Obeid. What a coincidence! Fancy seeing you here!' They were cheek by jowl. Mr Carr chooses to ignore the method, the manner, the when of the appointment of Eddie Obeid to the frontbench. He prefers to say that it was actually Mr Iemma who gave him a special status. It was Mr Carr who first appointed Mr Obeid as a minister of the Crown.


You know whenever Mr Carr is under pressure because he always reaches for some sort of Chairman Mao story. We saw that on Four Corners when he said: 'Forget about how Eddie Obeid was appointed, let me tell you about how I took on the 'Terribles'. Let me tell you about when I had Eddie Obeid in my office and I pushed him out of the ministry. I got so frustrated I had to reach for my Chairman Mao jar, which held my pencils and pens, and I threw it against the bookcase and, oh boy, I tell you, go and see Barry O'Farrell. Book an appointment with Barry, and if you go into the office you will still see the bookcase and you will still see the nick out of the bookcase the shattering jar caused'. That is part of the Bob Carr—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Carr.




Senator FIFIELD:
  Senator Carr MO, to come up with a colourful story to distract attention. But it was, in fact, Mr Carr who appointed Eddie Obeid as a minister, and Eddie Obeid served as a minister in that government in 1999, in 2000, in 2001, in 2002 and 2003. This was no short-term sojourn on the frontbench; this was five years as a minister of the Crown courtesy of Mr Carr.


But 1999 was not the first time Mr Carr tried to appoint Mr Obeid to the frontbench. He tried in 1995. He backed Mr Obeid over the then opposition frontbencher Mr Bob Martin. It is part of New South Wales Labor folklore that the vote was split at 22-all between Mr Obeid and Mr Martin and the name ended up being drawn not out of a hat, because they could not find one, but out of a briefcase. Mr Martin's name was drawn out and Eddie did not get to be a frontbencher. But Senator Bob Carr, as early as 1995, was fighting to have Eddie Obeid in his ministry. He eventually got there. He got there as the minister for minerals and fisheries. And let us not forget Ms Gabrielle Harrison, who was dumped to make way for Mr Obeid so that he could become the minister for minerals and fisheries. He was known and Mr Coal and Mr Fish.


Bob Carr has been cheek by jowl with Eddie Obeid. He stands condemned. He is not a credible figure to be our foreign minister. (Time expired)

Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (15:20):  I too rise to take part in the debate on the motion to take note of answers by Senator Bob Carr to questions from Senator Abetz. I do not know Senator Sinodinos all that well—we do not serve on any committees together—but I have come to the conclusion that he is quite a polite gentlemen. He often says hello to us in the corridors and he is generally very polite, and so I was very disappointed that he had failed to declare an interest on a number of board—




Senator Brandis:
  Directorships?




Senator BILYK:
  directorships—thank you so much. I think it was about six all up. That is of great concern to me because when we first come to the Senate we are all told how important it is to declare all of our interests. Everybody else manages to do that, but Senator Sinodinos, who is obviously smart—I understand he was handpicked to work for Mr Howard—could not get it right and declare these interests. I wonder whether that was an oversight because he might have been embarrassed that he too has been linked to Mr Obeid.


For the opposition to come in here and try to make a mountain out of a molehill and put it back on Senator Carr personally is absolutely disgraceful. Senator Carr is highly commended on the international stage as the foreign affairs minister. He is highly commended—



Senator Brandis interjecting—




Senator BILYK:
  Are you standing to interject or just walking around? I know you jump up and down all through question time. It took 25 minutes, I noted, to discuss this issue in question time today. One would have to wonder if those on the other side have got no questions to do with policy. We know that that is probably part of why they ran this issue today.


I want to mention something that happened when Mr Howard was Prime Minister and when one of the other senators failed to disclose his shareholdings in various businesses. That, of course, was none other than former senator Santo Santoro. Senator Santoro was sacked by Mr Howard when Mr Howard was Prime Minister for failing to disclose his shareholdings in various businesses.




Senator Fifield:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I know it is against standing orders to reflect on serving senators. It must be perilously close to being against standing orders to reflect on a former senator. For the record, Senator Santoro resigned. He was not dismissed, he was not sacked. He chose to leave the front bench in the parliament.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  It is a debating point, Senator Fifield. There is no point of order. Senator Bilyk, you have the call.




Senator BILYK:
  Whether he resigned or whether he was sacked—I understood he was sacked, and if I am wrong I am happy to retract that—the issue was it all happened because he failed to declare on his register of interests that he had shareholdings in various businesses. I will quote what Mr Howard had to say at that time, and the reason I am doing this is that I am wondering why Mr Abbott has not taken up the issue with Senator Sinodinos about this. Mr Howard said at the time:


This is a clear breach of the Senate rules and of his obligation to me—


that being Mr Howard. He went on:


He had no alternative but to resign.


So I take it back, Senator, and I apologise—he did resign. He was going to be sacked so he jumped first, obviously. The quote went on:


I am frankly angry and disappointed at the Senator's conduct.


This is still former Prime Minister—




Senator Brandis:
  I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy President. I do not rise on this point of order merely for the sake of defending my very dear friend Santo Santoro—though I am proud that he is and always has been a very dear friend of mine. The purpose of the point of order is to point out that this is not relevant. I took a point of order earlier on when Senator Crossin was making her contribution and she reflected on Senator Sinodinos. You ruled against me because you said—as I understood you—that Senator Carr in his answer had referred to Senator Sinodinos and therefore that was relevant to the debate. But there was no reference, not remotely, to former Senator Santoro—or, as I should describe him now, Commendatore Santoro—and therefore I would ask you to rule that this contribution by Senator Bilyk is irrelevant.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Brandis.




Senator Carol Brown:
  Mr Deputy President, on the point of order: you have ruled many times that these debates are very broad ranging and there is latitude given, but in Senator Bilyk's contribution she has been far more relevant than Senator Fifield was when he was giving us his CV about who he worked for and the fact that he is very close to New South Wales. We have heard it all before and we do not need to be told for the first one minute of his contribution in taking note of answers. I again ask you to uphold your previous ruling that it is a very broad ranging debate that we have in taking note of answers and that Senator Brandis's point of order is not a point of order.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Senator Brown. I was going to rule that there is no point of order, but I take note of Senator Brandis's remarks—as I did when it was raised against Senator Fifield—and I remind Senator Bilyk, as I did Senator Fifield, of the nature of the topic that we are debating. You had started to stray off topic for a short while, Senator Bilyk, so I just remind you what the topic is.




Senator BILYK:
  The question was brought up by those on the other side and there was some debate about why they would try to do that to themselves. There is concern, I know, about whose seat Senator Sinodinos might take to get him to the front bench—whether it is when you are in government or in opposition. I know that most people on the other side will do whatever they can to smear and belittle people on this side of the chamber, as they tried to do with Senator Carr, who, as I said, is most highly respected in international area. He has managed to do so much for Australia in the relatively short time he has been the foreign minister. He has secured a seat for Australia as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the term 2013-14. He has announced a road map for reducing sanctions against Zimbabwe. He has developed and finalised a charter for the Commonwealth. Those are just three things out of a number of things that Senator Carr has been able to do in the time he has been in that position. Those on the other side will do anything to throw mud at this side. They know that one on their side did the wrong thing— (Time expired).

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales) (15:28):  I also rise to take note of answers given by Senator Bob Carr to questions asked by Senator Abetz. The question here today really should be: how much of what is happening in New South Wales today could have been avoided had Eddie Obeid not been appointed to the ministry? Yesterday evening on the ABC program Four Corners we heard Mr Carr saying: 




It
'
s breathtaking, the wreckage that he has done
—
a single person who we saw as a marginal figure, someone lurking in the corridors, never to be taken that seriously, could produce this. Well there
'
s something epic


...



You bet you're right, Senator Carr! Had you not promoted him to the ministry and supported him and sponsored him and done all those things, one really wonders whether we would be seeing the worst scandal since the Rum Corps in New South Wales. Also in last night's Four Corners interview Senator Carr said:


I remember he did a very big Lebanese fundraiser in about 1988. So he must've been … He must've been a personality but some time he emerged from the semi-darkness and began to get a special prominence.


Somebody that is just there, in the background et cetera—did not really know him, did not really know much about him et cetera. Funny about that, because in 1988, the very same year, there is Mr Obeid's company donating to Mr Carr's Maroubra campaign. Funny about that—did not really know him, but there he was donating to him. 


Then in 1988, the very same year, for then Minister for Planning and the Environment Carr the issue arose about the Valhalla stables lease. Funny about that—all at the same time he is trying to paint the picture that he did not really know him, he was somebody in the darkness, but here we have then Minister Carr after he met Eddie Obeid twice as minister for the environment during the caretaker period for the 1988 election campaign over changes that Mr Obeid was seeking for his Valhalla stables snow-lease development. Yes, we all know about the snow lease and snowfields in other recent revelations, but Mr Carr could never explain the briefing note from the then director of the National Parks and Wildlife dated 3 March 1988 with respect to Valhalla stables and the difference between what was on the public record and his recollection. This briefing note, in part, said:


The minister requested the service, reviewed the request—


that is, the request from Mr Eddie Obeid—


with a view to providing alternatively worded provisions that could meet the requirements of the lessee.


When we see Mr Carr being thanked by Mr Obeid in his maiden speech, it is little wonder. Why was he made a cabinet minister and why, as my colleagues have said so correctly, did Mr Carr go out of his way to make sure that he became a cabinet minister? It was, as Morris Iemma correctly said, 'for services rendered and support given'. As Senator Faulkner said on yesterday evening's Four Corners: 'He'—Eddie Obeid—'ran Labor governments in New South Wales. That's what he did.'


Of course, he was promoted. He was promoted to the ministry of 1999, and from 1999 to 2004 Bob Carr was asked on at least nine occasions, in the New South Wales parliament and other places, about the behaviour of Mr Obeid. On every one of those occasions, Mr Carr stood by Mr Obeid—whether it was repeatedly about Mr Obeid's pecuniary interest disclosures or whether it was about the Oasis Liverpool development or whether it was about Mr Obeid's involvement in the company related to one of the Keating piggery companies. All along Mr Carr never gave any answers. All he did was stand by his little mate. (Time expired)

The Greens and the Labor Party have a hear no truth, see no truth, speak no truth policy when it comes to the issue of asylum seekers and their failures on our borders. Anyone who dares to even raise the topic or wants to talk about the government's failures is branded as someone who vilifies them and is a racist. 


Whilst the Greens do not like to admit it because it does not suit their purposes, it is a fact that Australia has an excellent record in the acceptance and placement of refugees into this country, with the head of the United Nations acknowledging that Australia has the most generous humanitarian settlement services program in the world, with much of this being achieved because of the policies of the former Howard government. It is a fact that the Greens do not like Australia having strong border protection laws. That is anathema to the Greens and as such they want to shut down any form of debate on the issue.

Rather than taking the approach that in this place, as elected members of parliament, we should be promoting the positive contributions that migrant communities make—whether they be refugees, whether they be people who have moved here because of family ties, whether they have come for work. These people have made a contribution to this country. Yet all we continue to hear from the coalition, right down to when they vote on this motion, is more nastiness, more cruelty and more lies.

Leave granted. 


I table the explanatory memorandum and seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted. 




The speech read as follows—



Last week, WIN Television announced it would be cutting its services to South Australia's South East and Riverland. It's likely this will mean the loss of ten editorial jobs, but it will also have a major impact on the local content broadcasted to these communities.


The importance of local content – broadcasted material that is about local issues, produced by people who live in the area –is important for everyone, not just regional or remote communities. We all want to feel connected with what we see on television: we want to hear our stories, told in our voices.


This is even more vital for regional communities. People living in these areas deserve to have content that is relevant to them, in a way that complements the capital city and national news broadcasts they have access to.


In fact, the importance of local content is so widely acknowledged it has been enshrined in the Broadcasting Services Act 1992.


Since the late 1980s, regional aggregated commercial television broadcasting licences have covered areas in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, with the addition of Tasmania in 2008. These licences require broadcasters to meet specific criteria for local content set out by ACMA.


There was supposed to be further studies done on whether regional areas of South Australia, and indeed Western Australia and the Northern Territory, should be added to this licensing regime. But those studies never took place.


I believe this is a major oversight, and an anomaly that is addressed in this bill. Broadcasting has changed significantly since these areas were included in the Act, with the advent of digital television, online broadcasting and media on demand.


But what we have seen, particularly in regional South Australia, is a decline in local content. Because there is no legal requirement for them to do so, broadcasters are simply taking the easy way out. Any cuts to a network's production budgets will obviously target the region where there is no legislative protection, rather than being distributed more fairly.


There may be more ways to get what you want... but less of what you want being aired.


The aim of this bill is to go some way towards rectifying that oversight. By bringing regional South Australia in line with the other areas listed under the Act, we can ensure that local content is protected.


Local content gives local communities their voice, and we must make sure it cannot be silenced.


I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2013-03-12,"



Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (15:44):  I thought this matter of public importance should start out on a generous note. I believe the government, particularly the Prime Minister, is concerned about the quality of education for Australian schoolchildren. Last year, I listened to the Prime Minister's address to the National Press Club and she spoke about the transformative power of education. She was passionate and she was sincere. All that you can take as given. But my initial enthusiasm for the Prime Minister's speech—some might even say my joy for the speech—was somewhat mixed with a certain trepidation. How, I thought, are improved learning outcomes going to be achieved? How are they going to be implemented? And also, how much is it all going to cost? Listening to the National Press Club address by the Prime Minister, I had to swallow—and I swallowed very hard—and I thought, 'Oh, no, here goes the Labor Party, yet again.'


What is it about the centre-left agenda ever since World War II, whether it be in health, welfare or education—I could add telecommunications but I am generous this afternoon, so we will not go there—that somehow the policy response has always got to be to spend more money, to throw taxpayers' money away at a problem. Haven't we learnt since World War II that in health and welfare—particularly in Indigenous welfare—and now in education that throwing around money is not always the answer—it is just an easy policy prescription. Labor always suffers from a sort of optimistic belief that if we just spend a little bit more, just a few more billion dollars, we will finally get there. Finally, student learning outcomes in this country will get better, if we just spend a little bit more.


You will recall the Building the Education Revolution school halls. We spent $16,000 million on school halls, and what happened to learning outcomes? They went down. We spent $16 billion and learning outcomes went down. Then the government's contribution to laptop computers was a cool $2 billion. What happened to learning outcomes? They got worse. Now we have the Gonski proposals: a National Plan for School Improvement premised on Mr Gonski's report. A sum of $6 ½ billion per annum is the cost of this one. We are told by the Labor Party: 'This time trust us. If we just spend it, it will be okay. This time we will get it right. This time learning outcomes will improve.'


The director of the Grattan Institute's School Education Program, Ben Jensen, recently said that the government's Gonski funding model:


… retells the same old, and failed, story of Australian education: that the only way to fix our schools is to spend more money and to change the way it is divided between schools and students.


Mr Jensen noted that in the past decade—this is terribly important—education spending has increased by nearly three times as much as the proposed Gonski increases, yet Australia is just one of four OECD countries where 15-year-olds went backwards according to international testing results between 2000 and 2009. It worries me to death that the government has spent $16 billion on school halls, $2 billion on laptop computers and yet, when the last round of international testing was done in December of last year, it showed that a quarter of year 4 students in literacy and a third of year 4 and year 8 students in maths and science performed below minimally acceptable international standards. That is not good enough. We have thrown a fortune in this country at the problem and now we are going to throw another $6½ billion dollars a year at it, and apparently that will be enough. Finally, we will get it right. The money will be worth it. That is Labor's argument. I do not think that it is enough and it will not do the job, and I am very worried about.


Finally, I will concede that the Minister for Education, Mr Garrett, finally seems to understand that teacher quality is important. The shadow minister for education, Mr Pyne has been talking about this for some time now, and Mr Garrett is now talking about it too. Mr Garrett did say that the government would look at improving teacher quality—and Senator Kim Carr has mentioned this in question time as well—and he did say that there would be more rigorous and targeted admissions into university courses and a national approach to teacher practicum. I accept that these goals are welcome—it has taken a long time to get this far but they are welcome—but still there is no implementation plan, and again the devil is in the detail. We have had plenty of plans in the past from this lot, but no improved outcomes; that is the problem. 


While the Gonski report recommends a range of proposals to give school leaders and their communities the ability to more flexibly provide for the needs of students—including more power for the principals to hire staff and control budgets—what does any of that mean? After all this Labor still has no agenda and there is still no way of getting there. What conclusive evidence do we have of the government's plans for educational reform? Well, we do have something. We have a bill. It is nine pages long and is about 1,400 words in length. It is called the Australian Education Bill 2012. I like this bill; it is my sort of bill. It is very short and very sweet. It reads like a UN declaration. I will quote from section 3, the objects of the act. It says, 'The objects of this act are for Australian schooling to provide an excellent education for school students and for Australian schooling to be highly equitable.' Well, yeah. It also says in the preamble, 'The quality of education should not be limited by a school's location, particularly those schools in regional Australia.' Yeah. I agree with all that. It also says, 'It is essential that Australian schooling be of a high quality.' Yeah, I agree with that. It is essential for Australian schooling to 'be highly equitable in order to create a highly skilled and successful workforce, strengthen the economy, and increase productivity, leading to greater prosperity for all'. I agree with that too. That is great. It goes on and on. Section 7—reform directions for the national plan—says:


Australian schooling will provide a high quality educational experience …


This is just a motherhood statement. It reads like one of those appalling Nigerian-sponsored human rights documents the Cubans, Nicaraguans and El Salvadorans used to put out.


This is where we are. This bill is a legislative enactment. This is what the government's reforms thus far have come to: this flimsy nine-page document and 1,400 words—all rhetoric, worse even than my contributions to the Senate! What is even worse is section 10 of the bill. I have never come across this in more than a dozen years in the Senate: 'The act does not create legally enforceable obligations'. That is the heading. Subsection 1 reads:


This Act does not create rights or duties that are legally enforceable in judicial or other proceedings.


So let me get this right. We have a bill before this parliament that does not create rights or duties. Oh. I am not a very good lawyer, but I have never come across a bill that states that it does not create rights or duties. If it does not, what is the point of it? Why do we sit here debating very poorly written rhetoric? This is not Abraham Lincoln.


In the end, we have a government that has spent an absolute fortune on education and results keep getting worse. The problem with this government since it started has been that it cannot implement anything. There is a litany of failure in that direction. But it comes to one thing that the Labor Party has never got over: they can spend money all right but have never been able to spend it well and get value. That is their failure. (Time expired)

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2013-03-12,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (15:54):  There is no doubt that the Labor government is now teetering on the brink of missing a once-in-a-generation chance of real school education reform of what is a broken funding model.




Senator Mason:
  Hear, hear!




Senator WRIGHT:
  But before I address this in more detail I do want to speak briefly about the breathtaking hypocrisy of the coalition on this issue—you will be happy to hear about that, Senator Mason!




Senator Mason:
  You started so well!




Senator WRIGHT:
  Frankly, I find it puzzling as to why the coalition would be indulging in such faux outrage about the government missing opportunities for school reform when their own shadow education minister, Christopher Pyne, is continually saying that there is no need for school reform. It was just two weeks ago that Mr Pyne argued that Australia already has a world-class education system for all students regardless of location, income and school selection. So Mr Pyne must be either ignorant or in denial about the state of public education in Australia to be able to make such a demonstrably false claim with a straight face. Mr Pyne says that the current Australian schools funding system is not broken, but numerous studies, including many of those cited by the comprehensive Gonski review of funding for schools, which marshals national and international evidence, have shown wealth and background are the best indicators of educational achievement in Australia in 2013. So how can Mr Pyne possibly call that a satisfactory system?


The claim that there is no inequality in our schools in the face of all the evidence is extreme, dangerous and wrong. On one hand we have the coalition shadow minister saying there is no need for reform, which is simply false, and on the other Liberal Party senators today decrying a lack of action on school reform—a total inconsistency. The double standards here are staggering. Indeed, the coalition is so unconcerned about real school education reform that they have actually proposed to continue the current model, which is leaving so many students in disadvantage every year, for a further two years at least.


However, the Australian Greens are undoubtedly concerned and are clearly on the record about the sluggishness of the Gillard government in acting on the Gonski school funding recommendations. The Gonski review is a watershed document which represents the most comprehensive review of Australian schools in two generations, but we have been waiting for action on Gonski for over a year now, and the government is leaving its run perilously late. So far the Labor government has done little more than spruik a set of aspirations. They have been busy selling the need for school funding reform, but there has been little more than talk about how we are going to give every student the start in life that they need. Unfortunately, the inaction on the recommendations from this review is now seriously risking the chance of real reform in the life of this parliament. It is risking a once-in-a-generation opportunity to fix chronic underfunding of public schools.


The Gillard government's management of the Gonski review recommendations has been alarming. Yes, this is complex law reform. It does require a dexterity of handling and careful, respectful negotiations with state and territory governments because we need all levels of government to work cooperatively and collaboratively in the best interests of Australia's students to make sure that we end up with a world-class, equitable school funding system.


The negotiations have also required a serious commitment of serious money. Gonski, as we know, recommended $5 billion per year investment in school funding. In today's terms that is closer to $6.5 billion. It is a serious commitment, so we needed to see a Prime Minister who was embarking on a crusade for better education, determined to make the strong decisions necessary to fund this serious commitment. Instead, since February last year we have seen mismanagement that has alienated state governments and put at risk the biggest chance Australia has had in decades to fix a failed school funding scheme and to make an investment in our children, in our future. Rather than working together with the states, momentum for these crucial reforms has been lost as, one by one, state education ministers have come out after being continually kept in the dark on funding contributions. Many now are threatening to pull out, as we have heard in the past few weeks. There is no room for losing this opportunity. We must be acting cooperatively and responsibly in the greater national interest. There is nothing more important in a country than educating the citizens of the future. Our wellbeing, our social cohesion and our productivity rely on it.


The Gonski review clearly indicates the areas in which Australia's schooling regime is failing, pointing to declining levels of achievement internationally and the pronounced inequity which is a characteristic of our system in 2013. There is now a staggering gap of up to three years in performance between the most advantaged and disadvantaged children in Australia in year 9. This is not related to their inherent ability; it is related to the opportunities they have when they walk through the doors of the school they attend. We simply cannot ignore this. This is not something we can put off to a later date.


Other indications of disadvantage include a growing body of evidence that the composition of a school's population has a significant impact on the outcomes achieved by all students at the school so that concentrations of disadvantage accentuate underperformance, even for those children from a more advantaged background. There is evidence that schools with high concentrations of disadvantaged students tend to have fewer material and social resources, more behavioural problems, fewer experienced teachers, lower student and family aspirations, fewer positive relationships between teachers and students, less homework and a less rigorous curriculum. Has Mr Pyne been visiting these schools? Over 80 per cent of students who did not reach the level required for proficiency to participate in society in reading and mathematics are in government schools. In relation to reading literacy, the gap between students from the highest and lowest economic, social and cultural status quartiles was approximately three years of schooling. The average performance of Australian students from the lowest quartile is significantly lower than the OECD average.


Of the little detail we have heard from the Gillard government, any funding to fix our schools will be well short of the $6.5 billion cash injection the Gonski review showed we needed to start helping these children. The Gillard government's plan to back-end the lion's share of the funding until 2019 is just not good enough, particularly for those disadvantaged students. Whole cohorts will finish primary school or high school before this government will begin fixing the problems we know are there.


The Australian Greens are not just here to lament the government's handling of the matter so far, or even the parlous state of this debate today. We have a solution for how we can get on with Gonski without any delay, and we must not miss this opportunity. Real school funding reform would see a system where differences in educational outcomes are not the result of differences in wealth, income, power or possessions. Opposition leader Tony Abbott's and shadow spokesperson Chris Pyne's coalition do not believe these reforms are needed, despite all evidence to the contrary. The Labor government may believe in the need, but has so far failed to provide a detailed, funded plan for reform.


The Gonski review has shown that the current school funding model is broken and is failing our most disadvantaged students, but it has also shown us how to fix this. We need the money and the political will, and we need them right now. We need to move beyond political games at every level of government. We need to consider what is best for Australian children and for the future of our country in an increasingly globalised 21st century market. The Australian Greens have been saying consistently that standing up to big business, standing up to the mining companies and plugging the holes in the mining tax would raise significant amounts of money—billions over the forward estimates; enough to fully fund the Gonski reforms. So far the Australian Greens is the only party prepared to stand up the big mining companies to find the money we need to give our children a world-class education. We will all benefit from that; not just the haves but also the whole society. Failing our citizens of the future will impoverish us all.

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2013-03-12,"



Senator MARSHALL
 (Victoria) (16:04):  I rise to speak to this matter of public importance on education reform. I wish that Senator Wright would heed her own advice in this respect and move beyond playing political games, because that contribution by Senator Wright did exactly that: it attacked the government for what it wanted to do and it attacked everybody for wanting to do something and putting in place significant reforms. Somehow, it said that only the Greens political party would be able to do that, yet we have seen no evidence and no demonstration of any serious commitment. I commend Senator Wright personally—I know she is very committed at a personal level to public education in this country—but she ought to come into this place to have a serious debate about these matters and not play the political games which she accuses other people of playing.


Education is the key to innovation and enterprise. It is the foundation of our present prosperity and it is the foundation for our future prosperity as a nation. That is why this government is so committed to education. That is why this government initiated a serious reform and review of the funding process called the Gonski review. It is something this government initiated because we knew that the system in its present form is not delivering the funding to where the education needs of our Australian community are. It is the most comprehensive reform with the most comprehensive set of recommendations that has ever been undertaken in education in this country. It is a difficult process, one that has to be worked through. Senator Wright is not here to hear this, but it has to be worked through with state governments and other stakeholders. There is a lot at stake. The future of the education system in this country is at stake. Those negotiations are happening—they are continuing—and this government is committed to getting an outcome and bringing all participants and all stakeholders with them.


This financial year the Labor government will invest $13.6 billion in our schools. I know it was a little while ago, but compare this with the last year of the Howard government, in which $8.5 billion was spent. This is a significant investment by the Gillard government. It comes on top of record amounts invested in the first four years of the present government—over $65 billion in schools and around $22 billion for early childhood measures by the end of 2015-16.


It is why we are driving reform in respect of the national curriculum. It is why we are driving reform in terms of transparency. It is why we are driving reform to assist those who I think are very professional teachers to become even better equipped for the challenges of classroom teaching in this country. We have in this country a world-class education system but it can be better, and that is why this government has set a goal of being in the top five international education systems in the world. We are confident that we will achieve those goals, given the amount of spending, the amount of reforms, the amount of professional development and the amount of assistance we are going to give our educators in achieving those goals.


We have delivered the most significant education improvements in living memory. They are based on Labor's values of fairness, equality, accountability and transparency. Thanks to this government every Australian student will have access to a great education, no matter where they live or the school that they attend. This is something that has been lacking in this country for too long; we must move to the areas where the need is most. We need to ensure that the low-performing tail in this country—which is too large—is brought up, and close the gap between the lowest-performing students and the highest-performing students. Unfortunately, a lot of that is based on where you live—on your postcode. We want to ensure that every Australian child—regardless of their background, or how privileged their upbringing may have been or how educated their parents may be—has the ability to fulfil their education abilities.


One of the great hallmarks of this government—I think one of the great legacies that will be remembered for generations to come—is the Building the Education Revolution, particularly during the global financial crisis. When it came time for the Australian government to invest back into our economy to support jobs we chose, as one of our watershed expenditures, to support jobs and to support the economy—and only a Labor government would do this—building and rebuilding schools in this country. We invested more than $16 billion across nearly 10,000 primary schools, rebuilding classrooms, building school halls, upgrading facilities, building science labs, and libraries—facilities that had been neglected—and we did that in every primary school across the country and in many secondary schools too. The Catholic education system regularly said to me, when I was involved in the opening of those facilities, that this was a once-in-a generation opportunity for them. The plans that we were able to put in place to build those facilities were things that they would never have been able to do over the next 20 or so years. It will be a long, important and lasting legacy.


But, of course, our reforms have not been simply about building facilities. They have been about assisting teachers to deliver better programs and more targeted programs to get better educational outcomes for our kids. Our parents and school communities now have more information about schools than ever before through the MySchool website. Schools and students are benefitting from the $2.5 billion we are spending in the Smarter Schools National Partnerships, helping to improve literacy and numeracy, to boost teacher quality and to provide extra support to low-SES schools. We have invested an additional $243.9 million in improving literacy and numeracy in a new national partnership to build on the successes of the Improving Literacy and Numeracy National Partnership. We are investing $2.1 billion in the Digital Education Revolution, which has delivered more than 967,000 computers—one for every student in years 9 to 12—tools of the 21st century.


Australia now has the first ever national curriculum from foundation to year 12, starting with English, maths, history and science from foundation to year 10 and $2.5 billion is being invested by this government in trade training centres, giving high school students access to industry-standard training which is helping them to complete school and to get a job.


We have committed an extra $200 million to help students with disabilities to get the best education possible. One thing we do know for sure is that if people with disabilities get a good, adequate and proper education—and that is what they deserve—then their employment prospects and their future prosperity is underpinned by those things. We are investing in that, and we have been investing in it.


We are rolling out the first phase of the Empowering Local Schools initiative to 926 schools across the country, giving principals more local decision-making powers over things like staffing and budgets. We as a government—as a Labor government—are delivering an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Action Plan to states, territories and non-government schools. We have invested $128.6 million to help boost school attendance, literacy and numeracy skills, strengthen the education workforce and provide extra resources to schools that are in most need of help. These are the things that the Labor government is doing.


Indigenous students in the Northern Territory will benefit from the $583 million Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory national partnership, which will focus on attracting high-quality teachers to Northern Territory schools, introduce a new Improving School Enrolment and Attendance scheme and provide funding for a School Nutrition Program so that children are getting access to healthy meals.


We are spending more than $706 million over four years investing in the National Partnership on Youth Attainment and Transitions to help more young people stay in school and successfully transition to work or further education. We, as a Labor government, introduced the first ever national certification process for highly accomplished and lead teachers based on the first ever set of nationally agreed professional teaching standards. And while we are on teaching, let me just say that I think Australia has a fine professional and excellent teaching profession in this country. We want to help make that even better and improve the learning outcomes for all our children.

"Kroger, Sen Helen",LP,2013-03-12,"



Senator KROGER
 (Victoria—Chief Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:14):  May I firstly applaud the tone of Senator Marshall's address, given that Senator Wright before him commented and deliberated on the parlous state of the debate on this particular matter of public importance. I thought that was quite a striking observation to make during her own speech. But I will leave it for others to make their own judgement on that.


I would also like to share one thing with the comments that Senator Marshall just made and that is that, without question, education is the key to unlocking the potential of our young people for decades to come. There is no question about that. I think we would all support the fact that it is the key to unlocking the potential of our young. But what I do not support—and I have been listening for probably a good three or four minutes—and where I fundamentally disagree with Senator Marshall and the government is that you do not achieve that by throwing a bucket of money at it. You actually have to see an outcome for what you are doing and then ensure that that money is invested wisely so that it does genuinely unlock the potential of young Australians.


The current Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, was the Minister for Education under former Prime Minister Rudd. Since she became Prime Minister she has not been particularly consistent in public policy in too many areas. But the one area I will commend her on, the one area where she has been consistent, has been her rhetoric—screaming and shouting, if you like, from the rafters—about her commitment to education. It is all rhetoric; it is all spin. But she has certainly been consistent in the way she has continued to pursue this. In fact, when Julia Gillard became Prime Minister she referred to herself as, and assured the Australian public that she would be—and I quote—the 'Prime Minister of education'. Those were her words.


What extraordinary hubris, these meaningless words. But what is more tragic is the way in which she has continued to fail Australia's children and our leaders of the future. Since 2007 she has been decrying the neglect of the education sector and the lack of appropriate resourcing, and all we have seen is a continued denigration of students' standards across the board. Not surprisingly, for more than five years we have seen a demonstration that the Labor government, as I said earlier, has a total lack of understanding—that you do not throw a bucket of money at something to come up with the right solution. There has to be a clearly crafted framework to advance the education standards that we have here in Australia.


One of the initial claims of the Prime Minister when she was education minister was that every student would have a computer on their desk. Then she massaged that message and it was changed to 'Every child from year 9 onwards would have a computer on their desk.' In the last few months we have seen not only that that is not the case but also there is no more money to ensure that every child does have a laptop on their desk.


This is a consistency of approach that we are seeing time and time again not just in education but also in other areas. I think it is incredibly tragic for those in the education area. As Senator Marshall and Senator Mason before him pointed out, $16.6 billion was spent in building school hall monuments to Prime Minister Gillard. To my mind, there could not be a greater example of money wasted in terms of investing in the education sector and, essentially, the opportunity that has been lost by that money being directed in that way instead of being spent in far more effective ways.

Senator KROGER:
  It is a tragedy that not all Victorian senators are looking after their constituents. The Catholic education sector, in particular, has valid concerns about the funding they will receive under the government's model and the likelihood that funding cuts will force an increase in school fees, which parents simply cannot afford. Clearly I am one of the few Victorian senators who listen to principals in the state of Victoria. The principal of Aquinas College in Ringwood, Mr Tony O'Byrne, recently wrote to the parents of that school, and I will very briefly read out a chunk of what he has written. He wrote:


It is important that politicians from all political parties understand the requirement that Catholic education continue to be funded at least at its current level plus any indexation for rising costs. Parents will be well aware that currently Catholic schools operate on approximately 90 per cent of the financial resources that are available to government schools and it is clear in negotiations that the government is seeking to discount what might be available to Catholic schools.

Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (16:23):  I am pleased to speak on this motion which has no basis whatsoever in fact—another wonderful example from the Orwellian group of motion writing within the Liberal Party. I visit many schools throughout New South Wales—it is one of the great pleasures that you have as a senator—and I find that you can always tell a good school about 10 minutes after you walk into one. Some of our schools are struggling, particularly some of those public schools in rural and regional areas. That is reflected in the objective international comparison of performance of our students. The Programme for International Student Assessment is based on an annual testing which looks at the rankings of educational systems within the world. Australia has been declining relative to other countries in terms of our international rankings. That decline began under the Howard government, under the previous Liberal government. In 2003, Australia ranked fourth when it came to reading literacy and we ranked eighth when it came to mathematics. In 2006, in reading literacy we had dropped to seventh place, and we had dropped out of the top 10 when it came to mathematics. In 2009, the decline continued. We fell to ninth when it came to reading literacy and 15th when it came to mathematics.


We have a problem in our education system, and the problem is declining standards. Objectively, that is the issue we have to deal with as a nation. Why is it that we are declining? All of the studies show us that other nations are investing more in education, more per income in education. We need to heed those results, particularly what many of our Asian competitors are doing when it comes to funding education. There is a need for reform and Labor is delivering that reform. We have invested $243 million in improving national literacy and numeracy through partnerships with the state governments. We have introduced a national curriculum so that we have a set of standards across Australia to assess the performance of our students. We have invested $2.5 billion in Smarter Schools National Partnerships. We introduced the My School website to ensure that parents had objective information about schools in their local areas and, importantly, that the government had information regarding the performance of schools and which areas needed additional funding. We have introduced computers into schools—950,000 throughout Australia, and national partnerships for improving teacher quality.


But, most importantly, on the issue of funding and addressing this problem of declining standards, we consulted with the experts. We set up an enquiry chaired by Professor Gonski, to have a look at these issues. It included the likes of educational expert, Ken Boston, and Kathryn Greiner. They went around the country talking to principals, experts, academics, teachers and parents, working out the best way to improve results in educational standards in our country. They came up with a report. It is commonly referred to as the Gonski recommendations.


What are we to do as the government? Are we to ignore those recommendations; ignore all that work that has been undertaken by the experts and which international comparisons tell us is the basis of Australia's failing performance? We would be a government that is ignorant if we failed to heed those recommendations, but that is what the opposition expects us to do. The government is developing a new funding model so that no school will lose one cent of funding and we will see better results throughout the country. That includes base funding with loadings for disadvantage, for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students, for disability and for low socioeconomic areas. We are delivering this plan. We have a plan to improve results, to stop the rot that began under the Howard government.


But the opposition are doing what conservative governments do. They do not want the system to change. The opposition education spokesman, Mr Christopher Pyne, has said that the current system is adequate. They keep saying that we are throwing money at the problem. But their argument is deficient because, if money were not the issue, why do parents pay a lot, particularly those who send their kids to private selective schools? Why do they pay that extra money? They pay that extra money because they want their kids to get a better education, because they know if they make that investment with that extra money their kids will have a better opportunity at a better education. So their argument about throwing money at the issue is deficient. We have seen what Liberal governments do when it comes to education. They cut services and they cut funding. In New South Wales, in my state, they have cut $1.7 billion from the education budget, and the effects of that are beginning to be felt throughout schools in my state.


Senator Kroger mentioned the Building the Education Revolution. This is one of the programs that I am most proud of as a member of this government—$16 billion invested in new facilities throughout this country. I often tell the story of East Maitland Public School. I had the great fortune of opening their new BER facilities last year. This school received $2 million from the Gillard government to build two new special-needs classrooms. They have a wonderful principal at that school, Sheree O'Brien—



Opposition senators interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Fawcett
):  Senator Thistlethwaite, resume your seat. I remind senators on the left that senators have the right to be heard in silence.




Senator THISTLETHWAITE:
  Sheree O'Brien is passionate about special needs education. She fought with the education department to ensure that the BER funding that the school received went into building special needs classrooms for kids with profound Down syndrome and autism. I went to the school and opened these wonderful new facilities, and I met the teachers, the students and their parents. At the afternoon tea that occurred afterwards, one of the parents came up to me and said, 'I want you to go back to Canberra and thank Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd for what they have done for our local school.' I asked her, 'Why is that?' She said, 'I have a son with profound autism. We moved our family from Perth to get our son into East Maitland Public School.' They did that because they found out about how passionate Sheree O'Brien is about special needs education. She said, 'You have no idea what a difference it has made to my son's education and to his relationship with his family—in particular with his two younger siblings who are also students at the school.' That is real change for the better that probably will not show up in any of the educational statistics that you see when you compare international students.


What you have to understand about special needs education is that there is never just one teacher in the room. Teaching special needs kids requires additional resources. There will generally be two teachers, at the very least, and a teacher's aide working with them. When you talk about $1.7 billion worth of cuts to education from the New South Wales budget, guess what will be the first positions to go at East Maitland Public School? It will be the teacher's aides that assist with that special needs education. That is the difference between a Labor government and a Liberal government when it comes to education. The $2 million that went into building special needs classrooms at East Maitland Public School, which will give these kids a better chance at an education, is referred to by Senator Kroger and the opposition as waste. They have referred to the Building the Education Revolution program as waste for the last three or four years in this place. Ask the parents of those special needs kids at East Maitland Public School—and at every other school throughout this country that has benefited from the Building the Education Revolution funds—whether they think that the money that this government has invested in their kids' schools is waste. I think you will find that they have a different view to those opposite, and it perfectly highlights why those opposite are out of touch when it comes to education funding and education policy in this country. That is the difference between a Labor government and a Liberal government. In New South Wales we are now facing the prospect of some of these schools losing their special needs support staff and losing some of their programs because $1.7 billion is being cut from the education budget.


I reiterate the point that has been made: if money is not the issue, then why are schools in other countries that are spending more per capita on education than we are moving ahead of us each year? The answer is simple. It is because they invest more in their future and more in their education system. That is what this Labor government is seeking to rectify with the Gonski reforms, and that is why those opposite should support them.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2013-03-12,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (16:33):  It gives me great pleasure to contribute to the debate on the Gillard government's dismal record on education reform and the missed opportunities that this government has had—for the entire period of time that it has been in government—to actually attain real change in our Australian schools. It was interesting to hear Senator Thistlethwaite's contribution in which he brought up the Building the Education Revolution. When we look at my own state, Victoria, and the waste that that program delivered on the ground—and I see Senator Thistlethwaite shaking his head as he leaves the chamber—that waste was not evident where the school system was able to choose their own method of spending. For state schools, they had a prescribed list of educational resources they could access, and they had to go for it. 


When I think about missed opportunities and real education reform, I think about the first missed opportunity. As a former lecturer in education training, I know that our universities' capital infrastructure needs have been severely lacking. The former government recognised that and set up a fund to take us forward: the now-defunct Higher Education Endowment Fund. I think that the first missed opportunity of this government was to not spend it all on capital infrastructure for higher education. Similarly, in another missed opportunity, there was a federal Labor commitment of $16 million to stem the shortage of maths and science teachers by fast-tracking bankers, accountants and engineers into classrooms. By the way, those three particular cohorts of people—we have all got friends in those cohorts—are in classrooms now. Think about it. There is a reason that they did not choose education as their first choice of career. It has been an incredible, expensive failure with just 14 participants recruited. Those who are experienced in banking and who are highly successful engineers and accountants may be able to perform certain types of arithmetic, but I would doubt their capacity in terms of flux equations and partial differentiation.


Prime Minister Julia Gillard announced the Teach Next scheme during the 2010 election, promising that Labor would over four years recruit 450 mid-career professionals to teach. However, just 14 participants have been placed into schools, after two intakes, and every state and territory, except Victoria and the ACT, has either not participated in the scheme at all or has pulled out. The computers in schools program blew out by $1.4 billion. The school hall program, mentioned earlier, blew out by $14.7 billion to $16.2 billion. The blow-outs in these two programs alone are more than double Wayne Swan's projected 2012-13 now-dumped surplus—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Fawcett
):  Order! I remind you to address members in the other chamber by their correct titles.




Senator McKENZIE:
  Thank you—Minister Swan.




Senator Carol Brown:
  Mr Swan.




Senator McKENZIE:
  'Minister' will be fine. Taxpayers' money was spent on these programs instead of on real education reform, and that is because of waste. Just throwing a lot of money at a problem does not mean you are actually going to fix it, and when we look at educational outcomes in this country over the whole period of time that this government has been in power we can see that money definitely has not fixed the problem. The air bubbles, thought bubbles and media releases to tackle the perceived educational issues have not actually fixed them. If the government is serious about improved learning outcomes for students, the rhetoric has to end. We saw that in MYEFO the government actually cut money out of education. So there are missed opportunities throughout this federal government's tenure. With the Prime Minister being the former education minister and purporting to have such a strong and passionate commitment to education, I am befuddled as to how we can have so many botched schemes.


As a Nat, I am predominantly concerned with the close to a million students—young Australians—studying at private and public schools throughout our nation. Over 687,000 of our young Australians outside our capital cities are studying at public schools. So I am excited by the thought of a highly equitable and effective education system being delivered to our students attending public and private schools, and I note we have some fine young Australians up in the gallery watching this debate at the moment. I talk specifically about the Gonski legislation before us. The lack of detail in this bill is incredible. There are aspirations galore but not a shred of detail on how it is going to happen and what metrics are going to be used in certain sections of the legislation. The areas that we are targeting are areas of disadvantage, and the coalition is so supportive of ensuring that the taxpayers' dollar is well spent and spent in areas of need, on students that are experiencing disadvantage, but we do not know what the metrics are. But the AEU, in evidence before the Senate inquiry into the bill, were very confident that it is all going to be fine. But, from my perspective, this government has form in not getting it right in education and not getting it right for regional Australia. So, when I talk about the over 600,000 young Australians attending government schools outside capital cities, I want to ensure that the loading mechanism in the Gonski legislation actually delivers for them. Given this government's poor track record on the youth allowance debate and its inability to draw lines on a map that result in effective public policy, you can sense the concern of many stakeholders in this debate. Similarly, there is no idea about the other loadings. We have only just come with a definition of 'disability', and this is for a funding model that is going to fund our schools next year. It just does not wash, and it is so very typical of Labor. (Time expired)

"Thorp, Sen Lin",ALP,2013-03-12,"



Senator THORP
 (Tasmania) (16:40):  Nelson Mandela was spot on when he said, 'Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.' An effective education system has the capacity to mitigate disadvantage and elevate all young Australians to achieve their potential. Education is an issue about which I am passionate, as someone who has spent many years working as a teacher. I have long believed that our school funding needs to be directed towards public schools, especially towards schools in our most disadvantaged communities. Every single Australian kid has the potential to live a full, rich life and to be a contributor to our country's economic and social wealth. Every school needs to be a great school. Every school needs to have inspired and inspiring teachers who are passionate about their jobs and their students. That is why we cannot afford to have huge differentials in the funding and outcomes of our schools.


This government proved its commitment to a fair education system when it commissioned the Gonski review, the most comprehensive investigation into the way schools are funded in over 40 years. This financial year, the Labor government will invest $13.6 billion in our schools, compared to a shameful $8.5 billion spent by the Howard government in its last budget. This comes on top of record amounts invested in the first four years of the Gillard government: over $65 billion in schools and around $22 billion for early childhood measures by the end of 2015-16. We have delivered the most significant education improvements in living memory based on Labor's values of fairness, quality, accountability and transparency, and we also recognise that there is so much more to do. Thanks to Labor, every Australian student will have access to a great education no matter where they live or which school they attend.


We have built or upgraded school facilities throughout Australia, and I do take exception to some of the outrageous statements that have recently been made in this place about the spending of the BER funds. Coming from the state of Tasmania, I can absolutely guarantee to this place that those funds were spent where they were needed and spent very well. In fact, there was a commendation by the Auditor-General of the administrative group that oversaw the spending of the BER funds. The group saw the spending come in under target, and they were highly commended for doing so.


Students and schools are benefiting also from $2.5 billion in the Smarter Schools National Partnerships. We have invested an additional $243.9 million in a new Improving Literacy and Numeracy National Partnership to build on the success of the Literacy and Numeracy National Partnership, and $2.5 billion is being invested in trade training centres—and I hope those opposite do not think that the trade training centres have not been an extraordinary investment, giving high school students throughout the country, many of them in regional Tasmania, access to industry-standard training which helps them complete school and get a job. More than $706 million over four years is being invested in the National Partnership on Youth Attainment and Transitions to help more young people stay in school and successfully transition to work or to further education. And that is not all. This year the Labor government will finalise a National Plan for School Improvement to ensure that all students at all schools get a great education. We have also introduced the Australian Education Bill into parliament.


It seems a bit disingenuous to me for the opposition to suddenly turn around and pretend they actually care about the quality of our education system. It is clear that the opposition education spokesperson, Christopher Pyne, does not care, as he has not bothered to ask the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth a single question in parliament since 2010. Last year the shadow minister found time in question time to ask 38 questions. Not a single one was addressed to the education minister and only one had any relevance to education.


Last year Mr Pyne confirmed that the coalition would keep in place a broken funding model that could result in cuts of up to $5.4 billion from Australian schools. He also dismissed the findings of the Gonski review, which has been welcomed elsewhere across the country, not to mention plans to sack one in seven teachers, squeeze more kids into classrooms and slash funding to disadvantaged schools. The Liberal Party does not care about education. Labor works on the principles of fairness and equity, not privilege and elitism. The Liberal mantra requires a system that produces workers to produce wealth for a few; Labor sees every Australian as a valuable contributor to wealth for all.

That the Senate take note of Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Local Government report.


It was a privilege to sit on the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Local Government. With the report being tabled today, I would like to re-emphasise the Green's support for constitutional recognition of local government. It is incredibly important, and we are inching closer to that point.


Now that the parliamentary inquiry has recommended a referendum to recognise local government in the Constitution at the coming September election, I do hope that the Labor government will move quickly to pass the required legislation between March and July to facilitate this referendum. That is the next step, and that step needs to be taken. We need that time to build a strong community campaign and cross-party support. The importance of informing the community and building that support came up constantly at hearings for this committee. Dragging the chain would rob the campaign of time to educate the public about the importance of constitutional reform. As we know, this financial recognition is vital to formalise and secure financial certainty for local communities. This issue came up time and time again when we were having the hearings, particularly in respect of the relationship with the High Court cases. The past two High Court cases have created uncertainty, as we know, around the ability of the Commonwealth to directly fund local councils.


The expert panel expressed doubt about the constitutional validity of direct grant programs that do not fall under a head of Commonwealth legislative power. This poses an imminent challenge to the continuation of directly funded programs in many important areas across the board of all the great work that local councils do, including aged care, child care, climate change and infrastructure. One of the witnesses spoke about some great work around light rail that is being undertaken in Queensland, and they were very concerned about such programs being under threat.


Many local councils face expanding roles and responsibilities and have expressed their concern about the increasing uncertainty surrounding council decisions. Councils are the level of government closest to the community—we say that because it is a reality, and those councils need to be given support so that they can carry out their work effectively—and without direct federal funding, residents face reduced services or higher rates. That was a slogan that so many of the councillors and people who are working for councils took to the hearings of the committee that I had the opportunity to sit on as a member.


Both the expert panel and the joint committee have recommended holding a referendum at the September election to amend section 96 of the Constitution. Again, we are on track here. We now need the Labor government to come on board and get the required legislation into this place. I do urge that the government move quickly. There is just one recommendation, and so it is very clear what needs to be done here. We all know how difficult referendums are to pass in this country so that is an added reason why we need to get going.


On behalf the Greens, I particularly want to congratulate the Australian Local Government Association for their readiness to spearhead the public referendum campaign. The Greens are strongly supporting that campaign and we urge all political parties, state governments, territory governments and local governments across the nation to get behind the referendum. The time has come to get the recognition in place. We just have to get some of the mechanics set out so that can be achieved.

"Boswell, Sen Ronald",Nats,2013-03-12,"



Senator BOSWELL
 (Queensland) (16:55):  I was saying just before lunch that the Labor government is destroying the fishing industry and I was explaining how. First, work in a policy vacuum. Then let a department that is wholly and utterly unsympathetic to the industry effectively take over control—that is, the environment department. Then, when we are trading in a global market and the price of our product is critical to sales success overseas, add unnecessary cost burdens at every stage of production, like the carbon tax and renewable energy target. This also makes our own seafood less price competitive against cheap imports on our own domestic market. At the same time, put no facility in place for the industry to easily gather funds from innovation, thus making it even more difficult to run marketing campaigns. Then reduce the area open for fishing by declaring 2.3 million square kilometres of our oceans as marine parks and ban commercial and recreational fishing in these vast areas, reducing the catch even further. At the same time, refuse to compensate many of the businesses directly affected and destroy much onshore infrastructure needed to support the catching sector. After that, override the recommendations of experienced fisheries managers and fisheries scientists for the sake of short-term political expediency, raising doubts in the minds of the community about the management of our commercial fisheries. Finally, to ensure that no-one can make any future investment plans with any confidence whatsoever, launch a root-and-branch examination of fisheries management.


Overall, demonstrate that you do not value the industry as a vital producer of healthy, high-quality food and as a provider of crucial jobs in often remote areas where there is little alternative employment, and demonstrate that you care more about the accolades of overseas, city based environmental activists and the continuing political support of Labor's coalition partners in government, the Greens. That is how to destroy an industry. That is how Labor is destroying the commercial and recreational fishing industry.


The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Joe Ludwig—he is a fine fellow; I get on well with him—is fisheries minister in name only. Everyone in government, everyone in fisheries science and management and everyone in the fishing industry knows that the portfolio is in fact run by the environment department and its minister, the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Tony Burke. Senator Ludwig's views, advice and recommendations have been ignored or overturned on one major fisheries issue after another. When it comes to real decisions on the big issues affecting the seafood industry, the environment minister has the call. A fishing portfolio run by an environment minister results in a fishing industry offered up as a sacrifice to environmental activists. This makes it impossible for the fishing industry business to predict what access to fisheries resources will be available to them in future and makes forward planning and sensible development of the industry impossible. 


The Australian dollar is close to record highs against the US dollar and other international currencies. This makes our exports dearer in overseas markets and makes our imports cheaper in our domestic market. So it is harder than ever before for our fishermen and seafood marketers to make a profit or even sell their product in the first place. It makes our fishing charters relatively more expensive compared with charters in overseas locations.


Despite the fact that the industry is already doing it tough, this government has added more and more costs that fishermen, processors and marketers have tried to absorb. The carbon tax—the renewable energy charge—is a classic example. Of course, the Labor government is not really managing fisheries—not coherently, rationally or predictably. It is moving from one ill-considered, illogical short-term decision to the next, going wherever it is led by the environmental activists.


Take the case of the Abel Tasman, where the government took its lead from Greenpeace. This is the so-called supertrawler. The government invited the trawler to Australia, and its Australian-based operators went through the proper process. And yet the government went to water when the vessel actually arrived. Environmental minister Tony Burke banned it from fishing for the last two years. He did this against the sound advice of the fisheries scientists and fisheries management. His action trashed the reputation of Australian fisheries science and raised unnecessary doubts in the mind of the Australian public about the state of the fish stocks and their management.


Banning the Abel Tasman you can chalk up to Greenpeace. However, their fellow environmental multinational, the Pew foundation, the World Wildlife Fund and others had a far bigger win. This was on 16 November, when the environmental minister, Tony Burke, declared 2.3 million square kilometres of new marine reserves that will lock commercial and recreational fishers out of vast swathes of our ocean. I expect this week that Minister Burke will table in the other place the management plan for these marine reserves. These plans will have enormous impact on the commercial and recreational fishing industries, and on small business and individual rights right around the Australian coast. They should be rejected by parliament. Minister Burke should be made to go away and try again and then bring back proper management plans for the marine zones.


The current plans have not taken proper notice of good science, just what Labor regards as good politics. There has not been proper consultation with recreational or commercial fishermen, just backroom deals with local and international environmental activists. There has not been any proper consideration of the terrible impact the plans will have on the lives and businesses of people in the coastal centres right around Australia. It is just simply to boost Labor's image in the inner-city seats in the federal election.


What Minister Burke has put in these management plans is bad policy development, for the wrong reasons. They are not about protecting the marine environment; they are about protecting Labor votes and preferences. They are shoddy—absolutely shoddy. Quite apart from the terrible impact these marine reserves will have on regional economies, there is the question of how these vast areas of soon-to-be-empty oceans will be policed.


What Minister Burke described as the 'jewel in the crown' of the marine reserve network is almost one million square kilometres of the Coral Sea. Much of this vast area will be completely closed to all fishing. Effectively, what this means is that the commercial fishermen and charter boat fishermen, who are the eyes and ears of enforcement there, will be banned. These are the very people who are in a position to spot any illegal fishing vessel operating in the waters hundreds of kilometres from the Australian mainland, and they will not be allowed in there.


How does this Labor government intend to police this area of almost one million square kilometres? No-one is prepared to say. I heard someone say that scuba divers will keep their eyes open on their way to their dive trips. Maybe we can ask the French to send some patrol boat from New Caledonia. This is a very serious question. The government is bringing in this Maritime Powers (Consequential Amendments) Bill, but how will it enforce these marine powers? How will it enforce the protection of our fisheries in the huge new marine reserves and the huge new zones where Australian commercial and recreational fishermen will no longer be allowed to fish?


It is really just creating protected fishing zones for illegal foreign fishing vessels—places where foreign fishing operators will no longer have to worry about being spotted by Australian commercial and recreational fishermen. Australia has the largest area of marine parks of any country in the world—more than three million square kilometres. Sadly, that is not a proud boast; it simply means that we have locked away more of our seafood, more of our exports and more of our recreational fishing areas than any other country in the world.


It is no wonder that we now have to import more than 70 per cent of the seafood we eat in this country every year and that international anglers are choosing alternative fishing destinations—when they look at the map all they see is green—before they make a decision to come to Australia or not to come to Australia. How ironic that a major report released by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Joe Ludwig, in December demonstrates that Australian key wildlife fish species are well managed. Over 80 of the country's leading fisheries researchers collaborated to produce a report on 49 species contributing over 80 per cent of the value and 70 per cent of the volume of Australian wildcatch fisheries. They found that fisheries are operating sustainably and our seafood stocks are in good shape—they are in great shape.


This government has demonstrated more than once it cares nothing for the opinions of the commercial and recreational fishing industries and all the families involved in fishing for sport or business. What matters is that it maintains the support of the Greens and the international environmentalists. As far as consultation with the industry is concerned on things like new marine reserves, the government is just ticking the boxes. It does nothing more than the minimum it is required to do. For example, the government released its draft management plans for new marine reserves with just the minimum 30 days of consultation in the middle of the Christmas school holidays. Of course, many of the people most interested in commenting on these very complex plans for the future of fishing in vast areas of ocean around Australia's coastline were on holidays—they had literally gone fishing. Both recreational and commercial fishing representatives requested the government extend the period for consultation from 30 days to 90 days. This very reasonable request by these representatives and others was totally disregarded. Now Minister Burke is rushing these plans through parliament just as quickly as he can.


In relation to the fishing bans to be imposed by the new marine reserves, the government has said professional fishers directly impacted will be able to apply for some compensation. However, charter boat operators will miss out entirely and so will related businesses such as tackle shops, seafood processors, seafood wholesalers, ship chandlers, providores, repair facilities and other suppliers of goods and services. At the same time, just to further muddy the waters and make sure the seafood industry cannot plan ahead with any uncertainty as to what the rules will be, fisheries minister, Senator Ludwig, announced a major review of Australian fishing policy and legislation, so the industry will have to continue treading water while the review is completed, his recommendations considered and then any changes to the legislation are framed, tabled and debated—more uncertainty for the seafood industry.


Senator Ludwig announced the terms of reference for the review on 13 September last year and said the review would be conducted within three months, yet six months later we have still not seen the review. Industry has to wait. Not once has this government stood up for the Australian primary producers and defended them against the outrageous claims and demands of the environmental multinationals. It is a valid question to ask whether this Labor government really has the will to protect Australian fisheries and the Australian fishing industry from a range of threats. We know the government has already caved in to pressure from the international environmentalists and their local franchises and is banning fishing from vast areas of Australian waters. Does the government have the will to genuinely protect our fish stocks from illegal fishing vessels? I do not believe so. Many senators will remember under the Howard government in 2003 the pursuit of the Uruguayan flagged vessel Viarsa by the Australian Customs and Fisheries patrol vessel Southern Supporter. The Viarsa was spotted in the Australian waters near Heard Island, suspected of illegally catching toothfish. The vessel fled when the Southern Supporter approached and so began a 7,000-kilometre, 21-day pursuit through stormy seas and icebergs in the Southern Ocean, until Viarsa was finally stopped in South Africa and escorted back to Australia. There it was forfeited and scrapped. 


Of course, that was under a coalition government. Now we know that Australia has not conducted a single patrol in the Southern Ocean for over a year. The difference is simple: the Labor government is providing for the protection of our Australian Fishing Zone on paper. In government, the coalition will enforce fishing laws where it really matters—out on the water. When Tony Burke announced the proclamation of Labor's 2.3 million square kilometres of marine reserves he declared that Australia's precious marine environment has been permanently protected. He should have added it had been protected on paper. It has certainly not been protected out on the water.


All Labor has done is ban commercial and recreational fishing and left our offshore waters more vulnerable than ever to illegal foreign fishing vessels. The government does not have a policy for the fishing industry and it does not have a policy for protection of our fish from illegal foreign boats. Worse still, it does not have the will to protect our fishing zones. The only way to see a policy developed for our valuable seafood industry and to genuinely protect our Australian fishing zone from illegal foreign operators is to change the mindset of the government—and the only way to do this is to change the government itself. Fishermen will get their chance to help do that later this year, and I know they will respond accordingly.

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2013-03-12,"



Senator HUMPHRIES
 (Australian Capital Territory) (17:10):  It is my pleasure to rise to speak on the Maritime Powers Bill 2012 and to indicate that I see in this legislation the reinforcement of a pattern of behaviour on the part of the Labor government, a government which, all too often, has set out with a grand vision of reforming a particular area of the law and an intention to make clear what was characterised by a series of disparate and sometimes disjunctive pieces of legislation and bring it all forward. That is the intention. To cite some recent examples, it was the intention of the privacy legislation amendments, it was the intention of the human rights legislation that was discussed recently and it was the intention of the Maritime Powers Bill in each case to bring together, codify and make clear the position with respect to that particular area of law in a comprehensive way.


But I regret to say that, like the privacy bill and like the human rights bill, the Maritime Powers Bill is grand in conception but in some respects fails to deliver what it promises—although I would not go so far as to describe the Maritime Powers Bill as being as grand a fiasco as those other two pieces of legislation. If I might cut in there, those of us who were involved in the inquiry conducted by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee into that piece of legislation know that almost every witness who came before the committee from every sector criticised the legislation as being unclear, as muddying the waters, as creating confusion and as leaving so many questions unresolved that it caused considerable concern in the broader community, who rely on that legislation.


In this case the level of confusion is not as severe or as widespread, but it is deficient in one very key respect, and I think it is impossible for this chamber to walk past this issue without it being comprehensively settled and resolved. The question is, very simply, whether this legislation preserves the ability of the Commonwealth, through those who operate our naval vessels and other vessels on the sea, to exercise a power to turn back vessels that are in or approaching Australian territorial waters. That is the critical question. It is a matter on which there has been considerable public policy debate in recent years. It is a matter where, in the past at least, public policy has been applied to exercise such a power to ensure that boats have been turned around and sent away. This is not a moot question; it is a question of what powers the Commonwealth actually might exercise in a maritime setting. It is reprehensible that the Commonwealth government has brought to the Senate for passage a piece of legislation, in the form of the Maritime Powers Bill, without a clear answer to the question: does the bill preserve the power of the Commonwealth, the prerogative power of the Crown, to turn boats around?


I say that that is a question which is not answered because, when the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee considered the legislation, it was unable to obtain a clear answer from officers of the Attorney-General's Department as to whether that power was preserved. To, I think not unfairly, paraphrase those who gave evidence before the committee, there was a suggestion that perhaps the prerogative power was still preserved in the legislation.


I asked specifically where I could find it referred to in the legislation and I was told that it was not necessarily contained in the words of the legislation, that in fact the power as a prerogative power of the Crown is a power which inherently lies with a nation state to be able to exercise with respect to the regulation of its borders. I thought that was a good answer, but not a complete answer. What the Maritime Powers Bill and its sister legislation, the Maritime Powers (Consequential Amendments) Bill, purport to do is to codify the powers of the Commonwealth that it might exercise in a maritime setting; to describe comprehensively what a person exercising such powers may or may not do—what the captain of a naval vessel or a Customs vessel, or some such person, might do—in the setting where they were confronted with a vessel attempting unlawfully to enter Australian waters. They might wish not to allow that to occur, and might wish to know whether the powers were there for them to turn that boat back. They might understandably make reference to, either personally or through some commanding authority back on the mainland, the place where such powers are enumerated and codified—namely, the Maritime Powers Act, as it would then be.


If they looked in that place—if this legislation were to pass in the form that is before the Senate today—they would not find such a power. There is not in the legislation anywhere a clear description of the power of the Commonwealth or its servants and agents to be able to turn back boats, in the circumstances where indeed Australian maritime powers have in the past turned back boats—in circumstances that were considered appropriate—in ensuring that unauthorised arrivals did not reach Australia's shores.


The answers to those questions to officers of the department were, with great respect to them, unclear and unconvincing. But I would be very assured if the minister at the table were able to assure the Senate categorically that this legislation does preserve the power of the Commonwealth to turn back boats in circumstances where that course of action is warranted. If that assurance can be given to us, I think it would go a long way towards mollifying the concerns we have had about this legislation.


As a belts-and-braces matter, however, I think we would proceed with the amendment which is before the Senate at the moment. Senator Brandis is moving it to make it clear that that power does rest with this legislation, which of course is meant to be a comprehensive enumeration of the powers of the Commonwealth in a maritime setting.


Why do we talk about this? Why is this a consideration, given that it has not been a power that has been exercised, apparently, for some time? The answer of course is that it must be available as a possible response if the circumstances warrant that being the case. No-one is suggesting that it would be an everyday occurrence for Australian naval vessels to turn boats around on the high seas. It would not be an everyday occurrence. We would hope it would not be an everyday occurrence, and it was not an everyday occurrence during the years of the previous government when this power was indeed exercised. Obviously, it is a power which is to be exercised only in very special circumstances. But it is important to have such a power available in the armoury of responses by Australia as a nation state to the circumstances where people choose to make journeys to this country and seek to enter its territorial waters, and for which there is no lawful reason for that to occur. 


The suggestion that officers of the Royal Australian Navy have said that the exercise of such power either is inappropriate or not legally possible is a suggestion which has no foundation. I have sat in meetings of the estimates committee—as I know Senator Feeney, the parliamentary secretary at the table, has—and I have heard officers at the table answer questions about the circumstances in which such powers might be exercised. It is true that they have said that it is very dangerous to exercise those powers, that there are risks associated with the exercise of those powers and that there are all sorts of reasons why it needs to be done with great care, but I have heard nobody in that setting say either that the power does not and should not exist or that it could never be exercised. The fact that such a power until now has existed, does exist and might be exercised in circumstances where it is in Australia's interest to do so in my view means that we should be careful today to make sure that this legislation does not pass through the Senate without that power being preserved.


If it is the government's view that the power should be preserved, it may not wish to exercise the power. I gather that, although the previous Prime Minister thought that it should, the present Prime Minister does not—fair enough. Whatever the views of the government of the day, it would be unfortunate if the power were to be wiped from the statute books or from the common law by virtue of the passing of a piece of legislation which had the effect of repealing the power or removing the power from Australian authorities. Obviously, if the Australian people see fit at an election later this year to have a new government—




Senator Feeney:
  It is unthinkable!




Senator HUMPHRIES:
  A fanciful suggestion, I am sure you would think, Senator Feeney! If they happen to do that, I imagine that a new government would be very much of a mind to make sure that a strong signal was sent to people smugglers that Australia's borders were no longer open borders and that Australia would take every measure it possibly could to ensure that their business of smuggling people was smashed. If the threat, or perhaps the actual use, of a power to turn boats around in circumstances where it was safe to do so added to that policy and made that policy real and effective then it would be employed by an incoming government.


It goes without saying that the policy this government has pursued generally on the protection of the borders and on ensuring that people, wherever possible, seek asylum in this country through lawful means has been a spectacular and unmitigated failure. I think that barely needs to be stated. The government has had, on my reckoning, five different positions on how to deal with the flow of boats across the Timor Sea, and no doubt before the election there is time for a sixth version if it decides that the policy is just too malodorous for the Australian people to be able to support.


So we will see what comes out of the coming election campaign, but what I do know is that the Australian people want a policy which is effective. They want our immigration policy to be strong and resilient and to have support across the entire community. They want the policy on the treatment and handling of refugees to be one which maximises Australia's generosity towards those who are deemed to be genuine refugees and ensures that, wherever possible, a person applies to Australia for asylum in a way which ensures that their processing is done in an orderly fashion and, if possible, offshore through application in such places as refugee camps under the auspices of bodies like the United Nations High Commission for Refugees or the International Organization for Migration so that once again Australians can have confidence that we are, as one of the most generous nations in housing and offering refuge to refugees, able to process such applications in a fair, merit based arrangement where the cost to the Australian taxpayer is not prohibitive. None of those things can be said at this point in time.


We make it very clear that, if we are the government that is elected later this year, we will radically alter the policies which have been by applied so ineffectively by this government. We will ensure that we have a policy which strongly discourages people from using unseaworthy boats to enter Australia's waters in order to obtain status as an asylum seeker, processed by Australian authorities. We will do our best to make sure that this vile business is brought to an unceremonious end. Of course we can only do that if we have the full suite of powers available to us that were available to the Howard government. It is very clear that the judicious use of that policy was an effective tool in the hands of the previous government to ensure that boats did not arrive in anything like the numbers that have arrived since 2008.


For those who have a vision in their mind of the circumstances of a boat being turned back that might conjure images of chaos on the sea or of something being done which is extremely unsafe, which is unsatisfactory from a humanitarian point of view, I want to make the point to senators that Australia has exercised this power in the past in a way which did not produce those sorts of outcomes and which were an aid to effective public policy in preventing and discouraging people from using that device to enter this country. If we take the example of an Indonesian fishing boat captained by an Indonesian captain with an Indonesian crew having departed from an Indonesian port perhaps a couple of hundred kilometres off the coast of Indonesia, which an Australian naval vessel decides to turn around, one could hardly say that was a particularly onerous or unfair arrangement to enter into if that resulted in that presumably unseaworthy vessel being forced to return to an Indonesian port.



Senator Feeney interjecting—




Senator HUMPHRIES:
  That may be the case, Senator Feeney, or it may not. But until we apply the policy we will not know. Let us see what happens. It was not the case in the past. We know how to do this. We have done it before. If you are not confident in exercising a power in those circumstances, let somebody who has done it before exercise such a power. I predict that it will not take long for these businesses—that is what they are—designed to exploit the misery of human beings who are seeking refuge to very quickly get a message about what it is that Australia is prepared to do to protect the integrity of its borders and to ensure that an orderly process for processing refugees is applied once again, one that creates a system which Australians and others around the world can respect for the way in which it is operated.


I urge the Senate to consider very carefully the powers that are in this legislation but even more carefully consider what is not necessarily in the legislation. I look forward to the minister clarifying what the status of that power is. As I said, I would be greatly mollified by an assurance that the power is absolutely preserved. Perhaps it does require the authority of a minister to make the statement that we are seeking.




Senator Feeney:
  You are stuck with me.




Senator HUMPHRIES:
  You are close enough, Senator Feeney. It was not an assurance we got from officers of the department. But we would be greatly reassured if the minister at the table were to make that assurance in the course of this debate.

Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (17:29):  I thank honourable members for their contribution to this debate. I will do my very best to mollify your points, Senator Humphries. I am sure by the end of my eloquent address, you and I will be seeing eye to eye on these questions and voting side by side. Before I make such bold predictions, let me roll on.


This government is committed to supporting the hard-working Australians who work on our behalf to uphold Australia's maritime laws. These men and women are required to operate in a difficult, dangerous and quickly changing maritime environment, an environment which regularly presents risks often unknown. This environment poses particular challenges to the effective enforcement of laws. Enforcement operations in maritime areas frequently occur in remote locations, isolated from the support normally available to land-based operations and constrained by the practicalities of sea-based work.


Under the current maritime enforcement regime, operational agencies use powers contained in at least 35 separate Commonwealth acts. This structure is inefficient and can lead to operational difficulties for the primary on-water enforcement agencies. The government has developed the Maritime Powers Bill 2012 and the Maritime Powers (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2012 to address these challenges. They provide a smarter and simpler approach to maritime enforcement by streamlining the operational framework for our on-water enforcement agencies.


The Maritime Powers Bill establishes a system of authorisations under which a maritime officer may exercise enforcement powers in the maritime domain. The powers contained in these bills are modelled on and preserve the suite of powers currently available to agencies to conduct maritime enforcement operations—a key point to which I shall return. In particular, the bills consolidate all maritime powers in the customs, fisheries and migration regimes, constituting a large majority of Australia's maritime enforcement operations. The bills will, therefore, effect a substantial consolidation of Australia's maritime enforcement regime in relation to areas of highest priority.


The bills also include a range of safeguards to make sure maritime enforcement powers are authorised and exercised appropriately and for a proper purpose. A key safeguard is the requirement for the exercise of powers to be authorised on specific grounds by a senior maritime officer or member of the Australian Federal Police. This provides clarity around who must make decisions to take enforcement action and ensures appropriate oversight in relation to the exercise of powers. The Maritime Powers (Consequential Amendments) Bill repeals maritime enforcement powers in a number of other acts where they overlap with powers in the Maritime Powers Bill.


I will turn for a moment to some of the specific comments made by Senator Humphries regarding the opposition's concern about this legislation and in particular speak to their amendments. Senator Humphries sought what might be called an undertaking about the impact of these bills and how they will change or bend the regime as it exists. He used the phrase 'have previous powers wiped from the statute books'. Let me see if I can give him some comfort in this important respect. These bills do not change the powers of maritime authorities, so to the extent that it was possible previously to turn back boats it remains possible. Let me provide a little more meat on that proposition.


The Maritime Powers Bill will not affect the legality of tow-backs or turnarounds. Currently, to the extent that the power resides in legislation, it is in section 245F of the Migration Act. To the extent that it will reside in the proposed legislation, it sits primarily in clauses 69 and 72, together with clauses 21, 32 and 41 concerning jurisdiction and clauses 52 and 54(1) concerning the exercise of power. To the extent that the power exercised is the prerogative power of a government to control its borders, that prerogative power is preserved by clause 5 of this bill. The government has no plans to reinstitute tow-backs or turnarounds at this time, as you are well familiar with, but this legislation does not change the powers available to a government and, so to the extent that it was previously possible, it remains possible.


We would make the point—and I am sure Senator Humphries would be disappointed if we did not make the point—that this debate and the amendments in this debate are in our view something of a furphy. You are, in our judgement, making amendments that have no practical effect. You are not strengthening the prerogatives or powers of a government in the way that you say you want to, because you are simply adding words that do nothing to add power. 


But you are doing this: you are making the political point and highlighting the political point that you want to turn back the boats. I suppose on that partisan point we say that the expert panel that dealt with some of these issues found that the conditions necessary for the safe and lawful enforcement of tow-backs did not presently exist. Senator Humphries, the government's position is that turn-backs and turnarounds are obviously not going to become a tool deployed by this government. We say—and perhaps I will go further into this in committee, if it is desired—that the expert panel report raised a number of questions, including treaty obligations for Australia about why that particular methodology of turning back boats is inappropriate, that it breaches safety of life at sea conventions and the like. But the critical point for you, I say, is this: your policy, notwithstanding the fact that we say it is crazed, is not defeated or undermined by this legislation. This legislation does not constrain this government or any future government from undertaking the sorts of powers that you describe the Howard government exerting.


While we do not agree about the substantive policy point and while I think the government is making its point that this amendment is about political posturing not about strengthening the legislation—




Senator Brandis:
  No, it's about reforming the law actually.




Senator FEENEY:
  I am sure we will debate this in committee, Senator Brandis. To the extent that towing back the boats was possible under previous legislation, it remains possible under this.


The unique aspects of the maritime domain pose particular challenges to the effective enforcement of laws. This warrants a tailored approach to maritime powers. The Maritime Powers Bill ensures flexibility in the exercise of these powers, allowing maritime officers to deal with quickly changing circumstances in often difficult and dangerous situations. These bills will streamline and modernise Australia's legal framework for maritime enforcement. They are another aspect of the government's work to provide Australia with a modern legal framework. I commend the bills to the Senate.

Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (17:39):  Thank you for the question. The government asserts that this bill has been drafted to ensure that it allows Australia to fulfil entirely its obligations under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and to exercise its rights at international law. The geographical limitations in division 5 of part 2 ensure that the exercise of enforcement powers in Australia's maritime zones in other countries and between countries is consistent with international law. In particular, the bill reflects the provisions of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea that outline the jurisdictional rights of coastal states to take enforcement action on the seas. For example, UNCLOS, the UN convention, gives states the right to identify vessels without nationality on the high seas, and this is provided for in the bill. Maritime officers will also be able to exercise maritime powers available under international decisions, such as UN Security Council resolutions and international agreements between Australia and other countries. I would particularly refer the senator to clauses 12, 19 and 33.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (17:42):  by leave—I move amendments (1) to (4) on sheet 7348:


(1) Clause 41, page 30 (line 5), omit ""Australia"", substitute ""Australia (which may include repelling vessels from the contiguous zone, or prohibiting vessels from entering or further entering the contiguous zone, or towing vessels to another place whether inside or outside the contiguous zone)"".


(2) Clause 41, page 30 (line 24), omit ""chased without interruption"", substitute ""towed or chased without interruption"".


(3) Clause 54, page 38 (line 8), omit ""Note:"", substitute ""Note 1:"".


(4) Clause 54, page 38 (after line 9), at the end of subsection (1) (after the note), add:


Note 2: A specified course or speed may include a direction to adopt or maintain a course that will take the vessel to a place outside Australia.


The parliamentary secretary, Senator Feeney, has already in a sense anticipated the debate on these amendments. Contrary to what Senator Feeney has said, the opposition is not satisfied that the powers gathered together and consolidated in this bill do make it sufficiently clear that the powers of masters of Australian vessels or those in control of Australian vessels, including naval vessels, do include the power to turn around and tow back other vessels, foreign vessels. For that reason, the effect of these amendments is to insert a provision into the act, in particular by amendment to proposed section 41 of the act, that makes it clear beyond doubt. The relevant words in the principal amendment which we move, amendment (1), are to make it clear that the powers to enforce laws of Australia in relation to foreign vessels include the power of repelling vessels from the contiguous zone, or prohibiting vessels from entering or further entering the contiguous zone, or towing vessels to another place whether inside or outside the contiguous zone.


It is essential, in the opposition's view, that the existence of this power be clarified in this bill. This is the bill that consolidates in a rational scheme which the opposition otherwise supports all of the maritime powers that have hitherto variously been located in a variety of different acts of parliament. What an appalling oversight it would be if, in effectively codifying those powers in a single act of parliament, that act of parliament omitted the biggest issue that is on the minds of the Australian public at the moment when it comes to the exercise of maritime powers, and that is the exercise of a maritime power to repel from unlawful entry into Australian waters foreign vessels and, in particular, vessels containing unlawful entrants or unlawful attempted entrants.


The parliamentary secretary said in his remarks—reading from a script no doubt written for him by officials—'To the extent that Australian law contains such powers, they are preserved by the bill.' The introductory or qualifying words of his contribution 'to the extent that' in a sense make the opposition's point, because it is by no means clear from this bill that that power exists as clearly as it should. We the opposition make no apologies for saying that the power to repel or turn around foreign vessels should exist and that the existence of that power should be made explicit in this codification of Australian maritime powers. It is as simple as that.


Might I remind honourable senators and those who may be listening to the broadcast this evening that, when Mr Kevin Rudd—remember Mr Kevin Rudd; of course, you do, Madam Temporary Chairman Stephens, because you are one of his supporters, and are you one of his supporters, Senator Feeney; I can never keep track of the Labor Party; they are like a merry-go-round—was elected as the democratically elected Prime Minister of Australia in 2007, during that election he said, emphatically, 'We will turn the boats around.' It was very controversial within the Labor Party but, nevertheless, Mr Kevin Rudd was elected on that promise in November 2007: we will turn the boats around. I have to concede that when Mr Kevin Rudd said that, Mr Howard, the then Prime Minister, could hardly say that Mr Rudd was not taking the issue seriously. But, unfortunately, within a year of the election of the Rudd government, by legislation introduced into this chamber, in August 2008, by the then Leader of the Government in the Senate and the then minister for immigration, Senator Chris Evans, the Howard government's tough border protection policies were repealed. And the rest, as they say, is history. 


We went from a situation in which Australia's borders had been protected and our maritime borders had been made secure, since the Howard government's reforms of 2001, to a situation in which a green light was given to the people smugglers. I think people know that, the people of Western Sydney know that, the people of Western Australia know that and people in every region of Australia know that. I see my distinguished colleague Senator Michaelia Cash, a very distinguished Western Australian senator, nodding in agreement. She will no doubt speak in this debate from a Western Australian perspective. 


But let me remind you of the facts. There was a problem of the borders getting out of control at the end of the 1990s. There is no doubt about that. In 1999, 86 unlawful asylum seeker boats made it to our shores and, in 2000, it was not a lot better—there were 51. Then in 2001 the government of Mr John Howard introduced tough policies. He introduced, in particular, temporary protection visas and a suite of policies which were designed to send a message loud and clear to the people smugglers: we are going to destroy your evil trade and we are going to put you out of business.


Do you know what happened? The policy worked because, in the year after it was introduced, in the calendar year 2002, not one asylum seeker vessel tried to enter Australian waters—not a single one. In 2003, one asylum seeker vessel tried to enter Australian waters; in 2004, there was not one; in 2005, there were four; in 2006, there were six; in 2007, there were five; and, in 2008, there were seven. In the course of those eight years there were 23 vessels, an average of about three a year, because the policy worked.


But out of an excess of zeal and moral vanity, Senator Chris Evans repealed those policies by legislation introduced into this chamber in August 2008. In the ensuing less than five years more than 500 vessels have made that perilous journey and, as you know, Madam Temporary Chairman, several of them have sunk. More than 1,000 lives have been lost and most of those lives have been of women and children. 


I have said before in debates on this issue, bad policy always has a price. I do not for a moment doubt Senator Chris Evans's good intentions. I remember his profession of humanitarian sentiment when he stood at that table, in August 2008, and announced these changes. But the problem is that when a bad policy is so bad that it reignites a trade like people-smuggling, in which innocent women and children are taken across perilous waters and their lives are placed in peril and, as a result, more than 1,000 of them drown, it is not just an academic exercise; a dreadful, horrible, human price was paid for that catastrophic policy decision by this government. It is a decision that it has been trying, without admission or acknowledgement of its error, to walk away from ever since. 


The Australian people know that there is one side of politics that gave the green light to the people smugglers in August 2008, regardless of all of their retrospective affectations and posturing of toughness—and that is this government, the government of Mr Kevin Rudd and Ms Julia Gillard. They also know that there is another side of Australian politics which gave the red light to the people smugglers which drove them out of business, and that was the side of politics that I represent—the government of John Howard, who, by introducing tough measures in 2001, stopped the people smugglers and saved lives. Who can say how many lives would have been lost in those years between 2001 and 2008 if we had not had the spine to introduce the measures to drive the people smugglers out of business? But we know how many lives have been lost, because in 2008 your government, Senator Feeney, did not have the spine to hold onto those tough measures: more than 1,000.


I feel sorry for Senator Chris Evans. I have served in this Senate for as long as I have been a senator with Senator Chris Evans. He is, in my view, undoubtedly a good and decent man. But he took responsibility for a catastrophic error and people died in their hundreds—in their thousands, possibly, certainly more than 1,000—as a result of that policy error. That is, I am sorry to say, something with which his name will always be associated and I feel sorry for him. But in these jobs we have to take the responsibility for the consequences of our decisions. If those consequences are as grievous as the consequences of that particularly egregious policy error then I am afraid that is the record that history has left.


We moved this amendment to ensure that in codifying maritime powers, the policy that worked under Howard—and will work again if the Australian people elect Mr Tony Abbott and his shadow ministers to government later this year—will be enabled to work again, to turn back the boats when it is safe to do so, to embrace temporary protection visas and to reopen Nauru. The government have already walked back on the issue of Nauru—we know that—in a terribly humiliating backdown, a backdown made more humiliating by the fact that the government did not have the grace to admit that it had made an error and was reversing an earlier policy decision to close down Nauru. But without introducing the whole suite of policies, including turning the boats around—the policy on which you were elected to office, Senator Feeney—and temporary protection visas then the people-smuggling business model will not be broken. 


You said that this amendment was introduced to make a political point; not so, Senator Feeney. The amendment is introduced to make sure that it is as clear as can be in this bill that the power exists. But there is an important point to be made, and call it a political point if you will, but the reality is and the record shows, indisputably, that there was a will and a steel to break the people smugglers that was supported by effective policies when my side of politics was in office that will be restored if my side of the politics is elected to office which your side of politics entirely lacks.

Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (17:57):  Firstly, the government do not support the opposition amendments and Senator Brandis is quite right that I did assert in my earlier remarks, when responding to Senator Humphries, that ultimately the coalition was motivated to put up this amendment not so much because it clarified or changed the bill, and in fact we say it does not, but to make a political point. Insofar as my observation required any confirmation, the contribution just made by Senator Brandis made the point better than I ever could.


I will begin by dealing with some of the questions of fact before returning to some of Senator Brandis's more expansive and indeed outrageous remarks. To repeat what I said earlier, the government is satisfied that the bill does not affect the government's executive power, including its prerogative power. This is preserved in clause 5 of the bill and as set out in the explanatory memorandum of the bill, specifically pages 12 and 13. Clause 5 provides that the bill will not limit the executive power of the Commonwealth. This means that the bill does not override the ability of the executive government to exercise any of those powers traditionally known as Crown prerogatives. These enable the executive to make certain decisions without the need for parliamentary or legislative approval. That is, for Senator Brandis's purposes, one would think, the end of the matter. 


As I alluded to in my earlier remarks, responding to Senator Humphries, further observations were made by the expert panel regarding tow-backs and turnarounds. In particular, the expert panel found that the conditions necessary for the safe and lawful enforcement of tow-backs did not presently exist. The panel did identify the theoretical circumstances in which tow-backs could take place. The expert panel report at paragraph 3.77 and attachment 3 also identified the following international law obligations relevant to tow-backs and turnarounds. Firstly, on jurisdiction, Australia has very limited powers to deal with stateless or foreign flagged vessels on the high seas, so as a general rule we would require the consent of the flag state of the vessel either to intercept the vessel outside our territorial sea or contiguous zone or to steam it outside those waters. Secondly, our obligations under the Safety of Life at Sea convention mean we would not be able to cause a vessel to be placed in a situation of distress. Thirdly, Australia has taken on so-called non-refoulement obligations under a range of human rights treaties and the refugees convention, which generally means that Australia cannot send a person to a place where they will be persecuted on the grounds of race, religion, ethnicity, membership of a social group or political opinion, or where they would be subjected to torture, cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, arbitrary deprivation of life or the imposition of the death penalty. Lastly, we would require the consent of the state to which Australia intends to return the vessel. The expert panel noted—as the government has been telling those opposite from time to time—that those circumstances simply do not exist for us at the moment. The government agrees with the conclusions of the expert panel's report. 


That sets out in a logical and concise way how the government says that the opposition's amendments add nothing to this bill. They do not protect or achieve the purpose for which Senator Brandis and others say they were intended. But, of course, that is not the true intention. The true intention of the coalition's amendments is to once again be able to raise the spectre of asylum seekers and—as the opposition leader has referred to it—the peaceful invasion of Australia.


In this respect, I cannot let Senator Brandis's farrago of distortions passed by unremarked upon. Perhaps, as an introduction to the farrago of distortion that was Senator Brandis' remarks, was this extraordinary proposition that the coalition have throughout recent years remained stoically and consistently resolved in providing a hard line or red light to the people smugglers. It is a black and white assessment which utterly belies the conduct of the coalition in recent years. Let us remind ourselves about where we are and how it is we came to be here. Firstly, Senator Brandis launched a series of statistics at us about ship arrivals during the period of the Howard government. And I guess it should be reassuring, particularly to those economists amongst us, that, just as the coalition insist that the global financial crisis never happened, so too do they insist that the invasion of Iraq in 2003 or the conflict in Afghanistan played absolutely no part in the arrival of refugees either. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan during those periods were at a phase where refugees and displaced persons were not making their way to Australia in the numbers that they presently are, nor for that matter was the aftermath of the civil war in Sri Lanka upon us. Those external factors remain completely unremarked upon by Senator Brandis because they, just like the global financial crisis, would reveal the fact that there are global externalities which are of critical importance in this debate, a debate of nuance to which the coalition is not well prepared.


Let me continue, because if we think about how it is that we got where we are, we cannot forget for a moment the decision of the High Court to strike down critical parts of this legislation. The impact of the High Court was such that it would have rendered impossible parts of the Howard solution, let alone rendered impossible parts of the contemporary government's mechanisms for dealing with this problem. In the aftermath of that extraordinary High Court decision, you will recall that the Prime Minister and the government reached out across the aisle and said, 'This is an issue of importance to both of us. Both parties have important commonalities here. This is a critical piece of national interest and we can work together to make a proper and considered fix, proper and considered amendments to the legislation that enable our policy and would indeed enable yours.' What was your response to that very sensible, amicable, bipartisan approach? It was ruthless and implacable rejection. 


So, Senator Brandis, I, on Senator Evans's behalf, take mighty exception to your proposal to lay thousands of dead at his feet in what I think is a particularly scurrilous allusion on your part, when I might just as easily say the same of the opposition for your disgraceful conduct during those dark days in the aftermath of the High Court decision. I might say the same about your refusal to let this government undertake the Malaysia solution: a solution which, in this government's judgement, would do precisely what it is you say you want to do, and that is to break the—




Senator Cash:
  Doug Cameron does not support them.




Senator FEENEY:
  I did not interrupt the barrages I have been confronted with, Senator Cash. You might do the same. 



Senator Cash interjecting—




Senator FEENEY:
  Or you might not. Let me simply make this point, Senator Brandis. You have deliberately as a ruthless political stratagem sought to obstruct this government, you have sought to obstruct this government's capacity to have legislation that enables its solutions. You have denigrated and destroyed wherever possible the Malaysia Solution, a proposal this government says would have dealt with the people smuggler model. You have conducted yourself in a way so as to ruthlessly exploit this issue for every vote you think that it might bequeath you. And to have done all of that and then lay the tragic dead of those dreadful tragedies at Senator Evans's feet—who, as you said, is a fine upstanding member of this place—is a disgrace. I am sure it will be thought of as such by everyone listening to this debate.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  I rise to clarify that the Greens will not be supporting the opposition's amendments as circulated and spoken to by Senator Brandis. In fact, I am extremely concerned that we are debating the introduction of amendments that absolutely fly in the face of international law when it comes to the laws of the sea. We know that the proposals that have been put forward by the coalition are incredibly dangerous. The idea that we would turn back asylum seeker boats on the high seas is a policy that the opposition have been spruiking for years. All of the evidence from those who have worked in this field previously such as the former Chief of the Defence Force, Admiral Barrie, clearly says that it will not work, it puts the lives of our brave men and women at risk and it pushes people to take desperate acts which we just should not be promoting. In fact, Admiral Barrie said only last year:


My expectation wouldn't be very high it's going to work in many cases, and I would be very conscious that our commanding officers at sea must act in accordance with international law.


The problem with the coalition's policy is that it drives people to very desperate measures, and I do not think it is something we should promote.


Of course there are many Australian defence personnel and international law experts on the record condemning this policy of the coalition, but there is also the Indonesian government, which has said time and time again that it simply will not accept this policy by the coalition. And we know that when Tony Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, had an opportunity to raise this issue with the President of Indonesia, he could not even bring himself to put this topic on the table for discussion, because the Leader of the Opposition knew very well that the Indonesian government, the Prime Minister of Indonesia and the Foreign Minister of Indonesia have all flatly rejected this as a workable option.


I will read one statement from the Indonesian foreign minister from March 2010: 


… simply pushing boats back to where they came from would be a backward step.


…   …   …


The general concept of pushing boats back and forth would be an aberration to the general consensus that has been established since 2003.


That is what the Indonesian government says about this ludicrous, dangerous, extreme policy of the coalition.


The Greens will not be supporting this desperate measure. I think it is incredibly unhelpful. It is illegal under international law. It is rejected by our neighbours, the very people we need to engage with in a positive way if we are to establish a genuine regional approach to people who are seeking asylum. Rejecting their opinion of this, dangerously pushing boats back to the high seas and not listening to our neighbours are not the ways you engage the very people you need in order to get us through what is going to be a challenging decade when we know that the number of people in our region who are seeking asylum and on the move is growing.


It beggars belief that the opposition continue to bang on about this issue despite all of the evidence showing that it will not work and is dangerous. Our Navy officers will not do it. That is what the Chief of the Defence Force has said. They will not accept their officers breaking the law and putting lives at risk. And our closest neighbour, whom we need to engage, says they will not have a bar of it. And of course Tony Abbott knows this; as I have reminded us here today, he could not even bring himself to bring it up with the President of Indonesia when he was here. It is all guff and bravado and has no substance in terms of a workable policy. I suggest we move on and vote for the amendment to get it knocked off.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2013-03-12,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (18:11):  I will disregard the moral posturing of Senator Hanson-Young, but I do want to respond in three particular respects to some observations made by Senator Feeney. First of all, let us deal with who bears responsibility for this tragic and catastrophic policy mistake, because these things we know. Firstly, we know that in the second half of 2008 the policy was changed by the Rudd government. I do not remember whether you were in the Senate. Were you in the Senate in 2008?




Senator Feeney:
  Yes.




Senator BRANDIS:
  Then you were here and you will remember that the policy was changed by the Rudd government. Secondly, we know that, before the policy was changed, in the period between 2001 and 2008 there had been a negligible number of asylum seeker vessels, in two years of that period not a single one—not one—and across those seven years a total of 23, an average of about three a year. Those are the facts, and you cannot—and, in fairness to you, you did not—controvert them.


The third thing we know, because we remember Senator Evans saying it, is that the policy was changed for humanitarian reasons, to do away with what were described as 'the harsh policies of the Howard government'. Senator Evans told Senate estimates how proud he was to have been responsible for doing away with those harsh policies. That is on the record.


The next thing we know that is not in dispute is that, immediately after those policies were changed, the number of unlawful asylum seeker vessels seeking to come to Australia went through the roof so that, in the 4½ years since, more than 500 vessels came. That is a fact. You may choose to believe, or to persuade yourself, that there was not a cause-and-effect relationship between that policy change and the sudden and continued escalation of people-smuggling. But if you seek to persuade yourself that there was not a cause-and-effect relationship then, with great respect to you, you are deluding yourself.


This last fact we know, too: hundreds and hundreds of people at least—on the most conservative estimates more than 700 people—whose bodies have been counted and recovered, died. Credible agencies, including Amnesty International and the UNHCR, have estimated that the likely number of deaths was more than 1,000. How many more than 1,000 is unknowable because we do not know how many bodies were never recovered. We do not know how many SIEVXs there were.


I do not wish to say anything cruel about Senator Evans, whom I regard as a good person, but it is a fact of life for senior political decision makers that they have to take responsibility for their decisions, which is why there is such a high price on bad decisions. This was a catastrophically bad decision made from the purest of motives. It was catastrophically wrong, and nobody, no matter how good or pure their intentions, can walk away from responsibility of the consequences. I think it was Saint Bernard of Clairvaux who said, 'The road to hell is paved with good intentions.' It has become a cliche, but it is also a truth. All ministers, in particular, are responsible for the consequences of the decisions they make, particularly when the likely consequences of those decisions were pointed out time beyond number in this chamber by the opposition. We were told that we were fear-mongering. The truth, as we know—the grim, fatal, statistical reality—shows that that was not so, that this was a terrible error which the government, albeit without acknowledgement, has been trying to walk away from ever since.


Secondly, let me say something about the Malaysia solution. The government chastised the opposition for supporting the Malaysia solution—




Senator Feeney:
  Not supporting.




Senator BRANDIS:
  I beg your pardon: for not supporting the Malaysia solution. We do not support the Malaysia solution—we never have—and we are unashamed of not supporting it because, as the High Court of Australia itself found, there were fundamental gaps in human rights protection in Malaysia which the so-called Malaysia solution did not deal with and could not guarantee protection from. One of those gaps was the custom of the Malaysian authorities to subject asylum seekers as a matter of routine to corporal punishment—to whipping. Do you think that we are ashamed of not sending men, women and children to a jurisdiction where they were liable to be whipped? No, we are not. We do not think that that was the right thing to do. It was not then, it still is not. We did not support it and we are proud not to have supported it. The Malaysia solution predated, in the government's consideration, the Nauru solution—the solution which worked.


Thirdly, Senator Feeney, let me take up what you say about Australia's international treaty obligations. Australia's international treaty obligations should be respected by all sides of politics, but treaties are obligations between nation states; they are always subject to domestic laws. Senator Hanson-Young, in the weird, cloud cuckoo land of the Greens, where everyone greets one another as a fellow Earthian, seems to think that there is a hierarchy of laws that puts international law above the laws of nation states. Not so, Senator Hanson-Young. We do not have global government—thank goodness! Treaties are not part of domestic law unless specifically enacted, and treaty obligations are always subject to and able to be attenuated by domestic legislation—not the other way around. Australia's treaty obligations are subject to the laws of this parliament—not the other way around. And while a law of this parliament might adopt a treaty obligation, the fact of the existence of a treaty not domestically legislated for does not tie this parliament's hands in seeking to abate or attenuate the obligations assumed under the treaty.


We make no apology at all for saying that the will of the Australian parliament, reflecting the will of the Australian people, is the paramount consideration here. If that means that a law passed by this parliament, with the mandate of the Australian people, abates a treaty obligation, then so be it. But nobody should say that a treaty obligation is superior to the domestic law of Australia in circumstances where the treaty obligation has not itself been enacted by the domestic law of Australia.

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2013-03-12,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia) (18:22):  I, too, rise to support the amendment moved by my colleague, Senator Brandis, and in doing so will take the opportunity to respond to some of the points made by the minister, and by Senator Hanson-Young.


In responding to the minister's—or parliamentary secretary's—comments in relation to what Senator Brandis had to say, I think the response can be summed up by this: the comments were nothing more and nothing less than from someone who clearly comes from a government that is weak on policy, and someone who is clearly representing a government that has no spine at all when it comes to securing Australia's borders. The speech that was given by the parliamentary secretary in relation to the comments made by Senator Brandis were excuse, after excuse, after excuse, after excuse as to why this government refuses to take steps—not only just steps but steps that have been proven to work under the former Howard government—to ensure the security of Australia's borders.


The parliamentary secretary also said in his comments that Senator Brandis himself had made some outrageous comments. The only thing outrageous about the debate that we are having today is that in not supporting the amendment put forward by the coalition, the government clearly does not have a view on the fact that in excess of 33,600 people have now arrived in Australia by boat under their failed border protection policies. That is the only outrageous thing about this debate! Clearly, the parliamentary secretary does not see as outrageous what Senator Brandis put squarely on the record; that is that we only know of some of those people who have perished, unfortunately, whilst trying to undertake the perilous journey to Australia. We do not know how many have actually died as a result of the loosening of Australia's strong border protection regime.


The parliamentary secretary also said that the government does not support the opposition's amendment, and that the only reason the opposition moved the amendment was to make a political point. Nothing could be further from the truth. The parliamentary secretary will know that these bills were referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee and that that committee reported on 12 September 2012. Coalition senators provided a dissenting report and they stated in the dissenting report:


…this legislation may represent a surreptitious attempt to remove the Commonwealth's power to turn back unauthorised boats as part of an effective national border control policy.


The term 'surreptitious' was used because agency witnesses before the committee were unable to state whether this power is preserved in the bill. So for the parliamentary secretary to say that the coalition moved this amendment merely to make a political point, I can only assume that either he or the advisers who are allegedly advising him have not read the legislation properly and do not properly understand the implications of the legislation that is currently being debated. The reason that Senator Brandis, on behalf of the coalition, has moved the amendment that is currently before the Chair is to ensure that this legislation is not read down in a way that brings into question the undoubted power of the Commonwealth to refuse entry into Australian waters or, if necessary, to tow back unauthorised maritime arrivals.


In his second reading speech, Senator Brandis indicated to the chamber that we would be looking for bipartisan support for our amendment. Why would Senator Brandis state that we would be looking to the government to support our amendment? The answer is quite obvious: because turning back the boats was actually Labor Party policy. It was the policy that the former Prime Minister of Australia—now the former Foreign Minister of Australia and merely backbencher, Mr Kevin Rudd—took to the 2007 election. Indeed, on the eve of the 2007 election Mr Rudd told the Australian newspaper:


… Labor would take asylum-seekers who had been rescued from leaky boats to Christmas Island, would turn back seaworthy vessels containing such people on the high seas …


To quote Mr Rudd:


""You'd turn them back,"" he said …


That was the policy the then Labor opposition, under former opposition leader, Mr Rudd, took to the 2007 election—a policy whereby if they were elected they would turn back the boats. That might give us an indication as to why Senator Brandis said he would expect bipartisan support for this amendment. But perhaps the policy of former Prime Minister, former Foreign Minister and now merely backbencher, Mr Rudd, was not enough to convince those on the other side that they should support this amendment.


Let us put on the table what the current Prime Minister—and, again, I use that term very loosely—Ms Gillard had to say about the policy of turning back the boats when she was the shadow minister for immigration. This is what the current Prime Minister said on 3 December 2002 about turning the boats around:


We think that turning boats around that are seaworthy, that can make the return journey and are in international waters, fits with that.


What the Prime Minister, the then shadow minister for immigration, was referring to was statements that we had made issuing new instructions to Northern Command to commence to turn back the boats when it was safe to do so. Let us look again at what Ms Gillard said:


We think that turning boats around that are seaworthy, that can make the return journey and are in international waters, fits with that.


So the Prime Minister herself supported turning the boats around when she was in opposition; yet we have a parliamentary secretary standing here today, responding to an opposition amendment which would assist both the current Prime Minister and the former Prime Minister to ensure that their former policies are implemented, and stating that the only reason Senator Brandis moved this amendment was to make a political point.


Parliamentary Secretary, with all due respect, I think the only person making a political point here is the parliamentary secretary himself. Like on so many things, members of the Labor Party take one thing to an election and then, when they are elected, do a complete turnaround and implement something else. This is a government that has continually said for a number of years that it 'wants to stop the boats'. However, if one were to do an analysis of statistics to date, two scenarios arise. Labor either does not mean what it says—which I put some credence on, given that it is the party that said there 'would be no carbon tax under a government that I lead' only, once it was elected to power, to completely change its mind on that issue—or, alternatively, it is incapable of doing it. I am not quite sure what is worse.


Is the Labor government totally incapable of securing our borders or has it yet again completely misled the Australian people? Why do I say that? Let us look at the statistics. The total number of arrivals since November 2007, when Mr Rudd was elected to government, is now 33,600 people. The total number of boats to arrive since November 2007 is 576. The total number of arrivals since polling day on 21 August 2010, bearing in mind that Ms Gillard was the leader of the Labor Party at that election—and one of the reasons Ms Gillard was the leader of the Labor Party was that former Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, had failed to stop the boats and Ms Gillard was going to stop the boats—is 423 boats carrying 26,251 people.


I am sure that, in his response, the parliamentary secretary may well tell the chamber that turning back the boats does not work and that is why the government will not support the opposition's amendment. Again, let us look at the facts, the actual statistics in relation to turning back the boats when implemented with temporary protection visas and offshore processing. As Senator Brandis pointed out to the chamber, we admit that in the early 2000s there was an influx of boats to Australia. Unlike the current government, the opposition does not shy away from that. We say, 'Yes, there was a problem.' It is as simple as that. It is not nearly as bad as the problem that the current government is facing. In fact, the total number of boat arrivals under the Howard government pales into insignificance compared to the total number of arrivals under this government. But we openly admit that in 2000 to 2001 approximately 54 boats with 4,137 people arrived. The difference between us and the Labor Party, however, is this: we took strong and decisive steps to implement policies that would secure Australia's borders, that would show those coming here illegally that Australia as a sovereign nation would dictate who comes to this country and the manner in which they come. Guess what? Our policies worked.


The statistics back that up as a fact. After the implementation in 2001-02 of the former Howard government's strong border protection policies, in 2002-03 the number of boat arrivals dropped to zero, with the number of people arriving in Australia being reduced to zero. One boat arrived the following year with 82 people on it. Zero boats arrived in the following year with zero people. This government says that it wants to stop the boats. If it truly means that, we expect the government to take the opportunity to support the coalition's amendment when it is finally put, because this amendment has been proven to assist in stopping the boats.

"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2013-03-12,"



Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (18:37):  I seek to respond to some of the remarks made by Senator Cash on the Maritime Powers Bill 2012 and the Maritime Powers (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2012. A whip once observed that 'Humanity is blessed with two ears and one mouth and they are best used in those proportions.' Reflecting on that, Senator Cash, I think a critical point needs to be made, and that is that you have missed, in its entirety, the central issue at debate here, which is whether your amendments actually affect any change at all.



I have said that the purpose of your amendments is to have this debate that we are having and probably to have this debate in the very terms you have it. But be very clear, Senator Cash, that as far as the government is concerned this is not a debate about tow-backs or turnaroundsor whatever you might want to call them. This is a debate about whether completely superfluous amendments should be adopted into legislation even though those completely surplus amendments are indeed superfluous. The prerogative powers of this government are not expanded or improved by your amendments. Your amendments achieve absolutely nothing, except to give you 20 minutes in this chamber to preach to this government about responsibility.


So let us just talk a bit about responsibility. Who is it who bears responsibility? Another whiponce said, 'There are lies, dammed lies and statistics', and again that is proven wholeheartedly with your use of statistics. It is a truism—perhaps unfortunately in this debate—that the coalition has tended to overestimate pull factors and the ALP has, from time to time, had a tendency to overestimate push factors. For those looking for the truth in this issue, the play between push and pull factors is critically important—but not for you, Senator Cash. For you the world is a very simple place indeed—there was no global financial crisis, there was no war in Iraq, there is no conflict in Afghanistan, there was no civil war in Sri Lanka, thousands of people were not cast up upon the shores and there are not 300 million refugees in the world today. For you the world is a very simple place.


That is unfortunately at the core of this problem, because it is not simply possible for you to say that the coalition's policies are the solution here, when the coalition has ruthlessly, at every turn over the past few years, sought to achieve nothing more than gridlock and stagnation. You are not interested as legislators in fixing this problem. You are not interested in working with the government. You declined to work with us on the expert panel. You declined to work with the government on amendments to the immigration legislation in the aftermath of the High Court decision. At every turn you have refused to work with this government. Why? Because you vote with your feet, Senator, and your feet and your vote are always for gridlock and stagnation. As entertaining as that debate is, that debate does not belong here, Senator Cash, except insofar as you can desperately try to make it so. This is a debate about whether completely superfluous amendments that achieve absolutely nothing for you or for us should be included in the bill. We say no. We say no for self-evident and obvious reasons.


Let me finish with this. I noted with interest, Senator Cash, that you spoke with great enthusiasm about the Labor Party's utterances in 2007. Next time you refer to a 2007 commitment as though it was an article of canon law, consider this: where is your commitment to the carbon trading emissions scheme which formed such a central part of the platform you were elected on? Where is your commitment to the 2007 platform of Howard and Turnbull to which you were committed? Dare I say it, before you start throwing rocks you should observe the glasshouse in which you reside.

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales) (18:41):  Clearly the parliamentary secretary has forgotten one piece of history, and that is when Ms Gillard told us that every boat arrival was a policy failure. According to her standard, since November 2007 we have had 3,600 policy failures. On her watch, 27,048 people have arrived since she became Prime Minister.


Parliamentary Secretary, let me take you back to the comments that were made at the time when I was in Senator Cash's position as shadow parliamentary secretary in this area. Senator Evans was sitting there at estimates and telling us about the changes that he was proposing, and I was taking him through those changes. He sat there and he told us that he was dismantling 26 programs in the immigration portfolio. How can you change 26 programs in the immigration portfolio and not have a consequential impact with those changes? The people smugglers listened to every word that Senator Evans told the Senate. They were tuning in wherever they were and listening to every word and thinking, 'Great, our product has just improved on the international market and we will be able to promise a lot more and deliver a lot more for a higher price. You beauty; we are going to make a lot more money.'


I would also say to you, Parliamentary Secretary, that as a former government lawyer I did my fair share of immigration law. So do not come into this chamber and sanctimoniously preach about detention. Look back into your own dark days when your predecessors, Gerry Handand the Keating government, introduced mandatory detention. If you want to go out there and preach, you should go back and look into your own history, because over my legal career I have done my fair share of immigration law. If you want to talk about throwing stones in glasshouses you ought to look back at your own history on these issues.


Today we are talking about a bill that provides for enforcement powers available to maritime officers, including boarding, obtaining information, searching, detaining, seizing and retaining things, and moving people into detention. We know that the maritime environment is a particular environment. My husband was in the Navy for 35 years, and at one stage of his career he was commanding officer of the patrol boat squadron out of Darwin at a time when we used to have boats coming in. Yes, it is a very difficult situation, but it is a situation which requires absolute flexibility in officers' ability to exercise judgement at sea and to deal very, very quickly with changing and difficult circumstances.


This bill was examined by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, and I refer the Senate to the dissenting report of coalition senators, who said it was their belief that this legislation represented a surreptitious attempt to remove the Commonwealth's power to turn back unauthorised boats as part of an effective national border control policy. I quote from the report:


We say 'surreptitious' because the Government, in evidence before the Committee, was unable to say categorically whether this power, used by past Federal governments as an important tool in maritime policy, is preserved in the present legislation.


That is the reason the report went on to say:


We note that the power to turn back boats has been exercised in the past and has been exercised by various agencies, in particular by the Royal Australian Navy.


Of course, turning back the boats is not new. Before the last federal election, as Senator Cash has correctly pointed out, we had Mr Rudd telling us that turning back the boats was precisely what he was going to do. We saw his quotes in the Australian, and he told everybody before the election that that was precisely what he wanted to do.


Coalition senators in their dissenting report observed that the Maritime Powers Bill 2012 purported to set out comprehensively the powers of authorised officers in a maritime setting. However, officers of the Attorney-General's Department were unable to tell the committee how, if at all, the power to turn back boats was replicated in this bill. One would have thought that the officers of the Attorney-General's Department would have been able to tell the Senate committee about a very important point in this legislation and to explain where in the legislation it is guaranteed that that power would continue. It was suggested that clause 5 of the bill preserves the prerogative powers of the Commonwealth, including the power to repel unauthorised boats. However, it seems that this bill evinces a clear intention to describe and regulate Commonwealth maritime power so that any prerogative powers must be read down by the constraining provisions of the bill—including clauses 32, 54 and 69. It is very doubtful that the present power to turn back boats is preserved by these provisions. Indeed, that is why the coalition cannot support these bills. The principle bill clearly seeks to codify the Commonwealth's maritime powers and it seems, therefore, that any prerogative powers must be read down.


Since the last federal election we have had many, many boat arrivals. As Senator Cash has correctly said, arrivals during the Howard years totalled just over 13,000—239 boats. Since the last election we have had 570 boats carrying 33,000 people, which is almost 20,000 more people and more than twice the number of boats that arrived during the entire Howard years.


Progress reported.

"Boswell, Sen Ronald",Nats,2013-03-12,"



Senator BOSWELL
 (Queensland) (16:55):  I was saying just before lunch that the Labor government is destroying the fishing industry and I was explaining how. First, work in a policy vacuum. Then let a department that is wholly and utterly unsympathetic to the industry effectively take over control—that is, the environment department. Then, when we are trading in a global market and the price of our product is critical to sales success overseas, add unnecessary cost burdens at every stage of production, like the carbon tax and renewable energy target. This also makes our own seafood less price competitive against cheap imports on our own domestic market. At the same time, put no facility in place for the industry to easily gather funds from innovation, thus making it even more difficult to run marketing campaigns. Then reduce the area open for fishing by declaring 2.3 million square kilometres of our oceans as marine parks and ban commercial and recreational fishing in these vast areas, reducing the catch even further. At the same time, refuse to compensate many of the businesses directly affected and destroy much onshore infrastructure needed to support the catching sector. After that, override the recommendations of experienced fisheries managers and fisheries scientists for the sake of short-term political expediency, raising doubts in the minds of the community about the management of our commercial fisheries. Finally, to ensure that no-one can make any future investment plans with any confidence whatsoever, launch a root-and-branch examination of fisheries management.


Overall, demonstrate that you do not value the industry as a vital producer of healthy, high-quality food and as a provider of crucial jobs in often remote areas where there is little alternative employment, and demonstrate that you care more about the accolades of overseas, city based environmental activists and the continuing political support of Labor's coalition partners in government, the Greens. That is how to destroy an industry. That is how Labor is destroying the commercial and recreational fishing industry.


The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Joe Ludwig—he is a fine fellow; I get on well with him—is fisheries minister in name only. Everyone in government, everyone in fisheries science and management and everyone in the fishing industry knows that the portfolio is in fact run by the environment department and its minister, the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Tony Burke. Senator Ludwig's views, advice and recommendations have been ignored or overturned on one major fisheries issue after another. When it comes to real decisions on the big issues affecting the seafood industry, the environment minister has the call. A fishing portfolio run by an environment minister results in a fishing industry offered up as a sacrifice to environmental activists. This makes it impossible for the fishing industry business to predict what access to fisheries resources will be available to them in future and makes forward planning and sensible development of the industry impossible. 


The Australian dollar is close to record highs against the US dollar and other international currencies. This makes our exports dearer in overseas markets and makes our imports cheaper in our domestic market. So it is harder than ever before for our fishermen and seafood marketers to make a profit or even sell their product in the first place. It makes our fishing charters relatively more expensive compared with charters in overseas locations.


Despite the fact that the industry is already doing it tough, this government has added more and more costs that fishermen, processors and marketers have tried to absorb. The carbon tax—the renewable energy charge—is a classic example. Of course, the Labor government is not really managing fisheries—not coherently, rationally or predictably. It is moving from one ill-considered, illogical short-term decision to the next, going wherever it is led by the environmental activists.


Take the case of the Abel Tasman, where the government took its lead from Greenpeace. This is the so-called supertrawler. The government invited the trawler to Australia, and its Australian-based operators went through the proper process. And yet the government went to water when the vessel actually arrived. Environmental minister Tony Burke banned it from fishing for the last two years. He did this against the sound advice of the fisheries scientists and fisheries management. His action trashed the reputation of Australian fisheries science and raised unnecessary doubts in the mind of the Australian public about the state of the fish stocks and their management.


Banning the Abel Tasman you can chalk up to Greenpeace. However, their fellow environmental multinational, the Pew foundation, the World Wildlife Fund and others had a far bigger win. This was on 16 November, when the environmental minister, Tony Burke, declared 2.3 million square kilometres of new marine reserves that will lock commercial and recreational fishers out of vast swathes of our ocean. I expect this week that Minister Burke will table in the other place the management plan for these marine reserves. These plans will have enormous impact on the commercial and recreational fishing industries, and on small business and individual rights right around the Australian coast. They should be rejected by parliament. Minister Burke should be made to go away and try again and then bring back proper management plans for the marine zones.


The current plans have not taken proper notice of good science, just what Labor regards as good politics. There has not been proper consultation with recreational or commercial fishermen, just backroom deals with local and international environmental activists. There has not been any proper consideration of the terrible impact the plans will have on the lives and businesses of people in the coastal centres right around Australia. It is just simply to boost Labor's image in the inner-city seats in the federal election.


What Minister Burke has put in these management plans is bad policy development, for the wrong reasons. They are not about protecting the marine environment; they are about protecting Labor votes and preferences. They are shoddy—absolutely shoddy. Quite apart from the terrible impact these marine reserves will have on regional economies, there is the question of how these vast areas of soon-to-be-empty oceans will be policed.


What Minister Burke described as the 'jewel in the crown' of the marine reserve network is almost one million square kilometres of the Coral Sea. Much of this vast area will be completely closed to all fishing. Effectively, what this means is that the commercial fishermen and charter boat fishermen, who are the eyes and ears of enforcement there, will be banned. These are the very people who are in a position to spot any illegal fishing vessel operating in the waters hundreds of kilometres from the Australian mainland, and they will not be allowed in there.


How does this Labor government intend to police this area of almost one million square kilometres? No-one is prepared to say. I heard someone say that scuba divers will keep their eyes open on their way to their dive trips. Maybe we can ask the French to send some patrol boat from New Caledonia. This is a very serious question. The government is bringing in this Maritime Powers (Consequential Amendments) Bill, but how will it enforce these marine powers? How will it enforce the protection of our fisheries in the huge new marine reserves and the huge new zones where Australian commercial and recreational fishermen will no longer be allowed to fish?


It is really just creating protected fishing zones for illegal foreign fishing vessels—places where foreign fishing operators will no longer have to worry about being spotted by Australian commercial and recreational fishermen. Australia has the largest area of marine parks of any country in the world—more than three million square kilometres. Sadly, that is not a proud boast; it simply means that we have locked away more of our seafood, more of our exports and more of our recreational fishing areas than any other country in the world.


It is no wonder that we now have to import more than 70 per cent of the seafood we eat in this country every year and that international anglers are choosing alternative fishing destinations—when they look at the map all they see is green—before they make a decision to come to Australia or not to come to Australia. How ironic that a major report released by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Joe Ludwig, in December demonstrates that Australian key wildlife fish species are well managed. Over 80 of the country's leading fisheries researchers collaborated to produce a report on 49 species contributing over 80 per cent of the value and 70 per cent of the volume of Australian wildcatch fisheries. They found that fisheries are operating sustainably and our seafood stocks are in good shape—they are in great shape.


This government has demonstrated more than once it cares nothing for the opinions of the commercial and recreational fishing industries and all the families involved in fishing for sport or business. What matters is that it maintains the support of the Greens and the international environmentalists. As far as consultation with the industry is concerned on things like new marine reserves, the government is just ticking the boxes. It does nothing more than the minimum it is required to do. For example, the government released its draft management plans for new marine reserves with just the minimum 30 days of consultation in the middle of the Christmas school holidays. Of course, many of the people most interested in commenting on these very complex plans for the future of fishing in vast areas of ocean around Australia's coastline were on holidays—they had literally gone fishing. Both recreational and commercial fishing representatives requested the government extend the period for consultation from 30 days to 90 days. This very reasonable request by these representatives and others was totally disregarded. Now Minister Burke is rushing these plans through parliament just as quickly as he can.


In relation to the fishing bans to be imposed by the new marine reserves, the government has said professional fishers directly impacted will be able to apply for some compensation. However, charter boat operators will miss out entirely and so will related businesses such as tackle shops, seafood processors, seafood wholesalers, ship chandlers, providores, repair facilities and other suppliers of goods and services. At the same time, just to further muddy the waters and make sure the seafood industry cannot plan ahead with any uncertainty as to what the rules will be, fisheries minister, Senator Ludwig, announced a major review of Australian fishing policy and legislation, so the industry will have to continue treading water while the review is completed, his recommendations considered and then any changes to the legislation are framed, tabled and debated—more uncertainty for the seafood industry.


Senator Ludwig announced the terms of reference for the review on 13 September last year and said the review would be conducted within three months, yet six months later we have still not seen the review. Industry has to wait. Not once has this government stood up for the Australian primary producers and defended them against the outrageous claims and demands of the environmental multinationals. It is a valid question to ask whether this Labor government really has the will to protect Australian fisheries and the Australian fishing industry from a range of threats. We know the government has already caved in to pressure from the international environmentalists and their local franchises and is banning fishing from vast areas of Australian waters. Does the government have the will to genuinely protect our fish stocks from illegal fishing vessels? I do not believe so. Many senators will remember under the Howard government in 2003 the pursuit of the Uruguayan flagged vessel Viarsa by the Australian Customs and Fisheries patrol vessel Southern Supporter. The Viarsa was spotted in the Australian waters near Heard Island, suspected of illegally catching toothfish. The vessel fled when the Southern Supporter approached and so began a 7,000-kilometre, 21-day pursuit through stormy seas and icebergs in the Southern Ocean, until Viarsa was finally stopped in South Africa and escorted back to Australia. There it was forfeited and scrapped. 


Of course, that was under a coalition government. Now we know that Australia has not conducted a single patrol in the Southern Ocean for over a year. The difference is simple: the Labor government is providing for the protection of our Australian Fishing Zone on paper. In government, the coalition will enforce fishing laws where it really matters—out on the water. When Tony Burke announced the proclamation of Labor's 2.3 million square kilometres of marine reserves he declared that Australia's precious marine environment has been permanently protected. He should have added it had been protected on paper. It has certainly not been protected out on the water.


All Labor has done is ban commercial and recreational fishing and left our offshore waters more vulnerable than ever to illegal foreign fishing vessels. The government does not have a policy for the fishing industry and it does not have a policy for protection of our fish from illegal foreign boats. Worse still, it does not have the will to protect our fishing zones. The only way to see a policy developed for our valuable seafood industry and to genuinely protect our Australian fishing zone from illegal foreign operators is to change the mindset of the government—and the only way to do this is to change the government itself. Fishermen will get their chance to help do that later this year, and I know they will respond accordingly.

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2013-03-12,"



Senator HUMPHRIES
 (Australian Capital Territory) (17:10):  It is my pleasure to rise to speak on the Maritime Powers Bill 2012 and to indicate that I see in this legislation the reinforcement of a pattern of behaviour on the part of the Labor government, a government which, all too often, has set out with a grand vision of reforming a particular area of the law and an intention to make clear what was characterised by a series of disparate and sometimes disjunctive pieces of legislation and bring it all forward. That is the intention. To cite some recent examples, it was the intention of the privacy legislation amendments, it was the intention of the human rights legislation that was discussed recently and it was the intention of the Maritime Powers Bill in each case to bring together, codify and make clear the position with respect to that particular area of law in a comprehensive way.


But I regret to say that, like the privacy bill and like the human rights bill, the Maritime Powers Bill is grand in conception but in some respects fails to deliver what it promises—although I would not go so far as to describe the Maritime Powers Bill as being as grand a fiasco as those other two pieces of legislation. If I might cut in there, those of us who were involved in the inquiry conducted by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee into that piece of legislation know that almost every witness who came before the committee from every sector criticised the legislation as being unclear, as muddying the waters, as creating confusion and as leaving so many questions unresolved that it caused considerable concern in the broader community, who rely on that legislation.


In this case the level of confusion is not as severe or as widespread, but it is deficient in one very key respect, and I think it is impossible for this chamber to walk past this issue without it being comprehensively settled and resolved. The question is, very simply, whether this legislation preserves the ability of the Commonwealth, through those who operate our naval vessels and other vessels on the sea, to exercise a power to turn back vessels that are in or approaching Australian territorial waters. That is the critical question. It is a matter on which there has been considerable public policy debate in recent years. It is a matter where, in the past at least, public policy has been applied to exercise such a power to ensure that boats have been turned around and sent away. This is not a moot question; it is a question of what powers the Commonwealth actually might exercise in a maritime setting. It is reprehensible that the Commonwealth government has brought to the Senate for passage a piece of legislation, in the form of the Maritime Powers Bill, without a clear answer to the question: does the bill preserve the power of the Commonwealth, the prerogative power of the Crown, to turn boats around?


I say that that is a question which is not answered because, when the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee considered the legislation, it was unable to obtain a clear answer from officers of the Attorney-General's Department as to whether that power was preserved. To, I think not unfairly, paraphrase those who gave evidence before the committee, there was a suggestion that perhaps the prerogative power was still preserved in the legislation.


I asked specifically where I could find it referred to in the legislation and I was told that it was not necessarily contained in the words of the legislation, that in fact the power as a prerogative power of the Crown is a power which inherently lies with a nation state to be able to exercise with respect to the regulation of its borders. I thought that was a good answer, but not a complete answer. What the Maritime Powers Bill and its sister legislation, the Maritime Powers (Consequential Amendments) Bill, purport to do is to codify the powers of the Commonwealth that it might exercise in a maritime setting; to describe comprehensively what a person exercising such powers may or may not do—what the captain of a naval vessel or a Customs vessel, or some such person, might do—in the setting where they were confronted with a vessel attempting unlawfully to enter Australian waters. They might wish not to allow that to occur, and might wish to know whether the powers were there for them to turn that boat back. They might understandably make reference to, either personally or through some commanding authority back on the mainland, the place where such powers are enumerated and codified—namely, the Maritime Powers Act, as it would then be.


If they looked in that place—if this legislation were to pass in the form that is before the Senate today—they would not find such a power. There is not in the legislation anywhere a clear description of the power of the Commonwealth or its servants and agents to be able to turn back boats, in the circumstances where indeed Australian maritime powers have in the past turned back boats—in circumstances that were considered appropriate—in ensuring that unauthorised arrivals did not reach Australia's shores.


The answers to those questions to officers of the department were, with great respect to them, unclear and unconvincing. But I would be very assured if the minister at the table were able to assure the Senate categorically that this legislation does preserve the power of the Commonwealth to turn back boats in circumstances where that course of action is warranted. If that assurance can be given to us, I think it would go a long way towards mollifying the concerns we have had about this legislation.


As a belts-and-braces matter, however, I think we would proceed with the amendment which is before the Senate at the moment. Senator Brandis is moving it to make it clear that that power does rest with this legislation, which of course is meant to be a comprehensive enumeration of the powers of the Commonwealth in a maritime setting.


Why do we talk about this? Why is this a consideration, given that it has not been a power that has been exercised, apparently, for some time? The answer of course is that it must be available as a possible response if the circumstances warrant that being the case. No-one is suggesting that it would be an everyday occurrence for Australian naval vessels to turn boats around on the high seas. It would not be an everyday occurrence. We would hope it would not be an everyday occurrence, and it was not an everyday occurrence during the years of the previous government when this power was indeed exercised. Obviously, it is a power which is to be exercised only in very special circumstances. But it is important to have such a power available in the armoury of responses by Australia as a nation state to the circumstances where people choose to make journeys to this country and seek to enter its territorial waters, and for which there is no lawful reason for that to occur. 


The suggestion that officers of the Royal Australian Navy have said that the exercise of such power either is inappropriate or not legally possible is a suggestion which has no foundation. I have sat in meetings of the estimates committee—as I know Senator Feeney, the parliamentary secretary at the table, has—and I have heard officers at the table answer questions about the circumstances in which such powers might be exercised. It is true that they have said that it is very dangerous to exercise those powers, that there are risks associated with the exercise of those powers and that there are all sorts of reasons why it needs to be done with great care, but I have heard nobody in that setting say either that the power does not and should not exist or that it could never be exercised. The fact that such a power until now has existed, does exist and might be exercised in circumstances where it is in Australia's interest to do so in my view means that we should be careful today to make sure that this legislation does not pass through the Senate without that power being preserved.


If it is the government's view that the power should be preserved, it may not wish to exercise the power. I gather that, although the previous Prime Minister thought that it should, the present Prime Minister does not—fair enough. Whatever the views of the government of the day, it would be unfortunate if the power were to be wiped from the statute books or from the common law by virtue of the passing of a piece of legislation which had the effect of repealing the power or removing the power from Australian authorities. Obviously, if the Australian people see fit at an election later this year to have a new government—




Senator Feeney:
  It is unthinkable!




Senator HUMPHRIES:
  A fanciful suggestion, I am sure you would think, Senator Feeney! If they happen to do that, I imagine that a new government would be very much of a mind to make sure that a strong signal was sent to people smugglers that Australia's borders were no longer open borders and that Australia would take every measure it possibly could to ensure that their business of smuggling people was smashed. If the threat, or perhaps the actual use, of a power to turn boats around in circumstances where it was safe to do so added to that policy and made that policy real and effective then it would be employed by an incoming government.


It goes without saying that the policy this government has pursued generally on the protection of the borders and on ensuring that people, wherever possible, seek asylum in this country through lawful means has been a spectacular and unmitigated failure. I think that barely needs to be stated. The government has had, on my reckoning, five different positions on how to deal with the flow of boats across the Timor Sea, and no doubt before the election there is time for a sixth version if it decides that the policy is just too malodorous for the Australian people to be able to support.


So we will see what comes out of the coming election campaign, but what I do know is that the Australian people want a policy which is effective. They want our immigration policy to be strong and resilient and to have support across the entire community. They want the policy on the treatment and handling of refugees to be one which maximises Australia's generosity towards those who are deemed to be genuine refugees and ensures that, wherever possible, a person applies to Australia for asylum in a way which ensures that their processing is done in an orderly fashion and, if possible, offshore through application in such places as refugee camps under the auspices of bodies like the United Nations High Commission for Refugees or the International Organization for Migration so that once again Australians can have confidence that we are, as one of the most generous nations in housing and offering refuge to refugees, able to process such applications in a fair, merit based arrangement where the cost to the Australian taxpayer is not prohibitive. None of those things can be said at this point in time.


We make it very clear that, if we are the government that is elected later this year, we will radically alter the policies which have been by applied so ineffectively by this government. We will ensure that we have a policy which strongly discourages people from using unseaworthy boats to enter Australia's waters in order to obtain status as an asylum seeker, processed by Australian authorities. We will do our best to make sure that this vile business is brought to an unceremonious end. Of course we can only do that if we have the full suite of powers available to us that were available to the Howard government. It is very clear that the judicious use of that policy was an effective tool in the hands of the previous government to ensure that boats did not arrive in anything like the numbers that have arrived since 2008.


For those who have a vision in their mind of the circumstances of a boat being turned back that might conjure images of chaos on the sea or of something being done which is extremely unsafe, which is unsatisfactory from a humanitarian point of view, I want to make the point to senators that Australia has exercised this power in the past in a way which did not produce those sorts of outcomes and which were an aid to effective public policy in preventing and discouraging people from using that device to enter this country. If we take the example of an Indonesian fishing boat captained by an Indonesian captain with an Indonesian crew having departed from an Indonesian port perhaps a couple of hundred kilometres off the coast of Indonesia, which an Australian naval vessel decides to turn around, one could hardly say that was a particularly onerous or unfair arrangement to enter into if that resulted in that presumably unseaworthy vessel being forced to return to an Indonesian port.



Senator Feeney interjecting—




Senator HUMPHRIES:
  That may be the case, Senator Feeney, or it may not. But until we apply the policy we will not know. Let us see what happens. It was not the case in the past. We know how to do this. We have done it before. If you are not confident in exercising a power in those circumstances, let somebody who has done it before exercise such a power. I predict that it will not take long for these businesses—that is what they are—designed to exploit the misery of human beings who are seeking refuge to very quickly get a message about what it is that Australia is prepared to do to protect the integrity of its borders and to ensure that an orderly process for processing refugees is applied once again, one that creates a system which Australians and others around the world can respect for the way in which it is operated.


I urge the Senate to consider very carefully the powers that are in this legislation but even more carefully consider what is not necessarily in the legislation. I look forward to the minister clarifying what the status of that power is. As I said, I would be greatly mollified by an assurance that the power is absolutely preserved. Perhaps it does require the authority of a minister to make the statement that we are seeking.




Senator Feeney:
  You are stuck with me.




Senator HUMPHRIES:
  You are close enough, Senator Feeney. It was not an assurance we got from officers of the department. But we would be greatly reassured if the minister at the table were to make that assurance in the course of this debate.

Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (17:29):  I thank honourable members for their contribution to this debate. I will do my very best to mollify your points, Senator Humphries. I am sure by the end of my eloquent address, you and I will be seeing eye to eye on these questions and voting side by side. Before I make such bold predictions, let me roll on.


This government is committed to supporting the hard-working Australians who work on our behalf to uphold Australia's maritime laws. These men and women are required to operate in a difficult, dangerous and quickly changing maritime environment, an environment which regularly presents risks often unknown. This environment poses particular challenges to the effective enforcement of laws. Enforcement operations in maritime areas frequently occur in remote locations, isolated from the support normally available to land-based operations and constrained by the practicalities of sea-based work.


Under the current maritime enforcement regime, operational agencies use powers contained in at least 35 separate Commonwealth acts. This structure is inefficient and can lead to operational difficulties for the primary on-water enforcement agencies. The government has developed the Maritime Powers Bill 2012 and the Maritime Powers (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2012 to address these challenges. They provide a smarter and simpler approach to maritime enforcement by streamlining the operational framework for our on-water enforcement agencies.


The Maritime Powers Bill establishes a system of authorisations under which a maritime officer may exercise enforcement powers in the maritime domain. The powers contained in these bills are modelled on and preserve the suite of powers currently available to agencies to conduct maritime enforcement operations—a key point to which I shall return. In particular, the bills consolidate all maritime powers in the customs, fisheries and migration regimes, constituting a large majority of Australia's maritime enforcement operations. The bills will, therefore, effect a substantial consolidation of Australia's maritime enforcement regime in relation to areas of highest priority.


The bills also include a range of safeguards to make sure maritime enforcement powers are authorised and exercised appropriately and for a proper purpose. A key safeguard is the requirement for the exercise of powers to be authorised on specific grounds by a senior maritime officer or member of the Australian Federal Police. This provides clarity around who must make decisions to take enforcement action and ensures appropriate oversight in relation to the exercise of powers. The Maritime Powers (Consequential Amendments) Bill repeals maritime enforcement powers in a number of other acts where they overlap with powers in the Maritime Powers Bill.


I will turn for a moment to some of the specific comments made by Senator Humphries regarding the opposition's concern about this legislation and in particular speak to their amendments. Senator Humphries sought what might be called an undertaking about the impact of these bills and how they will change or bend the regime as it exists. He used the phrase 'have previous powers wiped from the statute books'. Let me see if I can give him some comfort in this important respect. These bills do not change the powers of maritime authorities, so to the extent that it was possible previously to turn back boats it remains possible. Let me provide a little more meat on that proposition.


The Maritime Powers Bill will not affect the legality of tow-backs or turnarounds. Currently, to the extent that the power resides in legislation, it is in section 245F of the Migration Act. To the extent that it will reside in the proposed legislation, it sits primarily in clauses 69 and 72, together with clauses 21, 32 and 41 concerning jurisdiction and clauses 52 and 54(1) concerning the exercise of power. To the extent that the power exercised is the prerogative power of a government to control its borders, that prerogative power is preserved by clause 5 of this bill. The government has no plans to reinstitute tow-backs or turnarounds at this time, as you are well familiar with, but this legislation does not change the powers available to a government and, so to the extent that it was previously possible, it remains possible.


We would make the point—and I am sure Senator Humphries would be disappointed if we did not make the point—that this debate and the amendments in this debate are in our view something of a furphy. You are, in our judgement, making amendments that have no practical effect. You are not strengthening the prerogatives or powers of a government in the way that you say you want to, because you are simply adding words that do nothing to add power. 


But you are doing this: you are making the political point and highlighting the political point that you want to turn back the boats. I suppose on that partisan point we say that the expert panel that dealt with some of these issues found that the conditions necessary for the safe and lawful enforcement of tow-backs did not presently exist. Senator Humphries, the government's position is that turn-backs and turnarounds are obviously not going to become a tool deployed by this government. We say—and perhaps I will go further into this in committee, if it is desired—that the expert panel report raised a number of questions, including treaty obligations for Australia about why that particular methodology of turning back boats is inappropriate, that it breaches safety of life at sea conventions and the like. But the critical point for you, I say, is this: your policy, notwithstanding the fact that we say it is crazed, is not defeated or undermined by this legislation. This legislation does not constrain this government or any future government from undertaking the sorts of powers that you describe the Howard government exerting.


While we do not agree about the substantive policy point and while I think the government is making its point that this amendment is about political posturing not about strengthening the legislation—




Senator Brandis:
  No, it's about reforming the law actually.




Senator FEENEY:
  I am sure we will debate this in committee, Senator Brandis. To the extent that towing back the boats was possible under previous legislation, it remains possible under this.


The unique aspects of the maritime domain pose particular challenges to the effective enforcement of laws. This warrants a tailored approach to maritime powers. The Maritime Powers Bill ensures flexibility in the exercise of these powers, allowing maritime officers to deal with quickly changing circumstances in often difficult and dangerous situations. These bills will streamline and modernise Australia's legal framework for maritime enforcement. They are another aspect of the government's work to provide Australia with a modern legal framework. I commend the bills to the Senate.

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (18:52):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


Each year Australia exports millions of live animals, but before the sheep, cattle and other exported animals reach their destinations tens of thousands will die from the trauma of the unacceptable conditions of the voyage. This latest report on livestock export mortalities is witness to another 681 cattle and 19,407 sheep that have died on voyages in the one year since 2011 alone. In 2012 there were 192 voyages exporting cattle and 39 exporting sheep. Animals are often required to remain in very poor conditions for longer than a month, and this is on the back of often arduous journeys by road from the stockyards to the ports. Think of the animal cruelty. It is something that we need to address.


We could actually have a win-win here: we could reduce the animals' suffering and we could create so many more jobs in Australia if the Australian government would get behind a clear transition plan and open up more processing of the meat in Australia. The market for processed meat is expanding enormously, and there is growing concern that, because of the lack of action and lack of leadership from the Australian government, we are losing out here. Again, we are losing out in terms of addressing the considerable animal cruelty issues as well as just not creating the tens of thousands of jobs that can be returned to rural and regional Australia.


Coming back to this report that sets out these worrying figures, these animals are uprooted from large grazing pastures. Then, obviously, they can end up exhausted, frightened and anxious just from the travel to the port. We know the compliance by the exporters with the loading and unloading procedures is often abused. Then, on the ships, thousands of animals endure loud noise and vibrations. The conditions are often very cramped. The animals may be left to wallow in their own urine and faeces. So it adds up to a very stressful journey. It is quite understandable why so many die and we end up with these reports. Considering the number of animals exported, discussing the mortality rate in percentage terms is disingenuous and belies the sheer magnitude of suffering and distress these creatures endure as they are transported to our export partners for slaughter. Australians are not cruel people. The vast majority do not support live exports. A 2012 survey commissioned by the World Society for the Protection of Animals showed widespread opposition to the live export trade, with almost seven out of 10 respondents believing that the live export trade should be ended.


Returning to the issue of the boxed meat, from 2000 to 2011 exported boxed meat earned $59 billion, while live sheep and cattle exports earned $8.4 billion. The average earnings over the 11-year period were $5.4 billion per annum for exported boxed sheep and cattle and $765 million per annum for sheep and cattle live exports. So it is again giving emphasis to the very important point that so many jobs could be created in Australia and business could really develop on a much more solid footing by having the meat processed in this country and developing markets for the boxed meat trade. The government is really doing the wrong thing by the industry, because we are losing out to other markets at the present time.


This is an area that the Greens are giving a lot of attention to. We are working with animal welfare groups, with farmers and with the union that covers meatworkers, because clearly there is an opportunity here for there to be a transition away from a reliance on the live export trade and to bring great benefits to regional Australia as well as reducing the animal suffering.

Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (18:57):  Mr Acting Deputy President, thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act report on livestock mortalities for export for the period from July to December 2012 and once again, despite very difficult circumstances faced by the industry, to congratulate the industry on the remarkably good figures that we have seen for survival, particularly of sheep and cattle, to our destined markets.


I was interested in Senator Rhiannon's comments about loss of market, because that is exactly what has happened, regrettably, to our markets over the last six to 12 months, and the way things are going it probably will continue. Long-trusted markets—45 years in the case of Kuwait—such as Doha in Qatar and Oman are now being lost to Australia simply because of the unreliability of what had previously been an incredibly safe, high-quality market, which was that supplied by Australia.


If I may, as I often do in this place, I will debunk that theory that says that, if Australia ceased to export live animals, we would be able to replace the trade with the meat market. Let me give you a lesson in current affairs and history. When Australia lost the live export trade to Saudi Arabia some years ago, we had a very active sale of meat—boxed meat and frozen and/or chilled meat—to that country. History records that, when we lost the live export trade, we also lost the boxed meat trade. I come forward to 2012-13 and draw your attention to Indonesia, where, of course, as a result of a decision of Ms Gillard and Senator Ludwig in 2011, we all of a sudden terminated the sale of live cattle to the Indonesian market, thus denying some 69 million low-socioeconomic Indonesian people their right to beef protein.


If you listened to Senator Rhiannon, you would have thought that once the trade restarted under some limited conditions, including dropping the sale of live animals to that market, and there being a continuing demand for beef protein, logic would tell us that we would have seen an increase in the sale of chilled or frozen meat to Indonesia. But of course exactly the history that we saw in Saudi Arabia has been repeated in Indonesia—that is, while the number of live cattle going to those markets has halved, so indeed has the tonnage of beef going to those markets. At a time when the price of beef has increased tenfold, the average consumer, the low-socioeconomic Indonesian consumer who once so heavily relied on the Australian trade, has now been lost.


We now have a circumstance in my state of Western Australia at the moment where, as a result of the drop in the number of live animals that are leaving the state, prices for sheep have dropped dramatically. Those of us who know anything about markets and trade would always know that when a competitor leaves—in this case the live export competitor—it affects the market. So we now only have the one buyer—that is, the meat industry—and the meat industry will never sustain the prices.


In drawing attention again to these remarkably high survival figures for animals that are travelling from Australia to our Middle East and Asian markets, I simply make the point that Australia is the only country in the world that invests heavily to ensure that animal welfare standards in all of our target markets remain very, very high. And should we be forced to leave the live export trade, one can only assume that standards of animal welfare in those countries, countries which we have serviced for many, many years, will only dissipate. I leave the chamber with the message that it is an absolute myth that if we were to remove the live export trade there would all of a sudden be an increase in opportunities and employment in the meat industry around Australia.

Senator LUNDY
 (Australian Capital Territory—Minister Assisting for Industry and Innovation, Minister for Multicultural Affairs and Minister for Sport) (19:04):  Back in late 2008, I gave the first of a series of speeches over recent years devoted entirely to Canberra's wonderful centenary history. The speech recognised the historic decision by federal politicians in December 1908 to endorse the Yass-Canberra region as the site where the new nation of Australia would construct its capital city. Like so many special moments in Canberra's foundation, a century ago that decision, and the intense lobbying and jockeying that surrounded it, are not as well-known as they should be.


But perhaps the roots of Canberra's foundation story did not reach a climax with the end of the exhausting battle of the sites back in 1908; it was but a step in the journey. In fact, it is today, 12 March 2013, that precisely 100 years ago Governor-General Thomas Denman, Prime Minister Andrew Fisher, and Minister for Home Affairs King O'Malley laid Canberra's foundation stones with golden trowels. Lady Gertrude Denman stepped forward on the podium to announce Canberra as the name of the new city, accompanied by a roar from the huge number of Monaro residents present, because it was the local name, their name, as reflected upon eloquently at today's commemorative ceremony by our Governor-General, Quentin Bryce, ably assisted by her husband, as tradition requires.


A city such as Canberra is known in the present tense famously as the home of federal parliament. It is often unfairly sledged, as we have unfortunately witnessed again lately, but its rich centenary history tells the story of both a nation and a community. Close inspection of this history reveals not one or two, but a cluster of key moments to ponder, appreciate, commemorate and celebrate.


The symbolic beginning of the main story was probably the congress of engineers, architects, surveyors and others interested in the building of the national capital of Australia. Normally, such a gathering of design professionals might struggle to get any outside community interest, but not this one. For this group had shrewdly decided to meet in Melbourne in May 1901, at the very same time that the Commonwealth's politicians were meeting for the first time further up the hill. The design professionals were only too aware that the politicians could no longer postpone what one colonial delegate had memorably referred to in the 1890s as 'the burning question': the question of where the capital would be sited. The planners insisted on making their presence felt, and they did.


At the congress, architect George Sydney Jones demanded a city where the common sense 20th century spirit of Australia would assert itself. He wanted the future capital city's architecture to be essentially Australian, not a slavish copy of the art of past, dead centuries. This was an impressively liberated attitude at a time when England was still regarded as home, and other participants had the same attitude. They all wanted a city beautiful, but with a distinctive Australian character.


The first Labor government of Andrew Fisher instructed renowned surveyor Charles Scrivener to produce a capital site for a city occupying a commanding position, a design worthy of the object not only for the present but for all time. It was fortunate for the nation that the progressive Fisher government was again in power for the crucial years of 1910-13, because the new Minister for Home Affairs, King O'Malley, pursued the capital's development with passion and flair. He took quite a controversial hands-on approach to the international design competition, won by the superb design No. 29 submitted by the genius couple of Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin, and, more relevantly tonight, he structured the foundation stone and naming ceremonies.


The speeches delivered by Andrew Fisher, Attorney-General Hughes and O'Malley himself a century ago are oriented to an expansive future for the new nation, but it is undoubtedly Lord Denman's speech that really resonates today. It was regarded as the finest speech he ever gave in Australia. He concluded his speech with these words:


Remember that the traditions of this city will be the traditions of Australia. Let us hope that they will be the traditions of freedom, of peace, of honour, and of prosperity. That here will be reflected all that is finest and noblest in the national life of the country …


Today there was a commemorative ceremony at the foundation stone on the mall in front of Parliament House where the Governor-General, Her Excellency Quentin Bryce, gave a speech of similar eloquence in reflecting upon a century of this city's history. I want to conclude by acknowledging and thanking the Chief Minister of the ACT government, Ms Katy Gallagher, and the Labor government for their absolutely incredibly marvellous celebrations in this our centenary year of the national capital, Canberra.
