"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2010-06-24,"—I move:
That standing order 31 (Automatic adjournment of the House) and standing order 33 (Limit on business) be suspended for this sitting.
As Leader of the House I shall continue to consult during today with the Manager of Opposition Business. At this stage it is expected that the other place will sit extra hours to deal with some legislation. It is therefore anticipated that the House will sit this evening. If it is the case that there is not business ready to be returned to this House, we will have a dinner break. I would propose that later this day I would move a motion suspending the sitting of the House until such time as the bells ring. I will agree on the time with the Manager of Opposition Business so that all members can be informed. I will then inform the House as such.
I put on record my thanks, as I did in the caucus—where it was not necessarily well received—for the cooperation, for the dignity of the parliament, of the Manager of Opposition Business and the Leader of the Opposition this morning.

"Tanner, Lindsay, MP",ALP,2010-06-24,"—I move:
That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, and by reason of the urgent nature of the work, it is expedient that the following work be carried out without having been referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works: Infrastructure and upgrade works on identified immigration detention facilities.
On 18 April 2010 the government announced that a significant number of irregular maritime arrivals would be transferred from the Christmas Island detention centre to the Australian mainland. As a result of this announcement, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship has identified that various infrastructure and upgrade works are required in order for the facilities to meet detention standards. These sites include RAAF Base Curtin in Western Australia, which will accommodate single males, Northern Immigration Detention Centre Darwin, which requires upgrade and expansion works to increase the current amenities available to clients accommodated within the centre, and Christmas Island, which will undergo further works, including a security system upgrade, client amenity upgrades and additional staff accommodation.
The estimated outturn cost of the proposal is $190.29 million plus GST and is inclusive of capital and operational expenditure. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction will commence immediately and be completed by May 2011.
I note that a proposal to proceed with a construction project without referral to the Public Works Committee is not common. The government very much supports the work of the Public Works Committee and has not taken this decision lightly. I commend the motion to the House.

"Bailey, Fran, MP",LP,2010-06-24,"—It is 20 years since I first entered this chamber as the member for McEwen. In doing so, I became the first woman to represent a rural electorate in the House of Representatives and the first Victorian Liberal woman to win a seat in this chamber. During these 20 years, I have had constant and unconditional support from my two daughters, Amanda and Abby. Amanda is here in the chamber today. She has always described herself as the non-political member of the family, but she has frequently in her own forthright manner been able to tell me if we as a party were connecting with the public on various issues. Abby is watching this broadcast on her computer in Brussels at 3 am, and although she has worked outside Australia for the past seven years she has always been up to date and on the mark with Australian political life. They are wonderful, intelligent, articulate, forthright, loving and caring young women—and I am not at all biased! I thank them for their support and understanding of a mum who was often late for school or social functions. They always had to buy the cakes I was supposed to make for the cake stalls!
Twenty years ago, with a slender margin and as the shadow minister for consumer affairs and secretary of Fightback with responsibility for selling the first version of the GST, I became known as ‘Mrs GST’. I was an easy target for negative campaigning and lost my seat in 1993 by a few hundred votes. While I felt at the time that this was my political baptism by fire, it actually taught me valuable lessons, the most important of which was to stand up for what I believe in but at the same time to ensure that the people whose support I am asking for through their vote clearly understand a policy and its impact at both the local and national levels.
It was a difficult decision to stand again and attempt to win back McEwen three years later. I acknowledge the late Worrall Jones, my first electorate chairman, for encouraging me to stand again. History records that I did win my seat in 1996 and have won it at every election since, albeit with very slim margins. Each election has been a real challenge because of the huge outer urban population growth with demographics unfavourable to my side of politics. However, the last election made political history with a recount and a High Count challenge that resulted in my increasing my margin to 31 votes out of 106,000.
From the 1996 election to the present day I have had the good fortune to have the same team as my federal electorate council. To express my appreciation of Peter McWilliam, my chairman and campaign manager for the past five elections, the word ‘thankyou’ is totally inadequate. Peter and his wife, Kerrie, have become firm family friends and are here in the chamber today, along with Barb and Craig Jones. Barb has managed polling booth rosters with over 800 volunteers and, at one election, managed 106 polling booths. My heartfelt thanks go also to Chris Thomas, John Lithgow, Heather Tivendale and the other members of our McEwen campaign team.
I have always described working in McEwen as like being on a high wire without a safety net, but the reality is that my branch members, the Liberal women’s groups and the Liberal Party membership at large have provided me with a safety net, and I thank them all. I still vividly remember the first time I entered this chamber. I was nervous, excited and almost overwhelmed by the soaring dimensions of the chamber. I was aware of the great parliamentarians who had occupied these benches, but I had a keen sense of responsibility to all those in my electorate who had sent me here. I have always tried to do my best for the people of McEwen, and I have loved every minute of having had the privilege of representing them.
Chairing the Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Regional Services was very rewarding, and I experienced how a group of politicians from both sides, with diverse expertise, could work together to produce recommendations covering issues ranging from biosecurity to fisheries management to trade, and I thank Dick Adams, the member for Lyons, who was deputy chair, not just for his spirit of cooperation but also for his culinary expertise at the completion of an inquiry. Like so many members, I would like to see the work of committees taken more seriously by government. I am aware that the Deputy Speaker is seeking to achieve greater recognition and better responses by government, and I wish her well.
My parliamentary career has largely been spent as a member of government, the majority of which was as a member of the executive of that government—a rare opportunity for a marginal seat holder. My time as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence and as the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence was hugely rewarding. My responsibilities included defence estate, corporate services, infrastructure and personnel. And I had the privilege of working with both General Peter Cosgrove and Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston. I am particularly proud of being able to vastly improve the living conditions for defence families and single personnel and commend the work of the Defence Housing Authority. Running the defence cadets and establishing the first Indigenous defence cadets in both the Tiwi Islands and Wadeye was very challenging but also very rewarding.
I used to joke with people who asked me what I did in the defence portfolio that if I described what I did I would then have to shoot them. However, commercial and strategic sensitivities meant that I could say very little. But what I have always had is the ability to tell any and every audience that I had the greatest privilege to serve in this area of responsibility because I saw firsthand the extraordinary sacrifice, level of training and commitment of men and women who were prepared to put their hands up and wear the uniforms of our Defence Force in the service of our country. They perform an extraordinary job on our behalf.
I should explain that I did have a prior strong relationship with defence as I have Puckapunyal in my electorate, but that relationship almost floundered initially. As a new MP I was invited to visit Puckapunyal, my first ever visit to a defence base. I was taken on a tour of inspection, and at the time Australia had 42 Leopard tanks and they were all lined up for my inspection with members of the School of Armour in attendance. Naively I asked the brigadier in charge, ‘Why do we need so many tanks in peacetime?’ There was an audible gasp of horror, and I am sure they were thinking, ‘What on earth have we got here?’ However, Brigadier Gordon Jones quietly took me aside and invited me to lunch, where he instructed me—or, as he says, ‘guided my thinking’—about the use of armour. He was very persuasive because within a month I was on my feet in this chamber extolling the virtues of armour in peacetime to anyone who would listen.
I should also come clean to my leader and the member for Mackellar that I am the person who argued the case to move the School of Artillery from that very exclusive piece of real estate with the okay views, known as North Head, to Puckapunyal by portraying Puckapunyal as the Tuscany of the south. But I confess the ability to fire live ammunition was really the determining factor.
I was a member of the Small Business Association of Australia before entering parliament, and a strong advocate for reform for that sector. I was therefore thrilled when Prime Minister John Howard made me the Minister for Small Business and Tourism and enormously proud that we reformed the Trade Practices Act in favour of small business. Other highlights were reducing the compliance burden for small business by over $450 million by both harmonising and eliminating regulations, overhauling the franchise code of conduct, increasing transparency for franchisees and establishing a code of conduct for the smash repair industry, replacing a decade of infighting and disagreement.
I am proud that during my time as the minister for tourism the industry grew to an $87 billion industry, and that very cheeky advertising campaign ‘So where the bloody hell are you?’ added $4.2 billion to the industry’s bottom line. While that advertising campaign certainly had its detractors here in Australia, it was designed for the international market and particularly the UK, US and European markets. Industry there loved it, and it was seen as typically Australian: friendly and inviting. There was, however, one negative response overseas, from the British advertising standards board. It controlled TV advertising and decided it would ban our ad. I was dispatched to London by the Prime Minister with instructions to ‘sort it out’. The media frenzy began as soon as I landed at 6 am and did not stop for three days. A certain Blair cabinet minister facing yet another sex scandal was eternally grateful as we pushed him off the front page of major newspapers. My thanks to our high commission staff and to Sir Alastair Goodlad, the former British High Commissioner to Australia, for their assistance.
British people, and no doubt many expat Australians, helped by ringing in to talkback shows and asking how an authority could allow shows like Little Britain to run in prime time but not our ad. Our campaign became the talk of the town, and we certainly could not have afforded to pay for all the free publicity we received. The end result was that the BASB, which had never in its history reversed a decision, did so and decided in our favour—a great result for our tourism industry.
My thanks to all my ministerial staff for being so dedicated to their jobs—never simply agreeing with me but always willing to push me—and to my former chief of staff, Dan Tehan, in particular, who hopefully will join my colleagues as the next member for Wannon.
To be the member for McEwen has been a personally fulfilling experience. The people, the 107 communities, their issues, their achievements and their hopes for the future have always inspired me to work harder. There have been many successes and challenges over the years, but there has been no bigger challenge, with more impact on individuals, than the Black Saturday bushfires that devastated so many of my communities. I would like to share with the House a description of bushfire:
From early morning the fire was accompanied by a hot wind, almost the strength of a hurricane and throughout the day, the surface of the country was exposed to the full power of its withering influence. Bushfires raged across hundreds of miles of country, sweeping along with almost the speed of lightning and destroying almost instantaneously, men, women, children, homes, fences, gardens, crops, animals.
That, however, was not a description of Black Saturday, 7 February 2009 but a description of Black Thursday of 1851, written in the Argus. People said then that such a fire could never happen again. The reality is that bushfire presents the greatest threat of disaster. Since 1851, when the number of deaths resulting from bushfire was first recorded, 815 people Australia wide have died—but, significantly, 561 of those deaths have occurred in Victoria and almost half of those Victorian deaths have occurred in my electorate.
When I spoke in this chamber on 24 February 2009, I nominated key issues that must be addressed if we are to prevent a disaster of the magnitude of Black Saturday, when those 173 people lost their lives, from ever happening again. The key issues I nominated were an efficient and sustained fuel reduction program, an early warning system, safe shelters and the use of early fire detection technology. Sixteen months on, we do not have one of these measures in place. To give credit where it is due, however, both the former Prime Minister and the Attorney-General listened to my presentation of the FireWatch early fire detection technology that I brought back from the German Aerospace Centre and have funded a pilot program that is currently being assessed by the CSIRO. This technology has reduced forest fire in Germany by 93 per cent—but, most importantly, it has saved lives. To install this system in fire risk areas will be expensive, but I say to the future government: consider partnering with the insurance industry to install this technology. It has recently paid out $1.2 billion just on homes that were destroyed in Victoria as a result of Black Saturday.
We have learnt a great deal from our recent experiences in Victoria, and I believe it is imperative that we as a nation learn from them. I strongly believe—after many months of working side by side with people, listening to them, attending meetings, sharing their frustrations and disillusionment, and researching—that the model for recovery that was implemented in Victoria and funded extensively by the Commonwealth is the wrong model. It is based on the command and control model, where decision making is centralised and hierarchical, is part of the Department of Premier and Cabinet and has no decision-making power in its own right.
Of course governments at all levels through their agencies play a vital role. In the aftermath of Black Saturday, there were 12 federal government departments involved and they performed magnificently. However, research from around the world shows us that greater emphasis is placed on organised community action and control in determining the nature of the response to the disaster. It is local people who are best placed to coordinate and prioritise activities, use their local knowledge to advise government officials and be actively involved in decision making. All the research I have studied agrees that it is the local communities who provide the sense of continuity—the connection that people need. I have found that people look for and need the social and economic structures that existed before the disaster, and their priority is to regenerate those rather than having to create new ones.
Philip Berke, who is internationally recognised for his work in this area, says:
Effective response to recovery after disaster cannot be achieved through top down, inflexible approaches. Success is based on a process of bottom-up policy and organisational development.
I agree wholeheartedly. Whether the disaster is bushfire, flood or cyclone, there is a need for the Commonwealth as the major source of funding to take a leadership role in ensuring that disaster recovery models are community based, with a board independent of government, to ensure strategic targeting of funding for recovery. I encourage every member of this House to support this proposal. Disaster can occur anywhere with tragic results. The recovery process should never further traumatise affected people.
The past 16 months have been the most challenging ever for my staff and I place on record my thanks and appreciation to them. They have acted with compassion and commitment that has far exceeded any job description. I do have some regrets in leaving the parliament. I regret that in a country as affluent as ours we have not better looked after our disabled fellow Australians and their families, I regret that we do not have a Noel Pearson in this parliament and I regret that governments feel the need to spend vast amounts of money on spinning their message. Imagine the benefits for every Australian if that same funding was invested in medical research. Who in the next parliament will have the courage to cap the amount of funding government spends selling itself? Overwhelmingly, I leave this parliament with a great appreciation of what this parliament achieves and an enormous sense of appreciation for having the privilege of having served as the member for McEwen.
—Order! To the member for McEwen: as the member for Scullin, I apologise that within partisan politics I may have caused her some headaches. But she has the solace that they were largely unsuccessful. Beyond partisan politics, I thank her for her cooperation in the fulfilment and pursuit of aspirations of those that we jointly represent in this place in the outer north-east of Melbourne. I wish her all the best for her voluntary retirement. In the preliminaries, before I call the member for Riverina, I understand it is the wish of the House that the member should not be interrupted by points of order.",REPS,<title>FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT AMENDMENT (ANCILLARY BENEFITS) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Hull, Kay, MP",NATS,2010-06-24,"—Who would have ever imagined that an insignificant girl from Guyra could be one of those fewer than 1,000 people to have been elected to the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia in over 100 years? On this historic day I am more acutely aware of the significance and the privilege of being an elected member of this House. On this day, 24 June 2010, I am here in this place to witness the entrance of the first female Prime Minister of Australia, Julia Gillard. I guess the question now has to be asked: is it the gender of the Prime Minister that is important or is it the quality of the person who is at the helm? Let us not forget that the woman who is now Prime Minister of Australia has been at the table and has exerted extreme influence in support of every decision that has been responsible for the demise of Kevin Rudd. Julia Gillard has supported and championed every single bad decision that has put this country into significant debt. She has strongly supported the introduction of a mining tax and is directly responsible for the $1.7 billion blow-out of the BER; for a wasted $5 billion simply through mismanagement; for a $1.2 billion blow-out of the computers in schools program, still only 300,000 of the 970,000 laptops having been delivered; for promising the 260 childcare centres, delivering only 38 centres and then abolishing the program; and for removing the opportunity for thousands of our regional kids to get access to a tertiary education by changing the rules on youth allowance. So today is indeed a significant day.
I came to this place with a determination to use my voice to ensure that the voice of regional people was heard, particularly those in the electorate of Riverina. It was my choice to not take a seat on the frontbench when it was offered. However, I did feel honoured and I appreciated the fact that I was approached, but I have never regretted my decision. I place on record my appreciation to the voters of the Riverina who have given me the honour and the privilege to have served in this parliament. I am deeply moved to have had such amazing support over the years.
I have been fortunate to have been able to deliver some really good outcomes for the Riverina. I feel that I can justifiably take full credit for the fact that RAAF Base Wagga with 1,000 jobs is now secured and that, rather than close as it was scheduled to do, we were able to expand it. Now all the Defence recruit training commences in Wagga Wagga. I feel very proud of this outcome and I will never forget the day that Prime Minister Howard rang me to tell me that I had been successful in presenting my case and that the base would stay open. I was also successful in securing millions of dollars in health program grant funding for two linacs in the Riverina Cancer Care Centre, which was built entirely through communities raising over $4 million from across the Riverina and has delivered some equity in treatment for cancer sufferers. I am so aware of the significance of having this facility in a regional community, having lost my brother, my father and my mother to this disease.
Charles Sturt University now offer veterinary science, and their remarkable new dental school will see dentists once again returning to practise in regional Australia. I am honoured that the veterinary science and animal hospital has been dedicated with my name.
It is exciting to get hundreds of millions of dollars for projects we have worked hard for, but it is equally exciting to deliver small projects that build and sustain our communities, such as walk-in walk-out medical centres, rural transaction centres and regional communications centres. Our Regional Partnerships program was something to be proud of in the way it delivered local answers to our local communities in the Riverina. Every dollar spent was truly accounted for and never ever questionable.
There have been many issues that have taken an exhaustive commitment. Thus was my five-year, three Assistant Treasurers battle trying to change legislation that would see hundreds of millions of dollars spent on water infrastructure replacement projects rather than going back to the Treasury as income tax for Murrumbidgee Irrigation after the privatisation of water companies in 1999. Winning the Coleambally Irrigation mutuality issue took a little longer still. But, again, we never gave up, and I really do need to thank former Assistant Treasurer Helen Coonan for not just accepting the advice that it could not be done and for listening to us. The Coleambally community are very special to me and I am very proud of my ‘Kay Hull’ bridge on the Sturt Highway over the main canal.
This takes me to our Pratt Water project in the Murrumbidgee. Richard Pratt was a man with vision before his time. Had we listened to and acted on Richard Pratt’s advice on water, then we would not be in the position that we are today—fighting to maintain food security to feed our nation and securing access to water for productive use.
During the years that I spent as part of the coalition government we faced a deluge of challenges. This government may think it has done it tough with the GFC. Well, let me say we on this side of the House know what tough really is! There was a new tax system in the GST, and the Labor Party did all that they could to instil fear into the hearts and minds of all Australians. We had the job of trying to overcome that extreme mischief, and we did it. We had to bear the collapse of HIH that impacted on industry and businesses right across our nation. Then UMP collapsed, leaving all of our medical practitioners without insurance, and our obstetricians left the workforce en masse because of the difficulty getting indemnity. Tony Abbott rose to the challenge at this time and underwrote those medical services when he was the health minister. Labor throughout the entire process were scathing of our government for doing that.
We then had the collapse of Ansett. Minister John Anderson made the courageous decision—with a fair bit of persuasion, might I add—to stake a regional carrier, and from that we have seen Rex emerge and win many awards, including one for the best regional carrier internationally. I am very proud of this significant success and of my dedicated Saab VHTRX in recognition of my fight for Rex. I also need to praise the efforts of QantasLink at that time for the sensational way that they supported regional areas through those difficult times.
We governed through the worst drought in 100 years. That required huge investments in EC and interest rate subsidies over 10 long years. We had to stand by the decision to send our troops to war in Iraq, which was terribly unpopular, and each and every member of the government at that time felt that pain personally. These are just a few of the big issues that one dealt with as a backbencher in government, and it was not easy. However, one of the hardest things I had to bear was the decision by the Howard government, and then later supported by the Labor Party, to sell the remainder of Telstra.
I argued my case strongly that we should structurally separate Telstra and sell off the retail arm, keep the wholesale section and build a state-of-the-art network and then rent it off to all of our competitive carriers. That sounds a bit familiar! It was a significant and disturbing time for me, and I must say that I had to endure quite a lot of hostility. I certainly was not popular in my electorate because my local daily paper had beat up a story that said I had missed a critical party meeting where the decision was made to sell Telstra. This was categorically untrue. I was at a meeting advocating for those with a disability. There was absolutely no notice on the party room agenda that Helen Coonan was going to come to the party room and declare that she was preparing a scope for the sale of Telstra. I was assured afterwards by the attendees at that party meeting that when Senator Coonan announced this in the joint party room there was no debate on it, there were no questions asked on what and when she was doing it and there was no vote on whether or not we should agree to sell Telstra. There was no discussion at all. But that did not stop my local press from running what I believe to have been the most offensive article that I have ever had to endure. If I was ever maligned unfairly and unjustly in my career it was by this one article. In fact, the issue and the legislation did not come back to the party room for discussion for some nine months.
Then came the day of the vote. I will never forget that day of despair. In the sitting weeks leading up to the vote I had to case the parameter of the chamber, as I knew that my crossing the floor would not be simple on that day. I knew that there would be pious amendments thrown in from the Labor Party that were not serious to them, or acceptable to the coalition, and that there could be many divisions. So I had to find a place where I could follow the proceedings but still make it into the House in a one-minute division. So there I was, stepping out the House and timing myself to the chamber and in through the door—and it just simply wasn’t working from anywhere! It was always taking longer than one minute. I bought a stopwatch and I kept walking and clicking the routes. I could not be in my office because it was in R.1.76 and it took much longer than a minute from there. I finally found a solution. I waited in the downstairs library, I watched what was happening in the chamber on the TV, and then I made my dash. Having timed myself over and over, I was willing my legs to carry me even though they felt like jelly. It was a one-minute division and I was coming down that walkway, the guard was holding the door open and mouthing, ‘Hurry, hurry,’ and I was praying, ‘Please don’t shut the door.’ And then I was inside, taking my seat on the opposite side to the party members that I loved and respected. I was in despair, but I knew my actions were right. When I look at what is happening today, I know I am vindicated.
The pain I felt that day has only been surpassed once since, and that was when I sat in this chamber and watched the Rudd Labor government dismantle the single desk on wheat. I watched this House take action that would damage people who were salt-of-the-earth Australians who had done absolutely nothing wrong but been faithful to a company that had been imposed upon them by a former government. They were Australians who faced the most gigantic challenges known to man at times and they overcame them, yet they were sold out here in this House. I could not help but cry tears of despair for them on that day here in this chamber. These battling farmers told us that the Iraqi AWB wheat sales were nothing to do with the single desk on wheat, and they were correct.
I have been given many opportunities in this place. I have had the privilege of meeting the Queen of England; the US President George Bush; the British Prime Minister Tony Blair; and the most spiritual of all men, the Dalai Lama. I have been encouraged to pursue my advocacy on behalf of those I believe to be the most marginalised people in Australia and across the world, and they are people who are living with HIV. I have been supported by this parliament in my four-year appointment to the Inter-Parliamentary Union Advisory Group on HIV-AIDS. Working with people living with HIV is not everyone’s ambition; however, I have found within me a skill that I would like to continue to cultivate. I have been confronted with some of the most shocking experiences and I know that I can make a small difference to the lives of some people living with HIV.
I believe that the work that I have done on committees has assisted people across Australia. The committee that I chaired—the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs—along with my very good friend and very capable deputy chair, Julia Irwin, handed down two very good reports. The report entitled Road to recovery was on substance abuse, andthe members of the committee were faced with overwhelming and confronting issues that were affecting the everyday lives of so many, and I thought I would never have to do anything more difficult. Sadly, that was not the case. We then went on to do the child custody inquiry and handed down the report entitled Every picture tells a story. This report has been mentioned in valedictories in the last few days. It set the standard in committee reports and is widely recognised as one of the best reports to have been delivered in this place. It was an inquiry that left many on the committee feeling that they might never be the same again. We saw the grief, the pain and the trauma of partner separation and the effect that it had on the children of those relationships. Every picture tells a story had 28 recommendations; the Howard government implemented all but one of those recommendations.
I chose to stand down as chair of the family and community affairs committee in order that I could join every committee that would deal with the recommendations, from 2004 to 2007. I did this and guided the legislation through the legal and constitutional affairs committee and then the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. We then introduced the legislation, and it was enacted in late 2006 and early 2007. It is extremely disappointing to see that the current Attorney-General is now looking to unwind that very good work that was recommended in a bipartisan report. He is committing an assault on the Federal Magistrates Court by moving the family law cases back into the Family Court. I have a strong commitment from the coalition that, if they are elected, they will immediately stop this action and leave family law where it is best managed—that is, within the Federal Magistrates Court.
Thank you to all of those fabulous, hardworking committee secretariats over the years; to the attendants who have become such good friends; to the Comcar drivers and the security staff; and, of course, to the valuable clerks, who have always been there to give advice and comfort. I thanked Ian Harris before he left the Clerk position, but I would like to give particular thanks to Bernard Wright. Thank you, Bernard; you have been such a wonderful confidant for me, and what I said upon Ian’s departure is exactly true—that they searched all over the world for a replacement for Ian only to find you, the best man for the job, right here in Australia, in Parliament House. Mr Speaker, you have been an accomplished and splendid Speaker of this House. In addition, you have given me significant encouragement in my endeavours on HIV, and I truly thank you for your genuine interest.
I appreciate all of the friendships that I have made in the House and I would like to correct the misconception that government and opposition members are always at war. I have the deepest and most abiding respect for many Labor members of parliament. In fact, I would consider the member for Throsby, Jennie George, to be one of the finest people I know; and again, in the last parliament, I valued my friendship with the member for Eden-Monaro, Mike Kelly, among many others. Thank you to Jill Hall, the Government Whip, for the great working relationship we have had when counting on the floor of this chamber. Working with you, Alex Somlyay, whip to whip, has been so special. Also, to Nola, Patrick and the fabulous staff: you have all been a warm and most refreshing experience.
I have enjoyed my relationships with Liberal members, including the member for Wagga Wagga, Daryl Maguire. I have been privileged to have known you all and to have worked so closely with such committed members of parliament. Members like Judi Moylan, such a good friend, have my absolute respect and admiration for their integrity and their commitment to their beliefs.
I would like to acknowledge an amazing woman here today. Emily Gardner has shared her home with me for almost 10 years. Thank you, Em; you are so very, very special. Your true spirit has shone in your battle with lung cancer. You are an inspiration of positive thought power, and this has been such a lesson in life for me, Em. Thank you so much.
The Nationals celebrate 90 proud years this year, and I have enjoyed every moment of my association with them. I have been honoured to have worked with National leaders Tim Fischer, John Anderson and Mark Vaile as deputy prime ministers and now with the outstanding and loyal Warren Truss as the Leader of the Nationals in opposition. I would like to say to my fellow Nationals members and senators how deeply I respect each of them for the energy, drive and determination they all display in representing the people of regional Australia. It is very tough being the small party that we are, but it is not the size of the dog in the fight; it is the size of the fight in the dog—and I am very proud of the size of the fight in each and every one of you. Regional Australia needs us, and I wish you all a resounding re-election, with even more Nationals joining you in our friendly party room.
The Nationals branch members have been such tireless supporters and have never once let me down. My campaign team over four elections have proven that they certainly have what it takes to get the Nationals elected. Thanks to all of those energetic and committed polling booth workers who have manned over 90 booths all these years. I know that we will also be successful in getting the Nationals candidate Michael McCormack seated in this House after the next election.
My dedicated staff members, both past and present, have served the Riverina electorate with distinction on every occasion. I have had the most amazing staff and I have sincerely appreciated each and every one of you for your loyalty and dedication not only to me but to the entire Riverina electorate, regardless of politics. In particular, I need to thank you for the way in which you have all treated those who suffer from mental health disorders; you have given them the respect and dignity that they deserve, and your patience and empathy have been uniquely compassionate.
Today I have in the gallery Angela, Donna, Tina, Lucy, Joe, and Gerrie, who was the Nationals whips clerk for over 30 years. Doris, who has been with me the entire time I have been a member, unfortunately could not be here today. I thank you all from the bottom of my heart. I could never have done it without your team work, expertise and attention to detail. You are all so precious to me and I am so proud of you.
I need to give thanks for the job that gave me the most amazing addition to my family. In 2000 I met a humble little Ethiopian man who had been forced apart from his wife and two little girls, aged four and two, by war atrocities in his country. He lived only for the day that he could be reunited with his family. Then he found that his young wife had lost her life and his children had no parents to guide them. This gentle man filled me with a need to make his dream come true. He had suffered so much but he had never lost hope. He continued to search for his children, even in the most dangerous of circumstances, and he needed help. The most incredible and long journey began—of finding a son who was not known of; of commencing the immigration process for three children and a fourth born in Addis Ababa; of reuniting the children with their father after 14 years and introducing him to his little grandson; of finding out a secret, that he had one more child, who had been born in the village; and of then reuniting him with the mother he had never known. Watching them learn about each other gave me the most amazing satisfaction. The story of this heart-warming journey is a book to some day be written.
Seated in this chamber with my husband, Graeme, who has always supported this special journey, is Feseha Takele. Together, we are the father and mother to Freweni, Tsega, Walta Aman, Aduny and now Abi, who came from Ethiopia last year and was welcomed into our family when he and Freweni married in August last year. Walta could not be here today as he has just returned from his second tour of duty in Afghanistan as an Australian soldier. Thank you for giving us a greater understanding and appreciation of the gift of life.
To my sister, Pam, and her husband, Harley, who are sitting here on the floor today: Pam, you are not just my dearly-loved only sister; you are my deepest and most cherished best friend. Thank you for taking such wonderful care of our mother during her battle with cancer whilst I was so busy doing this job. I will always be indebted to you. There is only one regret in my life here in this House and that is that I did not take leave and spend more time with mum as she fought the hardest battle of all and lost it.
Finally, I offer my gratitude and my deepest love and respect to my husband, Graeme, the long-suffering man who has kept everything afloat whist I have been committed to this role. Thank you for always being my rock and my greatest supporter. We have been a team for 35 years. We have had our children, started our business and worked through some tough times. You have spent many years now without companionship, and I look forward to re-establishing a normal life together, but just for the record: I will not be walking the greyhounds!
To my much-loved sons, Darren, Danny and Brett; their partners, my lovely and beautiful daughters-in-law, Tonie, Anne and Chloe; and my most cherished grandchildren, Nicholas, Joshua, Aaron, Emily and baby Ashton: there is nothing that compares with my pride in and the love I have for you all. Thank you for the unconditional love and support you have all given me over the years. Without your sacrifices and understanding, I could not have managed to commit myself so entirely to my work. I am eternally grateful for your devotion. I thank you for being here with me today and for never, ever leaving me to walk alone in the troubled times.
This chapter in the life of a girl from Guyra is now concluded. Thank you.
—May the member for Riverina, as a true champion of social justice, fulfil all the visions that she has for her life beyond this place.",REPS,<title>FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT AMENDMENT (ANCILLARY BENEFITS) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Gray, Gary, MP",ALP,2010-06-24,"—by leave—I rise to speak again on the Farm Household Support Amendment (Ancillary Benefits) Bill 2010. We get it wrong in agriculture when we fail to take hard, pro-business decisions. So I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the contribution Dr Henry Schapper made to the great agricultural industry of Western Australia through agricultural economics, public policy, farm management and strong business practices in farming. Dr Schapper was an articulate and determined man who lost his battle with illness on 27 April this year. He fought his battle in the same way that he lived: with strength, integrity, courage and a grumpy sense of self-reliance and self-assurance.
Dr Schapper was an extraordinary man often known for his sceptical views, which he put forward in a frank, provocative and compelling manner. He had been a farm labourer, a clerk and a factory hand when at 25 he began studying economics in order to better understand society. This decision paved his future path and led to the significant contribution that he made to agricultural economics.
Dr Henry Schapper introduced agricultural economics to Western Australia in both policy and farm management business accounting. He often incensed the agricultural community with his direct and confrontational manner. In spite of this, he made sure people discussed, thought about and frequently acted upon what he was saying. In the Western Australian wheat belt, success was made through the application of science, chemistry and capital. Farmers went from subsistence to prosperity through science based farming and rational business practices. This made Henry Schapper a household name in the Western Australian wheat belt. Whether the direct and confrontational manner I have referred to was Dr Schapper’s natural style or simply a means of ensuring his logic was heard is for others to determine. It was successful as a tactic because people certainly listened to what he had to say.
We need to remember the message he had: the need for the application of hard, dry, market-driven policy in agriculture. It was largely anathema to postwar agriculture anywhere in the developed world. Subsidised agriculture was then the norm; indeed, in Europe and the United States featherbedding continued to be the mainstay of agricultural policy for decades. Dr Schapper’s logic was neither populist nor particularly welcome in many circles. Dr Schapper had concerns about traditional agricultural extension programs—such as the former Premier Sir Charles Court’s land release policy of a million acres a year—and how such schemes diminished attempts to control land value, salinity and good farm practices. This policy was overturned by Labor in 1983 and has not been restored since.
Henry’s views may have been confronting and somewhat controversial, but they became the basis for building the most competitive agricultural industry in the developed world. There is no doubt that Dr Schapper was a tremendous advocate for the agricultural sector in regional Australia. He played a major part in setting up some of the first farm management groups and mentored them through the Farm Management Foundation to make sure they were effective. Dr Schapper used antiprotectionist thinking, which emerged after the Depression, to communicate with farmers. By bringing modern thinking to Western Australia, he made farmers aware of the importance of managing their affairs.
Dr Schapper was also a champion for Aboriginal development. While undertaking a study of investment in the Kimberley cattle industry, Dr Schapper was aghast at the conditions the Aboriginal people were living in there. He found it ironic that Australian agricultural economists travelled abroad to advise on rural development when one of the most intractable development issues in the world was not being addressed by them at home. It led him to publish Agricultural Advancement to Integration in 1970. He continued to press strongly for Aboriginal development thereafter.
A lecturer at UWA from 1959 until his retirement in 1984, he made an excellent Dean of the Faculty of Agriculture and left a lasting impression on many students, including Professor Mike Ewing, the Deputy Director of the Future Farm Industries CRC; David Morrison of the Department of Treasury and Finance; Dr Ross Kingwell, senior economist with the Department of Agriculture and Food in Western Australia; Dr Brian Martin, a private consultant and former Head of the Division of Marketing and Economics in the Department of Agriculture; Sally Marsh, a research assistant professor at the University of Western Australia; John Salerian, Assistant Commissioner of the Productivity Commission; and, of course, Alan Robson, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Western Australia.
He also made a significant impression on political figures, such as former finance minister Senator Peter Walsh, former agriculture minister John Kerin, former WA agriculture ministers Kim Chance and Julian Grill and former Minister for Forestry and Conservation and later Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government Wilson Tuckey. All have achieved great things.
It is only right to honour his ability to encourage students to think critically for themselves. In 1999 Dr Schapper was recognised when he was awarded a distinguished fellow by the Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society. In April 2006, Dr Schapper’s commitment to agricultural economics earned him a place in the Agricultural Hall of Fame. This is a significant achievement—one we should not overlook. Although always humble about his role, Dr Schapper’s commitment and dedication to the agricultural community and regional Australia was absolutely outstanding. He was an exceptional economist and has left a firm imprint on the farming community and agricultural sector in Western Australia. He has left his mark.
Dr Schapper’s perseverance, courage in life and dedication to the community and his students is inspirational. I am reminded that in the condolences book at Henry’s funeral the following words were written: ‘The only thing that matters is love.’ Derek, Henry’s son, wrote in reply: ‘Why is it that we only receive this late in life?’ My thoughts go to Dr Schapper’s family, including his feisty, assertive and pugnacious daughter-in-law Alannah MacTiernan, the Labor candidate for Canning. He is survived by three children—Kathleen, Paul and Derek—six grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
Dr Schapper’s experience is a reminder to us all that we should evaluate arguments on their merits, listen to alternative views and challenge our own perhaps comfortable traditional positions. Dr Schapper showed through his career that we must be open to new ideas and new ways of thinking. The bill we are debating today is a new way of thinking about exceptional circumstances, EC. It is time that the government reviewed the appropriateness of current arrangements and created a better system—one that Dr Henry Schapper would have been proud of. I hope he would be proud of us today. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT AMENDMENT (ANCILLARY BENEFITS) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Stone, Dr Sharman, MP",LP,2010-06-24,"—I too wish to support the Farm Household Support Amendment (Ancillary Benefits) Bill 2010. It is of critical concern to the coalition that farmers who are in what we have called exceptional circumstances do get some support from state, federal and local governments. After all, if we want to have sustained food security in this country and if we want to be able to go into the supermarket and see fresh and manufactured foods that are grown in our country then we have to make sure that our farmers survive. There are a whole range of reasons why it is more difficult right now to survive, particularly under the Rudd-Gillard Labor government, than before.
There has been a long period when exceptional circumstances have focused on drought relief, particularly in my electorate of Murray. In fact, we have had the worst drought on record. It is continuing now into its 10th year. There is absolutely no doubt that, without the payments from the exceptional circumstances program to thousands of my farm families over that period of time, we would have had a complete collapse of the economy in northern Victoria and more farmers would have exited the business. The economies of scale of dairy production in particular but also livestock and cropping production would have been so reduced without that EC support that our food manufacturing sector would also have collapsed, leading to major losses of jobs in manufacturing, transport and the commercial supports for the food-manufacturing businesses.
We have to get it right in terms of support for the farm sector when faced with circumstances beyond their control. This bill looks at a pilot in Western Australia which is going to assume that the people involved in the pilot are in fact exceptional circumstances designated. They will have offered to them a series of measures. I understand this government will measure the impact of this pilot, which will then direct them in framing special support in the future for farmers who are caught up in difficult circumstances, which might be due to drought, climate change or another desperate circumstance that is beyond their control.
The Western Australian trial will include Farm Family Support with income to help meet basic household expenses. I presume that will echo what is currently happening with the exceptional circumstances payment. There will be Farm Social Support, including better ways to meet mental health issues, counselling and other social needs of farm families and communities. There will be a Building Farm Businesses set of grants of up to $60,000 to help farm businesses prepare for the impacts of drought, reduced water access and changed climate.
We are told there will also be support for on-farm Landcare activities. I am very pleased to see Landcare mentioned there because this government has gutted the funding for Landcare, a most important and significant program for more than 20 years in Australia and one that has kept a lot of our landscape in reasonable condition. It has rehabilitated a lot of landscape. Without additional funding those who are the land carers just simply cannot go on.
There is also support in this trial with Farm Planning, where farmers will be able to undertake training that will help them in their farm businesses in the future. We are told that the training will relate to future challenges. There will be stronger rural communities grants. They will go to local governments, and local governments will then try to ensure their rural communities are more resilient in downturns. There will be Farm Exit Support, with grants up to $170,000 to support farmers who have to leave their properties. There is, we are told, Beyond Farming, a special measure that will put current farmers in touch with previous farmers to help them understand what opportunities there might be outside farming, given they have to exit what they do.
This pilot is, as I say, part of the process of looking at how better we can prepare farm families for the seasonal and other catastrophes that meet them in the future. We are looking forward to a careful evaluation of how this pilot works out on the ground. There are some issues that have not as yet been properly dealt with, unfortunately. One is the guidelines for the Farm Family Support Scheme. We do not yet know what those guidelines are. Clearly they need to be made public and we need to ensure that they are appropriate. We also do not know yet how ‘hardship’ is to be defined. Of course, farmers have to demonstrate they are in hardship in order to access support through this pilot program. How is hardship defined? Is it a measure of income loss? Is it a measure of something else? We need to know what that is, obviously, to be assured that this pilot is going to be on a sound footing.
We commend the pilot and we hope it succeeds. There are serious implications for the future of our nation as we face a whole range of seasonal challenges, but there are other problems as well for the farm sector. I want to talk about those and put to this government the question of how they are to be dealt with if we are going to continue to have Australian grown food on our tables and if our food production is to be secure. It is under threat on so many fronts.
We know that if you have a non-viable farm sector, since the farm community actually manages the environmental services production of this country, your environment itself becomes degraded. By that I mean that a viable farm sector manages water quality, soil quality, biodiversity protection and habitat protection. When a farm is on a sustainable footing there are sufficient funds to put back into fencing out that last remnant of vegetation, for example, or to make sure that the groundwater is properly managed and soil cover is retained so there it is not a blow when it gets into dry conditions. All of that is contingent on the farm being viable. Unfortunately, we have right now a situation where, due to a number of factors, too many farms are becoming or are heavily indebted. Therefore, it is much more difficult for these farms to maintain and sustain the landscape, the natural resources and to produce the environmental services which all of the Australian population—indeed, our society itself—depends on. The connection between the environment and viable farms is of critical and highly significant importance, and I do not think it is understood at all by this government—this new Labor government. I just hope the new Prime Minister begins to understand differently.
We have in Australia a duopoly in the form of the incredible concentration of supermarket ownership. That duopoly squeezes prices to the farm sector for both fresh and manufactured food product. Squeezing those prices and making the margins so slim constantly puts pressure on farmers to survive commercially. We have to look very closely at how to manage better the concentration of ownership and at how to make sure there is not unconscionable action so that farmers—at the bottom of the value chain as the initial suppliers of the goods that end up on our plates—are not the victims of this duopoly. Those supermarkets can so easily reach offshore for alternative product. It is cheaper. If imported product goes into their own generic labels, it is hard for the shopper to distinguish where that product has come from. Is it beetroot from the Balkans or is it beetroot from somewhere in Australia? We need to be able to have the shopper understand exactly where their food is coming from. Unfortunately, because of the confusion of our food labelling laws, too many of our discerning food shoppers—our household buyers—cannot work out just how much of the can or jar of product actually comes from Australia and how much is overseas in origin. We have to do better with our food labelling laws, because unfortunately we are jeopardising the future of Australia’s own food security. That will continue for as long as we do not carefully identify just what is in that product—and in that manufactured product, in particular.
We also have the disastrous Labor government water buyback policy. It comes at a time when we have the worst drought on record and some of the lowest prices for commodities, like milk and cereals, on record. When you combine the disastrous water buyback policy with the commercial pressures, cost-of-production increases and farm family distress, you have disaster. In my electorate of Murray, farmers are in their 10th year of drought. Their banks and other lenders have been patient, but now there are a series of water buy-back tenders and these farmers are being told: ‘You owe us hundreds of thousands of dollars. Your water is worth about that or a little more. Sell your water, get yourself out of debt and we as your lenders will be the happier because you are at the end of your lending possibilities.’
Selling your water in a region which has low natural rainfall is the same as selling your dairy herd. Your means of production are gone. But there is a win-win solution, an alternative, which I am afraid this government refuses to tune into. Why can’t we have a win-win scenario instead of water buybacks from so-called ‘willing sellers’? There is no such thing as a willing seller when you are a young farmer with a dairy herd and with investment of perhaps many hundreds of thousands of dollars in capital for dairy, laser grading and a whole range of other on-farm works and when you have gone through 10 years of drought. There is no hope for you unless you have on-farm water use efficiency support. But what we have at the moment is just buyback.
We keep having groups like the Wentworth group of so-called independent scientists saying, ‘Look, it’s much cheaper to just go into the market and buy the water off these food producers.’ Yes, it is cheaper. You can get that water for about $1,400 a megalitre. But, if you are in fact to have a sustainable food production capacity for this country, you have to have water security. Water security can be a by-product of better environmental security and management as well—for example, if you have on-farm water use efficiency support funding for something like subsurface irrigation or more pressurised irrigation systems. These technologies are not always in place, particularly in horticulture. Where you invest in those measures you have the outcomes of higher production and lower water use, and the water that is saved can be put back into our rivers and streams.
At the moment, this government talks about a hierarchy of need. It has the environment at the top, then critical human need and then under that is the use of water for production—for example, irrigation or tourism. In fact, it is not a hierarchy of need; it is a virtual circle. In relation to the environment and its management, whether it is rivers and streams and/or the landscape itself, that environment depends on viable human communities to manage it. Once you beggar the human communities that have for generations in Australia managed that landscape effectively and constantly improved their practices and drive them out of business, what you have left is degraded farmland—that is, farmland where there is no-one to kill the weeds, destroy the feral animals, maintain the remnant vegetation, manage the soils so that they do not blow away, manage the groundwater systems or manage the surface water systems. If you have impoverished the human communities, they cannot do the environmental service production that I referred to at the beginning of my remarks. But that is what is happening throughout the southern Murray-Darling Basin.
I invite the Minister for Climate Change, Energy Efficiency and Water, Senator Penny Wong, to come and visit northern Victoria at the height of summer and to look at the properties that were once highly productive in dairying, fruits, oil seeds, cropping and livestock. Those communities have been forced to sell their water. The landscape in those communities is now blowing dust and is knee-high in weeds. The remnant vegetation is dying and the Landcare work that was done on roadside and other vegetation is not being maintained because those human communities have been deprived of their means of production and their capacity to sustain their properties and make a reasonable living. Is that what this government actually wanted? Is that what their so-called ‘environmental policy’ was meant to produce—the destruction of human communities, of country towns and of country places?
It was those country places that managed the landscape. If you say: ‘Oh, it’s not a problem. We can bring in the public servants. We’ll just simply pump up the numbers of contractors and people working for the department of sustainability and environment or the department of primary industries. We’ll put all of them out there on the ground to do the work that was once done as part of their farming activity by the land managers, who were farmers. They’ll do the work that should be done to maintain the landscape and the environment.’ They do not do it. There has never yet in the history of Australia been enough resources to put into the public sector to do the sort of environmental service, management and protection that needs to be done.
I am desperately worried about how we can maintain our farming populations when they are under such incredible threat across so many sectors, whether it is the price pressures on the domestic market brought about because of the duopolies and the power of the supermarkets or whether it is because when they export their foods they do so into corrupt world food markets. Everyone knows that the food trade internationally is subject to a whole range of different government interventions. Food trade is often confused with aid, so we have a long-established market that is often corrupted and distorted by dumped product—that is, product that is moved around the world in response to political pressures back home rather than in response to a market that responds to supply and demand.
Too often food sales into our export markets do not give back to the primary producer their costs of production. There is no long-term security for how we go about growing those markets in the face of government interventions in food trade. Then, as I have mentioned, we have problems with food labelling laws in Australia. We have serious issues with the growing costs of production. Even the new mining tax changes that this government wants to bring about will cost our farmers enormously in the inputs to all that they do, including the superphosphates and other fertilisers that are extracted out of the ground. They will get caught up in the mining laws.
Most of all, I am hugely concerned about the new sustainable delivery limits that are about to be announced in the Murray-Darling Basin by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority. They will take more of the water supply that food producers—that is, the farmers—are currently able to access. When those SDLs are announced, we presume in the coming weeks, how will farm family communities survive with even less water and with a government that has no intention of investing in on-farm water use efficiency support?
There was a tiny grant basket offered for on-farm water efficiency by this government. It was not the more than $3 billion that the coalition offered for the Murray-Darling Basin, but a tiny basket of grant moneys was made available recently by the minister, Penny Wong. Then she put all these caveats over what that money could be used for. In my electorate, for example, where we know sub-surface irrigation has major potential as a way to reduce water use but increase productivity, we were told that was not allowed to be one of the ways that such a grant could be used. We were also told that the use of things like overhead sprinklers—big centrifugal sprinklers—would also not be allowed. Who decided what technology was appropriate? It was clearly not anybody who understood anything about what works best in my part of the world.
We have nonsense coming out of this federal government on the risks that farmers now face and how they are best supported. We support this trial in Western Australia to work out how best to assist farms, farm communities and their local governments to survive disasters which are beyond an individual or community’s control. We have to do much better. Let us hope that, when this trial is completed, it is looked at with eyes that are better informed and there are better motives than this government has shown in relation to the Murray-Darling Basin. That goes for its water buyback schemes, its cutting back on Landcare funding and its cutting back on regional development support—in all shapes and forms. I can tell you that, where I come from in rural and regional Australia, my communities are in despair. They wonder why it is that they are overlooked— (Time expired)
",REPS,<title>FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT AMENDMENT (ANCILLARY BENEFITS) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Katter, Bob, MP",IND,2010-06-24,"—I rise to speak on the Farm Household Support Amendment (Ancillary Benefits) Bill 2010. The events of the last 24 hours should bring home with a vengeance to the politicians in this parliament and the members of parliament—and I think they are two different things—that the people of Australia really have had enough. The people of Australia watched this place completely destroy manufacturing industries. The policies of this parliament destroyed manufacturing in this country. When Mr Keating spoke about free trade, I thought: ‘Is the man completely mad? Does he think that we are going to work for Asian Third World wages? Or are we going to close down the industries?’ There was no in-between there. I did not think for one moment that he had countenanced that the industries would be closed down. But, since he must have known they were being closed down and he never changed his policies, he decided that we would not have any manufacturing industries in this country.
We then moved on to the next government, the Howard government. Whilst great destruction had been wreaked by Keating, it continued for the next 12 years under the coalition government. It amuses me no end to see people from the National Party—not that there is much left of it. There are only four members from New South Wales and two from Victoria in this place. The others are members of the Liberal Party. Their leader is a member of the division of the Liberal Party and I think it is about time the House sorted out that problem as well.
We went into a second phase when agriculture was completely shattered. It was shattered initially by Mr Keating in the wool industry. Few people realise that in 1990—not ancient history—wool was earning more for this country than the golden coal industry. Wool was a bigger export earner than coal. What has happened to it? It has vanished. It does not get a mention in the top 15 export items. Mr Keating decided to deregulate it. Whilst I very much respect the wisdom and wit of the honourable member for O’Connor from Western Australia—and I read with interest his speech on this bill—I was sorry for his speech because he mentioned the wheat industry but he completely failed to mention the wool industry.
I was very much aware of the collapse of the wool industry back in the late sixties and arguably the early seventies. I thought there was absolutely no hope for wool. That very great Australian Doug Anthony introduced the wool scheme. Having had somewhat of a university education, I said: ‘Supply and demand will determine price. You cannot really get around that.’ I said that the next year when the price rose 30 or 40 per cent and I said that the next year when the price rose 30 or 40 per cent, and after five years of watching the price rise I sort of forgot about what I had been taught at university. It was quite clear to me that collective aggressive marketing policies would dramatically increase the return that you received for a product. Orderly marketing schemes—as they are sometimes called—or statutory marketing schemes were needed if we were going to prosper.
The great Jack McEwen—one of the finest and greatest men to ever set foot into this parliament—said, ‘It was one of my proudest boasts that when I left the federal parliament every single industry was under statutory marketing arrangements.’ In fact, he was wrong. The wool and cattle industries were not. Doug Anthony, in the teeth of opposition from graziers, introduced the scheme. For the next 20 years we had continuing prosperity in this industry. It was not a great prosperity; a lot of people said, ‘You precipitated a great growth in numbers.’ There was never any great growth in numbers. The wool numbers never moved up dramatically. They moved up significantly, but most certainly not dramatically, so that effect did not occur. It is false to say that it did.
The price doubled over the next three years after the regulatory marketing scheme was introduced. We had this marvellous scheme for 20 years. Mr Keating deregulated the scheme and—surprise, surprise—within three years the price had dropped clean in half. I was corrected the other day when I said that there has been a 40 per cent drop in sheep numbers. A person shouted out that there has been a 60 per cent reduction. There is no doubt that the sheep industry’s numbers have dropped clean in half.
From then on we saw, sadly, the Howard government—which I was part of, initially—deregulate all the other industries: eggs, maize, tobacco, fishing and sugar. All of them were deregulated. You would have thought, after the enormous destruction of manufacturing and the complete collapse of the wool industry under deregulation, that someone in here would have said: ‘Hold on a minute, fellas. This ain’t such a good idea. This is working out really badly.’ There was a most wonderful cartoon which I thought epitomised the era magnificently well. It showed Mr Keating reading a book on the Japanese economy and saying: ‘They’re doomed to failure. It works in practice but it’ll never work in theory.’ I thought, ‘That says it all.’
I watched the wipe-out of the maize industry. We buried a hero son from the Atherton Tablelands who lost his life in Afghanistan. The great landmark and icon of Atherton were the grain silos. It was a huge maize-growing area for the dairy industry. We did not need it, of course, because now we have hardly any dairy industry left. We have gone from 240 farmers under deregulation down to 60 farmers. There is no sense of responsibility in this place. There is no sense of failure. There is no admission of being wrong. In the dramatic events of the past 24 hours it was interesting to see that the Australian people have had enough. They have had the two-party system telling them that this is going to be wonderful. They watched the annihilation of the manufacturing industry and then they watched the slow and agonising death of agriculture in this country.
I will be very specific. I have not checked on the wool figures recently, but I am told that they are down 60 per cent. Sheep numbers in Australia have most certainly fallen by half and they will not come back. Cattle numbers are down 20 to 25 per cent. The sugar industry is closing six mills every 10 years. We have only 23 mills to go, and then it will all be gone—wrapped up. This industry has been among the top 10 export earners for this country—minerals, coal and everything thrown in—for the nation’s entire history. The sugar industry was the industry that dragged us out of the Great Depression. It employs 50,000 people and it was shattered and wrecked by the removal of tariffs. It is a great idea to remove tariffs if other people are doing it; it is a really dumb idea if nobody else is doing it. Of course, we fit into the really dumb class.
Just to give you some idea, last time I looked at the figures, a few years ago now, the Europeans were getting $1,000 a tonne for their sugar, the Americans were getting $660 a tonne for their sugar and the Australians were getting the world price of $270 a tonne for their sugar. The Brazilians admitted in the WTO that there was a $2,000 million a year subsidy to their industry via the ethanol industry. In fairness to them, they had done as much to clean up the pollution and to help people dying of lung disease in Sao Paulo as they had done to help their farmers and to provide themselves with a safe source of petrol. They did not have to rely on outsiders.
Having said all those things, government is here to help, to ensure that our industries win. Government is not a spectator sport. Yes, risks have to be taken. Doug Anthony placed his entire political career and income for his family upon his judgment that he was right in introducing that wool scheme. I, for one, did not think he was right at the time, but I admired the man and I went along with him in loyalty to a party that had served us greatly and well in rural Australia. He proved to be dead right and I became a very enthusiastic supporter of the sorts of philosophies and policies that were expounded in this place by Jack McEwen and then later by Doug Anthony. They made us one of the most successful and aggressive farming nations on earth.
Where are we today in farming? We are a joke. The wool industry has almost ceased to exist. The cattle industry is currently collapsing. The dairy industry, which is the next biggest industry, is down by 15 per cent, which quite amazes me—I would have thought that people still have to drink milk. The loss of the manufacturing sector is so huge that it has dragged down the overall demand for dairy throughout Australia. The fifth giant industry that we have is the sugar industry, and, as I said, we are closing six mills every 10 years and have only 20-odd mills to go before we have no industry at all. This is something to be proud of! Australian governments over the past 30 years have had great achievements: they have wiped out manufacturing and destroyed farming! But, over the past two months, the Australian people have jacked up; they have had enough. When this place was going to put the king hit on mining, they said: ‘No. We’ve had enough of your stupidity and your stupid two-party system, where you agree with each other on your stupidities. You’ve wrecked every industry in the country, but you’re not going to wreck mining.’ And we have seen the events of the past 24 hours.
It appears that people in this place could not care less about their country. They could not care less that in this nation a farmer commits suicide every four days. Is that something to be proud of as a race of people—that every four days a farmer in your country commits suicide? I unfortunately have the indignity of presiding over two of the towns with the highest suicide rate in Australia, both of them in the heartland of the dairy industry—or what was once the dairy industry area. It was wrecked by this place.
I will illustrate your incredible stupidity. There are a million people—five per cent of the Australian population—living in North Queensland. Their milk is now being sent down to southern Queensland—because they have access to Woolworths and Coles—and southern milk is being transported to North Queensland. They wave to each other as the milk trains go past and say: ‘Hello, fellows. How are you going?’ So now we are carting milk 2,000 kilometres south and 2,000 kilometres north—4,000 kilometres the milk is being carted, whereas before it was being carted 100 or 200 kilometres at the outside. And five per cent of the nation are being serviced this way. That is so very clever! Is it any wonder that the people of Australia hate politicians? When I go into a bar, the last thing I own up to, if they do not know who I am, is to being a politician, I can assure you.
We have taken away the EC and I would agree with the remarks of the member for O’Connor when he says there is probably a better way to deal with exceptional circumstances than the way we have been dealing with them to date. In the last floods, the people who stood on their hind legs and fought to get government assistance to rescue the industry of the frontier of Australia—the Gulf Country of Australia, our frontier—were not just fighting for themselves. A number of them could sell up and retire as very wealthy people. They include Ian and Ellen Martin; Mick, Nola and Troy Gallagher and Ashley, who was also mayor of Normanton; Paul Edwards at Delta Downs; another mayor of North Queensland in Fred Pascoe; Luke and Helen Symons; the Secombes, a pioneering family of Central Queensland and now a pioneering family of the Gulf Country; Noelene Gross, a tenacious little fighter who has earned the great admiration of everybody who has come into contact with her; and John Nelson, my good friend, one of the most successful cattlemen in the country and one of the most successful businessmen in North Queensland, and his dynamic daughter, Sarah, who was a real tiger in the battle over the flooding devastation in North Queensland—her wonderful work brought it home to every single person in Australia and we pay great tribute to her.
We also thank the Minister for Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries for having an enlightened attitude towards our situation. People said: ‘It is for droughts. Have you got a drought?’ Yes, we had a drought that was created by flood. It killed all of the grass, so we had no grass for the cattle to eat. If that is not a drought, I do not know what is. We thank the minister, because we think his aggression on this matter helped us get agreement out of the state government, which was very critical. I also thank the state minister. At first he was recalcitrant, but I think he found his conscience and God bless him for doing so. We thank those people.
We set up a state bank in Queensland. People think that we troglodyte people who live in the past, those of us from the old Country Party, are a bunch of hick numbskulls. Yes, we were the hick numbskulls that created the greatest agricultural nation on earth. That is what we created. What the hell did you do? You destroyed it, all you clever people in here.
 (Mr S Sidebottom)—No, I did not destroy it. Please speak through the chair.
—Yes, Deputy Speaker Sidebottom. I speak to the Parliament of Australia in saying this and I do not apologise for my remarks—far from it. On almost a weekly or monthly basis at the very least, I have to sit and watch people I know in North Queensland committing suicide thanks to the decisions of this place. If I speak with great passion and anger, it is because I feel great passion and anger.
I conclude by saying that we were a Queensland government of business people—people who had backed our judgment with our own money and who had dirt under our fingernails. We had not asked other people to do the work for us; we had done it ourselves. We had lived in the mustering camps; we had worked down the mines; we had cut cane by hand. Of the cabinet ministers, 13 had cut cane by hand. Those were the sorts of people who  manned the cabinet in Queensland.
We decided that we could do a lot better by having our own bank—one that would look after our people. We conceived of this bank to help people, but it was the government of Queensland that it helped most. We made a huge amount of money out of it. We laugh at all the great free marketeers. Unfortunately, the party lost its way. It was actually the National Party that sold the bank and they made a thousand million dollars out of it. Bill Gunn and I were made responsible to cabinet for that bank. It pulled 25 per cent of the sugar industry through. In this place a lot of people dragged up the fact that I had been personally responsible for sacking the head when we were turning it into a bank. Yes, I had been. He said: ‘Bob, we are men of the world. Thirty per cent of the sugar industry has to go.’ I said: ‘Listen, Graham, the price of sugar goes up and down like a yo-yo, you imbecile. I will bring you down the graphs.’ I did not say ‘imbecile’. I was more restrained in those days. I took him down graphs of beef industry prices, wool industry prices and sugar industry prices. They go up and down, but what happens to us in agriculture is that, when the price goes up, it is truncated by taxation. When the price goes down, the banks add on, add on, add on. The interest rate was 17 per cent. In my last year in St Francis, we paid 29 per cent—an extra 2½ per cent because we were an at-risk industry, an extra three per cent because we were in an at-risk area and another three per cent because we were in drought. By the time you added it all up, we were paying 29 per cent and that is how we overcame the development bank. (Time expired)

—Before calling the member for Hughes, I understand it is the wish of the House that she not be interrupted by points of order. I call the member for Hughes.",REPS,<title>FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT AMENDMENT (ANCILLARY BENEFITS) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Vale, Danna, MP",LP,2010-06-24,"—I had great difficulty starting this speech. How do you distil 14 years into 20 minutes? There is a lot to tell, a lot of successes, a few monumental stuff-ups, a lot of memories and a lot of good people to thank, including the 97,000 people in the electorate of Hughes. In a way, this valedictory is a companion to the first speech I made in this House as a member of the ‘Class of 96’. As bookends they will provide my constituents, my family, my friends and supporters, indeed all the people of Australia, with a measure by which they can judge if I have discharged the awesome responsibility and been worthy of the hope and trust they placed in me back in 1996.
The road to Canberra was hard and long, but it was not a lonely road. There were many good people who began the walk with me and without whose support and assistance I would not have been able to serve as the member for Hughes during the golden years of the Howard coalition government. We should never forget that the real reason the Australian economy is doing so well today is the tough decisions made by the Howard government and that Costello legislation that imposed the strong prudential rules that underpin our banking here in Australia. I was proud to be on team Howard during those challenging years.
Women often define themselves and their place in the world by their relationships. So, firstly, I acknowledge my long-suffering husband, Bob, for his love and his friendship and his longstanding support. Before the journey began, I did seek his permission and I did ask him what he thought about me standing as the member for Hughes. Actually, I knew what he thought. It was a safe Labor seat, I was going against a minister of the Crown, I needed a 6½ per cent swing, I was an unknown working mum: I had no chance. But he said, ‘You go for it, love. You know I’ll support you.’ Much to his astonishment, we did win the election in 1996 and we won with a swing of 11.6 per cent. His world has never been the same since. But he has been true to his word. Despite the fact that he has often said, ‘I married her for better or for worse; she never said a word about politics at the time,’ he has been there to support me in the good times and in the tough times and I am grateful for his love and affection and for the fine character of the man that he is.
The role of a federal member of parliament and its impact on time and distance places a lot of pressure on relationships. Of the 39 members of that unique Class of 96, there are not very many of us left who are still married to the same person. There were times when I wondered if Bob and I would be one of those casualties. Yet, in so many ways, we have grown stronger for the journey. As we go towards our 45th anniversary, it is now my turn to honour him and to start cooking those home baked dinners that he has missed so much. After all, he is the only husband I have and I plan to make him last!
I also acknowledge the strong relationship that I have had with my local branch members of the Liberal Party and I publicly record the high value I place on the friendship I share with all members of the Hughes Federal Electoral Council. They began their journey with me and, with their hard work and commitment on election day, made the success possible. While I cannot name each and every one, my special thanks do go to Brett Thomas, who took the onerous role of campaign manager back in 1995 and has remained at the helm for the following four elections and is a good mate. My special thanks also go to the Hon. Chris Downy, once the state member for Sutherland, whose political nous and strategic devilry make him a great campaign director. Thanks to our generals in the field: core stalwarts like Lee Evans and his late dad, Keith; Gary and Julie Law; Peter Vermeer; Coral Slattery; Berenice Nixon; Don Minehan and his son Matthew; Michael Darby; Simon Newport, who is also doing a sterling job as our FEC president; Bob Osborne; Kristine Thomas; Pat White; Max Lombe; Councillors Ned Mannoun and Melanie Gibbons; and special friend Michael Henry. Dear friends Bill Meehan and his son Luke must be added also to that list. Bill efficiently managed my electorate office for me for over eight years. When I first met Bill, his son Luke was only seven, but he would always come along with his dad on the campaign. At the last election Luke captained his own booth for us. Like so many friends and supporters, young Luke has been with us every step of the way.
Warm thanks also go to my branch president, Lorraine Rodden, and branch treasurer, Val Wilkinson, for their commitment and treasured friendship formed over many years. I found Lorraine to be a formidable woman of substance when, as mayor of Sutherland Shire Council, she stood with me to fight against the Holsworthy airport proposal on behalf of our local community. We have been firm friends ever since. Also on the team in another way were our faithful supporters, who have contributed in so many ways to the success of our campaign. I say thanks to the Britton boys, Bob and Steve; to the laughing Brett Thompson; to Ron Stapleton; to John Emond; to my late friend Max Vidler and his family; and to my old boss, solicitor Mr Sam Macedone and his wife, Margaret.
Special thanks must also go to my electorate staff over the years who have helped me to serve the people of our electorate. Thanks to our blonde bombshell, Ros Bowker, who has been with me for nearly 12 years and who is in the gallery today. Thanks Marc Landrigan, Britt Keneally, Alan Hornery, Aarron Findlay and workers Rita Leghissa, Neville Ashdown and Michelle Cotterrill.
Since 1996 the electorate has had four boundary changes, yet the well-honed Hughes campaign team secured the success of all our campaigns in 1998, 2001, 2004 and 2007. In the 1998 election Hughes was the only seat in Australia that recorded a swing to the Howard coalition government. In 2001 we won every one of our 47 booths. The Hughes campaign team deserves to be applauded. I would not be here without them.
I acknowledge with humble thanks the reason that I am here: the special relationship that I have with the people of my electorate. I spent eight months doorknocking the electorate before the 1996 election. Because we did not have any money, Bob paid for a small business card out of our family budget that I left with residents. Written on the back was an old Chinese proverb which encapsulated my values and which has been on the back of my cards ever since. I also promised the residents of Hughes that I would be their public voice in Canberra. At the time I did not realise how soon that promise would need to be delivered.
In the early days of the Howard government a second airport for Sydney was proposed for Holsworthy in my electorate. My very first speech in the party room was a declaration of war. Some colleagues here may still remember. Not long after, I was grateful for a telephone call from the legendary Peter Reith who advised, ‘You stick to your constituents, Danna, and they will stick by you.’ There are no instruction books on how to be a parliamentarian and as a brand-new member with training wheels I was greatly encouraged by the kindness of this senior cabinet minister. His sage advice proved to be true. I have stuck by the people of my electorate and they have stuck by me. Together we were ultimately successful in our community campaign against the Holsworthy airport. It provided valuable lessons and I met so many people from all corners of the electorate.
It is the pastoral nature of the role of a member of parliament in caring for and supporting the people in the electorate that has given me great satisfaction. While I cannot change the world, I learnt that I could change the world for one person and I did many times. The people of Hughes are well-educated, articulate, very community minded and they know how to press a cause. We had many successes and in the finite space available I would like to mention only two.
Local parents, Senia Gaunson and Brad le Hay of the Moorebank junior cricket club made representations to me about the need for a new cricket field some years ago. Working together we eventually gained a new playing field for the Moorebank Sports Club located near Harris Creek. I was able to secure excess defence land and a sum of $750,000 from the government for its development. Known as Kokoda Field, it has now been in use for almost two years and is being put to excellent use by our local junior cricket and AFL teams.
Another successful effort began when working with passionate local resident Judie Stevens to amend the tax act to allow accident victims to take a compensation payment as a structured settlement without attracting a tax liability. After a very tragic motor vehicle accident involving her family, Judie saw the urgent need for such an amendment and it was a great outcome for Judie and a great satisfaction to me to see the Taxation Laws Amendment (Structured Settlements and Structured Orders) Act 2002 become law for the benefit of many of our fellow Australians.
There were other less public efforts made on behalf of the people of my electorate which I saw as my clear responsibility. One was to put a stop to a cabinet discussion to put a nuclear waste reprocessing plant at Lucas Heights in my electorate. For the record, I found that Prime Minister John Howard was always available to speak with his backbench and often I was able to use such access for the benefit of the people of my electorate. One such private, frank and forthright discussion, as they say, was in regard to an idea before cabinet to put a nuclear waste reprocessing plant in my electorate at Lucas Heights. Prime Minister Howard finally saw it my way and I had a great sense of relief when the suggestion was dropped.
ARPANSA was another matter. It stands for Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency and, depending on your point of view, I will either take the blame or the credit for its existence. With the prospect of a new reactor at Lucas Heights to replace the ageing HIFAR reactor, I convinced Prime Minister Howard that, following world’s best practice, it was high time Australia had its own independent nuclear oversight agency. While I do thank the then minister for health, the honourable Dr Michael Wooldridge, for his efforts in this regard, I make no apology for my harassment of him in pursuing the progress of the legislation. I was a woman on a mission and was immensely satisfied when the mission was finally accomplished and the enabling legislation was passed in 1998. The establishment of this independent nuclear oversight agency was essential, not just for the people of my electorate, but also for Australia. I also acknowledge the fine work of the first CEO of ARPANSA, Dr John Loy, and thank him for establishing the excellent reputation for which this institution has since been renowned.
Australia is a gold-clad democracy; it is the finest in the world. The reach of our backbench can stretch into the cabinet room and can provide members in this place with a real opportunity to make real changes for the benefit of the people we represent. Sometimes, however, an issue might arise which is not about your electorate but is one about which one feels very deeply and may drive one to consider committing political harikari for a higher cause. For me, one such defining issue was that of mandatory sentencing in the Northern Territory in 1998. Prior to coming to parliament, I had been a Children’s Court duty solicitor and was the founding coordinator of the Sutherland Community Aid Panel for First Offenders. Those Northern Territory mandatory sentencing laws were an anathema to me. Amongst other things, they dealt with 17-year-olds as adults and sent them to adult prison on their very first offence. I thought, ‘Not in my country they don’t.’ The issue ran hot in the media for weeks and my colleague, the member for Murray, Sharman Stone, may remember being with me on that Tuesday morning. The then Prime Minister had suspended the party room.
A private member’s bill on topic by the late Peter Andren, the member for Calare, was to come before the House the following Monday and that morning three of us in the party room had indicated we would reserve our right. That morning, I asked Prime Minister Howard and Treasurer Peter Costello for funding for diversionary programs for the Territory, for a juvenile court protocol, for funding for interpreter services, to raise the age of majority to 18 years, to hold a review of the initiative in 12 months’ time and, not very humbly, to appoint me on the committee to oversee the program—then I would not need to cross the floor.
I take this time to record my respect and admiration for two of my fellow members, who I found to be men of outstanding principle and commitment on this issue. They appeared to share my outrage and I name them. They were the member for Kooyong, Petro Georgiou, and the then member for Astin, the late Peter Nugent. I was grateful that they were both prepared to support this solution, which secured $20 million over the next four years, to implement these initiatives for the young people in the Territory, and this was later repeated for a second four-year period. Speaking for myself, I thought I had committed political harikari that day. I did learn a lot about political leverage though and I learnt a lot about the character of the good people with whom I was privileged to work in this House.
In the end, we three did get a good result and it did change the world for the young people in the Territory. To that end, I also acknowledge the fine efforts of Ms Jane Halton, who was then of PM&C, and Police Inspector Graham Waite, an officer of first rank with the Northern Territory Police Force, who is here with me today in the gallery. Both were charged to ensure the delivery of the initiatives and the diversionary programs and both were committed to exemplary outcomes.
After this, it was a bit of a shock to receive a telephone call from the Prime Minister in 2001 inviting me to be the new Minister for Veterans’ Affairs and Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence. I recall I was painting the front bedroom at the time and I fell off the ladder.
To me, this ministry was a sacred responsibility and in my role as minister I was exceptionally well served by the highly professional people in my ministerial office. Thank you to Paul Evans, a sound political and strategic thinker who worked tirelessly as my first chief of staff; to advisers Ben Hayes and Eacham Curry and to the diligent Jo Hutchinson; to my first media adviser, the excellent Rachel Thompson, and latterly, the efficient Clare Bannon. Thanks also to my last Chief of Staff, the venerable Warwick Bracken, valued not only for his sagacious advice but also for his treasured friendship and that of his wife, Fay, ever since. They all put in long hours and worked very hard to ensure I had an efficient and effective team—and as a team they did their best to keep me out of trouble as their minister. However, because I often managed to thwart their best efforts, I confess here for the record that any stuff-ups were mine.
I was deeply aware of the profound privilege to serve our veteran and war widow community as minister. Like many Australians, my own family was touched by war. I was the granddaughter of a digger whose name is on the Menin Gate. Private Donald Peter Dempsey died at Ypres, in the third battle of Passchendaele in October 1917. I thank John Howard for one of the defining moments of my life when, as Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, I was able to represent Australia at the Menin Gate on Anzac Day in 2003. My grandfather’s name on the gate was marked with a flower, from Passchendaele, by the good people of Ypres—I am not really crying, Mr Speaker. That day is indelibly etched upon my soul and will remain there for my eternity. After the Great War, my grandmother raised my mother in great hardship. There was no welfare then. There was no Legacy, because it did not exist in those early days.
As minister, it was satisfying to know that we were able to deliver in real terms to increase and enhance the service in support of our veterans and war widows, because this community so richly deserved it. During my watch, from 2001 to 2004, the budget for this portfolio increased from around $6 billion to $10 billion. In an initial response to the Clarke Review of Veterans’ entitlements, we increased services and benefits by almost $280 million. My appreciation and thanks must go to my friend the member for Gilmore, the indomitable Joanna Gash, and to the very able member for Dunkley, Bruce Billson, for their strong support and advocacy.
I had the benefit of the best professional support from executive teams of both the Department of Veterans’ Affairs and the Department of Defence. As other members have found, it is an edifying experience to work with our defence personnel. To work with officers of the calibre of General Peter Cosgrove, then Chief of Defence Force; Lieutenant General Peter Leahy, then Chief of Army; Air Marshal Angus Houston, then Chief of Air Force and now CDF, is to name only a few—it is to work with Australia’s finest, but I could name any private. We have all been inspired by their shining integrity, their disciplined focus, their strong work ethic and, when appropriate, a larrikin camaraderie. Such values are legendary in our defence personnel and one is left ennobled by the experience of exposure.
A similar ethos operated at Veterans’ Affairs and I was extremely fortunate to have been so ably served by Dr Neil Johnson as secretary of the department. Thoughtful and measured, his quiet presence reflected the authority of an exemplary public servant at the top of his game. Together with his tough-minded deputy, the forensic Ian Campbell, and two excellent repatriation commissioners, Major General Paul Stevens and later Rear Admiral Simon Harrington, they were the Repatriation Commission and they presented a formidable team. I also acknowledge with great respect and regard the remarkable Brigadier Bill Rolf, Chair of the Repatriation Tribunal. Also, I applaud the excellent efforts of the intrepid Air Vice Marshal Garry Beck, then Director of Australian War Graves, who created an Australian legend in London. He tackled the impossible and built a unique war memorial for Australian service men and women at Hyde Park Corner in London in less than 11 months from design concept to completion, despite the distance of over 13,000 kilometres. Her Majesty was to officiate at its opening with our Prime Minister on the morning of Remembrance Day 2003. The landscaping of the memorial was completed at midnight on 10 November 2003. His success in meeting the full completion of his warrant on time is testament to his immense executive ability, and I publicly acknowledge his excellent effort.
One other significant memorial built on my watch, by Air Vice Marshal Beck, and one in which I took a personal interest, is the elegant but powerful memorial at Isurava on the Kokoda Track, which literally sets in stone the legends of the ANZACs that forged the foundation of our nationhood. Etched in gold on four mighty granite pillars are these words: courage, endurance, sacrifice and mateship. They stand framed by the beautiful Kokoda Valley in the background. I thank my friend and colleague Bronwyn Bishop, who walked on the Kokoda Track and was there for the opening of that memorial.
The most important area of responsibility in the portfolio is the care of our serving personnel and their families. I was pleased to see the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act come into law in 2004. This benchmark legislation was framed and passed on my watch and set in place the most comprehensive changes in military compensation legislation in nearly two decades. Its drafting meant tough, long hours for Dr Johnson, Ian Campbell and Paul Stevens and those DVA officials who had the complex task of melding two pieces of earlier legislation—drafted for different purposes—the VEA and the SRCA. While I congratulate all departmental officers involved, special recognition must go to the principal officers for the intellectual rigor they each brought to the table. I also thank Arthur Edgar, Andrew Moorhead and Bill Maxwell from the Department of Veterans’ Affairs and Mal Pierce from the Department of Defence. This military-specific legislation makes realistic provision for the widows and families of our defence personnel and it was long overdue—it benchmarks the world.
In the rarefied atmosphere that marks this place there are many fellow members who I have come to respect and admire for the values and other worthy attributes that they bring to this place. I feel a better person for having worked with them. I have been warned not to name anyone if I cannot name them all. But I do need to recognise one or two, because I have worked in close association with them for some purpose or another. I want to recognise the admirable Brendan Nelson, the best Prime Minister we never had, and Kerry Bartlett, Kay Elson and Gary Nairn, who have gone before. I will miss you, Joanna Gash, Margaret May, John Forrest, Kay Hull, Judy Moylan, Andrew Robb, Russell Broadbent, Nola Marino, Don Randall, Dennis Jensen and Alex Somlyay. From the other place, I will miss senators Nick Minchin, Ian Macdonald, Cory Bernardi, Gary Humphries and Marise Payne. It was great to serve with you here in Parliament House in our great Liberal Party and I regret that I will not be here with you fighting the good fight next time. And we do have a winning chance next time.
The House standing committees are very much part of the real nuts and bolts of parliament and are very rewarding. Many of our members recognise this. I have found goodwill and sound cooperation across party lines as committee members work together at meetings and public hearings and I thank the secretariat, led by the excellent Anna Dacre and her team, who make the work appear easy. It has been rewarding to work as deputy to the chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, Michael Danby. I thank him and all the dedicated members of that committee. It is good to know that some of our recommendations have already become law, which just goes to show how effective committees can be at addressing issues of concern to the wider Australian community.
I also acknowledge the chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Bob Debus, and the earlier chair, Richard Marles. I hope that we get to finish our important report on Indigenous juvenile justice, in which I am passionately interested. At public hearings across Australia committee members meet fellow Australians at the delivery end of the legislation that we create here in this place. Sometimes we come across some good success stories. Back in 2006, this ATSI committee, chaired by Barry Wakelin, then member for Grey, we discovered the Cairns and District Regional Housing Corporation under CEO Jack Szydzik and his board of Indigenous traditional owners, who not only provided quality housing for local Indigenous families but had an Indigenous employment component on their maintenance teams of around 70 per cent. That is not bad when the national average for Indigenous employment was two per cent. It is hard to argue with audited success, but this corporation, which operates under sound business principles and world’s best practice, cannot even get an appointment with the minister. One has to ask why not.
Regrets, I have a few. I regret that I could not do anything about bad government industries, especially those related to Indigenous issues and the methadone program, which I believe is a program that uses a dirty, synthetic, addictive opioid that kills people. But they are battles for another time in another place.
Mr Speaker, thank you for being the Speaker. Thank you, too, to all your staff here in Parliament House. I know that I have had the benefit and privilege of working with you on parliamentary standing committees. I also thank the Clerks, Ian Harris and Bernard Wright; the House attendants; the security officers; and especially our Comcar drivers. In one way or another, they have all looked after me since I arrived.
The future offers an unknown adventure but I surrender to ‘the Greater Destiny’ which shapes all our ends because I leave this place with a spirit that has been forged to a higher tensile strength by the unique pressures of the role. I thank the worthy John Miller, Jock Cameron, our Parliamentary Chaplain Peter Rose and other spiritual leaders for their stewardship and good counsel when I found myself on the edge of the political plank, which seemed to happen often. If I fell, I was aware that the media were ready to publicly disembowel me. You have to know who you are when you come to this place and what values you fly by. Otherwise, you do not fly at all. The reasons I stood against embryonic stem cell testing, abortion drugs and pornography are well documented in Hansard for the world to see. They are an extension of my Christian faith and my values.
Mr Speaker, for the record I would like to share with you and the House the Chinese proverb of which I spoke which is on the back of my card:
Where there is light in the soul,

I wish all my colleagues every good success at the next election. Tony Abbott is prime minister material. He is a man of principle, of soul and of great intellectual velocity and I wish him and the team the success that they deserve in the election. We have a good chance to win in Hughes with our Liberal candidate, local resident and local businessman Craig Kelly. I will be working with Craig to ensure that we continue to have a Liberal member for Hughes.
I hope to continue to make a contribution to my community. But the immediate future belongs to the long-suffering Bob. We will earn our stripes as grandparents and learn to be enchanted by the wonderful grandchildren that our fine sons and their wives—our Robert and Belinda; Christopher and Suzanna; Matthew and Sonja, and Alexander and Melanie—have presented to us. I say to my children: you are the only glory that I ever wanted and I love you so much. And I love you, too, Bob; I love you, darling. I know that these last fourteen years have not been easy for you. Thank you for saving the last dance for me.
God bless you all, and God bless Australia.
—I wish the member for Hughes continuing happiness with family and friends beyond this place.

"Combet, Greg, MP",ALP,2010-06-24,"—I move:
That the amendments be agreed to.
Firstly I thank the opposition for ensuring the opportunity to deal with the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2010 at this point in time. I indicate to the House that the government proposes that all amendments agreed to by the Senate be agreed to here. I will briefly explain the implications of what the government proposes in this respect.
The Senate has returned to the House the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2010 with a series of amendments, as we have heard. The government moved a number of those amendments in the Senate and will obviously be accepting them in this place. The government amendments firstly provide a contingent arrangement whereby the large-scale renewable energy target annual targets can be adjusted should the stock of renewable energy certificates, which are known as RECs, exceed 20 million as at 31 December 2010 net of the February 2011 surrender amount and voluntarily surrendered RECs. Secondly, the amendments strengthen the process for review of the $40 price for RECs in the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme to ensure the price remains appropriate over time. Finally, the amendments provide flexibility to deal with changes in the cost of solar panels by enabling the Renewable Energy Regulator to adjust the solar credits multiplier to ensure that it remains well targeted. I indicate to members opposite that these amendments were all agreed to in the Senate when they were debated there and I trust that assists in the consideration of the issues by the opposition in this place.
A number of amendments were also moved by the opposition in the Senate, along with amendments by the Australian Greens and Senator Xenophon. I will indicate now that, in order to ensure the swift passage of this bill, the government will also be accepting these amendments in the House. These amendments include the following provisions: to exclude air sourced heat pumps of over 425 litres capacity from the ability to create renewable energy certificates; to allow for exemptions in respect of emissions-intensive trade-exposed activities for the costs associated with the first 9,500 gigawatt hours of the RET where the price of the renewable energy certificates exceeds $40, which I think was an amendment moved in the Senate by the opposition; to provide a definition of air sourced heat pumps and require the Renewable Energy Regulator to specify on the register of small-scale technology certificates whether each certificate was created for a solar water heater, air sourced heat pump or small generation unit; to enable the minister to prescribe by legislative instrument that an emerging renewable energy technology is to be included in the Renewable Energy Target Scheme; to provide for a review of the scheme every two years, commencing from 30 June 2012; to establish a scheme to inspect small generation unit installations for compliance with Australian standards and other requirements relevant to the creation of RECs; to allow for regulations to be made to specify what multiplier applies under the solar credits regime for systems up to three kilowatts in size up to the level specified in the act; and to increase the capacity limit for which the solar credits multiplier applies in relation to off-grid small generation units up to 20 kilowatts subject to an annual cap on the total number of certificates. That is a concise summation of the amendments that were carried in the Senate. For the assistance of the member for Flinders, the shadow minister who has carriage of this issue in the House on this occasion, they include all of the amendments that were carried by the Senate.
In conclusion, the bill before us today will support the deployment of both major renewable energy projects and household-scale renewable energy systems. The renewable energy target is a key measure in Australia’s climate change policy and these changes will deliver significant and timely sets of enhancements that will put the Australian economy firmly on the pathway to a low-carbon future. The enhanced renewable energy target will drive significant investment, accelerating the deployment of a broad range of renewable energy technologies like wind, solar and geothermal. These changes are designed to ensure that 20 per cent of our electricity supply comes from renewable energy sources by 2020. On behalf of the government I would like to thank leaders and members of the parties in the House and the Senate for their cooperation to secure passage of this important bill in anticipation of that occurring. I think the numbers, when one considers them, speak for themselves. This is a scheme that will help unlock more than $19 billion of investment in the clean energy sector and help create thousands of new clean energy jobs. Its passage reminds us that it is both possible and in our national interest to take strong, long-term and bipartisan action on climate change. I commend the amendments to the House.",REPS,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) (CHARGE) AMENDMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Hunt, Gregory, MP",LP,2010-06-24,"—From the outset let me make it clear that the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2010 and this set of amendments should not have been necessary. We warned about the problem created by phantom renewable energy credits back in August. We provided amendments to ensure that the crowding out of large-scale renewable energy generation would not occur. We had an alternative. That alternative was dismissed by the government. That alternative was ignored. We again provided in our direct action policy in February a solution to this problem, which was ignored. Now we have found that the government has recognised that it was a problem and that we had the solution, and they have adopted a variation on that. We are pleased that they have accepted the problem and accepted our basic solution. We are somewhat dismayed that the cause of renewable energy has been set back by almost a year through the government’s failure to consult properly, the government’s failure to manage its business properly and the government’s failure to recognise the consequences of its action. It is part of a pattern of consistent underperformance and consistent chaos in the implementation of basic policies.
Having said that, we are believers in renewable energy. We are proponents of renewable energy. We are advocates of renewable energy. Last year we led the case in the cause to ensure that renewable energy—solar, geothermal, tidal and wave, being the great new energy sources of the future—would not be delayed by having it tacked onto and tied and held hostage to the emissions trading scheme. We won that battle. We brought renewable energy forward. We offered to bring these amendments forward to 1 July of this year but, because of a sad intransigence on behalf of the government, what has occurred is very simple: they have now put back the effective date of implementation until 2011. So it was an unnecessary problem on the first occasion, it was an unnecessary delay, and the effect was that wind, solar, geothermal and tidal—the great new energy sources of the future—were delayed and put at risk and investment was slowed on the path of Australia to being an increasingly clean-energy economy.
I now turn to the amendments. I pay great respect to my colleague Ian Macfarlane, the member for Groom, and Senator Simon Birmingham as they have done a tremendous job in securing most of the coalition’s amendments, particularly Mr Macfarlane in negotiating with the government—and we accept their amendments and we appreciate the fact that they have accepted our amendments. I do note, however, that this bill in its current form represents a death knell for many in the waste coalmine gas sector. I do not believe that is this minister’s fault. I do believe that this government has turned its back on rural jobs in areas such as the electorates of Flynn, Shortland and Newcastle and on regional jobs in the electorate of Macarthur. Many areas of Australia will see the loss of potential jobs in the waste coalmine gas sector—and that is a shame. That was avoidable, that should not have occurred and that is a breach of faith—but we ran that, we lost that and unfortunately there is no prospect in these amendments of pushing it further forward.
I say to the minister that this could all have been avoided. Renewable energy in Australia should have been settled in August last year. The nature, the scope and the problems were all identified. At the very heart of this Labor government is policy chaos. The chaos continues and what we see now is that we have to fix it all up. We saw the problem and we identified the solution. Both the problem and the solution were denied. Now they have been recognised and addressed, so we accept these amendments. We will not oppose these amendments as these are what were negotiated. But I note that the waste coalmine gas sector will be the poorer as a result of the breach of faith by the government. Working people right throughout regional Australia and, sadly, their job prospects will be diminished as a result of the government’s failure to adhere to its previous commitment.

There are seven government amendments to the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill 2009. Government amendments (1) through (3) increase the thresholds for issuing bankruptcy notices, creditors’ petitions and petitions for the administration of deceased estates in bankruptcy from $2,000 to $5,000. Government amendment (4) will increase the period of effect of a declaration of intent to file a debtor’s petition from seven days to 21 days. Government amendments (5), (6) and (7) reflect the government’s decision not to progress an amendment that would have increased the income asset and debt thresholds for entering into debt agreements to make debt agreements more widely available.

"Marles, Richard, MP",ALP,2010-06-24,"—I move:
That the amendments be agreed to.
There are amendments here in relation to limited merits review. These amendments vary the scope of the limited merits review arrangements that the Trade Practices Amendment (Infrastructure Access) Bill 2009 is to introduce. The bill provides that, when reviewing decisions made under the National Access Regime, the Australian Competition Tribunal would have regard only to the information that was before the original decision maker as well as any further information the tribunal sought to clarify the original information. These amendments would expand the information available to the tribunal during merits review to include any information the tribunal considers reasonable and appropriate for the purposes of making its decision. Importantly, this may include information that could not reasonably have been made available to parties or to the original decision maker at the time of the original decision. This exception is consistent with the Council of Australian Governments’ 2006 Competition and Infrastructure Reform Agreement.
The amendments retain the notice mechanism previously contained in the bill whereby the tribunal would issue a notice to parties when seeking additional information. This is necessary because the notice acts as a clock-stopper to ensure that seeking the information does not unduly encroach on the time available to the tribunal to make its decision. However, nothing in the bill or the amendments seeks to alter the standard procedures of the tribunal. Typically the tribunal holds preliminary hearings with all parties present to consider the issues before it. It is envisaged the parties would be free to draw to the tribunal’s attention any additional information that the tribunal may wish to seek by issuing a written notice. These amendments are designed to ensure that the tribunal has sufficient information before it to assist in making accurate and timely decisions.
As for the amendment in relation to deemed decisions, this amendment is to remove the measure in the bill relating to deemed decisions. Previously the bill would have provided that, should the designated minister not make a decision in a declaration matter within the prescribed 60-day period, he or she should would be deemed to have decided to accept the recommendation of the National Competition Council.",REPS,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (INFRASTRUCTURE ACCESS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,15,1,speech

What I can say to the Leader of the Opposition is that this government, led by the Treasurer with the Minister for Resources and Energy, Martin Ferguson—the responsible minister—will negotiate with the mining companies of this nation. I have said to the mining companies of this nation publicly that the government is opening its door and asking them to open their minds. I have also said that as a show of good faith—and this has been enacted—the government will remove its advertising from Australia’s television screens. In return I have asked that the mining companies do the same, and I am advised that BHP has already taken that step. The negotiations will proceed in an orderly fashion, step by step and piece by piece and led by the Treasurer, and at the appropriate time the government will make further announcements about the resource profits tax.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Budget</title>,Questions Without Notice,18,1,answer

"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,2010-06-24,"—I thank the member for Hasluck for her question, I thank her for her representation of her local community and I thank her for her the amount of her lifetime that she has devoted to ensuring that Australians have fair and decent working conditions. The 2007 election was fought very, very clearly on the proposition of whether Australians wanted fair and decent working conditions or they wanted the now Leader of the Opposition’s Work Choices plans. The Australian people spoke in 2007, and they rejected Work Choices. They rejected it because of its power in stripping away pay and conditions. They rejected it because of the insecurity it gave them, never knowing if that was the day that they would be presented with an Australian workplace agreement that took basic conditions away. They rejected it because of the insecurity and unfairness of never knowing if that was the day they would be told that they no longer had a job and that they had no right to look for a remedy or contest the reasonableness or fairness of their dismissal.
These things were not abstract; these things were real. They were real for people like Sonya and Chrissie who feature in reports analysing the impact of Work Choices. They worked in aged care, a 24-hour industry, and they lost their penalty rates under Australian workplace agreements. They told in the lives of people like Jo, a young casual kitchenhand who faced pressure to sign an AWA against her will. For three months she refused, so the boss refused to give her any shifts. It is this kind of unfairness that we have eradicated with our Fair Work system. It is exactly this kind of unfairness that will be back if the Leader of the Opposition has the opportunity, as Prime Minister, to resurrect his much-loved Work Choices.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Workplace Relations</title>,Questions Without Notice,20,1,answer

"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2010-06-24,"—I again congratulate the Prime Minister on her accession to what would normally be regarded as the highest elected office in the country, even though she has not at this point been elected to the prime ministership. I also acknowledge the fact that she is in this chamber to respond in this matter of public importance debate. I am pleased that she is prepared to debate me today, but I note that just a couple of hours ago the debates that we have been having every Friday morning on the Today program were cancelled by the Prime Minister. It is very disappointing that the Prime Minister is denying the Australian people that opportunity to see a regular debate between the incumbent Prime Minster and the alternative Prime Minister of this country.
It is a historic day when there is change of Prime Minister in this country, but this has not been a clean change. This is not a change that has been brought about by the will of the people; this is a change that has been brought about by the will of the union and faction warlords. Other prime ministers, I regret to say, have been assassinated by their own parties. Former Prime Minister Hawke was brought down by the machinations of a disloyal party and former Prime Minister the late John Gorton was also brought down in an internal party coup. But what has happened in this parliament overnight is historic in the sense that this is the first time in the 109 years of the Commonwealth of Australia that a Prime Minister has been brought down by his own party in a first term of government.
This was a Prime Minister who until very recently had been the most popular politician in the history of Newspoll, and he has now been politically assassinated. He was not left by a loyal and grateful party to the judgment of the Australian people; he was assassinated because of a sleazy, shoddy factional deal that said that the replacement would serve the purposes of the factions and the unions better than the incumbent. I think that the reaction to this from the Australian people, which has been flooding into the offices of Labor members and been there for all to see on Labor Party websites, is one of dismay and disgust that the methods of the New South Wales Labor Party—the methods that have brought the once great state of New South Wales to such a sorry state—have now been translated to Canberra. The methods of the New South Wales Labor mafia have now been translated to Canberra.
The leader of this country has not been chosen by the Australian public, who elected the member for Griffith; the leader of his country has been chosen by the faceless men and backroom wheeler dealers of the Labor Party, particularly the assassins of Sussex Street. The midnight knock on the door, a feature of other countries and other political cultures, has now come to Canberra courtesy of the assassins of Sussex Street. This is modern Labor—leaders elected by the people but executed by the factional warlords. No wonder people are disillusioned with politics. And for what?
According to the incoming Prime Minister, the government had lost its way, yet she has not been able to offer us any serious or substantial change that will happen as a result of her prime ministership. In the speech that she will shortly make, I challenge the incoming Prime Minister to give us real examples of how the government will be different under her leadership. In what way will policy change? How will the boats be stopped? How will the mining industry be protected? How will the fires in the roofs of hundreds of Australian houses be guarded against? How will Australian families living in houses that have been so shoddily insulated by this government be protected? How will Australian schools get value for money from taxpayers’ money under this Prime Minister, given that they were so badly let down and betrayed by her when she was the Deputy Prime Minister? How is the government going to find its way, given that the only way that has been found so far is the incoming Prime Minister’s way to the Lodge? That is all that has changed today—the former Deputy Prime Minister has found her way to the Lodge. The ideals, the courage and the commitment of the former Prime Minister and member for Griffith have all been killed by this Prime Minister just so that she could find her way to the Lodge. There was no difference of principle and there was no difference in policy. All the commitments that he had, good and bad, she has signed up to. The only difference is that nothing has been allowed to stand in her way—nothing has been allowed to obstruct her path to the Lodge.
The Australian people are not mugs; they understand politics. And what they understand is that this is the same government with the same policies, the same shabby ethos, telling the same fibs, using the same recycled rhetoric and engaging in the same meaningless negotiations. All that has changed is the face that will front the television cameras on a nightly basis. And the fine words that will no doubt slip from the lips of the new Prime Minister are all very well, but they cannot be allowed to cover up for what will undoubtedly be the same incompetent government. What the factional warlords and what the union bosses are hoping is that the government can get to an election and sneak past the defences of the Australian people before they wake up to the fact that nothing has really changed, because nothing has really changed as was abundantly clear in question time today.
The big issue, by far the biggest issue, is the mining tax, which is a dagger aimed at the heart of every Australian’s prosperity. The only thing that really counts is how much extra money is the government intending to gouge from the mining industry, and the one thing this new Prime Minister made crystal clear is this: it is the same old gouge, the same old tax grab for $12 billion in these forward estimates and hundreds of billions of dollars as the years unfold—the same addiction to taxation to feed the same addiction to spending. Nothing has really changed as a result of this change of Prime Minister.
And there is the same lack of understanding of the fundamentals of our economy. She does not understand, any more than her predecessor, that the mining industry is responsible for 50 per cent of our exports. It is how we pay our way in the world. And, if you cannot pay your way in the world, the whole of the economy is compromised. There may not be a mine in every electorate of this country, but almost every electorate in this country has a mining industry and every electorate, every neighbourhood, every shopping centre, every suburb, every town in this country is dependent upon the mining industry because, without the income that that industry generates, the economy of this country simply does not and cannot work.
What the new Prime Minister wants to do, just as surely as her predecessor, is to increase the rate of tax on mining from about the international average to the highest in the world. She wants to increase the rate of tax on mining from about 40 per cent to about 57 per cent. Sure, there will be plenty of words, there will be plenty of fiddles, but at heart it is the same great big new tax. It is the same dagger aimed at the heart of our prosperity. It is the same fundamental misunderstanding of what makes this country and this economy work. She thinks, just like her predecessor, that any rate of return greater than what can be achieved from leaving your money in the bank is a superprofit that should be subjected to a supertax. Just like her predecessor she wants to penalise economic success. Well, it is not good enough. As I said, the Australian public are not mugs and they will see through this PR exercise.
The new Prime Minister has been part of every dud decision that this government has made. Her decisions, as much as those of the former Prime Minister, have been responsible for turning a $20 billion surplus into a $57 billion deficit, turning a $60 billion net asset position into a $100 billion net debt position. She is just as guilty as her predecessor at the flow of boats because she, just as much as her predecessor, wanted to parade her compassion credentials rather than do what was necessary to maintain the border security of our country. Just as much as her predecessor, she is in denial about the tragedies that have taken place thanks to the government’s pink batts program—even today she lacked the decency to apologise to the families of those who have died as a result of the incompetence of this government.
She is personally responsible, more so than her predecessor, for the rip-off after rip-off which has taken place as part of her school halls program. Even now, if she were to demonstrate any skerrick of concern for the taxpayer, she would suspend the final $5.5 billion outlay under this program until she has received the value for money report. If she wants to demonstrate that she really is different, that she really might be a different Prime Minister to her predecessor, that she really has learned something from the agonies that her party has been put through as a result of her ambition and the work of her assassination squads overnight, if she really wants to demonstrate that something good will come out of this, why doesn’t she stand up in this parliament and say, ‘We will not spend that last $5.5 billion until at least I have Mr Orgill’s report.’
What she is doing now is absolutely patently obvious. She is trying to trick the mining industry into believing that things are different and she is suspending the $38 million worth of ineffective government ads in the hope that she will bluff the mining industry out of their campaign, but there is nothing real in it whatsoever until she also dumps from the budget the $12 billion worth of tax revenue that the tax in its existing form is supposed to raise.
You cannot trust this Prime Minister with money, you cannot trust this Prime Minister with the economy and, I regret to say, you cannot even trust this Prime Minister with the truth. She is still recycling the same—I do not want to say ‘lies’, but certainly untruths about members on this side. Let me remind the House: Work Choices is dead; when I was the minister for health there was a 16 per cent real increase in Commonwealth funding for hospitals. She protested her loyalty to the former Prime Minister time and time again and then betrayed him, just as she will protest her willingness to negotiate to the mining industry in the hope of getting through the election and then she will betray them.
Let me make it absolutely crystal clear. If you want to stop the boats, it is not good enough to change the leader; you have to change the government. If you want to stop the tax, it is not good enough to change the leader; you have to change the government. If you want to restore cabinet processes and truth in government, it is not enough to change the leader; you have to change the government. The only risk that this country faces is that this trick might persuade enough of the people that the government really has changed. It is the same government and we must get rid of it before it does any more damage to the future of our country.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Gillard Government: Policies</title>,Matters of Public Importance,27,1,speech
"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,2010-06-24,"—I rise to speak in a matter of public importance debate that was filed by the opposition and was supposedly about the cost-of-living pressures for Australian households and families. How can the Leader of the Opposition be so out of touch that, even though those words are written on a piece of paper, the one thing he says absolutely nothing about is cost of living pressures on working families? Instead, he chose to pose a question about what is different and what is the same today after the events in this parliament. I will speak about the cost of living pressures on working families, but let me just for a moment respond to the question that the Leader of the Opposition has really raised in this parliament: what is different and what is the same?
The truth is that for the Leader of the Opposition there is much that is the same. He is the same man. He is the same man who sat around a Howard cabinet table and supported Work Choices and rejoiced in its outcomes. I clearly remember being in this parliament, sitting where the Deputy Leader of the Opposition sits now, looking over here at the current Leader of the Opposition, as they would come to the dispatch box and not just defend but rejoice in examples like Billy, the minimum wage worker who lost every award condition, including penalty rates, overtime and shift loadings—you name it. That was justified. That was okay. That was Work Choices. The Leader of the Opposition is the same man who used to come to the dispatch box and say that Work Choices was good for working families, as the statistics flooded in about how young workers were being ripped off and about how women workers were being ripped off—statistics that are undeniable. It is not that the Leader of the Opposition did not know these things. I do not allege incompetence. He knew every fact; he knew every statistic; he knew the detail of every rip-off. He had the same dataset available to him as was available to us and the Australian people—and he still defended it as good.
When we on this side of the House said it was unacceptable for working families to face that kind of insecurity and indignity at work, he said it was fine. When working Australians in their workplaces came to the conclusion it was unfair and joined the Your Rights at Work campaign, he said it was fine. When the trade union movement of this country identified individual workers who had lost their rights, he said that was fine. Whilst the Leader of the Opposition poses the question—what is the same and what is different?—what is the same is his absolute commitment to Work Choices. When he sat here and defended Work Choices he told the truth. He believes in it; he is committed to it; he thought it was the right way for Australia.
The Leader of the Opposition says that he hopes there will be debates between him and me, and as we lead up to the election there most certainly will be in many, many contexts. In those debates what I would suggest the Leader of the Opposition really does is have the fortitude to present and argue for the things he really believes in. He says he is a conviction politician. Well, let’s stump up. Let’s have a red-hot go. Let’s put before the nation the real choice—the choice he believes in, Work Choices, versus the choice I believe in, Fair Work. Let’s be conviction politicians. Let’s follow those convictions. Let’s debate them long and loud right around this country. I am happy to do it. I am happy to wear my convictions on my sleeve. The one thing I ask the Leader of the Opposition to do is to have the fortitude and the guts to wear his convictions on his sleeve—and his conviction is Work Choices.
The Leader of the Opposition poses the question: what is the same and what is different? The Leader of the Opposition is the same man who took $1 billion out of our hospitals. It just seems to me truly remarkable that a man who is so keen to find fault in others and who has presented himself to the Australian people in the guise of a plain-speaking conviction politician resorts to graphs and figures and statistics about growth compared with what it could have been, or should have been or was going to be, to try to explain this $1 billion cutback. The Leader of the Opposition is a man of conviction, as he says he is and as he wants to be perceived. Why doesn’t he just front out a debate that says: ‘Yep, I took a billion dollars out of health care. I did it because I thought it was right and I would do it again given the opportunity.’ Why doesn’t he front out that debate? Why doesn’t he wear his convictions on his sleeve?
Again there is the question: what is the same and what is different? There are other things that are the same about this Leader of the Opposition. I have been opposed to him before in this parliament in many guises, including as shadow minister for health and as Manager of Opposition Business. We are back where we have been. It is a remarkable serendipity that brings us to this point, him and me, back debating as we have over so many years.

15:59:25 Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition: on the questions in the debates of the past—on the questions he seeks to raise about political honesty and being forthright—does he recall going to an election giving a rock-solid, ironclad guarantee and then taking it away? Then, after the election, having promised the Australian people that the Medicare safety net would not be cut back, he said, ‘I got rolled at Expenditure Review Committee’ or ‘Peter Costello didn’t like me’ or some mumbo jumbo. He said, by way of explanation to Laurie Oakes: ‘It’s okay, because I did consider resigning. I didn’t resign, but I did have one dark night of the soul, and surely that’s enough to square up a promise smashed as well as that one was smashed—a promise as big as that one was.’ That is the track record on honesty of this Leader of the Opposition.
Why does the Leader of the Opposition not actually own that? Why does he not go out to the Australian population and say: ‘I want to have a debate about political honesty. This is my track record; I own it and I stand for it.’ With all of this affectation to conviction, the real question in front of the Australian people from today is: who stands by their convictions, who lives by them, and who is the phoney? That is the real question before the Australian people today.
On the question of conviction, let me say to the Leader of the Opposition that I have a conviction about serving the interests of working families. I have been in the Labor Party all of my adult life because I believe in some things that I will never let go. I believe in working hard. I believe it is appropriate to work hard—to give of  your all—and I believe fundamentally in the power and the dignity of work. I believe that there is nothing more self-destructive for an individual—for their self-perception, for their perception of their role in a community and for their sense of self-worth—than to be excluded from the benefits and the dignity of work. That is why I have been driven, as a member of this government, by a conviction that if we can do things to ensure, during bad economic times, that people have the benefits and the dignity of work then we should do them. Not everything has gone right. I freely and absolutely concede that. I expect that the Leader of the Opposition will make much use of that between now and election day, but I stand by this. It is the right thing to do if you can extend the benefits and the dignity of work to working Australians to do just that. And we did.
The other conviction by which I have lived and which is the explanation of my own life is the constructive power of education. I am here as a result of great schooling. I have lived a different life from that of my father and my mother because of the power of education—education provided versus education denied. The truth is that in this country today there are kids who effectively still experience education denied. If we have the ability to change that—and it is not easy—then we should. What drives the Building the Education Revolution and what drives my passion for and commitment to education each and every day is that delivering on this nation’s promise as the nation of a fair go requires us to look at and say to each other in honesty that every child has the benefit of a great education provided and no child is held back because a great education has been denied.
I say also to the Leader of the Opposition that I, obviously, opposed him as shadow minister for health. I do not claim the great intellectual depth and fortitude of the current Minister for Health and Ageing. She is far better than I ever was with the details, the understanding, the depths and the dimension of the portfolio. She is truly remarkable. What I take from those days as shadow minister for health is that it is so important for people to know that the healthcare system is going to be there for them when they need it. That is not an easy thing in an era of an ageing community. It is not an easy thing in an age of increasingly sophisticated and expensive technologies. It is not an easy thing in a vast continent like this one, but it is a task that we are building on and working towards. Benefits have already been delivered and we are absolutely determined to deliver more. That stands in contrast to the Leader of the Opposition’s measly record as health minister. Will anybody ever bother to write the book about the Tony Abbott era of reform? The answer to that is no, but I warrant that in five, 10 or 15 years time they will be writing books about the Nicola Roxon era of reform in health.
On the question of cost-of-living pressures on working families, we have taken action to support our economy during difficult economic days. We did what had to be done in order to keep Australians in work, and we were opposed every step of the way by this Leader of the Opposition. Our efforts have obviously been rewarded in the sense that we have kept Australians in work and our unemployment rate is at 5.2 per cent, but there are families out there doing it tough. The Leader of the Opposition is so out of touch with cost-of-living pressures that he wrote down the term ‘cost of living’ on his MPI and forgot to use it. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that we want to work with working families to help them manage those cost-of-living pressures. That is what the tax cuts on 1 July are about. That is what our childcare tax rebate reforms are all about—taking the amount of that tax rebate to 50 per cent. That is what our education tax rebate is about—helping with the costs of educating kids at school.
I conclude by saying to the Leader of the Opposition that when I walked into the chamber today for the first time as Prime Minister I shook his hand and said, ‘Game on.’ I mean it.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Gillard Government: Policies</title>,Matters of Public Importance,27,1,speech
"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,2010-06-24,"—Today is a historic day, as many commentators will contend. This is a historic day as the backroom operators and the union heavyweights of the Labor Party have achieved their goal of taking control of the Labor Party and installing one of their own as the Prime Minister, a person who is now beholden to their interests. This was a day of betrayal and naked ambition, a day that an elected Australian Prime Minister was brutally assassinated before he was able to complete his first term in office.
What a destabilising few months this Labor government has put the country through, with the then Deputy Prime Minister professing undying loyalty to her leader but all the time preparing to do the union bosses’ bidding. Thankfully, it is not often that the Australian public gets an insight into the ugly internal politics of the Labor machine, but today it was exposed in all its shocking glory. The union bosses decided that the elected Prime Minister would no longer serve their interests, so they installed their own Prime Minister. There is no place in the Labor Party for the national interest. Regardless of how many times the carefully scripted lines are repeated, ‘whatever it takes’ is the Labor way.
Labor shot the messenger but, sadly, for Australian families and the Australian people Labor’s message will remain the same. It is clear, as my leader said, that the ugly politics of state Labor have now come to Canberra. This poll driven party knifes its leaders rather than face the judgment of the Australian people. If history is any guide, the new Prime Minister needs to turn the polls around immediately and significantly or she will have to look over her shoulder for the inevitable knives from the backroom boys—the union bosses.
It is interesting to read the feedback from Labor’s very own website. I managed to print off just 25 pages, but there were hundreds of emails in just under an hour from people expressing their outrage that the union bosses have taken over the Labor Party and thrown out—assassinated—an elected Labor leader. People are giving their names, addresses and email addresses. One email from Queensland said:
What a bunch of cowards to slit the throat of an honest, hard-working Prime Minister just because things get tough.
Another email from Victoria said:
A very shameful day for Australian politics. The appointment of Australia’s first woman Prime Minister should have been a memorable and forward-looking occasion, not a backstabbing of the man elected by the Australian people.
Another email, again from Queensland, said:
Until last year, I was constantly disappointed that I wasn’t old enough to vote Labor. This year, with my first election, I am able to vote in this looming election and I was excited at being able to support Kevin Rudd and its honest Australian policies. Today I became a Liberal.
It goes on. This next one is again from Queensland and it reads:
I am so sad today I have actually resigned from the Labor Party. The first female Prime Minister is a great achievement if it had been obtained through an election and Julia Gillard would have had my support. Kevin Rudd did what he believed was the right thing for Australia. He’s been bullied out by his own party. It is a disgrace he was not allowed to face an election.
But that is the Labor Party. The losers from Labor’s brutal and damaging process will be the Australian people, for the change of leader does not change Labor’s policies. It does not change the mining supertax, which is causing so much damage to Australia and which will drive up the cost of electricity and the cost of building materials, cost jobs, hurt small businesses and hurt family businesses. The new Prime Minister has decided to retain the tax in all its damaging glory and has continued the same flawed rhetoric of her predecessor in claiming that mining companies have been ripping off the Australian people. This is about funding Labor’s continuing spending splurges.
The grand gesture of cancelling the government funded advertising campaign was a decision based on the fact that the advertising was not working. The Australian people had seen through it. What courage the new Prime Minister demonstrates in cancelling advertising that was actually hurting the government! This is the brave new Labor world under this Prime Minister. She lacks the courage to make the decision that must be made and that is to scrap the mining tax. We know the Labor way. Graham Richardson told us the Labor way: consult, consult, consult, negotiate, negotiate, negotiate and then do exactly what you intended to do in the first place. That is the Labor way.
The new Prime Minister has also sought to claim the moral high ground on the question of asylum seekers but has exposed her rank hypocrisy and her fake moral outrage. How does she reconcile her statements today with her infamous media release of April 2003, when the now Prime Minister described every boat of asylum seekers as a policy failure—the screaming, scare-mongering headline ‘Another boat on the way, another policy failure’? That was a year when only one asylum-seeker boat came to our shores, because the Howard government’s policies had stopped the people-smuggling trade. Yet the now Prime Minister could not resist the fear mongering—‘Another boat on the way, another policy failure’ she said in 2003. Yet, having promised in opposition to stop the boats, this government changed its policies, changed the laws, weakened our border protection and damaged the integrity of our orderly immigration program. The people-smuggling trade was reinvigorated under the gang of four and 140 boats have made the dangerous journey across the dangerous Indian Ocean to our shores. So, according to this Prime Minister, 140 boats means 140 Labor government failures—140 policy failures by this Labor government.
But the defining features of the Labor government have been waste, mismanagement and absolute disregard for evidence based policy. Among the numerous examples of ludicrous, staggering waste and mismanagement, the standout would have to be the Building the Education Revolution and that is a program for which this Prime Minister was personally and directly responsible. This Prime Minister will have the ignominy of being the minister responsible for the most wasteful spending in any federal government program in federal government history.
This was fundamentally flawed from its needlessly rushed inception and yet the now Prime Minister stuck her head in the sand and refused to take ministerial responsibility for billions and billions of dollars of taxpayers’ funds being wasted. It began as a $14.7 billion program to provide libraries and halls for schools, but it blew out by over $1½ billion. In a competent government, a minister who was responsible for a $1½ billion blow-out would have been sacked, but in this government incompetence is rewarded. The Prime Minister justified it at the time by saying, ‘It’s hugely popular. It’s a runaway success.’ But we now know that the Prime Minister was covering up the huge rorts, the rip-offs, the incompetent management and the massive waste. It has been estimated that taxpayers and schools will probably get less than $8 billion in actual value from an over $16 billion program. That is a disgrace. The Prime Minister admitted that there was no cost-benefit analysis undertaken to look at whether this program would be effective or have any long-term benefit, and no consideration was given by this Prime Minister as to whether this massive expenditure would have any impact on the quality of teaching and education or whether it would lift educational standards.
Another defining, stand-out policy that has been an absolute disgrace is the $2½ billion Home Insulation Program. It has been nothing short of disastrous. This government is incapable of implementing a government program. There have been four deaths and more than 170 house fires, and 240,000 homes have substandard or dangerous insulation. But it should not escape anyone’s attention that this Prime Minister was the senior minister responsible for the training component of this disastrous pink batts scheme. The government has to find hundreds of millions of dollars to fix this scheme, but this Prime Minister was responsible for the training component that failed young people in Australia so disgracefully. It was this Prime Minister’s responsibility to ensure that a proper training program was put in place. She failed the Australian people, as this Prime Minister has failed the Australian people with her record over the last two years.
We can list the blow-out in the school halls program, the dumping of her commitment to build childcare centres, the dumping of the computers in schools program and the promises there, and the delivery of only a couple of trade training centres out of the 2,650 promised. Given this pattern of failure, why would Australia trust this Prime Minister? (Time expired)

"Swan, Wayne, MP",ALP,2010-06-24,"—I welcome the opportunity to talk in this matters of public importance debate about competent government and cost-of-living pressures. We have had yet another demonstration from the Leader of the Opposition of what a risk he would be to our national economy should he come to be on the government benches. He revealed yet again his complete ignorance of economics. As Peter Costello said, the Leader of the Opposition is bored by economics—and didn’t it show in those comments we heard earlier. As the Prime Minister pointed out, this is supposed to be an MPI about cost-of-living pressures. Not once in his 15-minute contribution did the Leader of the Opposition talk about one cost-of-living pressure.
—He’s out of touch.
—I am not surprised about that because, yes, he is out of touch. I have a vivid memory from shortly after we were elected to government, early in 2008. He had been in hibernation for some time, although he was on the front bench. His most significant early remark as an opposition frontbencher was to complain that because he no longer had a ministerial salary and was only on an MP’s salary he could not afford to live. That demonstrates just how out of touch he is. He is completely out of touch. That was demonstrated by the complete absence of any discussion about what life is like around the kitchen table, what are the policy issues that impact on the cost of living—nothing, because he does not have a clue about what life is like around the kitchen table for an average Australian family. He would not have a clue about what it was like out in Penrith or down in Tasmania or up in Dobell or over in Petrie. He simply would not have a clue, living as he does, and has done for all of his life, in the leafy North Shore of Sydney. It is pretty good if you can get it. It is a great place to be and to go to, but most Australians do not live like that, do not earn the those salaries and do not live in those suburbs. They live right across the country, on modest incomes, trying to get by.
The hide of him to come in here and talk as if the Liberal Party care about jobs! It would make a cat laugh! People on this side of the House remember vividly what happened in this House back in February 2008 when we were trying to get the second stimulus package through this parliament. It was rejected and fought against tooth and nail by every one of the Liberal and National Party members who sit opposite. This is the package that saved Australia. It was rejected in the Senate on the first run through, then it went back up and finally it went through. But I vividly remember the night we were here debating it. It was about four or five o’clock in the morning and they were still fighting it. They were saying things like, ‘It won’t create a single job.’
—That’s right: not one.
—Not one single job. They did not care about employment then and they do not care about it now. Nor do they have any understanding of what must be done in the uncertain international environment to support our small businesses and to broaden the economy. Not only that, they have little knowledge of what we must do as we go forward to reform and strengthen the economy. They have no knowledge about any of that.
I would have to check this—I think my memory is pretty correct—but I do not think that the Leader of the Opposition even spoke in that debate. At the time he was the opposition spokesman on family and community services but he could not come into the parliament to debate one of the most significant economic initiatives in the history of this country.
—He was in the dining room!
—I have just been reminded and, in fact, it is coming back to me now. He was actually in the dining room with two other people, the former Treasurer and who was the third? I cannot remember who the third was.
—Andrews.
—Andrews, that is right! They were up in the dining room having a few drinks while we were down here debating the future of employment in Australia. They only bothered to walk into the House, in a dishevelled state, when the vote was on. So much for their concern for employment!
Because we acted, because we are competent, because we are concerned about employment, because we understand economics and because we knew the threat that was coming from elsewhere in the world, where is Australia today? Australia today is one of the strongest advanced economies in the world. It is one of the strongest developed economies, which is celebrated by everybody on this side of the House. And what does it mean? It means low unemployment. What is absolutely critical to coping with the cost of living, to making ends meet and to educating your children and getting health care and housing is a decent job.
Where are we in Australia today? As I said, our economy is one of the strongest in the developed world. Our unemployment rate is 5.2 per cent, but it is in double digits right across Europe and just around nine-plus in the United States. We are creating jobs while the rest of the world has been losing jobs. In fact, we have created something like 280,000 jobs in the past year—something everyone in this House is going to be proud of for a long time. When the economic history of this country is written in the fullness of time it will say that the decision to put in place that stimulus package was absolutely critical. It is not just for jobs but also for business and for small business to keep their doors open. And it is still keeping the doors of tens of thousands of small businesses open right around this country in projects which are denigrated in this House day after day by those people who are sitting opposite.
They said it would not create a single job. I will never forget Malcolm Turnbull at the Press Club who said it would never create a job. They may have those views, but there is a lot of support for what Australia did, which is recognised as being first class. This is what a number of people had to say about it. The Governor of the Reserve Bank said stimulus had, ‘worked a treat’. The Governor of the Reserve Bank does not make those comments lightly. The OECD said:
… in no small part shielded businesses and citizens from the initial damaging impacts of the global recession.
The chief economist at Deutsche Bank said, ‘The absolute reliance of the Australian economy on policy stimulus since the second half of 2008 has been absolutely critical.’ The evidence is in. This government has a fine record in supporting employment, in supporting small business, in underpinning confidence and in understanding the nature of the threats that this country faced in the past and faces as we go forward. Of course, we have done all that and we have come out the other end with the lowest deficit and the lowest debt of any advanced economy.
I listened very closely to the Leader of the Opposition. He did not once in his critique of everything that had gone wrong even acknowledge that there has been a global financial crisis let alone a global recession. It simply passed him by. Well, I suppose it might if you lived where he lives. It may well have passed you by. But I tell you what, it did not pass by Australians the length and breadth of this country. They knew what the challenge was and they got behind it and so did so many of the employers in this country.
We on this side of the House understand the future challenges as well. We understand we are going to be in the Asian century. We understand that there are great opportunities coming for this country and we do need to reform our economy. We also understand that there are many people who are not doing as well even in an economy which is in as good shape as ours is compared to everybody else.
Not everybody is sharing in that and that is why we have continued with our tax cuts. The third lot are coming through next week. They are modest tax cuts but because we understand that many people around the kitchen table are doing it tough we introduced the education tax rebate. When you are trying to send your kids back to school it is a difficult time of year. It is a bit of extra cash to help you get by when all the bills come in after Christmas, when the kids are going back to school and you have to get the uniforms, and when the credit card bills are coming in. The education tax rebate is a big help for those people. Do we ever hear mentioned by those opposite what we have done in terms of child care? All of these things are vitally important because we understand cost-of-living pressures.
Then there is what we did with the age pension. It was something they could not find the whit to do in over 12 years despite the fact that it was raining gold bars at the time they were in government. They could not find time for pensioners below the poverty line. They did not care. They did not give a toss. They just simply do not understand the cost-of-living pressures facing families. That is why they are such extremists when it comes to Work Choices; they simply do not get it. (Time expired)

"Truss, Warren, MP",NATS,2010-06-24,"—I begin by congratulating the Prime Minister on her election. While we will be working as hard as we possibly can to make her term as short as possible, the reality is she has been given the great honour of a being a prime minister of this country, and I am sure that she will treasure this day.
Even in amongst her own celebrations she must be feeling a bit uncomfortable in her stomach about the way in which she got where she is. She is there as Prime Minister today because of the intervention of the New South Wales Labor mafia. If you are relying on the mafia, the faction bosses, the union thugs and the factional warlords to keep you in office, one day they will knock on your door too. One day it will happen to this Prime Minister as well. Just as the New South Wales thugs and factional warlords came across from Sydney to mount a coup in the national capital, one day they will come again and this Prime Minister will face a similar fate.
This is the kind of behaviour you might expect in a Third World dictatorship where people unelected, union bosses and factional thugs, think that they can override the decision of the Australian people, ignore our democratic processes and put in place somebody of their choice to be Prime Minister. These people, still with blood on their hands from the last political execution in New South Wales, came across to do the same thing in the national capital. And their people quickly got behind their factional leaders and knocked on the Prime Minister’s door and within hours he was gone.
Just as a succession of New South Wales premiers are simply there as puppets of the factional leaders, this Prime Minister is simply a puppet of the New South Wales Labor machine. When they are sick of this Prime Minister—when the merry-go-round does another turn—they will be over again to knock on the door and to say, ‘Your time is up.’ Wasn’t it disgraceful to see on television last night the gloating Paul Howes. Who was he? No-one had even heard of him. He was not elected by the Australian people to the parliament. But he was gloating on television about how he was deposing the Prime Minister and he went on about class warfare and the like. He said there was nothing wrong with the way Labor was governing. If that is the case, why was he so determined to get rid of the Prime Minister? In fact, a lot is wrong with Labor in government. Higher electricity and food prices mean real costs to the Australian people. The debt and slashed services will be an additional burden for future generations of Australians. And, of course, the decline in hospitals and health care and other services is simply a national disgrace in a country with the potential of Australia. Labor it is that is now the problem, as it has always been. No matter who the leader is, it is the same lemon: a new face but still bad policy.
The Labor faceless men who wanted the emissions trading scheme and then wanted it dumped now seem to want it back. The only climate that these powerbrokers care about is the political climate and their chances of electoral survival. From day one, the current Prime Minister was part of the kitchen cabinet of four—now down to two—that decided all of the government’s agenda over the past three years. She is just as culpable as the man she deposed for the government’s performance. She is just as much to blame. Indeed, her own portfolio mismanagement has been at the top of the pile of Labor troubles. The reality is that she has wasted more taxpayers’ money in her department—with her BER and all sorts of other programs—than anyone else. If the left-winger Julia Gillard tries to pretend she is an economic conservative, nobody will believe her. If she makes the same promise about how she cares about all Australians, no-one will believe her. I have been trying over the last hour or so to find any connections she has with regional Australia and I cannot find any.

An opposition member—She flies over it!
—Yes, she flies over it. She goes past it but she has no commitment to people who live outside the capital cities. That was very evident when it came to the way she trashed the independent youth allowance so that people living in regional Australia could not get fair and affordable education. It is a change of face, but what we need is a change of government. (Time expired)

"D’Ath, Yvette, MP",ALP,2010-06-24,"—I am pleased to speak on this matter of public importance, although I did have to check what the matter of importance was about. We have had the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and now the Leader of the Nationals and not one of these three speakers has mentioned the cost-of-living pressures, which is actually listed as their matter of public importance. We heard the Leader of the Opposition making the statement, ‘The Australian people are not mugs.’ The opposition are trying to make comparisons and trying to identify similarities between the current Prime Minister and the previous Prime Minister of this government. The Leader of the Opposition has got one thing right: the Australian people are not mugs. They know they can expect the same thing no matter who is speaking on the opposition side, which is the same old scare campaign. They also know that Tony Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, is the same man who applauded Work Choices, the same man who said he would introduce paid parental leave over his dead body and the same man who said, ‘You cannot trust what comes out of my mouth unless it is in writing.’ This is the man who holds himself out as the alternative Prime Minister.
I am going to talk about cost-of-living pressures. I am going to talk about what this government has done since being elected to assist families and households with cost-of-living pressures. It has increased the childcare benefit by 50 per cent, paid quarterly, to help families. The most important way of assisting with cost-of-living pressures is to support jobs in this country. That is what this government has done and will continue to do. We supported jobs through the global financial crisis. We made sure that over 70 per cent of the stimulus that was put forward to invest in public infrastructure in this country went to supporting jobs—infrastructure both small and large, including in our schools.
Let us talk about what losing a job does to cost-of-living pressures. If the Leader of the Opposition got into government and scrapped the building of halls, libraries and trade training centres, what does he think that would do to jobs and cost-of-living pressures? If he scrapped the roads to recovery program and the jobs that are created in fixing those roads and building new roads, what would that do to cost-of-living pressures? The opposition, when in government, squandered the revenue that they got from the resources sector. They did not invest in infrastructure, they did not invest in education and not only did they not invest in health but also they pulled money out of the health system. The opposition’s idea of assisting or supporting cost-of-living pressures would be to, when in government, reintroduce individual agreements. They will once again rip away unfair dismissal protections for workers. They think that creating job insecurity is somehow going to improve cost-of-living pressures. This is the gospel truth from the Leader of the Opposition. Another way they are going to help cost-of-living pressures is to scrap the National Broadband Network, which will create tens of thousands of jobs in this country.
What this government has done is provided three lots of tax cuts—including tax cuts coming on 1 July—for households, increased the pension with the largest increase we have seen since the pension was introduced, created additional support payments for carers and provided affordable housing and new social housing in our suburbs across this country. That is how this government is supporting households; that is how this government is dealing with cost-of-living pressures. This government, with its leadership, its executives and its members, will go forward and continue to support families, pensioners and householders across this country at a time when they need support because of cost-of-living pressures. That is what this government is about: supporting jobs and looking after families and those most in need in our community—unlike those on the other side.

That the amendments be agreed to.
TheTrade Practices Amendment (Australian Consumer Law) Bill (No. 2) 2010 represents the final legislative step at the Commonwealth level to implement the most significant reforms in consumer law since the enactment of the Trade Practices Act 1974. It is truly a generational change in consumer law and the process has been a triumph for cooperative federalism. The government acknowledges the constructive approach taken by the opposition, particularly the shadow minister for consumer affairs. The government thanks the opposition for their support for this important bill. The amendments moved in the Senate address recommendations made by the Senate Economics Committee, including coalition minority recommendations, and make other minor and technical amendments. This bill demonstrates the government’s commitment to enhancing the wellbeing of all Australian consumers. I commend the bill to the House.

The government accepts these amendments, including government amendments to refine the definition of how-to-vote cards to ensure that it captures only those materials which express two or more preferences and does not unintentionally include material which simply encourages an elector to simply vote 1 candidate Y or vote 1 party X and opposition amendments to increase the penalties for breaches of offences in the bill to 50 penalty units.

"Windsor, Antony, MP",IND,2010-06-24,"—When I was first running for the seat of New England, one of my people suggested that a good bumper sticker might be, ‘The Windsors have done a great job in Old England; give a Windsor a go in New England.’ It was decided not to proceed with that bumper sticker. I support the Farm Household Support Amendment (Ancillary Benefits) Bill 2010. The trial that is being pursued in Western Australia is very significant. All of us, particularly those from country areas, should look closely at how this trial works. I have some concerns. I will not get into expressing too many of those today because I do not think that it pays to be negative when we are trying to assess a different way of looking at drought policy. It seems to me that both sides of parliament and, to a growing extent, the farm organisations are coming to recognise that the existing drought policy may not be the best way of addressing drought into the future. Particularly if climate change is a reality, there are going to be changed circumstances in some areas. So people are genuinely looking at various options in terms of drought policy.
I have been involved with the parliamentary committee that has been looking at some of these options and the potential impact of climate change on agriculture. Those who do not believe in climate change can substitute the word ‘drought’ and they will be able to make their own arrangements in terms of what sorts of policies should be occurring into the future. I think there are some significant things that do stand out, but before I get to those issues I would just like to reflect on the existing policy, which has been in place now for something like 18 years. I think it was the Keating government that put in place the arrangement where a drought that was greater than one in 25 years was deemed to require an exceptional circumstances response. Over time that has grown into what is called household support and also the EC interest rate subsidy assistance.
I have been in this parliament since 2001 and I have heard the previous government and the current government—I even heard it this morning from a country member of parliament—perpetuate a myth. I am not suggesting that the current system is correct, as we can always improve upon it, but a myth has developed in this parliament that somehow billions of dollars have been expended in country areas in relation to drought assistance. If you walked out into the street now people would say, ‘You cannot keep giving the farmers these vast amounts of money.’ The coalition did it brilliantly because they wanted to suggest that they were doing an enormous amount for the farm sector during the worst drought in living memory. The Labor Party did not do anything to fix the problem either. It seems to me that it has been in the interests of the major parties to paint the farm sector into a corner where it is seen to be in some sort of begging bowl arrangement, with the eventual goal of removing exceptional circumstances as a drought policy.
I would like to elaborate on that if I could. The exceptional circumstances arrangements are broken into two parts. The first part is household support, and the bill we are addressing today, the Farm Household Support Amendment (Ancillary Benefits) Bill 2010, is to do with the trial that is occurring in Western Australia. The household support is no different to Centrelink payments or unemployment benefits. The farmers who are getting that benefit are unemployed in the sense that they are not earning any income. They do not earn an income, but they are still working. They received the Centrelink payment because they needed to work to maintain the farm even though they were not earning any income. That is the same treatment that any unemployed person or any person who is not able to earn an income would receive.
The second part of the existing policy is the assistance to businesses through interest rate subsidy arrangements. There is a myth out there that this particular interest rate assistance has been propping up the broken-down farmer, that this has stopped a natural transition of people out of agriculture. There are viability requirements—the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry would be fully aware of them, and I thank him for being here—with exceptional circumstances interest rate assistance. If you are broke, you cannot get it. You have to show that during this exceptional circumstance you are viable enough that with some assistance you will tread water and, when the major event removes itself from the premises, you will be ready to produce again and be a productive contributor to the economy. I repeat: if you are a broken-down farmer, you cannot get assistance because the viability requirements disallow you from getting it. You might be able to get some household support, which any unemployed person who is not earning an income can avail themselves of.
The coalition perpetuated this myth—and I used to pick them up every time—that they were spending billions of dollars on propping up agriculture. That was the message and the farmers were all supposed to be out there saying, ‘Thank God you are here looking after us.’ When you look at the business assistance to agriculture over the first seven years of the drought—unfortunately I have left all my notes up in my office so I will operate on memory; I think you will find I am pretty close—the average assistance was $217 million a year. Two hundred and seventeen million dollars, in the worst drought in living memory, to one of the biggest contributors to our economy is a pittance, but this myth has developed that an enormous amount of money is being poured into agriculture and therefore we have got to look at different ways of doing it. I am not arguing about some of the other more positive things that the trial is looking at, but this myth annoys me because it puts the farming community in a position it should not be placed in. If you take it out to eight years, I think the average number went to about $250 million. If you bring in the last one or two years, the average over that period of time is about $280 million a year. The assistance that government gave to other industries during that period of time is somewhere between $11½ billion and $13 billion annually. There has been this mythology developed out there that you cannot help these people while they are going through one of the worst traumas from a climate event that we have ever seen, yet the money that has been presented out there is a pittance.
As I said, I agree with some of the changes. I agree with the trial. I think it is very worth while and we should look very closely at it. But I do not think we should use any financial argument to suggest that there are not circumstances where some direct assistance in terms of business assistance should be perpetuated. These are viable farmers who are becoming severely stretched. If you let them slip through the system, the productive activity that comes out the other end will be far less, and the investment of some money into the system to keep them ready to go, when eventually the drought breaks, would cost far less.
In my view, part of what the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry is trying to achieve—and I think it is a good idea—is to look at some of the ways in which we can pre-empt drought, remove drought. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that, particularly with the better soil types, there are ways and means of doing that. The minister spent a few days in my electorate, where one of the things that we looked at very early in the piece was the advent of no-till farming. That has been an extraordinary adaptation to climate change that has taken place in recent years. I was fortunate enough to be interested in that sort of technology many years ago, and we have a block of land that is currently one of the longest blocks of land that has been no-till farmed continuously. That is coming up to 33 years. So I have some idea about what that actually does in terms of drought—the member for Parkes, who is at the table, would have a lot of knowledge of that too—and removing from the scenery the potential downside of weather events or dry spells, from climate change or whatever else. With the better soils, it produces the equivalent of another six inches of rainfall. That is due to a change in technology that has occurred over time. In a theoretical sense at least, with the advent of that technology you could effectively have a reduction of six inches of rain through climate change and break even in terms of the moisture available to plant with nothing else happening, so we have got to encourage that. There are such technologies in farming, and in grazing as well, that we should look very closely at and encourage.
There are various other landscape technologies that the minister is aware of. A man called Peter Andrews and others are looking at variations on the theme of how we keep more of the water in the landscape rather than letting it rush out to sea. There are some conflicts there, particularly with the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and the inter-valley caps and things that are being produced at the moment through the accountancy process that is going on in relation to water. If you were to encourage technologies that retain water on the land, reduce erosion and increase infiltration—all these very positive things to produce food or fibre—what would happen to the accountancy process in terms of the water that used to run off through bad management? I do not think they have really come to grips with that in some of their accounting processes. Take plantation forestry, for instance, which will have a significant impact on the availability of water downstream when you remove land that would have allowed run-off so you can plant on it trees that do not allow run-off.
So there are these conflicting policy areas that are starting to develop. Maybe that will put pressure on the irrigation water that is available, particularly in the Murray-Darling system. So I would suggest that, as part of this policy—and I am sure that it is in place—we should really look at encouraging the technologies that remove moisture loss as being a problem. We will never negate drought totally—nor should we try, as we are in a dry nation—but there are technologies to which funding could be provided to encourage the people involved. It might be through machinery, or it might be through the investment allowance that is out there at the moment, or it might be through reducing certain taxation of the various chemicals that are particularly good for various agricultural systems, or there might be management techniques that suffer from various taxation issues and government could play a role by removing those issues—so not giving money but removing increases in variable costs.
The other thing that I would like to do is to briefly note, Minister, while you are at the table in the chamber, that you are fully aware of the Bundarra area exceptional circumstances arrangement. It highlights some of the great difficulties with the existing system as to where the rain falls, the rain gauges, the rain events and the lines on maps. The people in Bundarra are looking for some answer as quickly as possible so that they can have some certainty as to where they are actually going, so I would encourage you to take that on board. It is a pocket of land in my electorate that unfortunately has been dealt a fairly bad hand in recent years, whereas other areas around it have been doing quite well. This area of little doughnuts is not doing very well at all in terms of rainfall.
Another issue I would like to raise is in conjunction with land use. We have developed this theme in Australian agriculture and in our parliaments that all land should be used for food production, that the world needs our food and that if we do not use that land for food production our own food security will slip. Anybody who is involved in agriculture realises that the world might need our food but it will not pay anything for it. Society has downgraded the value of food. Those who really need it have not got any money. Sudan is a classic case. Sudan has magnificent black soils. It has a dry land, like Australia’s, but it has the capacity with our technology to produce six times what Australia produces in grain. Moving into a carbon economy when there is the carting of grain all over the world to those who need the food, when in fact they could produce their own, inadvertently or deliberately corrupts some of the cost structures that have developed in relation to international trade.
When we talk about land use and carbon, we get this mixed message. I am not having a go at New South Wales farmers, but agriculture is all about food production. They are also talking about property rights. If I have the right to a thousand acres of land, why can’t I grow trees on it? Why can’t I grow second generation biofuels? That would have a more positive impact on the carbon economy, though it does not help the food economy. One of our great problems with drought policy—and this completes the circle in a sense—is that when the good years are on there is not enough money being made. We have to look at these technologies that are out there. There is this devotion to using all land for food production, but our problem is that we produce too much of the stuff. We have to find markets. We bribe Arabs occasionally to buy the stuff from us. Then we go down and buy a boatload of oil and so we have this carbon footprint coming across the ocean, whereas in a lot of ways we could use some of that food production land for agroforestry or biofuels—second generation ethanol or sugar for fuel. The sugar industry was nearly destroyed a few years ago, until the Brazilians decided to take enormous amounts of sugar off the world market and grow their own renewable energy instead. Suddenly our sugar producers were saved—not by our policy, but by the Brazilians saying, ‘We’re sick of this; we are not going to accept this global market; what else can we do?’ The world price went up, and our sugar producers were saved. There are enormous opportunities.
Today the shadow minister was talking about renewable energy targets—but nothing about agriculture, nothing about land use. It was all about solar, wind and waves. The coalition put in place some renewable energy targets back in 2001, but there is less renewable energy produced now than there was nine years ago, before they established the target. We have to get serious about this, and if we are serious about drought we will acknowledge that you can afford to grow a quarter of a tonne of wheat to the acre if you are getting paid big prices for it. It is payment for food that is the issue. We can fix it with technology, and I think this bill will go some way towards doing that. If people are not prepared to pay for our food products, we have to look at alternative land uses—whether it be trees or biofuels or whatever—to produce energy for us. We need energy. At the moment we ship our food overseas, cash the cheque, buy energy and bring it all the way back again. In a carbon economy that is going to be terribly detrimental to a country like Australia with its geographical location.
I encourage the minister to look at some of these issues and particularly to look very closely at the Bundarra issue. (Time expired)
",REPS,<title>FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT AMENDMENT (ANCILLARY BENEFITS) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,32,1,speech
"Ley, Sussan, MP",LP,2010-06-24,"—I am pleased to speak on the Farm Household Support Amendment (Ancillary Benefits) Bill 2010, and I appreciate the presence of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry at the table. I give him permission to leave—he must have a lot to do back in his office! He can read my remarks in Hansard later. I am sure he will. I want to acknowledge the efforts of the minister and the government. We in the opposition do not think they are quite there yet in terms of drought support, but we also recognise that drought support, exceptional circumstances relief payments and, more importantly, the interest rate subsidy are enormous costs on the budget and if we can work out a way to support our farmers financially and in other ways we should do so.
This bill facilitates the trial in Western Australia, and I look forward to seeing the outcomes of that trial. I recognise that we might learn valuable things, particularly as it will be conducted in an area that is not actually under exceptional circumstances declaration. It will be good to see what comes out of the trial. Clearly not enough money has been allocated. There are some confusing reports in the media that the dollars are uncapped, but it does appear that only $12 million has been allocated in the budget. If every farmer in the area took up the trial to its fullest extent, there maybe a potential government liability of much more than that—even up to $400 million. That is a problem.
The trial itself I believe is coming at the issue with the right perspective. Farmers might receive $7,500 for farm planning, and if they undertake those farm plans they could then be eligible for $60,000 to put in, for example, better integrated water infrastructure or some other technological investments on their farm—maybe lock-up paddocks for sustainable grazing systems. So the door to another $60,000 would be opened, and then I understand there would also be a further $20,000 for environmental benefits for farms. So it is quite modest. If you compare it with what is available now, sure, the household support, which is the fortnightly payment from Centrelink, is still there, and that is a good thing. We all appreciate the way that that continues to put food on the table for our farming families, but I can certainly say that were it not for the exceptional circumstances interest rate subsidy almost the entire western division of New South Wales would be on its knees right now.
That is the constant feedback I get from every rural financial counsellor, both at state level and at federal level, as I travel in the western part of my electorate. I do acknowledge that these are large sums of money, and that if you have received as a farming enterprise $300,000 of interest rate subsidy from the federal government, even $500,000 in some cases, then that is significant support. We have to look at a policy purpose that is more than just allocating dollars to individual businesses; it has to recognise the vital nature of our farm sector and the need for it to continue. If these farms go under, and frequently they do, they often do not get resumed as working, productive properties. I guess the good thing about those who have gone broke in western New South Wales is that they have been able to sell to businessmen in many cases, and occasionally overseas buyers—people from outside the area who have paid a good price but have not necessarily farmed the land. In many cases they may visit only at weekends, and that becomes a problem for neighbours when they have to deal with an absentee neighbour and feral animals and pests et cetera. We know, and I know, that the productivity of this land is the most important thing that governments should be recognising and facilitating to the greatest extent that they can.
In conversations I have had with our rural financial counsellors, they have acknowledged that a better system needs to be found. They are frustrated by the seeming endlessness of the drought, though in many areas in the west it is now looking pretty good, and it is terrific to see that. However, one hazard gives way to another. We now have plague locusts, and when they hatch in spring and summer they will be extremely problematic. I appreciated the briefing we had last week from the Australian Plague Locust Commission. I recall that outfit from when I was involved in the agriculture portfolio in the last government. It is a bit clumsy because it only has a mandate to deal with plague locusts when they cross state boundaries and therefore has to work in conjunction with the state bodies that do the same thing, and clearly that is messy. What is needed is a national plan and something that gives effect to that national plan while recognising that state and federal funding should be included in it. So now drought has given way, unfortunately, to plague locusts.
I remember having been involved in exceptional circumstances declarations across my electorate. Sadly, most of my electorate is still in exceptional circumstances, although I expect that much of it will come out of exceptional circumstances when those declarations are lifted towards the end of this year or early next year. I can remember having long, intense discussions with the National Rural Advisory Council, which is the independent body that makes the recommendations to government. I do not mind the process, although it did sometimes get unnecessarily complicated. You cannot expect a federal government bureaucracy to understand the lie of the land in terms of rainfall history, drought prospects, stock-carrying numbers and all the other statistics that make up a case for drought relief, but one of the biggest battles that we had as members in this place was to convince the National Rural Advisory Council that low irrigation allocations actually warranted drought support. The criteria had been set for grazing and pastoral enterprises, but what we were seeing in the New South Wales and Victorian Murray in the early years—2003 and 2004—was extreme no-water and low-water allocations. So there were irrigators who were receiving the notionally normal rainfall for their areas but were not able to access any irrigation water because their general security allocation was zero.
I give credit to Wendy Craik, who was the head of NRAC in those days, because she accepted the message and pushed hard, and we had a change of policy in that area which has seen irrigators receive EC relief. I have already talked about the pastoralists being on their knees, but I assure everybody in this House that the irrigators would have been decimated if they had not received that EC relief. I know that water policy, while it has an influence on agriculture policy, does not come under this particular area of government, but it clearly intersects with it, and we are crying out for a better water policy for farmers. Farmers are desperately unhappy with the current government’s approach, and as they are beginning to face the sustainable diversion limits that will come with the draft basin plan due out in a few weeks time I am getting a lot of desperate calls from people who feel that they are being ignored by the hierarchy. Towns will get all the water they need and should get, the environment will get all the water it needs—although, while we want the environment to be well catered for, I am not certain that I would put it above the needs of irrigated agriculture in every case and on every day—but farmers are saying, ‘Okay, so you have towns getting their water, you have the environment getting its water and, if there is any left, we get it; so we are the ones who have to give up the most.’
Opinion is divided on whether we are facing climate change in the Murray-Darling Basin. Some farmers say they do not believe that we are, but some will quite freely admit that the circumstances that they see on their farms every day strongly indicate that something is changing permanently. But, if we are facing climate change, we have to manage irrigated agriculture with less water, and we are doing that. Previously, there was up to $6 billion allocated to a fund directed towards farmers to enable them to update their own infrastructure on-farm. So a farmer could update their water delivery system receiving a grant by the government—doing that is so capital intensive that you could never do afford to do it on your own—and then give the government back a proportion of the water saved. The disappointing feature of the current government’s policy is that the current Minister for Climate Change, Energy Efficiency and Water has made it very clear that she does not believe that taxpayers’ money should be allocated on-farm to people’s individual farm infrastructure. I think that is a huge mistake, because if you want to achieve the outcome you have to recognise that the main actors in the scheme are the farmers and they really do have to embrace the change and want to make it happen.
The policy currently in place buys back water—at the moment I think about 700 gigalitres of water have been bought back from the Murray Darling Basin—but there has not been the commitment by farmers to see it through. There has not been a recognition of the need for it, and the government certainly has not spelled out a real plan for that 700 gigalitres of water. It is fine to embark on a water buyback and—although I do not agree with this—say, ‘We have to take this out of the system; the system has been overallocated,’ but that is no use unless there is a sensible and comprehensive plan.
I know that an environmental watering plan is being developed which is going to be released with the basin plan and the sustainable diversion limit, but I am not confident that there is sufficient understanding in that plan of how to get the water to all the environmental sites. For example, there are certain wetlands that you can only flood when you have a king tide. So water is needed in order to carry water to a place to produce an environmental outcome, and if there is not enough water to create conditions that are completely counterseasonal—though there should not be, and I can see no reason why you would want to do that—delivery of the water is impossible. There is the Barmah Choke on the way, which has a constraint on the number of megalitres it can pass each day. There is also the interaction between the Menindee Lakes and the Darling River as well as that between the Murrumbidgee River and the Lachlan Catchment, out of which a significant amount of water has been bought. We know that the Lachlan has not flowed into the Murray for at least a hundred years, so it is clear that that water is not going to find its way down the river very easily.
My main concern, as it always tends to be when I am talking on agricultural matters, is the lack of water for irrigated agriculture. It is continually exacerbated by low storages in the Murray-Darling. The Hume Dam is currently only at 22 per cent of capacity; Dartmouth Dam is at 31.9 per cent. The Menindee Lakes, and this is absolutely fabulous, are at 85 percent. A few weeks ago, on a visit to Broken Hill, I travelled out to Menindee and watched the regulators being opened to move water from Lake Pamamaroo into Lake Menindee at, I think, a rate of 15,000 megs a day. It was an absolutely magnificent sight.
I am always so disappointed when the water in Menindee Lakes becomes a political football and various people decide that it is their water and that there are wetlands or Lower Lakes or storages upstream that deserve that water more. Although there is some man-made aspect to Menindee, Menindee itself is a world-class wetland and should be recognised as such. So for the water to be flowing into the fourth lake in the Menindee Lakes system and for some people to describe it as wasted because there is no outlet—well there is a very small outlet, but its carrying capacity is quite limited—is very disappointing to me. I would encourage people to go out there and have a look. Everyone should try to journey into inland Australia and look at the water at Cooper Creek and Innamincka and Birdsville and all the way down the Darling. There are arguments that you can see it better from the air, but it is pretty good from the ground as well.
So it is terrific to see Menindee Lakes at 85 per cent capacity. Lake Victoria further down the system is, at 56 per cent, reflecting better inflows from the Darling River. But it is distressing to see Hume Dam still only at 22 per cent. Until we get really good rains in the upper Murray catchment, we are not going to have the confidence return to the irrigation sector or the feeling that they can cope with government buybacks of water.
The exceptional circumstances regime has served our farmers very well. I would simply ask the government to take really great care in designing its replacement and to recognise that one of the main beneficiaries of the schemes has been the banks. The banks received 50 per cent of farm interest payments and that has enabled banks to, in their words, ‘lend with confidence’, carry on supporting farm businesses and maybe not take the action that they might have considered had that interest rates subsidy not been there.
But it is also incumbent on the banks to recognise the great benefits they have received from the exceptional circumstances interest rate subsidy. There has been a solid and sound transfer of taxpayers’ money to the banking sector to enable rural Australia to stay afloat, and I expect the banking sector to give as good as we gave them. When I talk to the economists for our major banks, I hear that in terms of liquidity requirements after the Basel III discussions that are happening in Europe at the moment that banks may find they have to carry more cash reserves. That will of course affect the amount of money they can lend. I sometimes pick up the sense that the rural sector needs to watch out. Of course, that means it might not be so simple and so on and so on. There is no reason, whatever the liquidity constraints are, for the rural sector to not be looked after by the banks. We know that, whenever there is a rural upturn, banks that have kept quiet in the marketplace—I am not naming names—leap out of the blocks and they are out there starting up a new agribusiness, knocking on farm doors and being aggressive in that marketplace. They need very much to plan for the long term and they need very much to recognise the great benefits they get. If you look at the standard mortgage rate and the margin that some farmers are paying, particularly if you are with one of our pastoral lending houses, those margins are significant.
The member for Mallee mentioned in this place last week his great concern about behaviour of banks. It does concern me when somebody running a farm business has their finances, their livestock and their merchandise all tied up with one lender. Sometimes that is the only lender they are able to access, but it is not a good situation for any business to be in. It gives the lender an unreasonable ability to control the farm operation and it really disturbs me. I have heard of situations where that lender suggests to a farmer: ‘You need cash flow, so you need to buy sheep; you need to restock. The stock price is sky high but we’ll advance you the money.’ And everything that the farmer’s better judgment is telling them is that they should just hold back, just wait, just see what the price for livestock does. Maybe the paddocks need to recover more and they are not confident that the rainfall is where it needs to be, but they are pushed into this. That is the situation that the member for Mallee and all of us who represent these pastoral areas of western New South Wales and South Australia are aware of. We are monitoring the situation carefully and closely and we are very keen always to hear about individual circumstances that we feel might be translating into unacceptable banking practices.
I would like to conclude my remarks today by recognising the death of Rob Seekamp on a pastoral property near Broken Hill earlier this week. The minister may have met him. He was the chair of the Pastoralists Association of West Darling. He was lost in his Cessna 172 mustering aeroplane on Monday. He was found yesterday. Tributes are flowing in. The people of Broken Hill and the people of the far west are shattered at the loss of this great fighter for their region. I can remember the pastoralists association, led by Rob Seekamp, coming to Canberra when the dust storms hit the western division. They had a great response from the minister and they appreciated that. We had several meetings in this place and we facilitated not the greatest help that perhaps could have been made, but I am not suggesting that had we been in government we could have done any better. There were state responsibilities there as well. We rely a lot on people who selflessly work to make their areas better places to live and who go through the trying and sometimes difficult and expensive representations they constantly have to make to government. To Rob’s family—Vicki and his children and his adopted children—I pass on my heartfelt condolences and say that he will be remembered in Broken Hill by those of those of us who knew him.
I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT AMENDMENT (ANCILLARY BENEFITS) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,32,1,speech
"Burke, Tony, MP",ALP,2010-06-24,"—in reply—I thank all members who contributed to the debate on the Farm Household Support Amendment (Ancillary Benefits) Bill 2010. I particularly thank the member for Farrer for the comments at the end of her contribution. I was unaware of the tragic circumstances that befell Rob Seekamp. It is an appropriate thing to bring to the attention of the House, and on behalf of the government I also extend our deepest sympathies. As soon as it was mentioned, I remembered the meeting I had with Rob to discuss the dust storms. Not only was he a thoroughly decent man who was so clearly connected with his community but he had very cleverly brought photographs of properties in the area that he knew I had visited so that I could completely understand the extent of the devastation that the dust storms had caused. So I thank the member for Farrer for making us aware of that, and I extend to Mr Seekamp’s family the deepest sympathies of the government and, I am sure, all members of the House of Representatives.
If I can turn to one other issue, Mr Deputy Speaker, that does not relate to the bill but was referred to in debate by the member for New England, there is an understandable frustration for people in the Bundarra region that there has been such a long wait to get certainty as to whether they would get an exceptional circumstances declaration. A number of issues have contributed to this challenge. One of them has been that state governments, understandably, always want to apply for the biggest possible area they can for exceptional circumstances declarations. Because the National Rural Advisory Council has to do an averaging across the region, if the region applied for is big, it is harder to get the approval. Bundarra has been going back and forth over a number of applications. With the latest one, the advice from NRAC is with government. I am working to get that through the processes of government as quickly as possible so we can make an announcement and provide certainty. The people of Bundarra should be well assured that the member for New England has been consistent in making their case known to government, and I certainly do hope it is not too much longer before we are able to provide them with an answer.
Turning to the contributions on the bill, first of all, there are occasions when different members of the House, including different members of the opposition, provide very different perspectives. There are times when politically it works and can be convenient to try to drive some sort of wedge and say, ‘There’s a split—there’s a difference of opinion between the Liberal and National parties.’ On this occasion, I can say that the differences that have been expressed in this debate about the future of the trial are, I think, a great example of members of parliament understanding the particular circumstances of their regions. This goes to one of the reasons why we have decided to embark on a trial rather than go immediately to a national rollout of a new drought policy. Getting this right is difficult and incredibly complex. It affects different parts of our nation in very different ways. That is why we have found some members of parliament to be highly supportive of aspects of the trial and some members of parliament to be sceptical, not about whether the program is worth taking forward but about whether it could appropriately be a replacement in the future for the current drought policy settings that we have. I commend all members of parliament on the issues that they have raised—I do think it reflects the complexity of this.
A number of members of the opposition, though, have raised a concern about why the money which has been allocated is not nearly enough to allow all the 6,000 farmers within the Western Australian trial region to be able to apply for and receive the on-farm grants. There is a very good reason why a smaller amount of money has been allocated, and that is: we are embarking on a trial. I do not want to pretend that in a trial we can immediately roll out enough support for 6,000 farmers to develop strategic plans. I do not want to pretend that we can do that in 12 months. I do not believe we can and I want to have the benefit of assisting a much smaller group—I mentioned in the second reading speech that it would probably be in the order of 150—where we can work on the strategies with the farmers, with them having control of it, and get plans together that actually make a difference for those properties into the future and co-invest with them. Doing that with smaller numbers will mean we will iron out the problems and work out how, if we go to a larger rollout, the strategic plans can be made in the most effective way. If you rolled out all 6,000 during a 12-month trial, you would necessarily create a situation where your best quality consultants were being spread too thinly, which would run the very real risk of paying people to assist farmers to put together a strategic plan where the quality of what resulted would not be part of the long-term vision for Australian agriculture that this trial hopes we can get to.
If we take this in a methodical way and are careful initially as to how many farms are involved in the planning process, while making sure that the food on the table money is available for the entire region, as it ought to be—but we are careful with the rollout of anything connected to the strategic plans—I do believe we will land in a much better policy zone and the trial will be used for the actual purposes that you would want a trial to be used for: to test different methods so that whoever is in government when the trial period concludes can look at the results and say, ‘Okay, if we’re going to roll this out nationally, these are the bits we would want to change.’ I think that serves the parliament very well.
To those members of parliament who have expressed concern about the trial, I want to express my deep gratitude that nobody has sought to prevent passage of the legislation. The legislation itself simply provides for extra benefits, such as the healthcare card, to be made available to recipients of support. Had the opposition sought to they could have blocked it. I appreciate that the opposition have not sought to do that.

Mr Baldwin interjecting—
—That is right. There is still time if you wish to, Member for Paterson! But, in anticipation, I convey my thanks to those senators from the opposition who I understand have indicated that they will try to ensure speedy passage of this legislation when it is sent to the other place in the coming hours. I commend the bill to the House.

Message from the Governor-General recommending appropriation announced.",REPS,<title>FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT AMENDMENT (ANCILLARY BENEFITS) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,32,1,speech
"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,2010-06-24,"—I rise to speak in support of the Autonomous Sanctions Bill 2010, which, according to the government, is designed to:
… strengthen Australia’s autonomous sanctions regime by allowing greater flexibility in the range of measures Australia can implement, beyond those achievable under existing instruments, thus ensuring Australia’s autonomous sanctions can match the scope and extent of measures implemented by like-minded states.
This bill will enable Australia to implement autonomous sanctions without having to rely on legislation that is, in fact, intended for other purposes.
While the coalition support this bill in principle, we propose to refer it to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee because of our concerns about the domestic privacy implications of the bill. These concerns arise from this passage in the second reading speech of the Minister for Foreign Affairs:
… the bill will facilitate access to information for purposes associated with the administration of sanction laws by removing impediments for the sharing of such information within the Commonwealth, and allowing specially designated Commonwealth entities, responsible for the administration and enforcement of sanction laws, to require, by written notice, the production of documents and written information—including under oath—from persons outside of government in order to determine whether a sanction law is being complied with.
The opposition believes that the government should elaborate on this aspect of the bill to satisfy the privacy concerns arising from this passage in the second reading speech.
Sanctions are an alternative to military force whereby the behaviour of an offending country or regime is punished economically, politically or socially. Sanctions can be imposed through the United Nations system by way of targeted measures aimed at removing a threat or the circumstances that have led to a threat to international peace and security. Autonomous sanctions can be imposed by individual countries.
There is ongoing global debate about the role and effectiveness of sanctions and whether they can achieve their stated aims. Sanctions have been imposed by nations against other nations throughout recorded history. Security analysts have pointed to the trade sanctions imposed by the ancient Athenians against their rivals in Sparta in the 5th century BC, for example. But, as students of ancient history would be aware, that led to essentially a trade war—the Peloponnesian War—which lasted 30 years.
The use of sanctions has been prominent at various times in our history. Currently, we are experiencing a significant increase in the use of sanctions, particularly those imposed by international blocs of nations under the auspices of the United Nations Security Council. I note the Minister for Foreign Affairs argued that sanctions were not effective during the Cold War years because any attempt to impose sanctions by one of the superpowers—the United States or the Soviet Union—was strategically undermined by the other. There is little doubt that this policy of the two global giants at the time of gaining competitive advantage over the other made sanctions an ineffective tool. Throughout the Cold War the only United Nations imposed sanctions were essentially against Rhodesia and South Africa and that action was broadly supported by the international community. It has long been the challenge with sanctions to get all relevant nations to agree to impose and to act to enforce the sanctions.
The ultimate goal of sanctions is to force changes in behaviour from the target government or regime. They will suffer significant economic costs if they refuse to alter their behaviour. A United States publication in 2003 entitled Economic sanctions: examining their philosophy and efficacy pointed out that economic sanctions can be imposed in myriad forms and with vastly different impacts on the nations subject to sanctions. It makes the observation that the ability to ramp up the economic cost over time allows for progressively stronger messages to be sent about the behaviour causing concern.
However, the publication also points out that there is an inevitable cost to the nation imposing the sanctions, as its companies and citizens are often prevented from pursuing investment opportunities. It is vital that any nation imposing sanctions has the economic and political means to enforce them for the length of time that it can take to have the desired effect. The longer that sanctions are maintained the greater the pressure on the sanctioned nation. There can also be increasing tension from the commercial domestic interests lobbying for an easing of sanctions. This has led to some nations imposing strict sanctions but turning a blind eye to commercial links or failing to enforce the terms of the sanctions.
Increasingly, sanctions have been regarded as the alternative to military action and are therefore seen as a more palatable method of dealing with rogue regimes, for example. Many international security experts regard sanctions as one of the tools that should first be employed and as a precursor to military action only should that ultimately be required. They also argue that sanctions must be pursued to first convince the public that every possible avenue had been pursued before taking additional further steps, such as military action.
United States security analyst Dr M Shane Smith, now of the United States National Defence University, argued in an essay published in 2004 entitled ‘Sanctions: diplomatic tool or warfare by other means?’ for the imposition of what he described as ‘smart sanctions’, which are carefully targeted and which include an element of incentive as well as punishment—a carrot-and-stick approach. A United Nations report in 2000 entitled The sanctions decade: assessing UN strategies in the 1990s was critical of the approach to sanctions in that punitive measures are often not balanced against rewards for improved behaviour.
Incentives can range from the economic to the diplomatic, including the opportunity to participate in international forums, amongst other things. One of the conundrums regarding the effectiveness of economic sanctions is that, the more damaging the sanctions, the more likely they are to work in harming the sanctioned nation economically. This can often impact on the broader population more severely than on the target government or regime. Conversely, economic sanctions run the risk of hurting the most vulnerable in a nation to the point that that fatally undermines their effectiveness. And herein lies the diabolical dilemma: sanctions can inflict damage to the target country or target population to the point where there is capitulation to the demands of the sanctioning country or powers, yet the sanctioning country or powers are rightly concerned by the moral or humanitarian implications of the sanctions and need to devise ways to get supplies to those most in need.
A case in point is North Korea. While broad based sanctions are called for, a collapse of North Korea would cause a massive flood of refugees into the region. The desired result—the end to North Korea’s nuclear program and its provocative behaviour in pursuit of it—must be put in this context. There is a view that sanctions are more likely to work if there is an organised domestic political opposition force which can build political pressure on the government. However, in the absence of such opposition, sanctions can sometimes bolster domestic public support for a regime that blames an external enemy for all the woes of the nation.
Dr Shane Smith also warns that strong sanctions tend to create a political atmosphere of anxiety and paranoia, which greatly increases the possibility of armed conflict. International economic pressure could also create incentives for authoritarian regimes to be even more repressive toward the opposition forces in order to hold on to power. Burma is a prime example. The more pressure from the international community, the more determined the regime seems to be in its efforts to destroy the chances of the main opposition, the National League for Democracy, as it was, and its leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, from taking any role in the country.
I met with Aung San Suu Kyi in 1995 and I think that any person who has spent any time in her presence could not fail to be overwhelmed by her inspiring and moral example of leadership. The Burma regime, having been humiliated in the 1989 election when Aung San Suu Kyi’s party won 89 per cent of the parliamentary seats, appears ever more determined not to concede to foreign pressure in the event that it weakened its claim, albeit spurious, to legitimacy and popular support.
Despite these risks and consequences, sanctions have proven to be an effective way of encouraging governments to adopt behaviour that is in line with the values of the international community. Historically it is fair to say that sanctions have played an important role in affecting the behaviour of many governments or regimes around the world. While they are far from perfect, I would argue they have helped avert military conflict in many instances. Sanctions can have a devastating impact on regimes in pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and they did play an important role in preventing Saddam Hussein obtaining nuclear weapons, for example.
Currently, sanctions are imposed on a range of nations, with most attention focused on North Korea and Iran in relation to nuclear programs. There are existing United Nations Security Council sanctions against North Korea that are yet to be fully enforced. For there to be any change, there would need to be a united international front, particularly from the Security Council members. That is not a given. The same applies to Iran. Recently a Russian Foreign Ministry deputy said that he doubted the sanctions imposed on Iran would be effective in this situation.
Iran has been accused of pursuing nuclear weapons, an accusation denied by the regime, but its ongoing refusal to fully cooperate with international nuclear inspectors has raised international concerns. This is a critical issue for the world, as Israel has threatened military action against nuclear facilities in Iran—an action that would almost certainly trigger retaliation from Iran and its proxies, with a potentially devastating impact on the globe. There is an obvious need for sanctions against Iran to work effectively and for Iran to open up its nuclear program to inspectors who can certify that its program is for peaceful power generation purposes. The consequences of the alternative are too terrible to contemplate.
North Korea, in contrast, has detonated nuclear devices in breach of United Nations Security Council resolutions and remains a source of deep tension in the region. Punitive sanctions have impacted on the regime and the long-suffering people of North Korea but have had limited impact on the behaviour of the regime. Its recent provocative action in allegedly sinking a South Korean navy ship has raised tensions close to breaking point. We must continue to trust that targeted sanctions can work to bring about a change in the behaviour of rogue regimes around the world.
In the case of autonomous sanctions imposed by our country, they are in place against Burma, North Korea, Zimbabwe, Iraq, the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Fiji, and they range from financial sanctions to travel restrictions, the suspension of government-to-government links and the like.
Autonomous sanctions against Burma have been in place since October 2007 and against members of the Burmese regime, their associates and their supporters. In response to the regime’s crackdown on pro-democracy activists in 2007, the former, coalition government introduced bans on financial dealings in Australia on about 400 Burmese officials and associates. At the time, foreign minister Downer described them as ‘the strongest financial measures available under existing Australian legislation against countries or individuals that are not subject to United Nations Security Council sanctions’.
North Korea has been subject to Australian autonomous sanctions since 2006, and Zimbabwe since September 2002, targeting the Mugabe regime and its supporters. Autonomous sanctions from Australia were employed against Iran from October 2008 and against the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from June 1992, targeting those indicted or suspected of war crimes during the early 1990s. Autonomous sanctions have been in place against Fiji since December 2006.
The coalition believes that autonomous sanctions can in appropriate circumstances play an important role in sending clear messages to regimes or countries that their behaviour is unacceptable to the norms of our regions. That is why the coalition supports this bill; it streamlines and improves the ability of the government to impose sanctions against regimes whose behaviour is out of step with accepted international behaviour. Sanctions are not a solution to every international situation, nor are they generally able to provide rapid changes in aberrant behaviour—or abhorrent behaviour. They are one of the ways in which the international community can show solidarity with countries where some have adopted behaviour that threatens to undermine stability or threatens their neighbours and beyond.
I note that sanctions are considered by the Australian people to be a productive tool in foreign policy terms. The Lowy Institute for International Policy recently conducted a poll called ‘Australia and the world: public opinion and foreign policy’. One question related to Iran’s development of nuclear weapons. It is interesting to note that, after ‘diplomatic negotiations’ with 85 per cent support, 69 per cent of those surveyed supported ‘economic sanctions’ as a favoured response to Iran’s behaviour.
The Autonomous Sanctions Bill 2010 will provide added flexibility to Australia to implement autonomous sanctions that reflect our belief that a type of behaviour is unacceptable and must be changed to avert more serious action. Rather than having to rely on existing legislation to implement autonomous sanctions, Australia will have available to it a more flexible range of foreign policy options to demand a change of behaviour. Subject to the point about referring the passage on privacy considerations to the relevant Senate committee, I commend this bill to the House.",REPS,<title>AUTONOMOUS SANCTIONS BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"McMullan, Bob, MP",ALP,2010-06-24,"—I thank the opposition for their support for this measure and I thank the shadow minister for foreign affairs for that contribution. As she was saying, the Autonomous Sanctions Bill 2010, which I of course rise to support, is to support what has been and remains an important facet of diplomacy—not just for Australia, but it has been substantially used by Australia in recent years—that is, autonomous sanctions. Australia is one of a number of countries which seek positive change around the world by supplementing United Nations Security Council sanctions and stepping in in circumstances where it is either inappropriate or not possible for the United Nations Security Council to act and impose sanctions which we as sovereign nation can implement under other legislation. This legislation does not need to cover a Security Council type sanction because we already have a legislative framework for that.
This bill will improve Australia’s capacity to respond quickly to issues of international concern by allowing greater flexibility in the range of measures Australia can implement beyond those that we can achieve under existing arrangements. I note the remarks, reported by the shadow minister, of the former foreign minister, Mr Downer, about the need for us to make these sorts of changes. This bill reflects the government’s intention to allow Australia to participate fully in concerted international action against individuals and regimes of concern.
I want to talk for a moment about why we need autonomous sanctions in Australian diplomacy. The UN Charter authorises the United Nations Security Council to impose sanctions in situations that it has determined breach or threaten international peace and security. In order for UN Security Council sanctions to be implemented, two-thirds of the 15 members must agree on each of the sanction measures, and—this is usually the most significant element—all five permanent members of the UN Security Council must assent to the measures and be satisfied the situation in question does threaten or breach international peace and security. We can all think of examples where a country like Australia might have wished to take action but a consensus among the P5, as they are called, could not be achieved. There are therefore some situations of serious international concern that have not been subject to Security Council sanctions because one or more of the five permanent members have not assented or the Security Council has not determined that the situation threatens or breaches international peace and security by the required two-thirds majority.
Examples of such situations include, as the shadow minister mentioned, the situation in Burma, which is close to the hearts of many Australians and of course many Australians of Burmese origin, some of whom were in my office only yesterday talking to me about the situation in Burma, particularly on the Thai-Burma border, and welcomed the changes that the foreign minister announced in our approach, particularly with regard to development assistance in Burma—and that is very difficult issue.
We were particularly concerned about the violent crackdown by the Burmese regime on the pro-democracy protests in 2007, but there is a long history of these sorts of repressive activities, going back to the election when the National League for Democracy had the temerity not only to contest the election but to win it! That clearly was not in the regime’s plan. It was okay about them contesting it but not about them doing the unwelcome thing of getting massive public support. So the result was never accepted, and we have had serious extensions of human rights abuses since that time. In a place like Burma, where the human rights and the democratic aspirations of people have been denied, Australia has taken, and will be facilitated to take more effectively in the future, autonomous sanctions.
We have a complicated situation in our region with Fiji, one of Australia’s best friends. The military coup in December 2006 continues to deny the population of Fiji their constitutional rights. Some of the basic freedoms—for example, freedom of the press—are being seriously impaired and we cannot get an agreement for a prompt return to democracy. We need to look at targeted autonomous sanctions. We do not want to see the people of Fiji hurt, we do not wish to see the economy of Fiji collapse, but we do want to see a return to democracy. This requires a scalpel rather than a broadsword. We need to have an array of measures that allow a complex situation like Fiji to be dealt with. There is also, of course, the situation in Zimbabwe. The Mugabe regime has been responsible for many acts that were unacceptable to Australia and the international community. The post-election government of national unity is struggling to establish itself and re-establish the legitimate arms of government. This requires a targeted set of sanctions that are specifically designed for the emerging situation in Zimbabwe.
Australia is one of a number of like-minded countries—including the United States, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and other members of the European Union—which actively seek to bring about positive change by applying pressure through autonomous sanctions. It is not only in situations where the Security Council is unable or unwilling to act; sometimes there are situations where UN Security Council sanctions are in place but Australia and other states may seek to supplement them through additional measures of the kind approved under this legislation. The Security Council has dealt with issues relating to both Iran and the DPRK, and Australia and other countries have imposed financial sanctions and travel sanctions on a range of persons that are broader than required under Security Council sanctions.
Let me take a bit of time to look at Australia’s use of autonomous sanctions. Australia has actively applied autonomous sanctions as a foreign policy tool for a number of years. So, if we already do it, why do we need this legislation? As the shadow minister for foreign affairs stated in her contribution, we have been using a range of existing instruments that are laws developed for other purposes. We have used these laws for autonomous sanctions but they are imperfect instruments. This bill will allow us to be more effective. I will come back to some of the other implications in a moment, but let me give you some examples. There is the very important question of targeted financial sanctions. Australia has taken financial sanctions from time to time. They were considered to be the most effective sanctions in the case of South Africa. These sanctions are applied under the Banking (Foreign Exchange) Regulations 1959, which were, of course, originally promulgated for entirely different purposes to do with the protection of Australia’s currency and our foreign currency reserves. Arms embargoes are applied under the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958. That does not make them inappropriate but it means they can only apply to tangible goods exported from Australia. They do not apply to intangibles like software or military services, so they are becoming less relevant to the 21st-century challenges we need to address. These are regulations designed in a different era. The government recognises that the types of measures Australia would like to implement whilst working with other like-minded countries are often likely to go beyond the scope of these instruments. Particularly in the future, as technology changes, we will need to take different types of measures that might reflect the significance of these changes but are not facilitated under existing legislation.
The purpose of the bill is to not only strengthen the regime but also ensure that our autonomous sanctions match the scope and extent of measures implemented by like-minded states. We need to keep up with 21st-century demands. What we have at the moment, which we inherited, is a cobbled together patchwork under which good things have been done in the past. But it is not a framework that is sufficient for the future. The bill will provide Australia with more options to achieve the objectives of autonomous sanctions, it will give Australia greater scope and flexibility to apply targeted pressure on oppressive and destabilising regimes across the globe and it will ensure that the adverse impacts on the people of the nations affected are minimised. It is a difficult balance to strike, but this bill will introduce measures that will enable us to do more of that. Our duty to the international community and to the Australian people is to have in place the most effective tools for applying sanctions against such regimes. The bill before us seeks to provide Australia with flexibility to implement measures beyond those achievable under existing arrangements.
I will not outline the details of the bill. That was done by the minister in his second reading speech, but it is important to note that no autonomous sanctions applied under this bill will be able to override our international obligations. They are designed to be measures to make people meet their international obligations. This is constrained by WTO arrangements and free trade agreements et cetera.
Finally, the bill provides and the government will ensure that Australia’s autonomous sanctions will continue to be subject to regular review and ongoing assessment with regard to changing international needs and pressures. This is a bill for which the purpose is agreed and has been agreed by Australian governments of all political colours for a long time but it will bring a 21st century set of tools to the task. I commend the bill to the House.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2010-06-24,"—I move:
That the amendments be agreed to.
The Senate has agreed to amendments to the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Television) Bill 2010 to address issues raised by the Senate committee in its report to the bill and by industry stakeholders since the bill’s introduction. The amendments help facilitate a more effective satellite service and assist the switchover to digital-only television. They also make various technical and other changes to the bill, originally passed in this House on 13 May 2010. The government amendments extend the current exemption from the Australian Content Standard and the Children’s Television Standards and from captioning requirements on multichannel services until digital switchover is completed nationally by 31 December 2013. This will ensure that regional broadcasters can continue to provide the full range of digital services.
The government amendments will also facilitate the rollout of the full range of commercial digital television services to the smaller regional licence areas of South Australia, Broken Hill and Griffith. This will allow the commercial broadcasters in these areas to terrestrially provide an equivalent range of digital television services to those available in the metropolitan and larger regional licence areas. The government amendments also address concerns regarding the ability of the new satellite services viewers to access third party services such as the National Indigenous Television service. Passage of this bill will be a major component of the switchover to digital television, which begins in Mildura at the end of this month.",REPS,<title>BROADCASTING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,36,1,speech
"Smith, Anthony, MP",LP,2010-06-24,"—The Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Television) Bill 2010, which we are now finalising in the House, was introduced in March. The second reading debate was on 13 March. It began that day and concluded that day by agreement between the opposition and the government so that the bill could be before the Senate at the earliest opportunity. In fact, the coalition agreed to reduce our speakers’ list and our speaking times in order for the bill to be through the House on 13 May.
Last week, the government produced more than 40 pages of amendments. On Tuesday of this week, the government sought our assistance to have the bill debated in the Senate on the Wednesday—that is, the following day. We agreed to this because there are, as you would appreciate, Mr Deputy Speaker, a number of very critical elements to this bill, with the switch-over beginning in Mildura in just a few days time. There are 40 pages of amendments. The shadow minister is right that many of them do pick up recommendations of the Senate committee, but many others pick up other aspects. We feel that this has been an unsatisfactory process. The bill itself should have been introduced much earlier. The amendments should have been produced earlier and there should have been full debate on them in the Senate.
As I said, on Tuesday evening the government requested that the debate occur on the Wednesday, to which we agreed. Unfortunately, overnight, the government itself decided to list the bill so low in the order of business in the Senate that debate during the time for government business was simply not possible. However, given the critical nature of some aspects of this bill, it was agreed that it would be dealt with in the Senate today on a non-controversial basis. The government did agree not to proceed with some amendments which it, by its own admission, said were not time critical—that is, they can be dealt with in the coming weeks and months when at least they can have some proper parliamentary scrutiny, given the importance of the issues. There are many amendments to the bill. In addition to that, given the process and given the government’s track record, we say here on behalf of the opposition that it is likely that there will be more things to fix up down the track.
In order for those important provisions which are time critical to proceed through the parliament before 30 June and for those other regions facing the switch-over in the coming months, the coalition agreed for the matter to be dealt with in the non-controversial business in the Senate today. We point out, as I have said, that the process the government has chosen has been rather chaotic with such an important issue, but it was important that the critical time nature aspects of the legislation that the government highlighted were able to proceed. It was agreed that those aspects that were not time critical and in fact not really part of the Senate committee inquiry process could be dealt with another day. On that basis, it is incumbent on the government to ensure the proper implementation of these amendments. Given the rush and the government’s own listing of the legislation in the Senate which it had had for a few weeks, and given the government’s own decision to list the legislation so low that it could not considered in its own government business, there has not been the normal scrutiny you would expect on such important legislation. Nonetheless, my friend and colleague and representative in the Senate Senator Cormann has expressed in greater detail all of these concerns. But, as I said, we are supporting it. (Time expired)

Question agreed to.",REPS,<title>BROADCASTING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,36,1,speech
"Robert, Stuart, MP",LP,2010-06-24,"—I will make some very brief comments on the Autonomous Sanctions Bill 2010. The purpose of the bill is to strengthen Australia’s autonomous sanctions regime by allowing greater flexibility in the range of measures that Australia can seek to implement, therefore allowing our sanctions, which we autonomously can put in place, to match the scope and indeed the range of measures that like-minded countries are seeking to put together. There is also a range of administrative and compliance issues that go along with the bill.
Suffice to say, we live in an uncertain world. In 1986, the International Year of Peace, 46 wars ravaged the globe. I look across the desk and see the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Support. He and I have spent a fair bit of time together in uniform and overseas on operations serving our nation in uncertain times. War is a dreadful thing. Everyone would concede that it is a horrendous thing. To send young men and women into harm’s way is not something an executive would seek to do lightly. At times, the profession of arms and forced combat is indeed necessary, but it behoves all executives and the parliaments which keep them accountable to ensure that we do everything possible before engaging in the ultimate battle of wills that is armed combat. Indeed, armed combat—the force of arms—should be used only as an absolute and utter last resort.
There is any number of options that any nation of the world can take forward before resorting to force. I think I join all members of the House in hoping, and indeed praying, for a world where the force of arms is not needed. Unfortunately, the reality is we must do everything to ensure the security of our borders, of our nation and of our national interest. One of the key measures that needs to be considered before the use of force has to be the use of sanctions, of economic might, of political muscle, of the strength of our argument and our ideas, backed up by the strength of our commerce, to achieve our political end state first, before the ultimate battle of wills may be necessary. This is the role of sanctions.
As we know, there are United Nations imposed sanctions whereby the UN seeks and passes a resolution for sanctions against a particular nation. And of course there are autonomous sanctions—sanctions imposed by individual countries. In the case of Australia, we currently have a range of sanctions in place against countries such as Burma, North Korea, Zimbabwe, Iran and Fiji. These sanctions range from financial sanctions to travel restrictions and, of course, suspension of government-to-government links, not allowing ambassadors and the like to be there. The purpose of these sanctions is to send a very clear message that we as a nation will seek to stand up to tyranny, that we will not allow other countries to sink into anarchy, that we will protect the rights of democracy and that we will set an example of a First World nation as it seeks to do its bit in bringing about a world far freer from the threats of violence, from disease and from hunger. That is why various governments have taken the move to put sanctions against such dictatorial and brutal regimes as Burma, North Korea, Zimbabwe and Iran, and nations where constitutional democracy has unfortunately failed, like Fiji.
The challenge is that currently sanctions are imposed by relying on legislation that is intended for other purposes. I thought the Minister for Foreign Affairs in his second reading speech gave a very good example of where governments currently do that. For example, financial sanctions imposed autonomously by Australia are actually applied by using the Banking (Foreign Exchange) Regulations 1959. These regulations were originally promulgated for the protection of our nation’s currency and the regulation of our foreign currency reserves. However, we have used that bill to provide the basis for financial sanctions against some nations of the world.
The purpose of the bill before us today, the Autonomous Sanctions Bill, is to provide greater flexibility and responsiveness in imposing sanctions from our nation on a range of countries without having to rely on using a range of other legislation that was not fit for purpose. Providing this flexibility and giving government the vehicle and the powers it needs to appropriately and legally impose sanctions for the betterment of mankind in other parts of the world is sensible, is right and is supported. Sanctions, where appropriate, are absolutely supported, especially if they are targeted and mindful of past events.
The coalition believes autonomous sanctions can play a very significant part in sending a very clear message. If we look at regimes like those in Iran, North Korea and Burma—regimes where democracy is not permitted, where human rights are grossly violated, where independent political parties seeking to represent people are not allowed and where trade unions are not permitted—for these countries it is appropriate for a nation like Australia to seek to use sanctions to send a very clear message that freedom is not just for a few; freedom is for all. People in countries must be free to assemble under trade unions. As a Liberal, I actually take great pride in fighting for the rights of people to assemble in a trade union. They have that right and they should have that right to seek to come together. They should also have the right not to be a member of a union. They should have the right to join a political party and to seek office. People should have the right of free speech, cognisant of course of the needs of others. People should have the rights of travel and expression.
People should be able to enjoy freedom in all its realms and, as a first-world nation, we are not ignorant of the plight of others nor do we ignore them or turn the other way. We seek to use every measure at our disposal that is sensible, appropriate and warranted to achieve the end of sending a clear, appropriate and compassionate message that, whilst we care for the peoples of other nations, at times we do not care for their unelected dictatorial representatives. I would rather use sanctions to achieve a political end state and I would rather we seek to continue to use sanctions than move to rely upon force.
I am not blind to the fact that force is sometimes required, that it can be all too necessary. As we speak, there are 3½ thousand Australian combat soldiers deployed overseas on a range of operations seeking to assist, help and support people who are suffering under dictatorial, oppressive and brutal regimes and insurgencies. I am not blind to the fact that the force of arms is necessary and that the price of peace is eternal vigilance. There is no way for us to move away from that, but this bill provides the platform we need to allow appropriate measures to be used first, one of those being sanctions.
I note that there has been a range of privacy concerns raised by the coalition on this bill. I believe the bill is being referred to a Senate inquiry to further tease out some of those privacy issues that arise, because the bill facilitates access to information for purposes to allow the bill to be enacted. Whilst on the surface this would seem appropriate, the due course of parliamentary oversight does require the bill to be analysed in greater detail, and I certainly applaud the Senate for taking that move. The Autonomous Sanctions Bill 2010 will provide an appropriate framework for the executive to undertake the role of seeking to preserve freedom and protect the rights of individuals through sanctions, and it certainly enjoys our support.",REPS,<title>AUTONOMOUS SANCTIONS BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,40,1,speech
"Kelly, Mike, MP",ALP,2010-06-24,"—I endorse the comments of my colleague the member for Fadden on this important bill, the Autonomous Sanctions Bill 2010. It is a pleasure to speak on the bill which is another tool in the armoury of the Australian government in our efforts to improve the circumstances of peace, freedom and democracy, to alleviate conditions of those suffering from oppression and to prevent those who would seek to acquire and use weapons of mass destruction in a world so threatened by such developments.
This bill will provide greater flexibility in the range of measures Australia can implement, thus ensuring Australia’s autonomous sanctions match the scope and extent of measures implemented by like-minded countries. Through this mechanism, we can work together with countries such as the United States on making sure such sanctions are effective. It will also assist the administration of, and compliance with, sanctions measures by removing distinctions between the scope and extent of autonomous sanctions and UN sanction enforcement laws.
The framework under which the regulations will be set up in this legislation will enable that flexibility to occur, with each set of regulations containing specific measures to be imposed in response to a particular situation. Dealing with these matters by regulation provides for the degree of flexibility that we need to respond to international developments in a timely way. It will also enable the government to harmonise its administration of autonomous sanctions and UN sanction enforcement laws, simplifying compliance arrangements for those entities whose business requires a regular and active engagement with the operation of such laws.
The regulations may make provision relating, amongst other things, to proscription of persons or entities, restriction or prevention of uses of, dealings with and making available assets as well as restriction or prevention of the supply, sale, transfer or procurement of goods or services. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has to be satisfied that the proposed regulations will facilitate the conduct of Australia’s relations with other countries or with entities or persons outside Australia or otherwise deal with matters, things or relationships outside Australia.
The offences under this legislation, for those who contravene the sanctions law, will involve a conviction with a possible maximum of 10 years jail and also a fine, which could be the greater of three times the value of the relevant transaction or transactions, if this can be calculated, or 2,500 penalty units. The consequences of contravening these sanctions are now identical to the contravention of Australian laws implementing the relevant United Nations Security Council sanctions under the Charter of the United Nations Act 1945. These sanctions laws will restrict the trade in a narrow class of goods and services, such as military and security goods and services, to specific regimes. They will also restrict financial transactions involving designated members or supporters of those regimes that the Australian government assesses are facilitating the repression of populations or the commission of regionally or internationally destabilising acts, including the acquisition or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The contravention of such restrictions is thus directly comparable to the relevant provisions of the Charter of the United Nations Act.
The use of sanctions is a contentious issue and has been for many years. A good colleague and friend of mine whom I served with in Iraq has produced a seminal text on the issue called Shrewd Sanctions: Statecraft and State Sponsors of Terrorism. Her name is Meghan O’Sullivan and she subsequently became an adviser to the National Security Adviser in the United States. It is relevant to refer to something she stated in that work. She said:
… the use of sanctions must be appropriately coupled with that of other policy tools. Sanctions on their own will result in little more than raised expectations, ones that are almost certain to be disappointed. Imposing sanctions in itself does not constitute a foreign policy strategy; sanctions are policy instruments that need to be combined with other tools in order to form coherent and effective strategies.
I can only endorse those words. Sanctions are one of a range of approaches that must be taken to achieve success. There are many historic examples of where that has been the case, where sanctions have been successful—for example, in dealings with Libya and in Bosnia, in the former Yugoslavia, back in the nineties.
One of the most important examples when looking at the impact of sanctions is the situation that applied in Iraq, which I had a very close association with. We are aware that the sanctions regimes that were put in place after the first Gulf War in 1991 were aimed at preventing Iraq from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. The Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein at the time sought to exploit that situation, however, by transferring the pain of sanctions to his own population while attempting to use his revenue from oil to develop weapons capabilities and to also satisfy his own lust for power.
Later on, the United Nations introduced the oil for food program, which was meant to ameliorate that situation for the population. This of course became a notable incident in our own history through the Australian Wheat Board saga. That was an issue that I became closely involved with, as we were going through the material and examining the sources of information that revealed the extent of the contravention of the oil for food program in Iraq. That became a sorry saga of note which was also delved into by the Cole commission of inquiry. It is a matter of record that it was a great travesty that this country went to war to enforce sanctions which were in fact being actively undermined by the Australian Wheat Board, which was putting into the back pocket of Saddam Hussein around $300 million. That was going into his war chest at a time when we were sending soldiers in to fight Saddam Hussein. It was a travesty of a situation in this nation’s history.
The effects of the sanctions regime in Iraq were catastrophic in many ways. Other than creating the effect that was sought, in limiting Iraq’s ability to acquire weapons of mass destruction, sanctions created a criminalised economy, particularly the spawning of a widespread smuggling regime in relation to oil. It became a primary responsibility of mine to try to defeat that while I was in Iraq. Sanctions also helped to destroy a diversified economy, which made it very difficult in the reconstruction phase post the combat phase in Iraq, and we subsequently went to war with Iraq in 2003.
On the positive side, the effect of the sanctions did in fact keep $250 billion, approximately, out of the hands of Saddam Hussein during that time and slow him down in his attempt to acquire weapons of mass destruction. The episode in Iraq is quite an interesting example of where sanctions can have positive and negative effects as a policy tool. It shows that they need to be complemented by other policy actions.
One of the primary purposes of being able to introduce this Autonomous Sanctions Bill is to target, in particular, oppressive and abhorrent regimes. One of the primary examples of that in the world today is Iran. Just recently we have seen the introduction of yet another United Nations Security Council resolution, 1929, imposing new sanctions against Iran. They have had a terrible record of not complying or being honest in their dealings with the International Atomic Energy Agency. This concerns their attempts to acquire weapons of mass destruction—that is, nuclear weapons—and to weaponise their nuclear capability.
The ongoing failure of Iran to comply has led to this latest resolution, which strengthens obligations on states to prevent the supply to Iran of any goods or services that could contribute to Iran’s proliferation-sensitive nuclear industry and missile delivery and technology programs. There are additional obligations on states to prevent the supply of military equipment and related services to Iran. The resolution also targets, importantly, Iran’s transport and financial sectors, as well as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in response to its role in Iran’s nuclear activities and the development of nuclear weapons delivery systems. This resolution includes new financial sanctions against 41 individuals and entities in Iran.
Australia will impose sanctions additional to those outlined or required by UN Security Council resolution 1929, in particular against one individual and two organisations that assist Iran in its violation of its obligations under the Security Council resolution regime. We have been imposing autonomous sanctions on Iran since October 2008, so this will now bring to a total of 21 individuals and 20 organisations subject to our autonomous sanctions. The additional organisations include Bank Mellat and the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Line. The individual now included is General Rostam Qasemi, the commander of the Khatem ol-Anbiya Construction Organisation, a company owned by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. These are important inclusions in the sanctions regime.
To date we should note that there have been four financial institutions that have been included as special targets under the UN sanctions regime 1747, 1803 and 1929 and these include Bank Sepah, Bank Melli, Bank Saderat and the First East Export Bank. But the United States Department of Treasury has expanded that out further to designate another 17 Iranian banks, charging them with the use of deceptive financial practices to support terrorist groups and their nuclear program.
I have seen research which indicates that there are probably another 44 international banks providing corresponding banking services to those 17 banks designated by the US treasury department. This highlights the need for us to be able to promote a broader application of these sanctions, to promote broader measures, to promote broader compliance and to tighten that net in relation to the Iranians financial services. I would call upon all Australian banks—and there is some suggestion that there are Australian banks associated in these correspondent banking activities—to have a look at their relationships, and how they may relate to other Iranian financial institutions they ought not to be dealing with, in order to pursue the international goals that we have.
Let us be absolutely clear about the nature of this Iranian regime and why these sanctions are so important. It really does dishearten me that we see certain quarters of the Left in this country take it as a fashion statement to vilify Israel, for example, but do not pay due heed to, or demonstrate against or take other action to target regimes in the world like Iran and North Korea. Since the travesty of the 12 June elections last year in Iran we have seen a new wave of massive human rights violations, massive detentions without trial, extrajudicial killings, rape, torture and beatings on a massive scale whereby the Basij militia as well as the Revolutionary Guards have been involved. We have seen the great frustration of the creative genius of the Iranian people through the repressive activities of this heinous regime.
But it is not just the massive violations of human rights that this regime is responsible for in its own country; it is what it is responsible for all around the Middle East. I watched first-hand how Iran was engaged in activities promoting terrorism and insurgent activities in southern Iraq, for example, where they were involved in funding and supplying weapons to Muqtada al-Sadr’s militia forces and other insurgent groups. Iran was responsible for the permeation of the insidious improvised explosive device known as the EFP or explosively formed projectile or penetrator, which is now much more prevalent around the region and is such a lethal weapon against even armoured vehicles. This insidious weapon has certainly been sourced from Iran.
But of course it is not just in Iraq and Afghanistan that we are seeing this appear. Iran has also played a very bad faith role in its promotion of Hezbollah in southern Lebanon and, of course, Hamas, in the Gaza Strip. They have been actively involved in supplying weapons to those groups as they have been involved in supplying weapons and promoting instability among Shiite minorities throughout the region. In my dealings as Director of Middle East and Strategy Group within the defence department, it became very clear to me that many regimes, in fact all regimes in the region, were much more concerned about the intentions and activities of Iran than ever they were or would be in relation to Israel. They are certainly deeply disturbed and alarmed about Iran’s attempts to acquire nuclear weapons. Iran is a greatly destabilising force in the region and the in world in general. Their promotion of the Islamist extremism is abhorrent and we do need to confront it as aggressively as we possibly can.
This brings me to their activities to smuggle weapons into Gaza and into southern Lebanon, which relates to the incidents that we have seen recently in the unfortunate circumstances of the Gaza flotilla. We need to be aware that Israel does face the massive influx of weaponry from Iran through these various smuggling attempts, including very heavily through marine activities. Not long ago we saw the interdiction of the MV Francop, which contained 320 tonnes of ammunition destined for Hezbollah. Not long ago the Karine A was apprehended, which contained 52 tonnes of ammunition and weapons. These were high-calibre rockets and other weapons systems aimed at terrorising the population of Israel, indiscriminately targeting civilians. There is widespread smuggling that happens by land through Sudan and Yemen into Egypt and the Gaza Strip through tunnels, which Egypt is now taking vigorous action to prevent through closing off those tunnels. It was perfectly legitimate for Israel to be concerned about the smuggling of weapons, in particular through maritime means.
I will not comment on the situation that evolved in relation to the Gaza flotilla incident. This is subject to further inquiry and investigation. We should all reserve judgment until that investigation and inquiry is finished, as indeed was our position in relation to the SIEV 36 incident, where there were five lives lost and 51 injured. We must allow these processes to occur before we rush to judgment. We do know a few facts about this incident, which we should bear in mind. Certainly we know that claims of passive resistance may be in question. As far as I know, Mahatma Gandhi was a passive resister. He never shot anyone in the stomach, never beat anyone to a pulp with an iron bar and never stabbed anyone. We must query questions of passive resistance in circumstances where these things occur.
Also, we should be completely eyes-open about some of the aspects of the involvement of elements in that flotilla. For example, two of the vessels were operated by the Islamic NGO known as IHH. This organisation has a long history of having been involved in and connected with Islamist fundamentalist activities. I would commend to anyone a reading of the Danish Institute for International Studies’ deep analysis of IHH activities. This is a highly credible paper that was issued in 2006-07. This IHH organisation has been raided in the past by Turkish authorities, which revealed that the leaders of IHH were purchasing automatic weapons from other regional Islamic militant groups. Their bureau in Istanbul was thoroughly searched and local officers were arrested. Security forces uncovered an array of disturbing items, including firearms, explosives, bomb-making instructions and a jihad flag. After analysing and seizing documents from IHH, Turkish authorities concluded that detained members of IHH were going to fight in Afghanistan, Bosnia and Chechnya.
IHH President, Bulent Yildirim, directly conspired in the mid-1990s to recruit veteran soldiers in anticipation of the coming holy war or jihad. In particular, some men were sent into war zones in Muslim countries in order to acquire combat experience. An examination of IHH’s phone records in Istanbul showed repeated telephone calls in 1996 to an al-Qaeda operations house in Milan and various Algerian terrorist operatives. IHH played an important role in the al-Qaeda millennium bomb plot for Los Angeles airport. One of the French intelligence experts has detailed:
The IHH is an NGO, but it was kind of a type of cover-up … in order to obtain forged documents and also to obtain different forms of infiltration for Mujahideen in combat. And also to go and gather [recruit] these Mujahideens. And finally, one of the last responsibilities that they had was also to be implicated or involved in weapons trafficking.
We should be well aware of what was involved here. The Israeli authorities had, of course, repeatedly offered to move that humanitarian material itself into the Gaza Strip. It did offer to do that once these vessels were seized, but Hamas—using the population of Gaza to hostage—refused to receive that material.
It only takes a reading of human rights reports on how Hamas behaves in the Gaza Strip to understand that that is also a repressive and brutal regime that must be neutralised. I also state on the record here that my absolute commitment is to a two-state solution in the Middle East, but I absolutely defend—to the last breath in my body—the right of the six million Jews of Israel to survive and not be annihilated by Iran or others who make that threat as part of their fundamental charter.

"Fletcher, Paul, MP",LP,2010-06-24,"—by leave—I present a petition concerning Hornsby Ku-ring-gai Hospital, which has been approved by the Standing Committee on Petitions. I have previously raised the issue of the Hornsby Ku-ring-gai Hospital in this chamber. Hornsby Ku-ring-gai Hospital is the major public hospital in Bradfield. It is unfortunate indeed that the physical condition of this hospital is poor and that the fine medical and other staff of that hospital have to work in very difficult circumstances in providing treatment and services to the many patients who go through that hospital on a daily basis.
The situation has become so urgent that the hospital’s medical staff and other staff have obtained over 30,000 signatures, I am told by the Chair of the Medical Staff Council, Dr Richard Harris, on a petition which calls for the facilities of the hospital to be upgraded. I have myself been with Dr Harris and other members of the hospital staff in the Hornsby Mall collecting signatures for this petition. It is unfortunate, as I have mentioned before, that the New South Wales Labor government failed to include within its application to the Rudd government’s $3.1 billion health and hospitals fund any reference to Hornsby Ku-ring-gai Hospital.
There were many fine words from the present Labor government in the lead-up to the 2007 election, but those fine words have to date produced no action at Hornsby hospital. But the people of Hornsby and surrounding districts have spoken in signing in very large numbers this petition that seeks to highlight the very difficult conditions in which staff work at that hospital and in which patients are treated and which seeks the assistance of the House in addressing this matter. I am therefore pleased to table this petition.
The petition read as follows—
To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives
This petition of the staff and community of Hornsby Kuring-gai Hospital draws to the attention of the house that the media have highlighted the appalling difficulties under which medical, nursing and allied health staff work at Hornsby Ku-ring-gai Hospital Despite these difficulties, the service provided by staff to their patients is of the highest quality.
We therefore ask the House to act to rectify problems that have been steadily deteriorating for decades. We call on the government to rebuild our local hospital.

"Neville, Paul, MP",NATS,2010-06-24,"—by leave—I wish to spend a short time giving the tabling statement that accompanied the report of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories that was tabled in the House earlier in the week. I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Support, who is at the table, for his indulgence. I refer to the committee’s report in connection with its visit late last year to New Zealand. This was a unique visit, the first of its kind. The committee welcomed the opportunity to represent the Australian parliament in its participation in the 2009 New Zealand committee exchange program. The committee undertook its visit to New Zealand in the context of gaining a better understanding of how New Zealand administers its external territories of Tukulu in the Pacific and the Ross Dependency in Antarctica. In addition, in line with the advisory role on the national capital, the committee was interested to compare the way in which urban design is applied to the capital of New Zealand—namely, Wellington. The committee also renewed its parliament-to-parliament ties.
In regard to New Zealand’s external territory in the Pacific, the committee was able to gain insight into complexities by ensuring adequate service delivery and gain an appreciation of the challenges that may be encountered in seeking to improve the economic development of a small and relatively isolated economy. In addition, the committee was fortunate to be given the opportunity to meet with New Zealand’s Select Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and to discuss ongoing inquiries which are of mutual benefit. At the time of the committee’s visit to New Zealand, it was inquiring into the changing economic environment in the Indian Ocean territories of Christmas Island and Cocos Keeling Islands.
The visit greatly enhanced the committee’s understanding of the types of economic and social challenges which may be encountered through its inquiry and also provided it with the opportunity to relay Australia’s experience in its administration of external territories. In a broader context, the committee gained a greater appreciation of the joint role of Australia and New Zealand in the Pacific through its meetings with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Murray McCully MP and officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The committee was also appreciative of the opportunity to meet the Hon. Chris Carter MP, shadow spokesman on foreign affairs.
On behalf of the committee, I would like to thank a range of groups, departments and individuals in New Zealand who participated in the visits, meetings and activities. The support and enthusiasm of all involved ensured that the visit was productive and memorable.

The Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Modernisation and Other Measures) Bill 2010 has returned. The government supports this bill, as it will improve the integrity of the Commonwealth Electoral Act and allow increased electoral participation by ordinary Australians. The government thanks the Senate for its consideration of this bill and agrees with the amendments made by the Senate. These amendments will remove the requirement that postal vote applications be returned directly to the Australian Electoral Commission and removes the prohibition on material being attached to postal vote applications. The government accepts these amendments in order that the remaining provisions of the bill be accepted and implemented before this year’s election.

That the amendments be agreed to.
There are two pieces of legislation before the House, the Healthcare Identifiers Bill 2010 and the Healthcare Identifiers (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2010. I want to make some very short comments that can cover both of them. Today is in fact a very big occasion for the provision of health services in Australia. Today, this parliament—this House and the Senate—is passing the very first piece of legislation required to build the e-health system into the future. It is a necessary foundation stone for us to be able to establish a national e-health record system for Australia. The amendments that were passed in the other place respond to concerns expressed in the minority report of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, including by moving a number of matters planned to be covered in the regulations into the legislation.
The government would like to thank the opposition and the minor parties for their support of this bill, which is an important step forward to improving the safety, quality and efficiency of health care in Australia. While it might seem very late on a very long day to be doing this, it does ensure that this can come into effect from 1 July—next week—as planned. Across the country, we, healthcare providers and others can get on with the job of building an e-health system for the future of this country.

"Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP",LP,2010-06-24,"—On behalf of the opposition, I wish to say that we agree that the unique individual healthcare identifier is an important of the architecture for e-health. We are supportive of e-health for the efficiencies, the improvements in safety and the avoidance of duplication in clinical practice that it will bring. As the minister said, there was a Senate inquiry into this legislation, the Healthcare Identifiers Bill 2010 and cognate bill, and there was a minority report. The opposition took up the concerns of the coalition senators raised in the minority report and drafted eight amendments. The concerns raised in six of those amendments were taken up by government amendments. There were two further amendments that addressed function creep but, following discussions with stakeholders, with NEHTA and also with Owen from the minister’s office, I am satisfied that those two amendments would not have been workable. The opposition determined in the Senate not to proceed with those amendments. We made the decision in the Senate to support the government amendments. We think that this is an important part of establishing the infrastructure for e-health. I also note that COAG has set aside $218 million for the adoption of a healthcare identifier service which runs until 30 June 2012. This money has already been allocated. Now the legislation is in place to let this go forward.

"Cobb, John, MP",NATS,2010-06-24,"—When it comes to education I guess we have heard it all from the government: trade training centres, an apparent education revolution, an end to double drop-offs, laptops for every student and 260 new childcare centres. The problem is the Labor Party and the Minister for Education delivered so very little. But whilst the Labor Party have been focusing on other things, their failures have been affecting real people in the community. One such a real person is Tracie Arkley-Smith, who has a son who attends Gumnut House in Lithgow, which will soon be part of my electorate of Calare. Gumnut House is facing closure, and Tracie Arkley-Smith is facing life without child care, all because of another mistake under Labor’s watch.
Gumnut House has recently been told it was overpaid by the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations and will now have to pay back $800 per week. It simply cannot do that. The company has lost its rural grant because there is now more than one childcare facility in Lithgow. The staff at Gumnut House are paying the price of a department’s failure under Julia Gillard’s watch. Tracie Arkley-Smith will struggle because the minister’s department got it wrong. Ms Arkley-Smith’s small business and her three employees will suffer because of this failure. Their families will suffer, other students’ families will suffer and the community will suffer because Labor could not get it right.
This government has spent its way into trouble and is now scrounging to get back any scrap of economic credibility it had. Instead of demanding back the billions it wasted on the BER, Labor has gone after a small business in Lithgow. Why can the government afford $38 million for advertising but not $38,000 for Gumnut House, or at least allow a longer period of time than just 51 weeks for this money to be paid back? Child care is a necessity for families in regional Australia and should be a priority for this government. I call on Julia Gillard to fix this mess.

"Baldwin, Robert, MP",LP,2010-06-24,"—It is with an incredibly heavy heart that I rise to speak on this condolence motion. It was, as I am sure this chamber remembers only too well, but two days ago that I stood here and spoke on the condolence motion for Sapper Moerland and Sapper Smith who were tragically killed by an IED in Afghanistan on 7 June only a little over two weeks ago. To speak so soon after that tragedy is in fact extremely difficult for me as I am sure it will be for many in this chamber. Unfortunately, there will be some dark moments before we again emerge into the light, particularly of course for the families of those soldiers that were killed and those soldiers who were wounded.
Private Timothy James Aplin, Private Benjamin Adam Chuck and Private Scott Travis Palmer were tragically killed after their International Security Assistance Force helicopter crashed during the early hours of Monday morning. They were performing the duties they were asked to do—eradicating the heart of terrorism in Afghanistan so that people may live freer from oppression and the acts of terrorism. It was Thucydides, a Greek historian, who said:
The bravest are surely those who have the clearest vision of what is before them, glory and danger alike, and yet not withstanding go out to meet it.
That is what they did—clear of mind, determined in purpose. People often say that they remember where they were when the Berlin Wall was brought down or when the Twin Towers in New York were attacked. I will forever remember being in my office in this place gazing at the television and listening to the Chief of the Defence Force, calmly and respectfully delivering the terribly sad news to the Australian people that we had just lost another three fine Australian troops in Afghanistan.
This news came as a shock, because not two weeks prior we as a nation mourned the loss of Sapper Moerland and Sapper Smith. It also came as a personal shock because at that moment I knew exactly how the families of these fine young soldiers would be feeling. I knew it because not a week had passed since I witnessed the grief and absolute sense of loss that enveloped the families of Sapper Moerland and Sapper Smith. I stood with those families at the ramp ceremony; I stood with them at the respective funerals. They are still very fresh in my memory and I am sure in the public’s consciousness.
The English philosopher John Stuart Mill said:
War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things. The decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse. The person who has nothing for which he is willing to fight, nothing which is more important than his own personal safety, is a miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself.
These men were fine men. They were sons of Anzac, who were willing to fight and who did it so well. Recent captures of weapons caches showed they were effective. They were well trained and highly disciplined individuals who became an integral part of a team at 2nd Commando Regiment, a very tightly banded brotherhood, fighting for freedom from terrorism and oppression.
Private Timothy James Aplin was from the Sydney based 2nd Commando Regiment. He joined the Army Reserves on 4 February 1992 and transferred to the Regular Army on 20 September 1995 where he reached the rank of sergeant. In 2008 Private Aplin completed the Commando Selection and Training Course, a very notable achievement by the most demanding of measures. In January 2009 he was posted to the then 4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (Commando) after completing the Commando Reinforcement Cycle. As a part of the process that Private Aplin undertook to become a commando in the Royal Australian Army he was required to give up his rank of sergeant. He did this willingly, as many before him had done. In doing so Private Aplin joined with those who went before him. He revealed his unconditional commitment to the Australian Army and to the 2nd Commando Regiment.
By all accounts, Private Aplin was an outstanding commando, highly respected and dedicated to his job. He had been deployed as part of Operation Tanager in East Timor, in 2000; Operation Bastille in the Middle East, in 2003; and Operation Slipper in Afghanistan, in 2009 and then again in 2010. This, his second tour of Afghanistan, where he was serving as a member of the Australian Special Operations Task Group as a team demolition specialist, was unfortunately to be his last. But I am sure that, if asked, he would have gone around again. Like so many of his colleagues will attest, they were most happy when they were on the ground plying their trade for which they had trained so well and so hard.
Private Aplin has been awarded the Australian Active Service Medal with East Timor, Iraq and ICAT Clasps. He has been honoured with the Infantry Combat Badge; the Iraq Campaign Medal; the United Nations Medal with Ribbon UNTAET; the Australian Defence Medal; the Defence Long Service Medal; and the Afghan Campaign Medal. Private Aplin has also been awarded the Return from Active Service Badge from a prior deployment. The following statement was released on behalf of Private Aplin’s wife and family. I am honoured to read it to the House:
Timothy Aplin is a man who represented many things to many people.
He was first, foremost and most importantly, an adored husband to his beloved Natasha, and a loving, guiding light as father and stepfather to their children Ty, Shinae, Josie and Daniel.
Tim was a much loved, valued and loyal friend to so many.
He was a highly trained and highly regarded soldier, who as a senior non-commissioned officer decided to pursue his dream of becoming a Special Forces soldier, and ultimately, a Commando.
Private Aplin’s parents, Mrs Margaret Gunnell and Mr Richard Gunnell, also released a moving tribute:
We are all very proud of Tim.
Tim was very fit and active with a real sense of adventure. He loved life, loved his family and was a devoted friend, father, uncle, son, brother and nephew.
Tim was a proud Australian who followed his dream to join the army. He loved military life and enjoyed his job. He was a confident and highly capable soldier and his loss will be deeply felt.
On behalf of Tim’s very large and extended family, we would like to thank everyone for their thoughts and prayers and we would now like the opportunity to grieve with our family and friends in private.
Private Aplin will be sorely missed by all those who knew him, particularly his family, colleagues and friends. I especially convey to his family my sincere condolences at this very difficult time.
Private Scott Travis Palmer was also from the Sydney based 2nd Commando Regiment. He joined the Army in 2001 and, after successfully completing the Commando Selection and Training Course in 2006, he joined the 4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (Commando). Serving his country through overseas deployment was not something that Private Palmer shied away from. At just 27 he had seen operational service in East Timor, Iraq and twice in Afghanistan prior to this tour where he would tragically never return home from.
Private Palmer clearly understood the importance of his role to his country but also demonstrated a brave dedication to the safety of overseas nations and to the colleagues with whom he fought side by side. His lasting legacy to his colleagues will be one of professionalism, despite the demanding, dangerous, difficult work he was asked to do. Not only did he love his job but he was good at it. Having his mates to work alongside only made it better.
Private Palmer was awarded the Australian Active Service Medal with Iraq, East Timor and ICAT Clasps. He was awarded the Iraq Campaign Medal, the Australian Defence Medal, the Australian Service Medal with the Timor-Leste Clasp, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the NATO ISAF Medal and the Returned from Active Service Badge from a previous deployment. I believe one of the greatest honours in this world is to serve one’s country. Private Palmer did that many times over, and Australia is blessed to have been served by such a dedicated and talented commando.
It is also with deep sadness that we say farewell to Private Benjamin Adam Chuck from the Sydney based 2nd Commando Regiment. Born in Atherton Queensland, Private Chuck joined the Army in May 2004 as part of the Special Forces Direct Recruiting Scheme at just 21 years of age. After completing commando selection and training, he was posted to the then 4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (Commando) and served as the patrol medic with his sniper team.
Colleagues of Private Chuck have described him as an outstanding, passionate, caring, highly trained commando who excelled at everything he attempted. I have no doubt his talents served his team immeasurably during these three tours of Afghanistan. He was awarded the Australian Active Service Medal with the ICAT Clasp, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the NATO ISAF Medal, the Infantry Combat Badge, the Australian Defence Medal and the Returned from Active Service Badge from his first deployment in Afghanistan.
Of course, Private Chuck’s passion extended beyond work and into his life at home with his family. As his mother, Susan, told the Australian:
“He loved what he did … He was focused on what he was doing. Even though he knew it was dangerous, he did it with the utmost pride.
“He was a passionate family man. He wasn’t married, but he was in a lovely relationship. We were a very close family, my husband, his siblings and I. What happened to him was just a tragic accident.”
His father, Gordon, has told of a young man who loved life and all that he could pack into it. I would like to read from an article in the Cairns Post written by Stephanie Harrington, whose words go some small way to describe the man that Private Chuck was to his family and to his team.
BEN Adam Chuck was a man among men. He handled crocodiles and venomous snakes at a local zoo. He flew helicopters and was a “beautiful kickboxer” who never lost a fight.
It was this thirst for adventure that spurred the former Atherton State High School student to train as a commando and become part of the Australian forces in Afghanistan in May 2007.
Pte Chuck was due to return home from his third mission in a fortnight, but for his devastated Tableland family, he will never walk through their door.
Pte Chuck was one of the three Australian commandos who died when their Black Hawk helicopter crashed in Kandahar Province in southern Afghanistan early on Monday morning.
It was the biggest loss of life in any incident during Australia’s near-decade long involvement in Afghanistan.
Pte Chuck was a passenger in the helicopter, along with Pte Tim Aplin and Pte Scott Palmer, who also died in the accident.
Yesterday, Pte Chuck’s heartbroken family spoke of their pride for their “courageous and kind” son who celebrated his 27th birthday on Friday.
Dad Gordon, 61, mum Susan, 58, brother Jason, 29, and his wife Gemma gathered at their Yungaburra home yesterday supported by a family friend.
“Ben believed very much in what he was doing and so did we. We knew the risks and so did he,” Mr Chuck said.
“I guess we will just live with the thought that when you believe in something strongly enough, there’s always the possibility the ending may be like this.
“But he loved his country. I guess he paid the ultimate price and so have we.”
Mrs Chuck said her son, who is also survived by his sister Tiffany, 23, and his partner of 18 months Tess Crane, had followed in the footsteps of his grandfathers, both decorated soldiers who served in World War II.
“He was an amazing solider and loved it,” Mrs Chuck said.
Pte Chuck was among fewer than 20 of 250 applicants who made the Special Forces during a recruitment drive in 2004, when he was given the most outstanding soldier award.
He went on to earn four medals and two badges during his six years of service. A Department of Defence spokesperson described him as an outstanding and highly-trained commando whose “affectionate and caring nature drove his passion for helping his mates”.
Pte Chuck was based at Sydney’s Holsworthy Barracks. Jason Chuck, who spoke to his brother on Saturday, said Pte Chuck’s goal was to fly a helicopter in search and rescue missions when he returned to Australia on July 8.
“He was a very strong leader. He just naturally commanded a lot of respect,” Jason Chuck said.
“Joining the army was probably the best thing he ever did, regardless of the outcome. It gave him such a sense of purpose and direction he didn’t have before.”
As I noted, before joining the army as a commando, Private Chuck worked at Hartley’s Crocodile Adventures in Queensland from 1 July 2003 to 14 January 2004. It seemed somewhat natural that an enthusiastic crocodile handler would make the transition to the army’s elite commandos. Through the former member for Leichhardt Warren Ench, a known crocodile farmer, I made contact with Ms Angela Freeman, Private Chuck’s previous supervisor at Hartley’s Crocodile Adventures. She spoke of a highly respected and well liked young man. She spoke of his gentle and polite nature. She said:
He was an outstanding person, an outstanding human being. There’s no way you can take away from his bravery and remarkable nature. He enjoyed things which involved some risk-taking so understandably he got a great deal of joy working with crocodiles. His colleagues were very impressed with how quickly Ben progressed and learned the trade of croc. handling where in a very short time he became a very highly valued employee. In fact every time he came back to visit us I tried to get him back working for us. Ben was always willing to take on new tasks and challenges, including working with venomous snakes and appearing on ABC television promos which many people would’ve seen him on.
Ben had a very cheeky sense of humour and thoroughly enjoyed his work. We were sorry to see him go, but we understood he was training very hard to join the army and the army was his passion. The last time I saw Ben he was on his way back to Afghanistan. He came in for a visit and he said he was very happy working in the army. He was well aware of the danger, but believed he was part of something very important and proud of the work that he was doing.
I have the deepest regard for his parents who gave their wholehearted support for Ben in his pursuits and I have the deepest sympathy for them now during this very difficult time. I’m sure Ben would have moved up the ranks and gone on to become a very successful soldier.
I sincerely hope that Private Chuck’s family can take some small comfort in knowing that he died performing a job he loved, supported by people he loved and who loved him. Many people never find either of these great blessings despite their long lives. As I said at the beginning, it has been a rather emotional week for everybody in this parliament. At the ramp ceremony just 12 days ago, the arrival of Sapper Jacob Moerland and Sapper Darren Smith, I spoke to Sandy Moerland, Jacob’s mother. She gave me one message to sum it all up. She said: ‘Don’t let Jacob’s death be in vain.’
The work that our men and women do in Afghanistan and in other theatres of operation, where they place themselves in harm’s way for the benefit of others, should never be underestimated or undervalued, and we must make sure that the deaths of these fine Australians are not in vain. I have not yet spoken to the families of Private Timothy James Aplin, Private Benjamin Adam Chuck or Private Scott Travis Palmer but I am sure they share that same sentiment: they do not want the deaths of these fine sons of Anzac to be in vain. In all of this, I think of the quote by Joaquin Miller:
The bravest battle that ever was fought!
Shall I tell you where and when?
On the maps of the world you will find it not;
‘Twas fought by the mothers of men.
Shortly, Australia will welcome home another three sons. We will respect them, we will thank them and we will bless them. As John 15:13 says:
Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends.
This they did, and for that their nation will be forever truly grateful. We will always remember them. We will remember their contribution, we will remember their mates and we will persevere—because the job is not yet finished, and to pull out before the job is finished would be to discredit these fine Australians who gave their all.
 (Hon. DS Vale)—I thank the member for Paterson for his very moving contribution. The question is that the motion be agreed to.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Private Timothy Aplin</title>,Condolences,48,1,speech
"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2010-06-24,"—Madam Deputy Speaker Vale, I think it is very appropriate that you be in the chair at this time, given your previous roles in this place, your deep-seated interest in our military history and of course your support for the men and women of the Australian Defence Force. I know that you feel very keenly these very emotional debates.
The member for Paterson, at some length and in some detail, provided us with information about the three soldiers we pay tribute to this morning, so I will not go over that again. I apologise in advance, though, if I am a little bit repetitive, because, sadly and tragically, we were in this chamber only two days ago paying tribute to Sappers Moerland and Smith, and in many ways the issues we confront today are much the same.
I begin by extending my sympathy to the families of Private Tim Aplin, Private Ben Chuck and Private Scott Palmer. To all of their family members, to all of their friends, to all of their ADF colleagues, I say how sorry I am, as I am sure we all are, that they are no longer with us. They are no longer with us because they, like many who have gone before them, were prepared to give their lives in service to their nation. I knew none of these three fine soldiers, but there is an extraordinary level of consistency in these matters, and I do not need to have known them to know that they were highly skilled, courageous and dedicated. Just as importantly, they knew what they were doing, they knew the risks and they believed in what they were doing.
As I said two days ago, I hope that their family and friends draw some strength from that fact—that they really believed in what they were doing. As a former defence minister I have been to many repatriations and funerals for soldiers who have fallen in operations, and again it is very consistent that the family members do draw strength, I have found, from the fact that their boys knew the risks and believed in what they were doing. That is absolutely the case with respect to the three soldiers we pay tribute to and whom we thank this morning.
We have now lost 16 fine Australians in Afghanistan—17, if you include Rifleman Nash, a western suburbs boy who was serving with the UK force in Afghanistan. I think we should include him in that list. He was fighting for the same cause, albeit in a different uniform, and with the same dedication and the same courageous approach. I want to read their names into the record again, because I think we should do that regularly to ensure that these people are not forgotten. They are: Sergeant Andrew Russell, Trooper David ‘Poppy’ Pearce, Sergeant Matthew ‘Matty’ Locke, Private Luke Worsely, Lance Corporal Jason Marks, Signaller Shaun McCarthy, Lieutenant Michael Fussell, Private Gregory Sher, Corporal Matthew Hopkins, Sergeant Brett Till, Private Benjamin Ranaudo, Sapper Jacob Moerland, Sapper Darren Smith and, of course, again today, Private Aplin, Private Chuck and Private Palmer.
Afghanistan is a very, very dangerous place. The campaign we are part of there is a very challenging one. I said two days ago that, unfortunately, the longer we are there, the more people we lose and the more people who are injured—and I also refer to those who were injured in the same helicopter crash that took out these three fine soldiers—the harder it will be to maintain the support of the Australian electorate for this campaign. Again, I make an appeal to the broader Australian electorate to understand, first of all, that we are there for good reason. We are there to stabilise a country which previously provided a safe haven, a breeding ground and a launching pad for terrorists prepared to perpetrate their acts of terror right around the globe, including on our doorstep and even on our own homeland. It is a very, very important thing to play our role in ensuring that people are able to travel freely around the globe and enjoy a safe lifestyle in their own homeland without threat or any question about their freedom. That is why we are there.
How do we achieve that? We achieve that by ensuring that the democratically elected government of Afghanistan has the capacity to take care of its own security and therefore deny groups like al-Qaeda the opportunity to once again use their own country to launch those vicious terrorist attacks around the globe. We do so by building up their security forces—both their defence force and their police forces—helping them build an economy, helping them build a system of governance and assisting them in establishing a justice system. These are important initiatives. We are only a relatively small part of the global effort to achieve those aims but we play an important part.
It is important that we continue to make a contribution, not just because of what our contribution provides on the ground—and it is a significant one; we are certainly punching above our weight—but also because it is important to send a signal that the international community is working together in a common cause against a common foe and that it is not a conflict between the United States of America and one particular fundamentalist group, or one particular country, even. It is an international effort, and we are standing together and cooperating together to achieve those aims. That is a very, very important message to both those who we confront in Afghanistan and the global community more generally.
Of course, there are other implications. Afghanistan has implications for countries like Pakistan in particular, a nuclear capable state, a state so critical to maintaining stability in that part of the region. But there is another point. Imagine a precipitate withdrawal from Afghanistan now, after nine years of operations. Can you imagine the humanitarian disaster which would flow from that precipitate withdrawal, as retribution was sought against all those who have sided with the international security forces? It would probably be a humanitarian disaster on a scale we have not seen before. Again, of course, that has implications for countries like Pakistan, which was the destination for so many refugees who fled war-torn Afghanistan in the early to mid-eighties, and countries like Australia, which will undoubtedly be a destination for those who again flee the acts of terror perpetrated by fundamentalist groups like the Taliban and indeed others. These are very, very good reasons to stay the course.
Today we saw a momentous event in Parliament House. We saw a change of Prime Minister. We will be reading about it for some days, weeks and indeed months ahead. I cannot speak on behalf of the new Prime Minister. She will speak for herself. I speak merely as a humble backbencher, but I am confident that the government’s policy will not change on Afghanistan. I am confident that our commitment to Afghanistan will remain in place. Indeed, I would urge the new Prime Minister to ensure that we continue to maintain our commitment. It is not an open-ended commitment. The government have made it clear that we have a clearly defined mission, and that is to train the 4th Brigade of the Afghan National Army in Oruzgan province up to a capacity where it is able to play its important role in enforcing and maintaining local peace and security. While our Mentoring Task Force is doing so, our Special Forces soldiers continue to clear and deny the worst of the enemy. But we do have an end goal, and that is it. I remind the Australian people that the government under Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has clearly defined the mission now and has provided an end point for the mission, and I ask them to be very, very patient with us.
I remind that House that the three brave Australian soldiers we pay tribute to today were not conscripts; they were volunteers, highly professional soldiers, highly trained, highly skilled, highly committed and highly determined to do their bit for their country. They believed in what they were doing, and we as an international community should also believe in what they were doing and what those who are still serving in Afghanistan and other operations are doing. I will say it again: the most effective way in which we can express our appreciation to them and indeed support their families—I should be careful not to generalise on that, but I believe it would be a general view amongst the families and friends—is to stay the course and finish the job. Their families and friends would not want their sacrifice to have been in vain.
I know it is hard because from time to time decisions come out of Brussels and Kabul which leave us somewhat bewildered. There are countries in the partnership that from time to time do not seem to be pulling their weight, but that is no reason not to continue on that very important mission. Having said that, it is incumbent on the government to continually reassess the mission to ensure that success is achievable and of course to ensure that in those global councils, whether they be in Washington, Brussels or Kabul, the right decisions are being made and a strategy is in place to deliver the key objectives we seek to achieve.
Again, I pay tribute to Privates Tim Aplin, Ben Chuck and Scott Palmer and extend my sympathies to their families and friends. Having made a contribution now to two of these condolence motions in one week, I dearly hope that this will be my last.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Private Timothy Aplin</title>,Condolences,48,1,speech
"Katter, Bob, MP",IND,2010-06-24,"—The previous speakers referred to bravery. If you want to know about bravery, look at the mothers. In my own family, my great-great grandmother suffered this and then my great-grandmother suffered it as well—Bert Henley, my great-grandfather’s brother, died at Gallipoli. His namesake, Bert Henley, died soon after coming home from Changi Prison.
I think the most moving scene I have ever seen in a movie was the first one in Saving Private Ryan. In that movie, the camera is behind the mother at the door. The black limousine pulls up and the telegram is brought telling the mother that her three sons are dead. Everything that was in that woman’s body that held her upright simply crumpled as she collapsed to the floor. Tommy McIver, the famous rough rider and country music singer, wrote in the song 21 Guns: ‘The angel of death with his knock at the door, the crumpled up telegram falls to the floor. Her reason for livin’ is livin’ no more as she cries for the pride of Australia.’
That is the story of Susan Chuck, the mother of the soldier we are commemorating here in the House. I sincerely congratulate the Cairns Post on the really wonderful treatment and effort they have made to honour one of our North Queensland sons. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you do in Tasmania, we live in a very small community where everybody knows everybody. Whilst I do not know the Chucks personally, Gordon Chuck went on the walk at Kokoda with Ian Hosey, and I know Ian very well. My chief of staff and right hand director comes from Malanda, which is just 15 or 20 kilometres down the road, and her mother knows the family well. You can see the sort of people that they are, with Gordon Chuck doing the Kokoda Track. They established Eden House, which is a wonderful tourist attraction and enriches the tourist basket we can offer visitors from outside Far North Queensland. They have made a very great contribution to the Far North Queensland industry.
I am drawing a picture for you of what these people are like. Private Chuck’s home town of Yungaburra must be one of the most beautiful places on earth. It has a magnificent lake and behind it is the dense high-elevation jungle of North Queensland. Every night of the year you use one blanket, and there is no night of the year when you need to use two blankets. It truly is a beautiful place with beautiful buildings and people that are very, very civilised.
Private Chuck, because he was a man who clearly loved challenges, took himself off to become a crocodile handler. I hold up for the benefit of the House a picture of Private Chuck contending with a crocodile, all but wrestling with it. He was also a handler of dangerous snakes at the zoo. He was a man that loved life, loved excitement, loved adventure and was making his contribution, like his parents, to a wonderful industry in Far North Queensland. I quote from the very wonderful treatment by the Cairns Post commemorating one of our sons:
THE brother of fallen soldier Pte Ben Chuck yesterday cautioned against using the commando’s death as a reason to pull Australian troops out of Afghanistan.
As support for the war wanes and is likely to continue to fall after the death of three Australian commandos on Monday, Jason Chuck said his brother was committed to Australia’s role in Afghanistan.
“I don’t want this used as some sort of political justification for bringing troops home. That wouldn’t have been something Ben would have endorsed. He was so proud of what he did,” Mr Chuck said.
A very moving editorial by the paper says:
… on Monday, one of our own sons, Ben Chuck of Yungaburra, was among three experienced Special Forces soldiers killed in a helicopter crash.
Now it is very real, very raw and very painful.
The war is now very much part of our community and we all share the grief of his family and friends in the close-knit Tableland village.
Ben’s death and that of his two colleagues are the worst suffered by the Australian army on operations since Vietnam. …
The Chuck family blames no one for the death of their 27-year-old son. They knew the risks he faced and he did too.
Ben was among the elite in the Special Forces and received a most outstanding soldier award.
He was dedicated to the war on terrorism and determined to play his part in removing these killers who spare no one in their misguided quest of murder.
The family supports Australia’s involvement in the war and do not, for one moment, want the Defence Force to withdraw, despite current debate …
We grieve for the family but we know, as they know, he died bravely and courageously fighting to rid the world of the terror which has changed the face of this planet forever.
Another article in the Cairns Post reads:
BEN Adam Chuck was a man among men. He handled crocodiles and venomous snakes at a local zoo. He flew helicopters and was a “beautiful kickboxer” who never lost a fight.
It was this thirst for adventure that spurred the former Atherton State High School student—
I might add, for those that follow the great game of rugby league, that just up the road is the home of Dallas Johnson and just down the road, at Gordonvale, is the home of Nate Myles. We pride ourselves on the boys coming out of the Atherton Tableland, like Mickey Nasser’s mob. They have always been tough people who love excitement and adventure. The article goes on:
It was this thirst for adventure that spurred the former Atherton State High School student to train as a commando and become part of the Australian forces in Afghanistan in May 2007.
Pte Chuck was due to return home from his third mission in a fortnight, but for his devastated Tableland family, he will never walk through their door.
Yesterday, Pte Chuck’s heartbroken family spoke of their pride for their “courageous and kind” son who celebrated his 27th birthday on Friday.
Dad Gordon, … mum Susan, … brother Jason, … and his wife Gemma gathered at their Yungaburra home yesterday supported by a family friend.
 “Ben believed very much in what he was doing and so did we. We knew the risks and so did he,” Mr Chuck said.
“I guess we will just live with the thought that when you believe in something strongly enough, there’s always the possibility the ending may be like this.
“But he loved his country. I guess he paid the ultimate price and so have we.”
Mrs Chuck said her son … followed in the footsteps of his grandfathers, both decorated soldiers who served in World War II.
“He was an amazing solider and loved it,” Mrs Chuck said.
Pte Chuck was among fewer than 20 of 250 applicants who made the Special Forces …
Remember that those 250 applicants are only the people who thought they would have some chance. If you asked how many people wanted to be a commando, it might be 2,000 or 3,000, but only those 250 thought they were good enough to apply. Of that 250, only 20 became commandos. So this man was an elite of the elite. The article goes on:
He went on to earn four medals and two badges during his six years of service. A Department of Defence spokesperson described him as an outstanding and highly-trained commando whose “affectionate and caring nature drove his passion for helping his mates”.
As a person who spent eight years in uniform in the militia on 24-hour call-up to fight in Indonesia and later in Vietnam, I do not think you really go out there with a burning love for your country. In the back of your mind, you know that that is what it is all about, but really in the Army you do what your country requires of you and you do it because you do not want to let your mates down. That probably is one of the strongest forces operating inside a military unit. The article goes on to quote Private Chuck’s brother Jason:
“Joining the army was probably the best thing he ever did, regardless of the outcome. It gave him such a sense of purpose and direction he didn’t have before.”
The Australian flag at the family’s business Eden House Retreat and Mountain Spa at Yungaburra was flying at half mast yesterday as the Tableland community started to grieve for their fallen son.
Staff at Atherton State High School, from where Pte Chuck graduated a decade ago, remembered him as a well-liked and personable student.
“He’s from a very respected family and was well thought of within the school,” acting principal Stuart Edwards said. “It’s terrible.”
Pte Chuck worked as a wildlife keeper and crocodile handler at Hartley’s Crocodile Adventures, north of Cairns, for six months before joining the army.
He earlier worked at the Cairns Crocodile Farm.
At Hartley’s, Pte Chuck learned to handle venomous snakes and thrilled tourists as a performer in the crocodile attack show.
Zoo co-owner Peter Freeman said Pte Chuck had left a lasting impression and would drop by Hartley’s to catch up with staff when he visited his family.
“He was an extremely good employee,” Mr Freeman said.
“Everyone who worked with Ben has remembered him and remembered him as a great person and a great colleague.”
…            …            …
“He loved life and all of the adventure he could pack into it,” Mr Chuck said.
“He was a man amongst men.”
Another article says:
 “We will be bring him home,” his mother Susan Chuck told The Cairns Post yesterday.
…            …            …
The decorated soldier, 27, described as a “man among men”, died in a Black Hawk helicopter crash in Kandahar Province early on Monday morning.
Pte Chuck’s brother, Jason, said the news had hit the family hard but there was some comfort in knowing he died doing what he loved.
“He was a passionate soldier and he, and his unit, were always so excited leading into a deployment,” he said.
“He had pride in serving his country and deeply believed in what they were doing.
“It helps us knowing he died doing what he loved and we are sure this is the way he would have wanted to go.”
It is worth mentioning that Private Chuck received commendation as an outstanding soldier on one occasion. We are a small community up on the Atherton Tableland. Particularly in this area we take very great pride in the achievements of our sons like Dallas Johnson and Nate Myles, but we take infinitely greater pride in someone of this nature who died serving his country. The article goes on:
Mrs Chuck said Pte Chuck would be brought home shortly.
“He loved north Queensland,” she said.
“It’s where he would want to be.”",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Private Timothy Aplin</title>,Condolences,48,1,speech
"Griffin, Alan, MP",ALP,2010-06-24,"—I would like to express my sorrow at the passing of three Australian Defence Force members who were killed in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan on Monday. Privates Tim Aplin, Ben Chuck and Scott Palmer were all members of the Sydney based 2nd Commando Regiment and were serving with the Special Operations Task Group in Afghanistan when they lost their lives in the service of their nation.
Private Tim Aplin was serving as a demolitions specialist and was on his second tour of duty in Afghanistan. He has been described as an outstanding and dedicated commando who was highly respected.
Private Ben Chuck was the patrol medic within his sniper team and was on his third tour in Afghanistan. He has been described as an outstanding commando who excelled at all he attempted. His affectionate and caring nature drove his passion for helping his mates.
Private Scott Palmer was also on his third tour of duty in Afghanistan. He has been described as having professionalism of the highest order and excelling at everything he did.
I extend my sincere condolences to the family and friends of these men and to the members of the Australian Defence Force, who also feel this great loss. In particular, I offer my deep condolences to: Private Tim Aplin’s wife Natasha; his children Ty, Shinae, Josie and Daniel; and his mother Margaret; Private Ben Chuck’s mother Susan, father Gordon, brother Jason, sister Tiffany and partner Tess; and Private Scott Palmer’s mother Pam, father Ray and brother Adam.
To the members of the 2nd Commando Regiment, my thoughts are with you as you mourn the loss of three of your members and the wounding of another seven. I offer my prayers to the family and friends of Private Tim Aplin, Private Ben Chuck and Private Scott Palmer and also for the safe homecoming of our soldiers, sailors, airmen and airwomen who continue to serve in operations all around the world. Privates Aplin, Chuck and Palmer have made the ultimate sacrifice in the service of their nation and this will not be forgotten. I mourn their loss.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Private Timothy Aplin</title>,Condolences,48,1,speech
"Simpkins, Luke, MP",LP,2010-06-24,"—I would like to take the opportunity to pay tribute today to the three soldiers who lost their lives in Afghanistan on 21 June, 2010. This is one of those moments where we are reminded of the seriousness of our actions here in the parliament and the potential consequences on our soldiers and of course their families. War is a serious business with serious consequences.
I would, firstly, like to pay tribute to Timothy James Aplin, who was 38 years old. When I read that Private Aplin was 38 years old, I thought that 38 was quite old for a private and that there must be a story behind it. Indeed, there is a story behind Private Aplin. Having joined the Army Reserve in 1992 and having transferred to the Regular Army in 1995 Private Aplin had progressed to the rank of sergeant. But his goal was to pursue a career in Special Forces. He undertook the commando selection course and then the commando training course in 2008. But of course to enter Special Forces as an OR—other rank—normally you cannot, under any circumstances, go in taking that more senior rank such as sergeant or even corporal.
Sergeant Aplin was presented with a choice: did he want to proceed with a posting to the 4th Battalion Royal Australian Regiment (Commando) or did he want to retain his sergeant rank? Pursuing the goal that he had always sought, he put aside his rank, reverted to private and went in as a commando. I think we need to remember that the rank of sergeant is very highly regarded by the soldiers of the Australian Army. It is not achieved lightly. There are subject courses to be passed for the rank of corporal and then sergeant. Recommendations by commanders need to be made. It is not something that is just achieved. It is no handout in the lolly packet, the cereal packet or anything like that. He worked hard to achieve his rank of sergeant, but his goal was Special Forces. His goal was the commandos, and he set aside his rank of sergeant to achieve his goal and join the commandos.
I think that the way he did that was certainly a testament to great character: someone who wanted to serve his nation, someone who wanted to serve in a particular area as a commando, someone who had dedication to service. Private Aplin strikes me as the sort of man who was every commander’s dream, someone who just wanted to be there, just wanted to serve, just wanted to do the job, who was not wrapped up with the trappings of rank or anything like that but just wanted to get on and do his duty, and I imagine that he enjoyed doing his duty as well. Indeed, he was already something of a veteran, having had operational service in East Timor in 2000, the Middle East in 2003 and Afghanistan already in 2009. His second tour of Afghanistan was where he lost his life in the helicopter accident. I guess it is not that easy to replace people like that, who have that sort of unique and driven dedication to their profession. I think his loss in the 2nd Commando Regiment will be felt greatly, as indeed the loss of any of our soldiers is felt greatly within Defence. So I pay tribute to Private Aplin today.
I would also like to speak of Private Benjamin Adam Chuck, also a member of the 2nd Commando Regiment. The service of 27-year-old Private Chuck is also a story of its own. Some years ago, it was determined that there could be direct recruitment into the Special Forces, where people off the street, you might say, or maybe from the police could apply with the specific intent of entering the Special Forces. As I think all of us here know, and some of us who have served in the Army as well maybe know just a little bit better—and I am not Special Forces myself by any means—it is serious business out there. The weapons, the explosives and the training can be pretty dangerous stuff. Some may call them supersoldiers, as the SAS are often referred to, but there is no doubt that they are a highly trained organisation and highly effective. For someone like Private Chuck to have come from civilian life, to have specifically joined and to have just gone straight through those courses to become a commando is again a testament to an excellent character. He has been described as a person who excelled at everything he attempted. Clearly he was a very tough and determined young man. As we have heard from other speakers, he was fulfilling the role of patrol medic within his sniper team. It has also been said that he was devoted to his mates, as I am sure that all members of the 2nd Commando Regiment certainly are.
I also take this opportunity to pay my respects regarding Private Palmer, the third soldier who unfortunately died in this helicopter crash. Private Palmer joined the Army in 2001. By the end of 2006, he had completed his commando selection course, his commando training course, and was then posted to the 4th Battalion Royal Australian Regiment (Commando) as it was then called, now the 2nd Commando Regiment. He certainly had plenty of operational experience. This was his third tour to Afghanistan, and he had also served at other times in East Timor and Iraq. He was also notable—as indeed, as I have said before, are all members of the 2nd Commando Regiment and members of the Australian Army in general—for his professionalism and dedication to excellence.
A lot has been said about why we are in Afghanistan. Questions have been asked. Some people still ask why we are there. What possible influence can that place have on us here in Australia? The reality is that there are evil people in the world. The Taliban wish to increase fundamentalist Islamic rule across the region and beyond. Of course, they need a base. They need somewhere to train, somewhere to gather, somewhere to launch their wider operations from, and that place is Afghanistan—but only if we let it be Afghanistan. We remember, not too long ago, the Taliban’s operations in the Swat Valley, in Pakistan, and I commend the Pakistani army and services for driving them back out of the Swat Valley and re-establishing legitimate government control over the Swat Valley. The Taliban continue to pursue a re-establishment of their bases in Afghanistan and their control in Afghanistan, and they intend to use that place to launch their forms of terrorism.
We know that they are suppressors of women and the rights of women. They are controllers of education. They are soldiers of totalitarianism. I would just add one other thing to that. Who can forget those famous views of where the Taliban destroyed the image of Buddha carved into a cliff face in Afghanistan? These are, without doubt, evil people. We have no choice, and we have an obligation, to continue that fight against them. Certainly the Taliban provide no value in the world. They are enemies of democracy. The point is that, if we do not stay in Afghanistan until the Afghan government can ensure their own security, this nation and our neighbours may be subject to terrorism that originates from Afghanistan. That is my view about our national cause.
But, down from such heights, I will bring it back home. There are the families who will forever have to live with the loss of their loved ones—in this case, the families of Private Aplin, Private Chuck and Private Palmer. It can be a struggle to find the words to say to those who have lost their loved ones in this cause. To the parents, brothers and sisters, partners and friends of these lost loved ones: my thoughts, my deepest sympathy and my heartfelt condolences are with them. These men died in defence of democracy and for liberation. Australia never wants to have to send soldiers abroad, but we have. Australians did not ask for violence, but we have answered it. Australia did not start this war, but we will move on with the coalition to win it. To all the Australian Defence Force personnel still engaged in the conflict in Afghanistan: take a moment to honour your fallen comrades, but maintain your vigilance, your confidence, your courage and your commitment to carry on with the mission. I thank them for their service. I thank the families of these fallen soldiers for the sacrifice.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Private Timothy Aplin</title>,Condolences,48,1,speech
"Danby, Michael, MP",ALP,2010-06-24,"—It is with great sadness that I rise to speak again, as I have previously in this chamber, about the deaths of Australian soldiers in Afghanistan, particularly Private Timothy James Aplin, Private Benjamin Adam Chuck and Private Scott Travis Palmer, all special operations soldiers in 2nd Commando Regiment. They were killed in action just days ago. The three soldiers we are mourning today died in what seems to have been an accidental helicopter crash of one of our US ally’s military helicopters. These are deaths in active service, and we honour them as we have honoured the other 13 Australians who have died in active service over the past eight years, including Sappers Moerland and Smith, for whom we had a condolence motion just the other day. I join with all the political leaders and other parliamentarians who have spoken before me in sending my deepest condolences to the families of those who have died. I think of the families of those who have been wounded and, like all members of this House, pray for their rapid and complete recovery. I also think of our American, British and Afghan allies and the losses they have sustained.
Wars, particularly prolonged wars, are very difficult for democracies. It is easy to say, ‘We shall stay the course,’ but when we have months like this, with five deaths in rapid succession, we begin to realise what that means in practice. Questions begin to rise and pressure begins to mount on elected governments to find the best way to end the sacrifice of our best and bravest. We need to resist those calls. This is not a war that Australia or the democratic world as a whole can afford to lose. We need to win this war not for its own sake and not just to protect ourselves against terrorism. We also need to win it for the sake of the people of Afghanistan.
I thought that point was made very strongly by the member for Paterson, on the other side of the chamber, who talked about having attended the ramp ceremonies and funerals of soldiers killed in Afghanistan very recently. I can echo that experience, having represented the government on the death of a soldier from Melbourne from 2nd Commando Company, 1st Commando Regiment, Private Greg Sher. Private Sher was our first reservist to be killed in action since Vietnam, and I am in contact with his father, Felix Sher, and family. All parliamentarians from the various electorates of the families of these brave people who are killed should remain in contact with them as part of our continuing service to them. I think Felix was quoted in the papers just in the last few days saying very clearly that these three boys died in the service of Australia and would want our leadership, military including our arguing not to be dissuaded. He spoke as the father of a very precious son who died in Afghanistan, saying that we should not give up the struggle and the fight there.
The 28 million people in Afghanistan have suffered a great deal over the past 30 years: revolution, civil war, dictatorship, foreign invasion, political and religious fanaticism and savage repression. Millions have had to flee the country and spend years in refugee camps. At one stage, four million people had fled from the Taliban to Pakistan. Anyone who has seen the films of refugee camps teeming with millions of people can only have sympathy for those who have had to live under that dreadful regime.
Thanks to Australia and its allies, the lives of most people in Afghanistan have been improved, and that is particularly true for Afghan women and children. That is something of which we should be proud, and we should be particularly proud of the role that the young women and men of our defence forces have played in bringing security and safety to so many people. I think of the huge numbers of young girls in Kabul who can now attend education, who were barred from it literally under the threat of death—as some of them still are in regional areas in Afghanistan—by the Taliban regime.
The members for Cowan and Kennedy spoke very movingly about the nature of these servicemen—devoted to their mates, not over there with grand theories or ideological obsessions but representing Australia quietly and efficiently with their comrades in 2nd Commando Regiment and killed in action with their friends. They were fully devoted to each other and representing Australia, as Australian servicemen have been in recent conflicts, and we are so very proud of them.
Things are very far from perfect in Afghanistan. You only need to read some Kipling to realise the dreadful terrain and the longstanding nature of recriminations and interfactional fighting there. It goes back a long way. The British experienced it. The Soviets did as well. I hope and I pray that we are fighting in a different cause—for the people of Afghanistan, not against the people of Afghanistan.
In some ways things have deteriorated in recent times. No-one ever supposed that rescuing such a country from the depths to which it had sunk under the Taliban regime was going to be easy. I remember seeing a dreadful film of a public execution of a woman in Afghanistan who was stoned to death in a public stadium. The reporter—for a British television program, I think—asked the Taliban minister, outside the country, ‘How can you spend the money of the international community on a sports stadium where you kill people by public stoning?’ His contemptuous response was ‘Give us the money for another sports ground and we’ll play soccer there.’ This is the nature of the people that we are fighting against, in which cause these three brave men have laid down their lives.
The rehabilitation of Afghanistan is a massive task and many mistakes have been made. We have been too tolerant of corruption and warlordism there. I am pleased to see our friends in the American congress are getting very tough with some of the contractors and some of the transport convoys about the bribes being paid to some of the gunmen for the warlords. Frankly, the recent presidential election was a disgrace. Yet I remain optimistic. The United States troops surge has shown the strong commitment of the leading country in the coalition to give Afghanistan the help it needs to create a stable and defensible government and to give security to its population. That is, after all, the aim of Australia, the international force and the United States—to train the Afghan army into a position where eventually the allies can withdraw and leave the population of Afghanistan in some kind of security and safety. I think we have an obligation to assist in doing that, despite the price we are asking our men and women in uniform to pay.
The consequences of failure for the people of Afghanistan, for us and for all those who look to the democratic world for help would be very grave. Just the other day in New York—to connect all the dots—the would-be terrorist who left the huge bomb in Times Square boasted in confessing to the court that he was trained and paid by the Taliban. If we do not understand from that incident that the consequences of not confronting these people over there, rather than letting them have a secure base there, are that we will have them come to us, then we do not understand anything.
We cannot ask our defence forces and their families to make sacrifices like this unless we strongly believe in the justice of the cause for which we are fighting. I believe that the cause of helping the Afghan people to defeat those who want to return them to slavery is a just one. The member for Cowan had a very insightful comment when he talked about the nature of a regime that would take the ancient and beautiful statues carved into the stone hills of Bamiyan by another civilisation thousands of years earlier, those famous buddhas, and blow up them up in their total contempt and hatred for other people’s religions. That is an insight into the nature of the people that we are confronting there. That is why, despite our grief over these deaths, I believe it is right to maintain our commitment. To the parents, the partners, the children and the friends of these three incredibly brave servicemen who died in the helicopter accident, I say that I believe we are right to maintain that commitment. It is the best way can honour the last full measure of devotion to our country that these three brave commandos made for Australia.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Private Timothy Aplin</title>,Condolences,48,1,speech
"Hunt, Gregory, MP",LP,2010-06-24,"—I wish to join with all members of the House in expressing my condolence to the families of the three very brave young Australian soldiers who were lost in the recent helicopter accident in Afghanistan, Private Timothy Aplin, Private Benjamin Chuck and Private Scott Palmer, all of whom lost their lives on 21 June 2010. They were accompanied by seven other Australians, one of whom is from my electorate. Obviously the name of this very brave young man from my electorate, for reasons of both family privacy and national security, remains confidential, but I note that I have spoken with the partner and the father of this brave young soldier.
On behalf of the family, I say to the government: we thank you for your help. The partner will be transported to Germany. There has been some confusion. The family was of the belief that the mother would also be transported. That was confirmed by the government and then that hope was taken away late last night. The family is not in a position to make these travel arrangements without assistance from the government. I realise that there are other issues concerning the government at the moment, but I respectfully ask that all care and immediate action be taken to assist the mother to travel to Germany. There is great distress in the family. There is particularly not just a concern about the son but a double emotion, having been offered the prospect of travel and having had that withdrawn in the last few hours. I have been in contact with the office of the Minister for Defence to this effect and the staff have been very helpful, but we do need a resolution, and I ask that a resolution be put in place today.
More broadly, to the families of these three very brave young men who have been lost: they could not have given a greater sacrifice for Australia and, more significantly still, for the people of Australia and their long-term security. It is a tragic outcome. These are the finest of young people. They have extraordinary training, skill, intelligence and compassion and such a high-functioning nature that their deaths are doubly tragic.
I want to talk briefly about the broader context: the foe. The challenge which is underway in Afghanistan is part of a broader global challenge to deal with a stream, a strand, of extremism which, irrespective of its religion, is aimed at destabilising the modern way of life. It is nihilist in many respects in that it is indiscriminate in its target. It seeks to destroy progress. It seeks to destroy the very freedoms that people on all sides of this House believe in, whether it is freedom of religion, freedom of action, gender freedom, in particular—all of the noble virtues which give people the ability to live their lives in full. These are under attack.
What we see at the moment is the Wahhabi stream of Islamic extremism attempting in its own way to bring down governments. Whether it is the government of Pakistan, the government of Indonesia, the government of Saudi Arabia or the government of Egypt, it wants to destabilise these major Islamic countries and ensure that there is either a fragmentation or a takeover—those are the long-term, millennial objectives—and, in so doing, create and craft a very different world from that in which we live. That is a profound global challenge. It is real, it is important and it manifests itself in forms of terrorism, in acts of violence, first and foremost, within and against the Islamic world itself. The four countries that I have mentioned are all targets of extremist Islamic violence. Secondly, it manifests itself in acts of violence such as those that we saw so tragically close to home in Australia, in Bali, with both Bali bombings, with the attack on our embassy in Jakarta and on the Marriott Hotel and, most prominently, the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Centre, the Pentagon and the four flights.
This insidious strand of terrorism has a strategic goal: to take as a base one of the four large states with a strong Islamic heritage and in so doing bring about a transition through internal destabilisation and violence. That is why it is not just an internal issue in Afghanistan. Afghanistan was the base for the Taliban, Afghanistan has been the hiding place for the senior leadership of al-Qaeda and Afghanistan was a centre for the activity which occurred on September 11 and throughout much of South-East Asia. So it is real and profound and of significance to Australia.
The cause could not be greater in terms of our global responsibilities. The cause for which these Australian soldiers lost their lives could not be greater. Having said that, we have a duty to do everything in our power to ensure that, where our forces are deployed, they are deployed in a way that protects them and their mission and does not in any way lead to them being needlessly exposed. There is a bipartisan commitment to this broader cause. We believe in it because it is profound and important. I recognise, though, that the costs are extraordinary and that it is ever so easy for those of us in this place to make easy gestures which are borne by others. We must never, ever forget the risk and the price and the commitment of those on the front line. The association I have had with the family of this very brave young soldier from my electorate over the last few days reminds me all too clearly that it is the brave young sons and daughters of Australia who are on the front line. We thank them for their commitment. I offer my profound thanks and condolences to the families of these three brave young Australian men: Private Timothy Aplin, Private Benjamin Chuck and Private Scott Palmer.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Private Timothy Aplin</title>,Condolences,48,1,speech
"Kelly, Mike, MP",ALP,2010-06-24,"—I thank all members for their words today, as we gather again to farewell favourite sons lost in the cause in which they were engaged and offer our condolences to the families of Private Ben Chuck, Private Timothy Aplin and Private Scott Palmer. I echo of course all the comments about the importance of this conflict in which we have been engaged, and which I have previously commented on, in fighting this Islamic extremism.
Australians have always steeled themselves in the cause of freedom and peace and have steeled themselves to endure costs in pursuing those aims. Australia lost 60,000 killed in the First World War and 48,000 in the Second World War. Our allies are alongside us in Afghanistan, where the Americans have lost over 1,100 troops, the British, 300, and the Dutch, our partners in Oruzgan, have lost 24 killed. We remained steeled to this task. It is extremely heartening and I think should be heartening to the families, to the colleagues of these soldiers and to the Australian people that the major parties of this parliament are united in continuing to support our troops and continuing to support this operation.
It is particularly of note that these soldiers were reservists of the 2nd Commando Regiment. It is my privilege to have as part of my portfolio responsibilities the administration of the reserves—and what wonderful and special people they are. They devote aspects of their lives that would normally be reserved for leisure time or time with their families and make that extra commitment to train themselves, to serve and to offer their lives and limbs in the defence of this country above their ordinary commitments in their daytime job. In terms of the 2nd Commando Regiment, that goes to another level altogether. We know these are special operations or special forces soldiers who must train to an extremely high degree of proficiency, so the courses and training that they undertake are in addition to that which would normally be undertaken by a reservist. And, of course, in order to be deployed in Afghanistan they have to go to another level yet again in their proficiency and the excellence of their skills at arms. So we should very specially salute the commitment that they make, above and beyond their daytime jobs, to attain those skills and to serve in this cause.
As the member for Melbourne Ports mentioned, we have had experience with losses in the regiment, dealing in particular with the family of Greg Sher. Felix and Yvonne Sher have been typical of the stoic families who have endured these losses, and in their commitment to supporting the troops and the mission. We attended various ceremonies associated with the Sher family in their loss, met many members of the 2nd Commando Regiment and know well their commitment to this operation and to each other and their ongoing determination to confront this Islamist threat.
The nature of these situations is terribly traumatic for everyone, of course. I would ask people to think of those who have to bring the news of these losses to the families. I have been in the position of being the duty officer who has to go and visit a family and be first person to advise them of their loss. This is a very difficult job to perform. We should spare a thought for those who serve that purpose in our Defence Force as well. I have seen the consequences of what happens on the ground to our men and women and to our allies, and know what trauma it causes to the colleagues of these soldiers and how they will be grieving and drawing together to deal with that grief. We should spare a thought for their colleagues who remain and of course for the injured as well, who will have long periods of recovery to contend with. We should provide them with all the support we can.
The other aspect that is worth noting is the nature of service in the Australian Defence Force that is highlighted by this incident. People focus, of course, on some of the combat casualties that we experience. But, on a daily basis, men and women of this Defence Force risk their lives in hazardous training to achieve their states of professional proficiency. We do lose people in accidents in training. The nature of that service is why we salute so much the men and women in the Australian Defence Force, because they assume those risks just to be in a position to deploy in the first place. There are quite often casualties in conflict zones relating to these types of transport or other situations. Before you even confront the threat of the enemy, the hazards of the environment are great to begin with, in relation to the diseases, the extremes of weather conditions, the hazardous nature of the terrain and the circumstances of having to move around in an operational context following operational procedures where the normal standards of the air traffic control or occupational health and safety will not apply. So we ask our personnel to assume that risk in the context of their training, in the context of deploying, in the context of conducting these operations. One of the most heartbreaking experiences of my service was a previous helicopter accident we experienced here in Australia where we lost 18 of our personnel in the crash of the Black Hawk helicopters in northern Queensland. That was incredibly traumatic for the defence family at the time. Once again, they were training for the difficult circumstances of night operations, albeit not in an operational zone. So we should bear in mind that the entirety of service life encompasses these risks. That is why it is so special. That is why we pay such tribute to these personnel in the first place.
We are here today to recognise the further addition of names to the list of those which we honour in the service of this nation in the context of this conflict and the cause against Islamic extremism and the cause of peace and freedom. Their names will be added to that glorious history of the Australian Defence Force, the Australian Army. It will be an enduring memory. Our thoughts and our prayers go out to the families, the survivors and the colleagues of these members. We will bear them in our hearts forever and we will continue to support our troops in every way possible.
 (Mr S Georganas)—I understand it is the wish of honourable members to signify at this stage their respect and sympathy by rising in their places.

"Haase, Barry, MP",LP,2010-06-24,"—I rise today to bring the attention of the House to the fact that the original Federation division of Kalgoorlie, created of course in 1901, will at the proroguing of this parliament disappear from the list of electoral divisions across Australia. Back in 1901 the electorate of Kalgoorlie was one of just five Western Australian seats that were part of the 75 seats across Australia. Since 1901 there have been a number of outstanding members representing the seat of Kalgoorlie. From 1901 to 1903 there was Mr JW Kirwan for the Free Trade Party. He was followed by Mr CE Frazer of the ALP, who was followed in 1913 by Mr H Mahon for the ALP. In 1917 there was Mr E Heitmann for the National Party. In 1919 Mr H Mahon was back again. In 1920 there was Mr G Foley and in 1922 there was Mr AE Green for the ALP. From 1940 for a period of 18 years there was Mr H Johnson for the ALP. In 1958 he was replaced by Mr P Browne for the Liberal Party—for the first time there was a Liberal member for Kalgoorlie. In 1961 there was Mr F Collard. From 1975 till 1980 Mr J Cotter, who was know as Mick Cotter, served for the Liberal Party. Then Mr Graeme Campbell served for 18 years, firstly, as an ALP member and, secondly, as an Independent. Of course, I took the seat in 1998, 12 years ago.
Kalgoorlie is an electorate that is enormous. Its area today is some 2.3 million square kilometres. It was a fraction of that size when it was first formed in 1901. It has the auspicious title of being the largest electorate in the world today. To give an idea of comparative size to those who have no idea of the vastness of Australia, it occupies approximately a third of the Australian landmass. It is in contrast to the smallest electorate of Australia, which is Wentworth. Wentworth would fit into the seat of Kalgoorlie some 88,472 times. Of course, because that is the case, as member for Kalgoorlie I have one more staff member just to do the job. We are all incredibly capable.
One of the outstanding representatives for the seat of Kalgoorlie was, of course, Mr Mahon, who became the Postmaster-General at one stage of his career. Another thing about the seat of Kalgoorlie, and more specifically the location of Kalgoorlie, is that it was the population of Kalgoorlie in 1901 that justified the formation of the Federation. Federation was looking a little shaky there for a while because Western Australia, of course, was not particularly interested in giving up its direct connection to the UK, but it was the overwhelming vote of the population of Coolgardie, Kalgoorlie and Boulder that swayed that final decision. So, for the education of the House, it is reasonable to suggest that it was because of the population of Kalgoorlie-Boulder that the Federation was formed in the first place.
I remind the House again that as of the proroguing of this parliament, whenever that may occur, the name Kalgoorlie will forever leave the list of Federation seats. That is indeed a sad day. We are moving on, and the area will in the future be represented by the seat of O’Connor and the newly created seat of Durack, which, God willing, I will be very, very proud to represent.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Kalgoorlie Electorate</title>,Adjournment,49,1,speech
"Hunt, Gregory, MP",LP,2010-06-24," asked the Minister for the Environment Protection, Heritage and the Arts, in writing, on 23 November 2009:
What sum of money has the Government spent on whale research papers, what are the titles and dates of the papers, and what sum of money was spent on producing these papers.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS IN WRITING</title>,<title>Whaling</title>,Questions in Writing,50,1,question
"Garrett, Peter, MP",ALP,2010-06-24,"—The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:
The Australian Government primarily funds whale research through the Australian Marine Mammal Centre (AMMC), based at the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD). These funds are primarily administered through a research grants program. Under this program, proposals are sought that deliver the highest quality science outcomes to address the most pressing marine mammal management needs.
To accommodate Australia’s national and international obligations, and to reflect the large-scale movements of many marine mammal species, the funding priorities of this program focus on the whales, dolphins, seals, sea lions and dugongs of the Australasian region, including the waters of the Indian, Southern and South Pacific Oceans.
The priorities of the program have been developed to incorporate scientific and management priorities identified from or through:
Australia’s obligations under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999;
national recovery plans for listed threatened species;
Australian science in Antarctica;
relevant international treaties;
broad-scale consultation with the marine-user stakeholders and the scientific community; and
the national Strandings Sampling Protocol.
The AMMC Grants Program is open to both public and private bodies and individuals. The Program is open to state government departments. Commonwealth bodies are eligible to apply for funding, however, under the 2009 Commonwealth Grant Guidelines, only Commonwealth bodies under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies (CAC) Act 1997 are eligible to receive grant funds.
Applications are assessed for their scientific merit by the National Marine Mammal Scientific Committee (NMMSC) and for their relevance, utility and priority for management and conservation needs by the National Marine Mammal Advisory Committee (NMMAC).
All recipients of funding under this program are required to sign a Funding Agreement with the Australian Government through the AAD that outlines Commonwealth oversight of the research projects. This agreement covers rights and responsibilities including the project budget, financial and performance reporting and acquittal, intellectual property, assets and data requirements.
Between the 2008-09 AMMC funding rounds, the Australian Government has provided $2,715,765.62 in marine mammal research grant funding. These include projects conducting research on whales, dolphins, seals, sea lions, dugongs, or combinations of these species. Approximately 57 per cent of these funds ($1,547,986.30) have been spent on projects conducting cetacean research. A list of all projects funded is below.

AMMC grant funding is provided to undertake research and is not conditional on publication. The list below is of papers produced by AMMC grant recipients. This list may not contain all papers published on cetacean research arising from AMMC grant funding. Some grants that have already resulted in publications may yet produce more publications; some grants will never produce papers because the research did not proceed as hoped. It would therefore be misleading to link the grant awarded with a cost for papers produced to date.
