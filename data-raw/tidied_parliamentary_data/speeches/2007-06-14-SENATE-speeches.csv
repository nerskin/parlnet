"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2007-06-14,"—I want to take this opportunity to speak to the second reading of what is the ‘Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) and All Praise John Howard Bill’. I find—
 (Senator Moore)—I note that it should be Prime Minister Howard.
—It probably would be. I noticed that on the list of bills here today there are a series of pieces of legislation being referred to, usually in the conventional form—that is, by a direct description of the bill, for instance: Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Amendment Bill 2007; Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment (2007 Measures No. 1) Bill 2007; Corporations (NZ Closer Economic Relations) and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2007; and Migration Amendment (Statutory Agency) Bill 2007. These are bills that tell us what the legislation is about, whereas this particular bill, the Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Amendment (2007 Budget Measures) Bill 2007, has this Orwellian description attached to it, which is increasingly occurring in this department. It is supposed to be some symbol of modernity, but it reduces our legislative program to a propaganda sheet whereby the government seeks to insert a political message into the title of a piece of legislation. Frankly, this is a very retrograde step. I wish to draw to the attention of the chamber that this is happening increasingly within this department, whereby the brave new world has very much come to the Department of Education, Science and Training.
This bill amends provisions relating to the Investing in Our Schools Program and provides funds for other school programs—capital funds for non-government schools and the Literacy, Numeracy and Special Learning Needs Program. Investing in Our Schools provides small targeted capital grants directly to government schools as well as non-government schools. In her second reading speech on this bill, the minister, Ms Bishop, noted that the Investing in Our Schools Program had proved to be very popular. She said the reason for that was that additional funds were to be appropriated. What she failed to mention was that for government schools this is the case, but not for the non-government schools, where there is in fact a new and lower cap that has been placed on the grants that any individual school may receive.
And, while the opposition supports in principle any moves to provide additional funding to schools, which of course this bill does and so we will support it, what needs to be appreciated is the dishonesty of the government’s message here and the way in which it presents this legislation. Of course, there should be a clear appreciation of the higher priority that Labor gives to the importance of education given the significance of education to our national prosperity and the continued security and social cohesion that education helps facilitate. Therefore, it is unfortunate that the minister failed to mention in her second reading speech that the effect of this particular piece of legislation was to lower the cap on grants through Investing in Our Schools for government schools. So the ceiling on grants will be lowered from $150,000 to $100,000. In other words, the government has shifted the goalposts mid-program. It has suddenly told government schools: ‘The application you were preparing for $150,000 in funding—scrap it. Write another one, reducing the amount by a third.’
When the program was announced as part of the coalition’s 2004 election commitments, the then minister for education, Brendan Nelson, indicated in a letter to school principals:
… the maximum amount an individual school community will receive is $150,000 over the next four years.
The same amount, the same specification, was included in the guidelines for the previous rounds of funding for this program, and the advice issued by the Department of Education, Science and Training on its website at that time said schools could apply for several projects up to a $150,000 limit over the life of the program. The guidelines for the second round however, which were released on 19 February this year, indicate that government schools are now only eligible for grants of $100,000. The government has reneged on its commitment as far as government schools are concerned. It has pulled the rug from under government schools despite the commitments it made at the last election. That is why I say there is dishonesty about the way this legislation comes before the parliament and the manner in which the minister has presented this bill.
Government schools that have already received a grant of less than $100,000 will only be able to receive a total of $100,000. It is only the schools that have been lucky enough to receive $150,000 to date—that is, those that have actually been able to bank the cheque—that are able to keep that more generous level of funding. If we compare that to non-government schools, we see that eligibility for grants completely uncapped. There are no restrictions. The sky is the limit. I understand that, in the most recent round of funding, 12 non-government schools received more than $1 million each. While a third of the funding that is available for non-government schools is capped at $75,000 per school—and again I stress that there is no absolute cap—the remaining two-thirds of the funding is for the non-government school sector.
There are quite clearly two sets of rules operating here. We have a situation where government schools have their maximum grant level slashed by one-third to just $100,000 while non-government schools are able to apply for more than $1 million. The minister said that this has proven to be a popular program. I am not surprised that it was popular—if you were one of the 12 schools. Many schools have decided to take advantage of it, but there is no reason why there should be different sets of rules applying for the different sectors. I cannot see any reason at all. I look forward to the minister explaining why it is that such different levels of regulation operate.
If the government’s schools policies were based on fairness, if they were actually based on need, then surely the rules of this program would be the same across the two different sectors—the government sector and the non-government sector. Government schools, surely, would be able to apply for the $1 million grants, as well as the non-government schools. I understand that, for the non-government sector, funds are targeted to the needier schools, but there are at least as many needier schools in the government school system that might benefit from the generous amounts available through this program as there are in the non-government sector. In fact, it might well be argued that there are many more needy students in the government school system than there are in the non-government school system.
As I understand the situation, the government has been far from even-handed in its policy approach to school funding. It has failed dismally on the fairness test; it fails to fund all schools on the basis of need. I contrast this with Labor’s approach, which is predicated on a commitment to fund schools on the basis of fairness and need. My colleague Stephen Smith has made that proposition perfectly clear. Just two days ago Mr Smith, who is the shadow minister for education, made four very clear and unequivocal points about Labor’s new policy direction for schools. Along with Kevin Rudd, he made it clear that Australian voters can expect from a Labor government a policy based on the following principles: a fair investment should be made at all levels of education, including schools and schooling; funding for all schools should be on the basis of need and fairness; Labor will not cut funding to any school; and Labor will not disturb the current AGSRC indexation arrangements for schools funding. Those are the four clear commitments that have been made and they underlie Labor’s policy. We can be confident that, in terms of those principles, we will be able to provide a policy that genuinely recognises a needs basis for the funding of schools. While there are obviously further announcements to be made in the run-up to the forthcoming election, I am confident that, with the propositions that have been outlined, we will be able to demonstrate a much improved allocation of funding to ensure that fairness is the underlying principle of schools funding.
The Prime Minister has recently attacked me on schools-funding policy. He has effectively sought to put words in our mouths and verbal Labor on these matters. Quoting statements that I made in this chamber a few years ago, he said that Labor believes the school policy is an addition, not an alternative, in terms of providing reasonable access to quality schooling. What he failed to point out is that we support the establishment of non-government schools and we take the view that we need to ensure that there is additional choice for parents with regard to the provision of non-government school education to give all parents a choice as to where they send their children. But that choice has to be predicated on the assumption that there are high-quality government schools available to all children in this country. A genuine choice of a government school must be available to all families, rich or poor, whether they live in the country or the city. On that basis there can be the provision of genuine equality of opportunity. It is not a fair and reasonable choice to run down government education—to undermine the quality of public education in this country—and then say that your choice is to go to a private school. That is not genuine choice at all. I am very concerned that the government’s approach on these questions does not provide adequate support to ensure the provision of high-quality public education in this country.
So I urge the government to appreciate that, if we are to provide genuine equality of opportunity in this country, that can only be addressed on the basis of genuine quality in the education provided to all children in this country, no matter where they live. I have a view on what our priorities should be for public education. Seventy per cent of Australians attend public schools in this country. That is the overwhelming majority of Australians. The principles that underlie our commitment to quality ought to be extended to that overwhelming majority. That should be a fundamental principle in the approach taken by the Commonwealth to the different sectors. Yet, quite clearly, you can see that that principle is not followed by this government in terms of this legislation. The principle is not worth the paper it is written on in terms of choice if it is not backed up by a fair policy administrative framework.
While supporting families in their choice of schooling, Labor not only recognises that most Australian children will attend public education but is also committed to ensuring that those families that enjoy the benefits of public education get access to an education of the highest quality. It is the responsibility of any government to guarantee that all children have such access. That is why we say that the Commonwealth government’s approach should be to cooperate and work with the states to ensure that that happens right across the Commonwealth. That is what our education revolution is all about: the provision of a national educational education system—at all levels—to make us the best in the world and to provide the children of this country with the best opportunities that can possibly be provided within the resources that this country has at its disposal.
Let us look at the principles outlined in this bill. The bill has provided additional funding to schools and therefore, of course, we support it. However, the bill reduces the amount of funding available to individual government schools through the Investing in Our Schools Program, and that is a matter of deep concern. It shifts the goalposts for government schools and it is not fair in that regard.
As I have indicated, this program finishes up in 2008. Now, in the year before it finishes, the guidelines the government has put forward for applications have changed. So the government is open to the charge that this program—which is essentially an ephemeral program—was no more than a political stunt announced at the last election, when commitments were made that have been reneged upon two-thirds of the way through this parliamentary term. This was not a cheap stunt: it will have cost $1.2 billion after four years—not an insignificant amount of money.
What concerns me, though, is that the government has sought to misuse this education funding in this way. It is therefore necessary to move a second reading amendment to draw attention to the approach that the government has taken. While the Senate should welcome the additional funding for the Investing in Our Schools Program, I would note that, when making the announcement, the minister was silent on the change of criteria for government schools halfway through the life of the program. The Senate should condemn the government for leaving many government schools ineligible to apply for additional funding by reducing the funding cap from $150,000 to $100,000 and failing to guarantee the future of the Investing in Our Schools Program beyond the current funding round.
I now move the second reading amendment standing in my name, as circulated:
At the end of the motion, add “but, although the Senate welcomes the additional funding for rural, regional and remote non-government schools, it notes the continuing failure of the Government to immediately address the need for additional funding for needy rural, regional and remote government schools”.",SENATE,<title>SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE (LEARNING TOGETHER—ACHIEVEMENT THROUGH CHOICE AND OPPORTUNITY) AMENDMENT (2007 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2007-06-14,"—I also rise to speak on the Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Amendment (2007 Budget Measures) Bill 2007. The bill provides for extra funding of $50 million to increase the English as a second language program for humanitarian entrants and introduces a loading in the recurrent school-funding arrangements for regional and remote non-government schools of around $40 million.
The Australian Democrats will support this bill. We have said on many occasions, along with others in this chamber, that any additional funding to enhance the facilities of our schools is more than welcome. We particularly welcome the first measure in the bill, which provides more funding for intensive English language tuition for newly arrived migrant primary- and secondary-school-aged children.
Under Australia’s humanitarian program, more families from African countries are coming to Australia. In 2003-04 and 2004-05, 70 per cent of the 12,000 refugees invited here were from Africa. In 2005-06 that was 56 per cent.
Resettling populations from protracted conflict areas does bring with it particular challenges but Australia is able to meet those challenges. Many are leaving refugee camps in which they have lived for most, if not all, of their lives. These camps often house 70,000 to 80,000 people. The refugees arrive in a country that offers welfare payments, access to health care and, importantly, schooling for children. But it is by no means an easy adjustment that they face when they come here. Some of these difficulties are common to all refugees: displacement and alienation; men being unable to find work and losing their sense of worth; women finding themselves isolated; children challenging traditional limits; and prejudice and racism, both real and perceived. Many African refugees have spent extended periods in refugee camps, often for more than 15 years, and have not had access to adequate food, water, shelter or health care.
Many of these women and children are highly traumatised. Many women have lost husbands and often on multiple occasions have been brutalised and raped in their home countries, during flight and in the camps themselves.  Many children and young people have known no other life than the refugee camp. They have grown up with very limited schooling—some with none at all. Their basic literacy skills are non-existent or very low. In 2005-06, 42 per cent of humanitarian arrivals were of school age with an average of only three years of education prior to their arrival. It is overwhelmingly obvious that we need to provide more support to these children and young people. We need to provide more support across all areas, including education and English language tuition.
In Australia, children whose schooling has been disrupted or whose schooling has been largely non-existent because of war, poverty and sickness are placed into classes according to their age and not their ability. They are already well behind the eight ball. Many will not have family or friends who are in a position to help and support them and, for these students, added support to learn English is a good thing and it will go some way to ease the difficulty that these young people face. I certainly hope that this is not the full extent of the government’s effort to provide more support. I hope the government will show more compassion for vulnerable cases and consider extending the time period and the level of service available for settlement services. I hope it will introduce long-term service provisions for at-risk cases and I hope it will fund widespread community education about the circumstances from which these groups come. The government seems very keen on spending money on advertising; let’s see some of that go where it could do some good. Rather than scaremongering about refugees with HIV, the government should provide real information about the experiences of these people who were not lucky enough to be born into Australia’s predominantly safe environment.
Unfortunately, the Democrats have far less enthusiasm for the second element of this bill. We would be the first to say that there is a clear need for additional resources for education in rural and remote Australia—that is nothing new. This government and previous governments have struggled to provide equitable access to quality education and training in rural and remote locations, and that has been the case for many years. The reality is that schools and training facilities outside metropolitan areas have different needs and costs to those in the cities, and this applies equally to government and non-government schools and facilities. It is a great shame that the government has not recognised this—these institutions are affected by their location.
There is a mountain of evidence and information available about student participation and achievement levels in rural education. On average, the school performance of country students lags behind that of urban students. There is a gap of 11 points between the percentage of students in metro areas passing the year 3 writing benchmark test and their counterparts in rural areas. That gap pretty much stays the same across years 5 and 7, give or take a percentage. One in five students in rural schools is not meeting the writing benchmarks, and it is no better in reading and numeracy. Yes, the gap between kids in metropolitan schools and kids in rural schools is only seven points in year 3, but by year 5 the gap increases to 11 and 12 and stays there for year 7. Again, we are looking at one in five rural students not meeting the benchmarks, and the situation is even worse if you look at students from very remote schools. Here, the gap between the percentage of students from urban schools and the percentage of very remote schools meeting the year 7 reading benchmark is 38. That is a difference of 38 points. For writing, that figure is 33 points and for numeracy it is also 33 points. All of us in this place have questioned the benchmarking and testing that goes on in years 3, 5 and 7 as being useful in telling us what needs to be done, but here you have a very clear example of the differences between metropolitan, rural and remote, yet we only have a very partial response from this government to fix the problem.
According to the National report on schooling, country students are also far less likely to finish school than their metropolitan counterparts. Seventy per cent of students in metro areas complete year 12 and only 53 per cent from remote areas do so. Although students from remote areas make up around one-third of our school students, rural and remote students constitute only about 17 per cent of tertiary students in Australia. That is a disgrace. We know there are problems with attracting and retaining teachers in rural schools and that we need better pre-service teacher preparation and ongoing support for those working in these country areas. Indeed, a HREOC report back in the year 2000 recommended that all teacher-training institutions should require undergraduates to study a module on teaching in rural and remote communities and should also offer students the option to undertake a fully funded practical placement in a rural and remote school. Now, you do not hear the Minister for Education, Science and Training talking about this when she goes on about performance pay for teachers being the way to lift results, and we see nothing in this bill to fix that problem or pick up on that recommendation made seven years ago.
There are disincentives affecting staff in rural and remote schools. The isolation; cost of travel; cost of living, including higher telephone, food and power costs, poor-quality and often expensive housing; and limited opportunities to participate in professional development, with resulting impacts on promotional opportunities, are some of the many difficulties. There have been suggestions that we should have a senior teacher outreach program to enhance the ongoing education and training of rural teachers and to provide for rural leadership, support and development—again, gone missing in this bill. Positive long-term incentives to increase and strengthen the rural education workforce and to encourage teachers to remain in rural areas, incentives similar to the incentives offered to country health professionals, are clearly needed. There has been talk about the need for more flexibility at a local level so that education facilities can be restructured to become more viable and relevant to their communities.
These issues and solutions are not unique to non-government schools. They are matters which apply across the spectrum of rural, regional and remote education and across early learning, primary and secondary education, vocational training and higher education. And they apply to both government and non-government schools—and that is the crux of the problem with the measures in this bill: once again the government’s anti public services bias is showing through. Yes, according to figures from the report on government services, 24 per cent of non-government school students attend schools in regional and remote areas. But 32 per cent of all government school students also attend schools in these areas. The public education system gets none of these incentives. Those 715,502 students get absolutely nothing in this legislation.
The government’s tired old refrain that public schools get more of the total combined federal and state money misses the point. This should not be about public versus private schools. It is about what schools need to meet the educational needs of their students. Of course, as we well know now, that is not a government priority. If it were, it would not be able to justify diverting hundreds of thousands of dollars to wealthy schools while other schools have demonstrably too few resources to do their job.
Australia is unique in the world when it comes to an open-ended public funded system for non-government schools that places no obligations on those schools for overall educational outcomes and that takes no account of the schools’ existing resources. The reality is that some schools need extra funding, whether that is because of remoteness, the nature of the students they service or the existing levels of their resources. And the children at those schools deserve those extra resources, whether they are at government or non-government schools.
It is time that we had some honesty in the debate about funding for schools. Let us do a national audit of all schools—government and non-government—so that we can see what schools need more resources and what schools do not need more. Let us see schools with the greatest need, including those with students who have extra educational and social needs, getting the greatest amount of funding. Let us see all schools required to meet the same rules and obligations when it comes to providing education to all—and that includes being subject to FOI and anti-discrimination legislation.
Unlike those in most other OECD countries, despite receiving public funding, our non-government schools can pick and choose. To be fair, many non-government schools do accept children with extra needs, but we all know of cases where children from disadvantaged backgrounds or children with learning difficulties or disabilities are turned away from some non-government schools. If these schools do not feel the ethical obligation to provide for these students, at the very least they should be contractually required to provide for them if they want to receive public funding. And let us see all schools subject to a curriculum that will provide their students with the skills they need for a modern world.
It is not acceptable to provide public funding to schools that do not allow their children access to computers or that refuse to teach sex education, for instance. Let us see all schools required to meet the same accountability and transparency standards for the public funds they receive. The Australian public deserves to know how public money is spent. Let us not be fooled by the government’s very narrow definition of choice, which is simply code for entrenching inequality between schools and giving more support to those who are already most advantaged.
Let us remember that free public education is at the core of providing equality of educational opportunity, and that participation in quality education reduces poverty and social exclusion and improves health, wealth and wellbeing. Societies where the gap between the haves and the have-nots is smaller are more cohesive, healthier and happier societies.
I also note that this piece of legislation is yet another variation to the hopelessly flawed SES funding model. We were all hoping that this year might have been the year when that model was properly reviewed and looked at and a new, more sensible model was introduced. But I see it is just more of the same tweaking around the edges to provide funding here and there. As I understand it, most of the schools that are subject to the SES model are exempt in one way or another from its rules. This is a disappointing piece of legislation to have to deal with in this place; with a stroke of a pen this money could have been going to government schools as well in remote areas, but it is not. Shame on the government for doing this.",SENATE,<title>SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE (LEARNING TOGETHER—ACHIEVEMENT THROUGH CHOICE AND OPPORTUNITY) AMENDMENT (2007 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2007-06-14,"—I also rise to speak on the Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Amendment (2007 Budget Measures) Bill 2007. This bill delivers on the promises made in the May 2007 federal budget and continues the government’s very strong record of investment in education. The bill provides funds for the English as a Second Language Program for new arrivals and expands government support for non-government schools in rural and regional Australia.
The government recognises the vital importance of recent immigrants learning English. The ability to communicate with people in the workforce and in the general community is an essential skill for integrating into Australian society. As a result, the government is increasing its funding for teaching English as a second language in our primary and secondary schools. The coalition also recognises the challenges faced by schools in rural and regional Australia. Rural and regional schools face a number of costs that their counterparts in metropolitan Australia do not have to grapple with. Accordingly, the government has announced that a new funding loading will be applied to rural non-government schools, augmenting their initial federal funding by five per cent, 10 per cent or 20 per cent, according to their remoteness.
The government is proud of its record of support for non-government schools and for choice in education. The choice to educate children in non-government schools is one that is growing increasingly popular as parents are voting with their feet in what is a virtual referendum on the quality of Australian schools. In the last decade, enrolments at non-government schools have increased by approximately 20 per cent. Unfortunately, although Labor has indicated its support for the bulk of the federal budget this year, these funding policies are not really bipartisan.
We know that the Labor Party, perhaps because of the pressure they feel from the Australian Education Union, is, at best, ambivalent about federal support for independent and Catholic schools. Labor went to the last election with a hit list of schools whose funding would be slashed. They have spent the last 11 years in opposition complaining about the federal government’s support for choice in education. We know that the AEU, still using a Marxist critique, hate the idea that the federal government should facilitate choice. We know that the union movement will be bankrolling the Labor Party’s election campaign this year. We know that, for as long as the union movement holds the purse strings of the Labor Party, they retain their influence and dictate ALP policy. We have seen that expressed again in the papers this morning.
The new secretary of the ACTU has said that he wants a closer and more formal relationship with the Australian Labor Party. I would not have thought it was possible for there to be a closer and more formal relationship between the ACTU and the ALP than presently exists. But, apparently, it is possible for them to still get even closer. I do not know how that will manifest itself, but I will be waiting with bated breath to see what transpires. Already, the AEU has embarked on its regular dishonest advertising campaign, claiming that public schools are underfunded. The truth is that, whilst government schools enrol 67 per cent of all students, they receive 75 per cent of all public education funding. That is not a bad thing; it is a good thing. But it is not what you would believe to be the case if you watched the AEU’s deceptive advertising campaign. This is the sort of misleading and deceptive nonsense that we have come to expect from the unions and from Labor. But the Australian people see through it; they are not so easily fooled.
The AEU helped shape the Labor Party platform, as have other unions. Why wouldn’t they? They control 50 per cent of the votes on the floor of the ALP national conference—and it shows. When it comes to support for non-government schools, you cannot trust Labor. The Leader of the Opposition has been out there running around trumpeting the dumping of the Labor schools hit list, saying, ‘We hated private schools last election; we wanted to slash their funding, but we have now changed our mind, we now love them and want to support them by funding them.’ Mr Rudd has been out there saying, ‘The hit list policy has gone,’ promising that no private school will be worse off under Labor. Mr Rudd thinks that that will solve Labor’s problem. But not everyone is convinced by Mr Rudd.
I picked up yesterday’s Australian newspaper and saw that Bill Daniels, the head of the Independent Schools Council of Australia, wrote to Mr Stephen Smith, the shadow minister for education, to express his concern that the promises of funding from Mr Smith and Mr Rudd are:
… inconsistent with some of the statements in the ALP national platform—
the very platform that the antichoice Australian Education Union helped shape. What does the ALP national platform say on education? I went to the ALP’s website. When you click on the icon platform, this is what is on the ALP’s website—nothing. A month and a half after the national conference, the ALP have still not uploaded their national platform. I did try to assist the Senate on that issue, but I cannot because it is just not there on their website. The Australian, though, reports—courtesy of Mr Daniels, who has seen the relevant sections of the ALP platform—that it contains a clause to the effect:
… “income from private sources” will be taken into account when deciding how much money a school will receive …
We know what that means. That is code for private schools being defunded. If Labor won the next election, the schools hit list would be back. How do we know that? Because the ALP platform tells us that that would be the case. It is just another illustration of the old adage: don’t listen to what Labor say; look at what they do. They say they will not cut funding to independent schools, but their own platform suggests that that is just what they will do. Mr Daniels puts it best in his circular, when he writes:
… (Labor’s) policy, if implemented, would take us back to the dark old days when parents were penalised for their financial contribution to their children’s education.
That is the Labor way: a parent cares so much about their own child’s education that they want to put their own money towards it, and Labor thinks that should be penalised. We on this side of the chamber think it is a good thing that parents want to put money towards their child’s education. We encourage it and we support it. There is only one side of this chamber which can be trusted to support all schools—that is, the coalition.
In other areas of education funding, the 2007 federal budget maintains this government’s strong support for choice. The government will be increasing its support for children who do not meet literacy and numerous benchmarks with an expanded voucher scheme. The National Literacy and Numeracy Vouchers program provides a $700 voucher to the families of students who are not meeting literacy and numeracy benchmarks. Testing conducted at years 3, 5 and 7 determines students’ progress in these areas, ensuring that those who are falling behind are identified. These vouchers provide parents with an opportunity to seek additional help for their children outside the school system in a $450 million program. Vouchers are a very sound vehicle for delivering public funding in order to achieve these objectives. They promote choice and they direct funding to those services which actually help individuals.
I have been an advocate for a more fundamental and widespread use of education vouchers. Some of Australia’s leading institutions have added their support for this concept. The Group of Eight universities recently came out in support of student vouchers as part of a more consumer driven system. Earlier this year the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry heavily featured vouchers for higher education in its education reform blueprint. I am pleased that the government has continued to expand its use of vouchers to deliver education funding, and I look forward to further developments in the use of vouchers. I must commend Senator Birmingham on his first speech last night, in which he called for a comprehensive voucher system in the school sector. Under other proposals announced in the budget, the federal government has continued to intervene where state Labor governments have failed to deliver.
There are a few things which I must at this point take up in response to Senator Carr’s speech earlier. Senator Carr was making the allegation that this government has somehow dudded government schools and dudded independent schools in relation to the Investing in Our Schools Program. I should put on the record that the guidelines have not changed for the original amount of funding under the $1 billion plan that was announced at the 2004 election for government and non-government schools, except for the new allocation of funding announced by the Prime Minister earlier this year and the $40 million remaining from the previous allocation for state government schools. The original allocation provided was $700 million for government schools, for grants of up to $150,000; and $300 million for non-gov-ernment schools—$100 million of this amount for grants of up to $75,000 and $200 million for larger grants. Program funding was brought forward, through legislation for state government schools, due to overwhelming demand. However, non-government schools will be able to receive funding as per the original guidelines through to 2008 as funding was not brought forward through legislation.
But the real outrage regarding the Investing in Our Schools Program is the approach of the state governments. It is bad enough that the state governments do not adequately fund their own state schools—that is why they are called state schools: because they are run, they are managed and they are funded predominantly by the states. Not only do the states not adequately fund them, but after we introduced this Investing in Our Schools Program the state Labor governments actually creamed administration fees off the top of the grants to schools. We have seen in Western Australia and New South Wales those governments actually take funds from schools administration fees of over 20 per cent. They have creamed 20 per cent off the top for administration. Queensland, South Australia and the Northern Territory also impose fees and charges on successful applications. It is an outrage. These states do not adequately fund their schools, the Commonwealth has to step into the breach to support them and then state governments cream the money off the top. It is an outrage.
Also in this budget we have done more for literacy and numeracy. We know that providing students with skills in literacy and numeracy is critical to their development. We as a federal government are not going to stand by whilst a provider driven state education system fails in its duty to properly prepare students with the skills they need. In addition to vouchers, which provide assistance to underperforming students, the government will be rewarding high-performing schools who improve their literacy and numeracy standards with $50,000 grants. Further, the government will reward teachers who undertake ongoing professional education to ensure that Australia’s children are taught by the highest quality professionals. The government also realise that not all teachers are created equal. We are seeking to reward outstanding teachers with performance pay. And in its typical fashion, following the lead of the AEU, the Labor Party is opposing the apparently radical idea that teachers who perform well should be financially rewarded for doing so. After years of claiming that teachers are underpaid, they are opposing a program of merit based pay. Labor’s shadow minister for education, Mr Smith, mused earlier this year that performance based pay for teachers was something that he supported in principle, but he was quickly smacked down by the AEU. I note Mr Smith has now adjusted his rhetoric following the dressing down he copped from AEU Federal President Pat Byrne and is now talking about rewarding teachers for things other than student performance.
The government is also acting where state governments have failed in providing support for technical eduction. The highly successful Australian technical colleges are being expanded with three additional centres to meet the strong demand. These Australian technical colleges have gone from being just an idea to reality in a very short space of time. In the 2004 election the establishment of 25 colleges was announced, and by the end of this year 21 colleges will be operating around Australia. The good news is that the Commonwealth’s effort in establishing these colleges has shamed the state governments into establishing their own technical colleges. Some 20 or 30 years ago the states, very unwisely, dismantled the old tech colleges that we had. We recognised that that was a mistake and we did something about it. Thankfully, as a result of what we have done, by 2009 there will be 70 technical schools around Australia. There are now 25 and the rest will be established by the states. So by 2009 there will be between 25,000 and 35,000 young Australians at technical colleges. That is what I call a real education revolution. This is not just about having a lathe or a pie warmer in every school, as Mr Rudd announced as his grand technical education revolution; this is about having 25,000 to 35,000 real students enrolled at 70 technical colleges around Australia. That is a real education revolution.
In addition, the federal government’s usage of vouchers to promote choice has been expanded to cover Australian apprentices with the new apprenticeship training voucher. First and second year apprentices in areas of skills shortage are eligible for vouchers to the value of $500 to defray the cost of their education. Those vouchers are in addition to the government’s $2,000 tax-free wage boost for young Australian apprentices. If Labor were doing their job and providing real choice for students—something which they are, belatedly, starting to do now that we have shamed them into introducing their own tech colleges—then some of these federal programs would be unnecessary.
Perhaps most importantly, the federal government will be encouraging the development of additional academically selective government schools as part of the next round of funding negotiations with the states. New South Wales does have a number of academically selective government high schools—something in the order of 17—Victoria has two and South Australia is in the process of establishing its first three. There is no reason why, because you lack the means, you should not be entitled to the best education possible. Unfortunately the state education systems, which have become so monochromatic, have not provided real choice and real variety in their own systems. That is something that the Commonwealth is going to endeavour to encourage the states to do in the next round of funding negotiations. I have to admit that the Victorian Labor government have reluctantly agreed to build an additional two selective entry schools after pressure from the Victorian state opposition, but that does not go far enough.
Academically selective schools do offer real opportunities to talented kids from disadvantaged backgrounds who lack the means, and I think the states need to realise the benefit of offering that sort of choice in the state sector. On the issue of education, we know where the coalition stands—this government supports choice, it supports excellence and it supports higher standards. The real test though is for the Australian Labor Party. Will they toe the union line or will they support parents? Will they support choice? It is time for Labor to stop paying heed to special interest groups and to stand up for standards and choice. It is time for the Australian Labor Party, once and for all, to abandon the politics of envy.",SENATE,<title>SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE (LEARNING TOGETHER—ACHIEVEMENT THROUGH CHOICE AND OPPORTUNITY) AMENDMENT (2007 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2007-06-14,"—The Greens are always happy when the government spends more money on providing improved education services to those in need. The government would have us believe that this is what the Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Amendment (2007 Budget Measures) Bill 2007 does in both of its parts because it delivers more money for new migrants and refugee arrivals in the first half and in the second half it delivers more money to private schools. The Greens welcome the increase in money for the English as a Second Language—New Arrivals Program, which is very much needed, but we do not support the further increase in funding to private schools in this bill. I will move on to the reasons for that later.
First I want to talk about the English as a Second Language—New Arrivals Program component of this legislation. This bill doubles the amount of per capita funding for this particular program. It is a program that is designed to give intensive support to new migrants to Australia who come in either through the normal migration stream or through the humanitarian refugee intake. These are young migrants who need both the language skills and the basic learning skills necessary to integrate into further schooling, into further education or into the workplace. The Greens welcome this funding increase because we have long held the view that Australia can and should provide a welcoming environment for immigrants and refugees whom we accept and that part of the welcoming environment we provide must include adequate English language training for those who do not have English language skills.
Sadly, the funding increase in this bill is not part of, or combined with, the other necessary support for public education that is needed to ensure that the increased money into this program can work. So we see a situation where students go to intensive English language centres—like the one that I visited in Beverly Hills in Sydney on Friday—and are able to get fantastic support for the time that they are there. But the government’s funding limits the support they can receive to three terms. Then you see a situation where perhaps a 17-year-old young man from Sudan, who has come to Australia through our refugee program, has been put into this intensive English school but only for three terms. He is not able to get the English language skills that he needs to go on. Because the federal government has reduced the funding to other public education services, migrants cannot go on to a well-funded TAFE where they could do a course like the adult basic English course, which used to be much more accessible in TAFEs. Since the federal government has cut funding to TAFEs, we have seen a lot of TAFEs around the country getting rid of their adult basic English courses because they do not have the funding to continue to run those courses. What this means is that the benefits that are provided through the funding program that we are dealing with in this legislation—benefits that might enable a young Sudanese boy who comes to Australia to get three terms of intensive English language support—cannot be continued for him because there is no TAFE course available for him to attend so he can get the English language skills that he needs.
Three terms of intensive English language support does not provide you with the capacity to go out and get a job in the workplace. I will give an example of this. When I visited the school on Friday one of the teachers told me about the afternoon she had sat down in front of a computer with a number of young African men who had come to Australia as refugees. They were only allowed to spend three terms there, so they were looking at what they would do when they left. There was not a TAFE course available for them to go to, so she was trying to help them to find some employment. She went online to the Coles website because these boys wanted to register themselves to pack shelves at night in the local Coles supermarket. But three terms in this English language centre for African migrants who have never been in a formal schooling situation is not enough for these boys. It meant that they were not able to read the questions on the website about their work history. They needed to do this in order to register their names to pack shelves at the local Coles supermarket at night.
There needs to be an increase in the availability of options for students—not only what is provided through the increased funding available in this particular bill but ongoing assistance in order to ensure that they can find a place in the workplace and contribute to our society. If we do not do that and we continue operating as we are now, with more refugees coming in from Africa—many of them have never experienced formal schooling and they are currently only able to spend three terms at an intensive English language centre, and then there is not another further educational opportunity for them—those people will end up not being able to contribute to or engage with our society. Many of them will end up in our prisons. That is what we are already seeing happen. Young boys are coming through as refugees and going through the English language program, but, because there is not the ongoing support that they need to get a job, to get into TAFE or to go to a normal school, they are ending up in prison. That is not the way to run our immigration system. Accepting people as refugees and then not providing them with the support to gain the English language skills that they need means that they end up not being able to integrate within the broader community. They end up not being able to engage and instead find themselves in prison. That is, unfortunately, the pattern that we are seeing.
I met a young girl at the intensive English centre on Friday who was an asylum seeker trying to come to Australia. She was turned back by the Australian government and had spent the last couple of years in Lombok in Indonesia, where the Australian government pays to keep asylum seekers that they have turned away. She is one of a lucky few who have recently been accepted to come to Australia. But her brother was not so fortunate. He was on a boat trying to get to safety and drowned. He drowned as a result of trying to get protection—from the Australian government in this instance. This young girl was sitting in the reading class on Friday, making a real opportunity of the experience that she was given through the program for which funding is increased in this bill. But she needs more support than that.
The Greens would like to see the federal government increasing the amount of support that is available for this program, which is a very good program. They do that in this bill, but there is a need to ensure that students are able to spend longer in intensive language centres getting support and that there are other services like full-time school counsellors to help people, such as this young girl, who do not have the English language skills that they need to attend a normal school. She also has to deal with the trauma of having lost her younger brother who drowned while fleeing the Middle East on a boat trying to get to safety. There needs to be an increase in the support available not just in relation to the programs but for school counsellors at intensive English language centres as well.
The intensive English language centre I visited cannot apply for support for infrastructure because of the way the government structures its funding for capital infrastructure at schools. Schools can apply for funding if they have a Parents and Citizens Association at the school. This school does not have that, because the parents are newly arrived migrants or refugees and they are trying to get on with their own lives. They are not in a position to spend a lot of time and effort setting up a P&C at a school where the kids will only go for three terms. The school is not able to have a functioning P&C that can write funding applications to get capital infrastructure from the federal government for their school. At the Beverly Hills school you see committed teachers who are doing fantastic work all through the week going in on the weekend to build a mound around the edge of the school right next to the railway line in King Georges Road, one of the busiest roads in Sydney, to stop the noise getting into the school. There is no capacity, through the way in which the federal government funds capital infrastructure at public schools, for them to apply through government mechanisms to get any support for such infrastructure. So the teachers have to come in on the weekend and build the mounds so that the students can continue with their work.
The Greens want to hear from the minister—and perhaps he can address these comments—whether negotiations have occurred with the state government about how this funding will be implemented. In New South Wales the state government contributes additional funding to these programs and to the funding of intensive English centres. We welcome the increase in the bill and we want to make sure that the response by the New South Wales government is not that it will reduce the funding it makes available to these intensive English centres. The Greens would like to see the state government follow the funding increase in this bill and also increase its component of funding for intensive English centres so that the schools can get the additional funds that they need to provide the quality education that they give students.
I will now turn to the second part of the bill, the increased funding to private schools, which the Greens do not support. It is very hard to keep track of the new and innovative ways the government dream up to give legislative expression to their preference for private schooling. Since they came to government they have tinkered so many times with the way the Commonwealth subsidises private schooling that it is no wonder that the public, the media and parliamentarians get confused about how it all works.
At the time the government introduced their socioeconomic status—SES—funding model they would have had us believe that it would clarify the process and bring some simplicity to the way in which the funding operated. But it does not do that. The mess of funding get-out clauses, of special cases and of cosy arrangements continues to proliferate. We have seen SES funded schools, then SES ‘funding maintained’ schools, then SES ‘funding guaranteed’ schools, then there were the Catholic ‘funding guaranteed’ schools and now, presumably, with what is proposed in this bill, there will be some SES Catholic ‘funding guaranteed remote bonus’ schools. It is hardly a simple system for people to understand.
The cosy arrangements in this particular bill are not the worst that we have seen. The Greens recognise that, like public schools in remote areas, there are private schools which are not as well resourced when compared with other private schools. On the other hand, there are some which are very well resourced and most would be better resourced than their local public school, as is the case across the country. But this bill does not contain any provisions for finding out how rich a school is before deciding that it needs more public money. It does not means test the schools, which may be in receipt of large fees, generous bequests, endowments, earnings and other income streams. How do we know that the schools really need this money, given that there is no assessment done? How do we know that this will not be a foolish waste of taxpayers’ money—money which is urgently needed in other areas, like teaching English to new arrivals and to migrants? The answer is that we do not know. Even if we believe that there is a genuine need for some increased public subsidies to rural and remote private schools, which remains to be proven, we know that the area that needs government funding most is the public school system right across the board.
The Greens reject as bogus the argument that the Commonwealth is somehow responsible for private schools and the states are responsible for public schools. It is an argument that has no basis in law, in the Constitution, in history or in practice. Both levels of government choose to subsidise private schools, and both are significant contributors to public schools. The key point of departure between the Greens’ view and those of the Labor and the Liberal parties in this area is that both those parties are happy to allow much-needed public funding go to the wealthiest private schools while public schools suffer. Neither is prepared to stand up for the rights of public schools in this country. For example, the federal government does not impose an appropriate or an equitable level of accountability or responsibility to go along with this public subsidy to private schools.
Many, indeed the majority, of the remote and rural schools that will receive a boost from this bill are in fact majority publicly funded—that is, they receive most of their income from the government. Yet these schools do not have the same responsibility and accountability requirements. They are able to not adhere to antidiscrimination legislation. They are able to avoid the level of financial accountability and openness required of public schools. And they are allowed to teach content that simply would not pass muster in a public school. The Greens cannot support the extension of this subsidy to private schools with no means testing and no equivalent subsidy to public schools. I will be moving a second reading amendment to this piece of legislation, which I will foreshadow. That Greens second reading amendment:
… condemns the Government for devising a funding system for non-government schools that:
fails to take into account the relative wealth and income-raising capacities of each school;
does not require an appropriate level of accountability and openness from non-government schools in exchange for the receipt of public monies;
consistently favours non-government schools ahead of government schools;
continues to allow non-government schools which are now largely publicly funded to discriminate against prospective students based on ability to pay fees;
unfairly ties the funding of non-government schools to the cost of education provision in government schools;
is formulated without any reference to its effect on the quality of school education as a whole . . .
The Greens’ policy seeks to end this ineffective approach to schools funding and instead establish a national scheme that would be guided by need, by fairness and by the basic principles of educational outcomes—and in the spirit of cooperation with the states, rather than coercion. We do not propose a final blueprint for such a system. We propose instead a nationwide inquiry into the effectiveness and the equity of current arrangements with a view to introducing complementary legislation at state and federal levels to give life to a simpler, a fairer and a more effective funding system. I cannot say exactly what such a system would look like, but I can tell you what it would not look like. It would not allow remote public schools teaching the neediest children in the country to go begging whilst super-rich private schools in capital cities continued to receive government subsidies. It would not allow some schools to discriminate on the basis of wealth whilst receiving government funds. It would not dish out public money to schools without allowing open public scrutiny of the financial arrangements of those schools. And it would not allow public funding to support schools that promote discriminatory values and impose those values on the children in their schools.
The Greens want diversity and excellence in our school system. The Greens believe that it is not beyond the wit of Australians to construct such a system. And we believe that what we have now falls well short of that goal. I hope to see steps taken by both the major parties that address the influence that those components of the community with strong vested interests, through the churches and rich private schools, are having on the way in which public funding is being distributed to schools in this country. I want to see governments at the state level and at the federal level putting the priority on public education, making it the centre of the responsibility of the federal government to provide government funding to our public school system. We need to see, particularly in the lead-up to an election, a commitment from both the government and the opposition to invest in our public schools and to provide their much-needed support. We need to see a statement of support for the work that is done in our public schools. Let us see some value of the great work that is done. Let us see some acceptance of how much they are contributing to our society. That is what I would like to see. I would like to see both the government and the opposition talk about how much they value the work that is done in our fine public schools. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE (LEARNING TOGETHER—ACHIEVEMENT THROUGH CHOICE AND OPPORTUNITY) AMENDMENT (2007 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2007-06-14,"—I thank all honourable senators for their contributions to this debate. In response to the inquiry you made of me, Senator Nettle, concerning consultations with state governments in relation to the implementation of this program, I am instructed that there have been and will continue to be consultations at a departmental level between the Commonwealth department and the state and territory departments. I hope that answers your inquiry.
May I say, though, in relation to Senator Nettle’s contribution, as to those of Senator Carr and Senator Allison, that it seems there are some on the left of politics who cannot grasp the notion that schools funding is not a zero-sum game. It is not as though every dollar given to a private school is a dollar taken from a government school. One of the hallmark achievements of the Howard government has been to increase, in absolute terms, Commonwealth support for both private and government schools in the course of the last 11 years. I do not have the figures readily at hand but, as Senator Carr, who I know takes a close interest in this matter, well knows, the extent of Commonwealth investment in both sectors of school education—government and private schooling—has massively expanded under the Howard government. How can it be, when there is a significant increase in the allocation of funding to both sectors, that one can imagine that this is a zero-sum game? In fact it is a win-win situation for schools education overall.
In summing up, may I say that the Australian government makes a substantial investment in education, providing approximately $33 billion to government and non-government schools over the period 2005-08 and delivering genuine choice for Australian parents. Funding for state government schools has risen by close to 70 per cent in real terms since 1996, while enrolments have risen just 1.2 per cent. That gives the lie to your proposition, Senator Carr, as it does to that of Senator Nettle and Senator Allison, that money paid to non-government schools is money taken from government schools. There has been a massive, 70 per cent increase in real terms since 1996. I do not hear you applauding that, Senator Carr, I am sorry to say. The enrolments, however, during that period of 70 per cent increase in funding have risen by only 1.2 per cent. It remains the fact that state schools enrol 67 per cent of students and receive 75 per cent of total public funding for schools.
State governments have primary responsibility for education in state government schools. They own-operate under the major source of funding for state government schools. While the Australian government supplements that funding as a percentage of the state investment, few people realise that if state governments increased their investment federal funding would increase automatically. There is a shared responsibility between the state and federal governments. State governments accredit and regulate non-government schools, while the Australian government provides the majority of public funding.
Through the Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Amendment Bill 2007 to amend the Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achievement through Choice and Opportunity) Act 2004, the Australian government continues its commitment to invest in young Australians in regional and remote areas to deliver stronger educational outcomes for all students regardless of where they live. The Australian government is providing an additional $121.1 million in funding over four years for regional and remote schools as part of the budget’s Realising Our Potential package for education. This funding will support students at more than 400 non-government rural and remote schools through a loading under the general recurrent grants program. The funding is being provided in recognition of the high cost of delivering educational services in regional and remote areas of Australia and the negative impact that this can have on student achievement levels. There is clear evidence that rural and remote students do not achieve as highly as their peers in metropolitan areas, and through this bill the Australian government is seeking to rectify this. In addition, two recent Australian government reports demonstrated significant inequity in access to education between regional and metropolitan students: the report Science, ICT and mathematics education in rural and regional Australia: the SiMERR national survey of 2006 and the report The impact of drought on secondary education access in regional and remote areas, also of 2006.
In levels of reading, writing and numeracy across all years in 2005, significantly more students in metropolitan and provincial locations met the benchmarks, relatively speaking, than did students in remote and very remote locations. I refer in particular to the National report on schooling in Australia 2005. National benchmark results: reading, writing and numeracy, years 3, 5 and 7, where Senator Carr, if he cares to interest himself in the matter, may find the statistics that form the basis for that conclusion. International studies, such as the Program for International Student Assessment and the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, show that metropolitan students generally perform better than their regional counterparts. The Australian government recognises the unique hardships regional and remote schools face, and these funds will enable schools to target those areas that most seriously affect their capacity to enhance educational outcomes for their students. This additional funding will now be available for non-government schools and will allow them to direct resources to assist their most educationally disadvantaged students. Funding can be used towards improving the educational opportunities for students in these regions by attracting quality teachers, increasing staff retention rates or improving teacher access to professional development, thereby ensuring that students in regional and remote areas are able to achieve their potential.
Building on the success of the existing English as a Second Language—New Arrivals Program, the Australian government, through the second measure in this bill, will double the per capita amount of support for eligible humanitarian entrant students. The increased funding will flow through state and territory government and non-government education authorities. Increased funding for intensive English language tuition is aimed at promoting the successful settlement and integration of newly arrived humanitarian students in Australian primary and secondary schools. It does this by recognising that English proficiency is one of the best ways to improve educational outcomes and future employability and to smooth the pathway to broader participation in Australian society.
The second measure in the bill implements a humanitarian settlement initiative. The bill will provide increased per capita funding to assist with intensive English as a second language tuition for school students entering Australia under the humanitarian program. The Australian government has implemented this measure on the basis of evidence identified in the 2006 MCEETYA Schools Resourcing Taskforce discussion paper entitled ‘Funding for English as a second language for new arrival students’ and the whole-of-government strategy to improve settlement outcomes for humanitarian interests. The English as a Second Language—New Arrivals Program does not set out to fund the total cost of intensive English language tuition. It is provided to assist with the costs of this important support but recognises that all levels of government are partners in the successful settlement and integration of newly arrived migrants.
The Australian government’s increased contribution under the English as a Second Language—New Arrivals Program combines with other federal education funding, such as the general recurrent grants program and targeted funding for students with a language background other than English through the Literacy, Numeracy and Special Learning Needs Program, to form a substantial package of support for these students. The focus of Australia’s humanitarian migration program centres on those groups of international refugees who are in greatest need of resettlement, which has meant that they need much longer in the initial phase of intensive English language tuition and, as such, the increase in funding announced as part of this package is confined to this group of students.
The Howard government is committed to supporting a quality school education for all Australian children, whether they attend government or non-government schools and whether they attend schools in capital cities, provincial centres or regional and remote parts of Australia. The program and the initiatives that it is putting in place are helping to create an Australian education system of high national standards, national consistency and quality so that all young people are prepared to meet the future demands of life and work. This bill reinforces the Howard government’s ongoing commitment to ensuring that Australian children are given the best opportunity to have a quality learning experience in the best possible environment. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2007-06-14,"—The Governance Review Implementation (Science Research Agencies) Bill 2007 is part of a procession of legislation coming before parliament implementing the recommendations of the report of Mr John Uhrig. As we know from similar legislation considered recently, the Uhrig report recommended new governance arrangements for many government agencies. The simple purpose was to streamline accountability—that is a pretty straightforward management practice. It is also about efficiency and better defining roles, responsibilities and relationships. It is about gaining greater clarity and clearer lines of communication in organisations. Most importantly, it is about improving the relationship between government ministers and the bureaucracy. We support this legislation because all this is good governance. But it is more than just the relationship between government ministers and chief executives; it is also about relationships, lines of communication within organisations and lines of communication between organisations.
As we know, the Commonwealth has an incredible maze of organisations. First, there are the line departments, which are the principal sources of policy and program management. In most portfolios there is a swag of smaller agencies, and some of these are established by specific statute. The list is long and there is a huge variety under each source of authority. The summary developed by the Department of Finance and Administration is very informative. Roughly, there is a division between those covered by the Public Service Act and the Financial Management and Accountability Act and those which are not; however, most are covered by the respective acts. There is an inclination to bring as many agencies as possible into that framework for consistent governance and accountability. There are other agencies which are not dependent on budgets and which are more commercially orientated, and they are accountable under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act. They must be set up by legislation for a public purpose and they must be a body corporate and hold money on their own account. Slowly but surely we are now seeing a convergence of governance into these models.
There are, of course, a few anomalies. Parliamentary departments are a case in point, and there are some with historic origins which are politically difficult to tinker with. For example I refer to the Repatriation Commission, set up under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act. When considered against the principles of the Uhrig report and the government’s program, this does still remain an anachronism. The bill today addresses governance changes for the above reasons in CSIRO, the Australian Institute of Marine Science and the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation. The principal change is in the appointment of the CEO, except for ANSTO. Instead of the Governor-General being the appointing power, there has been a shift to the board of each agency. These agencies therefore retain boards with executive power. That is distinct and different to other agencies where boards have been abolished or have lost executive power in favour of a more advisory role. The distinguishing factor is the degree of dependence on the budget and the independence considered appropriate by government. CSIRO, for example, while partly budget funded, also has a growing commercial interest. This for many has been a serious bone of contention, because its governance structure should reflect the nature of its business. Likewise, the role of the minister might need to be circumscribed. In this case, the minister’s responsibilities, for example, for contracts and funding limits have been reduced. For a quasi-commercial organisation such as CSIRO, that is also appropriate.
I do not need to go further into the specifics here but say that this rationalisation does make sense. But, as I have noted before on similar legislation, accountability is more than organisational structures and lines of reporting. It is more than improving communication and having better role clarity. It is also more than performance contracts and agreements, such as ministerial statements or letters of expectation. More than anything, it is about behaviour. And governance in the private sector is no different.
Look at the great catastrophes of recent times—for example, HIH. No amount of corporate legislation can prevent that sort of corruption. It is true that sanctions are available and that they do have some teeth. But that is not much solace for all of those investors who lost so much. Seeing some of the crooks behind bars might offer some comfort, but not enough. It is likewise with government agencies. Good governance does not guarantee good performance. In almost every case, good performance comes from good people.
Government agencies need worthwhile managers. Sometimes, as we know, that creates a dilemma, especially for those agencies with high specialisation. That might be specialisation in the law, medicine, science and many areas of research and policy development. Finding a CEO who has that status as well as the experience and the technical skill and reputation is sometimes, indeed often, difficult. This is particularly the case for the three agencies which are the subject of this bill.
The most critical element of each organisation is the quality of the chief executive officer. It is about far more than managing an internal budget. It is about being a leader in science and research and having a high personal reputation in the research community. Budgets are not difficult to manage; building commerciality and winning revenue are. Acting and managing organisations such as these in the public interest is also a most critical element. These organisations have few, if any, real competitors except, perhaps, within the research area, which as we know is rich in highly specialised niche sectors.
ANSTO is essentially regulatory and AIMS is uniquely concerned with the protection of our marine environment. So there is considerable diversity in these organisations, for which good governance measures must be applied. Let us hope that the refinements of the different models being made in this bill work to their advantage.
Let me conclude by repeating the remark I made about accountability the last time I spoke on a similar bill, and let me repeat the point I have made about behaviour being the fundamental ingredient of governance. The irony should not be lost on us. Despite this wonderful emphasis on accountability, it is being introduced by a government whose behaviour is the antithesis of good governance. The Howard government is probably the least accountable government this country has seen for a long time. The contradiction is absolutely breathtaking. We could go on for hours about the litany of failed accountability, but it would take much too long. We see it here at question time every day. We see it in nonanswers to questions on notice. We see the parliament being treated with contempt by ministers who prefer to say that it is too hard to answer a question—or, alternatively and increasingly, questions are deliberately misconstrued. I could go on.
The great disappointment in this behaviour is that others see their leadership’s values at work and in an open manner. Monkeys do as monkeys see. The example being set for the values and future behaviour of government is a matter of ongoing concern. The behaviour of spin, cover up, deceit and misrepresentation is now becoming universal. No matter how good our governance structures appear to be on paper and in black and white, it matters little if the current decline in government standards continues unabated.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNANCE REVIEW IMPLEMENTATION (SCIENCE RESEARCH AGENCIES) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2007-06-14,"—As Senator Bishop has already indicated, the opposition is supporting the Governance Review Implementation (Science Research Agencies) Bill 2007. We do so because, as has clearly been indicated, it makes sense to have clearer lines of communication and responsibility. It is particularly appropriate that CSIRO, ANSTO and AIMS, the premier scientific bodies responsible for our national and international research effort, are given appropriate administrative support to ensure that they can fulfil their proper functions, especially considering the enormous contribution that they have made over time and that I believe they will continue to make in the future. They represent public research assets which are the envy of many other countries. Collectively, over an 80-year period, these agencies have undertaken research programs that have saved existing industries and created new industries. They are absolutely vital to our national innovations system and they have profound national importance. As part of a national innovations system, they provide this country with the resources it needs to meet some of the challenges we face with respect to the great questions of our time, such as the ageing of the population, climate change and globalisation. They provide this country with a huge capacity to support our manufacturing industries, to advance new manufacturing industries and to find new technologies that allow us to meet the challenges of the day. So the governance of these agencies is of considerable importance.
In the case of AIMS, the legislation shifts the powers of governance towards the AIMS council, away from the minister. This is particularly important with regard to the appointment of a chief executive officer and the new power of the council to directly appoint the new CEO. Similarly, in terms of ANSTO and CSIRO, the legislation clarifies the relationship which exists between the CEO and the various boards or councils. Labor supports this legislation because it clarifies the financial responsibilities and the accountability of the boards of these organisations. They are very useful reforms.
I know from recent discussions with CSIRO that the project in contract management has been less than perfect. Contracts have been awarded on occasions to people in, I think, highly dubious circumstances. I have made these points at Senate estimates hearings. The Senate estimates process will still operate and provide us, as members of parliament, with an opportunity to pursue these matters. But, frankly, if these powers had been in place at the time of these events I have spoken about then there would have been a different response from those organisations. The fact that the minister failed in his duty of public accountability at the time is regrettable. So I look to the boards and the councils of these organisations to take up these new responsibilities with gusto. It will place greater importance upon the relationships between the minister and these boards. Frankly, a higher and more sophisticated response will be required as to the operation of these boards by way of direct line through to this parliament via the minister.
The autonomy and the integrity of these agencies should be foremost in our thinking. Notwithstanding the fundamental value of the research that these agencies undertake, the public perceptions of these organisations depend largely on the management of these organisations. This can be highlighted in the authority with which these organisations speak on scientific matters. The future health of our national research effort demands no less. But in recent times we have seen a ham-fisted—in fact, incredibly clumsy—approach to the capacity of our scientists to undertake research and to engage in public comment about the significance of research. Only two years ago the debate within CSIRO on climate change was a matter of some considerable public controversy. In recent times there appears to have been a shift in the policy directions of organisations on the capacity of scientists to speak out, and it is something I welcome. However, questions about the capacity of ministers to intervene to steer public debate on matters of scientific interest still remain. Therefore, these reforms go some way to providing a clearer demarcation of responsibilities to manage these organisations.
The employment of staff and the status of senior staff within these agencies ought to be the responsibility of these boards, but the responsibility for the general welfare of these organisations cannot be abrogated by the parliament. We have an ongoing responsibility to ensure that there is appropriate accountability through the estimates process and that the welfare of these agencies and councils is in fact protected. The prosperity of this country depends upon our capacity to remain competitive and productive and that, in my view, depends on our capacity to strengthen our national innovation system. That is precisely what the government has failed to do. It has failed to appreciate just how important these organisations are by not ensuring that that occurs. It has failed to ensure that their integration within the national innovation system is in fact upgraded and that there is a capacity for our scientists to contribute to public debate and genuine research effort to allow us to meet the challenges that lie ahead.
That is why Labor have proposed a comprehensive reform program for our national innovation system. We are committed to a comprehensive program to stimulate innovation, competitiveness and productivity in which these public research agencies will have a central role. Therefore, like Senator Bishop, I commend this legislation to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNANCE REVIEW IMPLEMENTATION (SCIENCE RESEARCH AGENCIES) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2007-06-14,"—I thank Senator Bishop and Senator Carr for their contributions to the debate on the Governance Review Implementation (Science Research Agencies) Bill 2007.  These amendments reflect the recommendations of the Uhrig review and align each agency’s governance arrangements with current best practice. This will ensure that administration of the recently announced government funding for AIMS, ANSTO and CSIRO for the next quadrennium—the largest ever research budget—will be efficient, effective and accountable. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2007-06-14,"—The Labor Party supports the Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (2007 Measures No. 1) Bill 2007. The bill proposes a range of mostly technical and housekeeping amendments to the Veterans’ Entitlements Act—or the VEA—the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act and the Income Tax Assessment Act. Its provisions seek to formalise current practice and policy, to better align the VEA with the Social Security Act, to correct some unintended or unfair consequences of legislative drafting and to improve the Department of Veterans’ Affairs administration.
An efficient administration ensures fair outcomes for veterans. These amendments touch upon the income and assets test, the tax treatment of veterans pensions and assets, bereavement payments, and eligibility criteria for assistance and compensation. Therefore, while these are fairly minor amendments, they will affect a considerable number of veterans and it is important that we consider the full range of their effects. I want to mention a few salient amendments in the bill before discussing Labor’s position on the administration of veterans issues, reiterating some of the points put in the other place by my colleagues.
The bill amends the VEA to require the Repatriation Commission to provide written notification of income support pension decisions and other matters and make a written record of that determination—setting out its findings on questions of fact, evidence and reasons for its determination. The commission will also be required by law to provide a copy of the decision, findings and rights of appeal to the claimant except where that information is of a confidential nature. I am advised that this largely updates the VEA in line with existing practice.
In addition, the bill will ensure that additional one-off payments of family assistance under the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (More Help for Families—One-off Payments) Act 2004 are not counted as income under the act. This will bring the VEA into line with the Social Security Act, which exempts one-off payments to families from this income test. The bill expands the definition of ‘compensation affected payment’ to include supplementary benefits. This means that, in cases of overpayment, supplementary payments will be recoverable where primary payments are recoverable. This is in line with the provisions of the Social Security Act as well.
The bill will amend the bereavement payment provisions to ensure that, where a deceased person’s payments include the Defence Force income support allowance, the bereavement payment provided to the surviving partner or carer also includes that allowance. It will also amend the income and assets test for the service pension and income support supplement to allow for the application of the deprivation provision to be reversed in circumstances where an asset is disposed of for less than its full value but adequate consideration is later received.
Schedule 2 amends the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004, broadening the definition of ‘service injury or disease’ to include those injuries or diseases contracted or aggravated as a consequence of medical treatment for an earlier service injury or disease and amending the onus of proof provisions to cover both persons claiming for the acceptance of liability and persons claiming for compensation. Schedule 5 clarifies the taxable status of Defence Force income support allowance payments in line with the tax treatment of the basic rate component of the ordinary age pension or the disability support pension. It must be remembered that veterans and ex-service personnel are often at their most vulnerable during the claims process, both emotionally and physically. Veterans and ex-service personnel deserve more. Constant improvement is necessary to ensure we have an effective operating system and administration which provide for the veterans community in a transparent and easily understandable way. For this reason, one of Labor’s six pillars for action on veterans affairs is to improve the operation of the department. This will be a key policy focus for a Labor government if elected later this year.
The Labor Party have spoken extensively in recent months about the need for improvement in the administration of the department. For example, we have raised the issue of improving the interface between Defence and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs to ensure a smoother transition from service to care, such as around record sharing. We have also expressed concern about the department’s claim-processing times. Departmental figures obtained in February showed that 4,570 claims have exceeded the average time taken to process a claim. While efforts are being made to address these backlogs, these waiting times are clearly unacceptable and should not have occurred in the first place. These long waiting times are occurring against the background of a net national reduction of 12.5 per cent over the last two financial years of staff allocated to process compensation claims under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act. The 2007-08 budget shows that the government will reduce the department’s average staffing level for the third financial year in a row.
Labor have been willing to support the work of the government in veterans affairs where positive steps have been made to enhance the wellbeing and care of veterans. In the recent budget, Labor supported the government’s initiatives which include: $25,000 one-off ex gratia payments for Australian former prisoners of war in Europe or their surviving widows, a doubling of the funeral benefit under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act from $1,000 to $2,000, and catch-up payments for special intermediate rate disability pensioners. However these initiatives do not go far enough, and in fact many are catch-up initiatives. The catch-up payments for special intermediate rate disability pensioners addressed the considerable erosion of the value of those pensions over the term of the Howard government but did not insure against future erosion through indexation.
Recent enhancement funding for the gold card addressed its serious decline due to underfunding over the term of the Howard government. Veterans were not receiving the services they needed. Labor have been busy putting forward positive plans for veterans: the indexation of the above general rate pensions to both the CPI and the MTAWE indices; a commitment to provide additional resources to the suicide prevention service ASIST; and an undertaking to do a health study of the children of Vietnam veterans. We want to make sure that, in all things, veterans get a fair go. Labor support the bill and look forward to its implementation. I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>VETERANS’ AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2007 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2007-06-14,"—The Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (2007 Measures No. 1) Bill 2007 is a relatively simple housekeeping bill that does not require a lot of description or debate. It makes amendments to a number of acts involving veterans benefits. Its aim is to correct anomalies contained in those acts. This is necessary to avoid unforseen matters cropping up. It only takes a few people to be affected unfairly for such amendments to become necessary. As such this bill is unobjectionable and is worthy of support.
It is worth reflecting, however, on this maze of legislation and the seeming inability to streamline it. This is particularly the case with veterans benefits. Such benefits originated far earlier than most of those in all other social security legislation. Veterans benefits were derived from the ravages on diggers, and their dependents, of World War I. They have always been distinct from social welfare payments. Inevitably, however, similarities between the two have been drawn. The separate origins of these benefits were forgotten by many. Indeed, some have wrongly suggested that the payment and the care of veterans should be transferred to what is now known as Centrelink. That will never happen, and nor should it. We have long preserved the veterans jurisdiction as a separate entity within government because of its unique status.
The history of veterans care and the public’s commitment to it is very important. The gradual move within and into the Defence portfolio, however, is a far more positive one. As care shifts from World War II veterans to the general population of ex-service personnel, that move becomes even more sensible. Even now the separateness of veterans affairs and Defence may not be as logical as it once was. The artificial division in the provision of services often leads to inefficiencies. The quality of services delivered by two agencies to separate populations—dependent only on eligibility for war service benefits—is hard to justify now. We recognise the special status of those who served to defend us in the past, but the nature of modern service is quite different, as are the needs for support. The dual operation of disability compensation schemes has become a nightmare, and it is often unfair. The new act will remedy that in time. But it is something that should have been done 15 or 20 years ago.
The situation is likewise with income support benefits. Differences between the service pension and the age pension are recognised, but over the years they have been brought into line. However, as this bill shows, there are still differences which trip up legislative drafters. It is difficult to keep in synch different legislation that affects the same population. In policy terms, there is only one substantial difference between the age pension and the service pension, and that is that eligibility for the latter commences five years earlier. But this is also historic and there must be doubt now about the relevance of that distinction—except for it being a mark of status between the two categories: the aged pensioner at large and the aged veteran.
The origin of that five-year eligibility demarcation reflects the shortened life span of many ex-World War I diggers, who spent many years overseas suffering interminable bombardment. It was likewise for many in World War II, although it is not necessary to get into a debate as to who suffered more. The point is that the issue of longevity, as affected by war service today, is increasingly becoming a dubious proposition. If, in policy terms, it is a mark of respect or of service, then let us say so. But, if it is a reaction to reduced life expectation, as a general proposition it is now doubtful. The fit soldier syndrome is equally as relevant.
So the question becomes: why doesn’t the government get serious and avoid this legislative process every year? Why doesn’t it provide one age service pension through the act? Preserve the age differential by all means; but apart from that the differences are minimal. If we can do it for disability compensation between two very large agencies, why not between two others? The answer is that the social welfare bureaucracy would never agree. That is because of the longstanding ‘warfare’ between agencies. The traditional values and cultures clash regardless of the greater good. That is why we now have such a strong focus on whole-of-government endeavours.
Government is quite rightly trying to bring some of these things together. There are two telling illustrations of this serious dysfunction in policy between the bureaucratic behemoths. The first is the Defence Force Income Support Allowance, which was legislated two years ago now. The policy conflict there was that the veterans lobby wanted to exempt veterans disability pensions from the means test for the age pension and other Centrelink payments for which it was counted as income. The government agreed to that proposal. It could have been done by adding a single word to the Social Security Act. But the social security mindset could not accept veterans compensation payments being treated in this manner. Nor would they administer the exemption through their payment system. So the Department of Veterans’ Affairs had to build its own new system to pay a refund of the equivalent amount, which social security had refused to deduct. This is mind-bogglingly stupid, but it is all on the pubic record and it all happened.
Again in the recent budget, a decision was made to pay a catch-up amount to T&PI veterans. Essentially, the government had agreed to the proposition that the value of the pension in isolation had declined over the years. Yet, having agreed to that, they chose to do nothing about the cause, which was a failure to index the whole pension—not just part of it—in line with other pensions. I bet this involved a social security objection to the indexation of a disability pension by a wage based index—that is, they stuck rigidly to a definitional difference in pension types between those which are economic and those which are non-economic. If I am not even close, perhaps the minister will advise me in his response. In policy terms, it makes little difference. As the government have clearly demonstrated, there is little policy consistency in this bill. Unfortunately, the government do not appear to care. So, instead of a better policy rationale between portfolios and legislation, we will have this legislative bandaid approach.
The same inane legislative fixes are produced budget after budget in the same area. These same amendment bills will keep coming before us, wasting the precious time of the parliament. Having said that, I will finish here and waste no more time. We support the bill but not the ridiculous process it represents. I ask the minister to respond to the issues that I have raised.",SENATE,<title>VETERANS’ AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2007 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2007-06-14,"—I too wish to address a few comments to the Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (2007 Measures No. 1) Bill 2007. As we have heard from previous speakers, the bill amends three acts: the Veterans’ Entitlements Act, the Income Tax Assessment Act and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. In the main, the proposed amendments repair inconsistencies between those acts and other legislation, particularly the Social Security Act. The bill before us also remedies unintentional consequences of previous legislation. Once again, we are here fixing mistakes that the government should never have made in the first place.
It is always disturbing to realise that legislation is flawed and even more so when that legislation is in the area of veterans affairs, because it affects people who have served in our defence forces. Currently, there are some 450,000 veterans and nearly 112,000 war widows. As we know, more than 100,000 Australians have died during the numerous conflicts in which our country has been involved. Many of those who were fortunate enough to return from active service did so suffering from physical and mental injuries. The lives of veterans and their families are, of course, significantly affected by their service. It is also a sad fact that every day the nation loses more of its World War II veterans. This fact was brought home to me recently when my father’s old battalion association advised me that they would be winding up next year. Anzac Day next year will be their last official function because there are not enough diggers left to maintain the activities of the association. I understand that it is not the only World War II battalion association going through that difficult process at the moment. So anything that we can do to make life better for our veterans—veterans of all wars—should be supported. The government should at least make an effort to ensure that future legislation avoids the neglect and mistakes that we are remedying today.
As senators on this side of the chamber have said previously, Labor supports the legislation. However, I would like to highlight a few matters in the bill. Currently, the Repatriation Commission is required to provide written notification of its decisions in relation to a number of claims and other matters, but the specific matters to be notified have not been prescribed in the Veterans’ Entitlements Act. Any senator or member who has assisted veterans in pursuing claims through the Repatriation Commission, or in appealing the decisions of the commission, can attest to how such matters often involve significant distress for veterans and their families, particularly when veterans feel that the nation they served has failed them in the process of applying for compensation. The amendments before us will require the commission to include in its notification its findings on questions of fact, evidence and reasons for its determination. Importantly, the person who made the claim will be provided with a copy of this information. While that will not always make good the disappointment of an aggrieved complainant, hopefully it will go some way to providing some more confidence in the system in place.
In addition, the bill amends the bereavement payment provisions to ensure that, where a deceased person’s payments include the Defence Force income support allowance, the surviving partner or carer also receives that allowance within their bereavement payment. This is an important step that needs to be taken to ensure that the partners and carers of veterans receive the financial support they require.
The Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 sees a number of amendments in schedule 2 of this bill. One such change that I find encouraging is the broadening of the definition of ‘service injury or disease’. The proposed amendment will allow for the inclusion of injuries or diseases contracted or aggravated as a consequence of medical treatment for an earlier service injury or disease. With such injuries and diseases now included in the MRCA’s definition of service injury or disease, veterans who do develop these problems will, hopefully, be better protected and supported.
There are worthwhile things in this bill, and the previous senators have outlined some of those. I also acknowledge the recent increase in funeral benefits for eligible veterans under the VEA to $2,000. That is a good move. There has been some progress made on the important issue of compensation for our veterans, but there are still issues that the government needs to address. One of the government’s biggest failings in providing for Australia’s veterans is its refusal to introduce complete indexation of veterans’ pensions. By refusing to index their pensions, the government has made life very difficult for our veterans. The erosion of the standard of living suffered by veterans for more than 10 years is significant. For example, a veteran on the special rate disability pension has lost somewhere between $70 and $92 a fortnight over the last decade. If Labor’s indexation policy were adopted, our veterans would receive the compensation for their service that they so clearly deserve. Labor is committed to properly indexing these pensions in the same way that the age pension is indexed.
I am pleased to say that the government has finally paid some attention to the veterans community, which has lobbied hard on this issue, because—surprise, surprise—in the pre-election budget recently delivered, the government issued veterans in receipt of the special rate disability pension a one-off catch-up payment. That once-only payment will assist disadvantaged veterans temporarily, but it does not equate to all the income that veterans in receipt of the pension have missed out on. While Labor support the one-off payments, we want veterans’ pensions to be properly indexed. Veterans not only deserve this increase in their pension but need it to maintain an acceptable standard of living. Hopefully the government will see this as the long-term problem that it really is and recognise that veterans and their families deserve to have the value of their payments maintained. They should not have to wait until an election budget is coming up for them to receive appropriate compensation.
Another example of the too little, too late method that the government prefers when it comes to compensating our veterans is the recently announced payment of $25,000 to former prisoners of war interned in Europe. You would think that no-one could argue that POWs deserve special consideration. I would suggest that most of our POWs endured conditions that are beyond the comprehension of anybody in this parliament. In 2001, former Australian POWs imprisoned in Japan were given a much overdue payment of $25,000. It was not until 2004, in the lead-up to a federal election, surprisingly, that the government finally made a payment to former Australian POWs imprisoned in Korea. Only this year has the budget allocated compensation to our POWs who were imprisoned in Europe. Previously the government argued that the conditions endured by those POWs did not warrant a compensation payment. It is a pretty mean and thankless government that could presume to apply a hierarchy of suffering to former Australian prisoners of war. The Howard government has had more than a decade to compensate these Australians for their suffering but, as I have said, it took an election year to see a change of heart from the government.
While we are supporting this bill, Labor will continue to monitor what the government is and is not doing for our veteran community. Another area of particular concern for Labor senators is the delays in processing claims handled by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs. The department’s 2005-06 annual report showed some startling figures in relation to the speed at which veterans’ claims are processed. Under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, the time taken to process new impairment claims had increased from 26 days to 130 days since 2004-05. Under the same act, the mean time taken to process primary injury claims had gone from 90 days to 146 days since 2004-05. These figures are disgraceful. It is outrageous that, at a time when our veterans need our support, they are left waiting months for a reply.
Labor senators pursued the matter of claims-processing times at last month’s budget estimates, and we will continue to pursue that matter, particularly in the light of the reduction in staffing numbers at the Department of Veterans’ Affairs which has been made to accommodate the budget restraints imposed on the department by the government—a government that continues to fail our veterans.
While I have the opportunity, I would like to commend the numerous veterans groups and organisations that are amongst the most tenacious advocates for their constituents and whose hard work has seen incremental advances for veterans such as those we see in this bill. But you have to ask, as more of our older veterans are dying or succumbing to the impact of their service related injuries and illnesses: who will continue to keep the government accountable for the responsibility we all have to our veterans community? You certainly would not want to rely on the government to do it—a government which increasingly governs according to the Prime Minister’s standing in the polls. You would not want to rely on the government to do the right thing of its own volition when it comes to protecting and caring for our veterans.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-06-14,"—The Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2007 amends the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980 to implement changes to the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation’s governance arrangements in line with recommendations of the Uhrig review. In particular, the bill’s amendments propose to discontinue the appointment of government members to the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation board.
The Australian Democrats support this bill but are taking the opportunity of this debate to point out that it could go much further. This bill does away with the procedure of appointing a government member to the board of the AWBC, which generally, but not always, is a good thing. Boards of authorities should in general be as free from government interference as possible, but there should be a transparent process for appointments on merit against set criteria. This bill does not in any way set out procedures for appointments on merit; it simply does away with the requirement that there be a government appointee to the board.
The criteria for the selection of someone to the AWBC board are set out in section 13 of the act. Although the amendment does away with a government member, the members are still appointed by the minister in writing and the criteria, set out in that section, are simply that they have must have knowledge of or experience in winemaking, grape growing, marketing, finance, administration or business management. This bill now adds knowledge of or experience in ‘government policy processes and public administration’.
The argument is that this will increase the transparency of the AWBC operations. I am not convinced, as the minister will still have the final say—it is up to him or her to sign off on appointments, and while the criteria cover a broad skills set they do not prevent the appointment of mates and the use of patronage. It is easy for the minister to simply appoint a person that he wants to the board—a mate. That is not an arms-length appointment on merit. And I am not persuaded that the role of the selection committee—which is made up of ministerially appointed members of the AWBC board—will make the appointments at arms length from the board or the minister.
I note that the committee must report to the minister and their report must be tabled in parliament. That too does not guarantee appointments on merit. It just means we get told of the decision, not that a fully transparent and accountable appointments on merit process took place. During the inquiry by the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee into the operation of the wine industry, which reported in October 2005, it became apparent that there is a great divide between the interests of winemakers and those of grape growers. Section 13 of the act specifically states that a person nominated for the board must have knowledge of or experience in winemaking, grape growing, marketing finance et cetera; however, it does not specify that there must be representatives from each of those areas. Therefore, you may have a board that does not have a representative from grape growers on it. I am sure that is not what is intended, but I do not see any safeguards to stop the board from being stacked with boffins or persons from a particular sector rather than those with practical experience.
For over a decade I and the Democrats have noted many times in this chamber that appointment on merit was extensively investigated by the Nolan committee, appointed by the United Kingdom parliament, which in 1995 set out the following principles to guide and inform the making of such appointments: a minister should not be involved in an appointment where he or she has a financial or personal interest; ministers must act within the law, including the safeguards against discrimination on grounds of gender or race; all public appointments should be governed by the overriding principle of appointment on merit; except in limited circumstances, political affiliation should not be a criterion for appointment; selection on merit should take account of the need to appoint boards that include a balance of skills and backgrounds; the basis on which members are appointed and how they are expected to fulfil their roles should be explicit; and the range of skills and backgrounds that are sought should be clearly specified.
The United Kingdom government fully accepted the committee’s recommendations at the time and have maintained those principles on appointments. The Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments in the United Kingdom was created subsequent to the Nolan report, with a similar level of independence from the government to that of the Auditor-General, to provide an effective avenue of external scrutiny. The Democrats have used the Nolan committee’s recommendations in our persistent and long-term campaign for appointment-on-merit amendments in various items of legislation, because those Nolan recommendations are tried and tested. I would remind the chamber that we have moved those amendments more than 30 times, and more than 30 times the coalition government have rejected them because they prefer patronage to appointments on merit in many cases—not in all cases, I might add.
While I have the opportunity I want to cover a second matter concerning the wine industry. Whenever I speak to bills that deal with the Australian wine industry, I am reminded of my work on the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee and the work of other senators on that committee and the report into the operation of the wine-making industry, which reported in October 2005. In that report, the committee referred to the discussion of unconscionable conduct in the Senate Economics References Committee’s 2004 report The effectiveness of the Trade Practices Act 1974 in protecting small business. That report considered the evils of ‘unilateral variation’ clauses—contract conditions which allow one of the parties to vary the contract without further negotiation or without the other party’s agreement. During the Senate Economics References Committee’s inquiry, the ACCC itself voiced concern that unilateral clauses could be unreasonably exploited by the stronger party, and it was the recommendation of the ACCC, followed by the Senate economics committee in its March 2004 report, that unilateral variation clauses should be added to the list of matters which a court may have regard to in deciding whether conduct is unconscionable. I refer to the Trade Practices Act 1974, sections 51AC(3) and 51AC(4).

In the government’s response to the Senate economics committee it agreed to the need for the amendment. In the 2005 report into the operation of the wine-making industry, the rural and regional committee reiterated the sentiment of the Senate economics committee in recommendation 2. It stated:

The committee recommends that the Government should give priority to amending the Trade Practices Act 1974 to add ‘unilateral variation’ clauses in contracts to the list of matters which a court may have regard to in deciding whether conduct is unconscionable.
After the rural and regional committee’s report into the wine industry, I was heartened by the government’s response which stated:
The Government notes the Senate Economics References Committee, in its report on the effectiveness of the Trade Practices Act 1974 in protecting small business, recommended that section 51AC of the Trade Practices Act 1974 be amended to provide that unilateral variation clauses should be added to the list of matters which a court may have regard to in deciding whether conduct is unconscionable. The Government has accepted the Senate Economic References Committee’s recommendation in full and is progressing legislation for its implementation.
As Australians say, ‘Yeah, right!’ I am willing to work through things with the government to bring about good and effective outcomes for the Australian people, but I have to say I am losing all hope of the government ever amending section 51AC of the Trade Practices Act. I could understand it if it were adamantly opposed to the amendment, but the government has said it is willing to do it and it is progressing legislation. Years ago it said that.
This is a government that, in a ridiculous farce, can recall the entire parliament to change ‘a’ to ‘the’ in one piece of legislation, but when it comes to the Trade Practices Act and small business it moves with the speed of treacle. The government has said since 2005 that it would do something about section 51AC of the Trade Practices Act. It is now 2007. So even though the government accepts the recommendation made by two committees, and the amendment has the support of the ACCC, the progress is abysmally slow. You have to ask yourself why. I ask you that, Minister: why? Whatever the reason, it stinks.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2007-06-14,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

I rise today to speak on the Health Insurance Amendment (Inappropriate and Prohibited Practices and Other Measures) Bill 2007.
This Bill proposes to amend the Health Insurance Act 1973 to replace existing prohibitions on the payment of medical benefits for pathology and diagnostic imaging services.
The new provisions are aimed at:
firstly, prohibiting certain practices in relation to the rendering of pathology and diagnostic imaging services, including prohibiting inducements and other relationships between requesters and providers of pathology services/diagnostic imaging services;
secondly, preventing payments for pathology and diagnostic imaging services that do not benefit patients;
and thirdly, encouraging fair competition between pathology and diagnostic imaging providers on the basis of quality of services provided, and cost to patients.
These new provisions represent a response to persistent long-term claims that a minority of providers, particularly within the pathology industry, were providing payments or other inducements to practitioners so that practitioners would refer patients to them. For example, pathology companies (and third parties acting for them) have allegedly been offering inflated rents, gifts, lump sum payments and staff to general practices to encourage referrals. There have also been some reports of doctors actively soliciting inducements, gifts and benefits.
While current sections 129AA (Bribery) and 129AAA (Prohibited practices in relation to the rendering of pathology services) of the Health Insurance Act contain a range of provisions addressing bribery, inducements, over-servicing and prohibited practices relating to the provision of pathology services, ongoing reports from within the pathology industry allege that these provisions are being circumvented by operators who are contravening the known intent of the legislation. The provisions have been ineffective in their deterrent and enforcement aspects, with the relevant agencies – Medicare Australia and the Director of Public Prosecutions – unable to successfully prosecute any alleged offenders.
Among the difficulties identified with the current provisions relating to pathology are that they are expressed very broadly; their scope is unclear; it is difficult to discharge the burden of proof; it is difficult to determine the preconditions for application of the relevant sanctions; and it is difficult to establish the facts necessary to apply the relevant sanctions. The sections also apply differentially to the requesters and providers of these services.
Notably, the current prohibitions relating to diagnostic imaging services contained in Division 3 of Part IIB do not carry any criminal or civil penalty sanctions.
This Bill repeals these sections and replaces them with a new Part MBA, which sets out new prohibitions relating to both pathology and diagnostic imaging services.
These changes arise from several thorough reviews of the operation of Commonwealth legislation for pathology arrangements under Medicare.
The Department of Health and Ageing in 2002 undertook a review of Commonwealth legislation for pathology arrangements under Medicare, including the HIA. The final report was released in December 2002 and noted that the legislative arrangements for regulating pathology services needed updating and streamlining, particularly highlighting the area of offences and enforcement provisions.
In 2005, DoHA commissioned a further review, undertaken by Phillips Fox Lawyers, to specifically examine the pathology enforcement and offence provisions of the HIA. The review included extensive consultation with pathology providers, professional and peak industry groups, State and Federal Government agencies, consumer groups.
The Phillips Fox Review did not attempt to substantiate any of the allegations concerning inducements from service providers or claims that some medical practitioners were demanding payments from pathology providers; rather the authors accepted that ‘the frequency and consistency of claims made across the sector generates a high level of confidence that such conduct is, in fact, occurring’.
The Phillips Fox Review made 52 recommendations including the need for enforcement and offence provisions be redrafted to express more clearly the Government’s intent to prevent benefits and bribes between pathology providers and requesters of services, and to extend the application of provisions to create an enforcement framework that can be more effectively applied.
Minister Abbott accepted the bulk of the Phillips Fox report’s recommendations when he released the Government’s response to the Phillips Fox report on 2 June 2006.
It is clear from this background that the current legislation has proven ineffective in tackling persistent claims of over servicing and prohibited practices within the pathology sector particularly.
This is at great cost to Medicare and the health system more generally.
To put this into perspective – in 2005-06, 83 million Medicare funded pathology services were performed, with approximately 10 million Australians accessing these services. During the same period, approximately 15 million Medicare funded diagnostic imaging services such as X-rays, ultrasound, CT and MRI were performed, benefiting more than 6½ million Australians. This equates to expenditure in excess of $3.2 billion, representing approximately 30 per cent of total Medicare outlays in 2005-06.
While noting that it was impossible to quantify the level of inappropriate servicing in these sectors, the Explanatory Memorandum noted that a 0.5% reduction in Medicare funded pathology and diagnostic imaging services would result in a saving of approximately $16 million a year in inappropriate use of Medicare funding.
As my colleague the Shadow Minister for Health Nicola Roxon emphasised in the House, Labor knows how important it is to get the most out of the health dollar and will always support measures which will result in savings to Medicare and the health system more broadly. If this new regime manages to tackle even a fraction of inappropriate servicing by pathologists or diagnostic imaging services – then that will free up much-needed resources for other areas of the health system.
Detailed consideration
Turning now to the provisions of this Bill.
Schedule 1 amends the Health Insurance Act 1973, the Medicare Australia Act 1973 and the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986. Schedule 2 makes some minor procedural amendments to the Health Insurance Act and the Health Insurance (Pathology Services) Regulations 1989.
The major amendments are to the Health Insurance Act and involve the repeal of the current prohibited practices provisions for diagnostic imaging and pathology services and the insertion of a new Part IIBA, which contains the new civil penalty provisions and offences relating to requests for both pathology and diagnostic imaging services.
New Part IIBA contains three Divisions:
Division 1 —Preliminary, which outlines procedural and definitional aspects related to the new Part, including the meaning of “requester” and “provider” for the purposes of Part IIBA.
For pathology services, a “requester” means: a practitioner (as defined in s 3(1) as a medical practitioner or dental practitioner; a person who employs, or engages under a contract for services, a practitioner; or a person who exercises control or direction over a practitioner (in his or her capacity as a practitioner).
For diagnostic imaging services, a “requester” means: a medical practitioner; if the service is of a kind specified in regulations made under section 16B —a dental practitioner, a chiropractor, a hysiotherapist, a podiatrist or an osteopath; or a person who employs, or engages under a contract for services, one of the people specified above.
A “provider” of a pathology service or diagnostic imaging service means a person who renders that kind of service; or a person who carries on a business of rendering that kind of service.
New section 23DZZIF describes what is, and is not, a permitted benefit. The new provisions are aimed at preventing the payment of inappropriate and unethical benefits in any form – including money, property or services – from a provider to a requester, either directly or indirectly, but are not intended to capture or prohibit legitimate commercial transactions. Amongst other matters, this section deals with what is permitted in cases where a service requester (such as a General Practitioner) owns, or part owns, a pathology or diagnostic imaging service provider, or where a requester and a provider share premises.
New Division 2 of Part llBA contains civil penalty provisions that are entirely new provisions for the HIA and are imposed where a court is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the relevant person, a requester or provider, has contravened the relevant provisions. The maximum penalty under the civil penalty provisions are 600 penalty units ($66,000) for an individual (including executive officers of corporations) and 6,000 penalty units ($660,000) for a corporation.
Under Division 2:
A service requester must not ask for or accept a pathology or diagnostic imaging service-related benefit (other than a permitted benefit) from a provider or a person connected to a provider.
A service provider must not offer or provide such a benefit to a requester or a person connected to a requester.
A service provider must not make a pathology or diagnostic imaging service-related threat to a requester or a person connected to a requester.
The provisions may also be contravened by a requester or provider if they know that a person connected to him or her has asked for, accepted, offered or provided such a benefit or made such a threat and they fail to report the person within 30 days to the Medicare Australia CEO.
New Division 3 of Part IIBA contains the criminal offences. Many of the elements of the offences are similar to the civil penalty provisions, but it is necessary to prove beyond reasonable doubt certain levels of intention and/or knowledge on the part of the persons involved in the making or receiving of requests or benefits or the making of threats. The maximum penalty for a Division 3 offence is 5 years imprisonment (or 300 penalty units by virtue of subsection 4B(2) of the Crimes Act 1914).
Under new section 23DZZIQ, there are two sets of offences: firstly, where a requester asks for or accepts a prohibited benefit and secondly, where a requester knows that another person has asked for or accepted a prohibited benefit and has not reported this to the Medicare Australia CEO.
These offences are mirrored in new section 23DZZIR which deal with people who offer or provide prohibited benefits. New section 23DZZIS provides that a person also commits an offence if the person threatens a second person, intending that the threat will induce a requester of pathology or diagnostic imaging services to request services from a particular provider.
Notably, this Bill makes explicit reference to Executive Officer liability in a number of the new provisions. The elements required for executive officer liability mirror those in other Commonwealth legislation such as section 54B of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989.
Items 39 to 84 of the Bill amend various elements of Part VB of the Health Insurance Act, which deals with the Medicare Participation Review Committee (MPRC). Currently, in cases where persons have been convicted of HIA pathology-related offences or are considered to have contravened the prohibitions relating to diagnostic imaging services, the MPRC may take a range of actions, including making services provided by that person ineligible for Medicare payments. The Bill amends Part VB so that the jurisdiction of the MPRC applies on conviction of a Part IIBA offences or a court giving an order for a civil penalty.
Item 85 inserts a new Part VIA – Civil Penalties (new sections 125A-125H) which outlines some of the details about civil penalties, including Federal Court powers and clarifying the relationship between civil penalties proceedings and criminal proceedings under the HIA.
The Bill makes a large number of consequential and other amendments to the Health Insurance Act, arising from the introduction of this new regime. I do not propose to go through these in detail today.
Schedule 1 also amends the Medicare Australia Act 1973 and the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986.
The Medicare Australia Act contains certain powers that allows ‘authorised officers’ to require the production of information or conduct searches where there are reasonable grounds for believing Medicare-related offences have been committed. Items 98-109 of Schedule 1 amend the Act for these powers to apply to situations were it is suspected that a civil penalty provision under the HIA has been contravened.
Schedule 1 substitutes a new definition of approved pathology practitioner in subsection 93E(9) of the Veterans’ Entitlements Act, to reflect amendments to the Health Insurance Act.
Schedule 2 makes some minor procedural amendments to the Health Insurance Act and the Health Insurance (Pathology Services) Regulations 1989.
According to the Government, these changes have been the subject of extensive consultation with pathology providers, professional and peak industry groups, State and Federal Government agencies and consumer groups.
Media reports suggest that the Australian Medical Association (AMA) believes that there are already sufficient regulatory mechanisms in place to address inappropriate interactions between requesters and providers of pathology services. However, representatives of the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia and the Australian Association of Pathology Practices (AAPP) have expressed support for the measures contained in this Bill.
In line with stakeholder support, Labor supports this legislation because we are confident that the new provisions will prove more effective than the current enforcement and offence provisions of the HIA in tackling prohibited inducements and other relationships between requesters and providers of pathology services and diagnostic imaging services.
Labor understands that over-servicing and prohibited practices in the pathology and diagnostic imaging sectors – or indeed in any sector – serves to undermine the whole system, and casts a shadow over the good work done by the vast majority of providers who are doing the right thing. It is not fair that the majority of providers who are doing the right thing should face commercial losses simply because they comply with the spirit of the legislation while their competitors do not.
Labor supports legislative frameworks that encourage fair competition between providers of pathology and diagnostic imaging services on the basis of quality of service provided, and cost to patients, rather than inducements and other relationships.
Performing unnecessary procedures is not just deceitful, it is wasteful and costly. Costly to Medicare and costly to the broader health system.
Labor is committed to the universal provision of quality health care for all Australians. Just as past Labor governments built Medicare, Labor believes that Medicare should be retained, defended and strengthened. Labor knows that Medicare is the cornerstone of our health system, and obviously does not support the abuse of Medicare. Labor supports this legislation because we believe that Medicare must be protected from inappropriate use by deceitful service providers.
In conclusion, as I said at the outset, Labor will be supporting the bill.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2007-06-14,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

It’s a disgrace that the precious time of the Parliament should be wasted on legislation such as this.
In fact, I have to ask why such provisions in Acts are such that they require such amendment in the first place.
I would’ve thought that in this day and age, once a scheme had been legislated, sunset clauses on such routine matters would have been done away with long ago.
There are simply better ways of doing things.
This bill extends—yet again—the provisions of the Act for the operation of the Defence Home Owner Scheme.
What’s more, this is the second such extension.
And again we have the same reason.
The government is constipated and can’t get its act together.
Mr Acting Deputy President, this is not rocket science.
It’s a simple program for ADF personnel.
It’s been in operation for 16 years.
But as we noted at the last time this matter was debated, it’s now quite inadequate.
It’s also very unfair.
The review has also been years in gestation.
That’s now apparently finished ... yet it seems to be shrouded in secrecy, like everything else.
The Minister, though, has indicated in the recent budget that a new scheme Is coming.
If the indications are right, it looks promising.
The proposed increase in subsidy benefit levels is overdue, but will be welcome.
The ability to shop around between lenders is also a promising change.
Whether this removes the anomaly in benefits between those who purchase their own house and those who rent, is an equation we’ve not seen.
I will curtail my remarks in the interests of time, but let me make two points.
First, the delay in getting this new scheme drawn-up and legislated is unforgivable.
It seems to be like everything else ... way over time.
When materiel is the issue, it affects capability.
But here it affects people.
Our sense is that the concern for people-values in Defence and the ADF is improving. Slowly.
That’s good.
But wouldn’t it have been nice to have seen some swifter action here?
Second, we know that the biggest bugbear for ADF families is the constant postings across Australia.
So I wonder at schemes such as this and how they can be tailored to match that phenomenon.
If we’d had access to the review we might have been enlightened a little.
But the attitude seems to be that we in parliament get what we are given.
No room for discussion or consideration.
I just hope that ADF people were considered a little bit more than we have been.
We support the Bill.

"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2007-06-14,"—I would like to add to answers I gave to Senator Wong and Senator Evans in relation to the issue of a Liberal Party function at Kirribilli House. I refer to the Australian Electoral Commission’s media statement of today in which the AEC says that it is examining if any potential disclosure obligation exists under the Commonwealth Electoral Act in relation to a function hosted by the Prime Minister at Kirribilli House. The AEC has noted suggestions that the government may have attempted to silence or constrain the AEC responses to the media on this issue. The Electoral Commissioner, Mr Ian Campbell, said today, and I quote:
The AEC takes its integrity and independence very seriously and I want to make it quite clear that no attempt was made by the government or anybody else to influence the AEC in its response to this issue. Contrary to some media reports, the AEC Director of Funding and Disclosure, Mr Kevin Bodel, was not asked by the AEC or the government to shut up regarding these matters.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Liberal Party</title>,Questions Without Notice: Additional Answers,32,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2007-06-14,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance and Administration (Senator Minchin) to questions without notice asked by Senators Evans and Wong today relating to a function for the Liberal Party held at Kirribilli House and political donations.
In doing so I thank the minister for that supplementary answer, which confirms that the Prime Minister is under investigation by the AEC for what Senator Minchin himself describes as a Liberal Party function. He is exactly right. It was a Liberal Party function which business observers paid $8,000 to attend along with two other functions. A Liberal Party fundraiser was conducted at Kirribilli House, organised by the Prime Minister and largely supported by taxpayers. Taxpayers, who are paying the wages of the staff and the upkeep of Kirribilli House, have directly contributed to the cost of the Liberal Party organising fundraisers at official residences. I thought this was extraordinary and a terrible development in Australian politics.
I understand from the Prime Minister’s press conference that he has done this before. I understand he has got form on this. He thinks that he has done it once or twice—no doubt all that will come out. But the clear offence that has occurred here is that the Liberal Party have charged people for access to government and taxpayer funded facilities. They have sought to abuse their trust and they have abused their role as the government of this country in order to further their narrow political interests. This is partisan behaviour on behalf of the Prime Minister. It is not behaviour that the old John Howard would have conducted. This shows the deterioration in the standards of the government. This shows the commitment now of the government to do whatever it takes and to use whatever taxpayer funded resources are available to achieve their political ends. People understand; they are very cynical about the Howard government’s use of taxpayer funded advertising and they know taxpayers’ funds are being used to promote the government. We have seen the worst abuse of this in recent months and we will see more in the lead-up to the election. People have in some ways come to accept it because they have seen it all before; they know that in an election year taxpayers’ funds will be used by the Prime Minister to support his re-election. But what is becoming increasingly apparent is a pattern of behaviour that sees the Prime Minister abusing his office in a much more personal way. We remember of course the alterations to the dining room in Parliament House that were proposed—the third dining room alteration under the Howards. They did the Lodge, they did Kirribilli and then they were going to do Parliament House.
We have seen the $243,000 for alcohol at the official residences, the Prime Minister inviting his mates around for a booze-up and putting the cost on the taxpayers. We have seen the Broome holiday. The Prime Minister went to Broome on holiday at taxpayers’ expense. He flew in on the VIP jet and he flew out on the VIP jet. When concern was raised, when the light was shone on this issue, the Prime Minister again sought to make a reimbursement. He fronted up $1,200 each for him and Mrs Howard to meet the costs of the VIP flight in and out of Broome, which on return took them to Brisbane. Economy rates for Broome to Brisbane are $1,200. It cost taxpayers about $54,000, but we got 2½ grand back from John Howard for the cost of his holiday in Broome. So what you are seeing is a pattern of personal behaviour that the Prime Minister did not indulge in in his early days in office, but his standards have dropped as the standards of this government have fallen dramatically.
We have this latest incident where the government seeks to abuse its position, abuse taxpayers’ funds and run fundraisers for the Liberal Party, where donors to the Liberal Party—people who donate $8,000—are invited to official government residences and entertained as part of their donation. This behaviour is extraordinary. It is wrong, the Prime Minister knows it is wrong, and every Australian will know it is wrong when they see the telecast of his press conference. I have never seen him look so bad. I have never seen such an appalling performance by the Prime Minister, because he could not explain his behaviour. His behaviour was totally inappropriate. He could provide no rational answer. He even admitted that it was part of the fundraising effort on behalf of the Liberal Party. The Prime Minister ought to stand condemned for his behaviour. This is a new low in the standards of this government. I am not sure how low you can go, but increasingly the standards are falling. (Time expired)

"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2007-06-14,"—What a ramble, Senator Evans. Perhaps it would not hurt if you looked a little bit into your own history—into the history of your Labor Party and the activities of your prime ministers when they were in office. Then you might find that your wild accusations are way off the mark. If you want to talk about fundraisers and Kirribilli House, how about referring to the fundraiser that Prime Minister Hawke had in 1987 in Kirribilli House? He had a fundraiser there for millionaires and multimillionaires, who were secretly invited so that nobody would know who was on the list. Then, when they got there, who was walking around amongst the millionaires and multimillionaires but the well-known ‘fixer’ Graham Richardson, touching every one of them for somewhere between $30,000 and $100,000, to be paid after the election so that it could be hidden in the administrative costs of the Labor Party. Why don’t you read your own history and look at the use of Kirribilli House—$30,000 to $100,000 from those touched by Graham Richardson—for what was unarguably a fundraiser?
—Have a crack at Kirribilli.
—In the case of Kirribilli House, where we had a function on the occasion of the federal council, those people who were business observers certainly never paid $30,000 or $100,000. They paid to be business observers and they went to a function—
—They didn’t invite senators because they had not paid eight grand.
—that was hosted by the Prime Minister in Kirribilli House. If Senator Evans wants to look into the history of the Labor Party and see what previous prime ministers have used Kirribilli House for, he ought to take a close look at Prime Minister Hawke. It was probably when Senator Faulkner was deputy secretary of the Labor Party in New South Wales; that seems to be about the right time.
—Have a crack at defending the function.
—If you are going to let him keep yelling out like that, Mr Deputy President—
—Senator Ferguson, address your comments through the chair. Senator Evans, cease interjecting.
—When you have a function hosted by a Labor Prime Minister where the multimillionaires are touched for $30,000 to $100,000, that is all okay! ‘What about Kirribilli House?’ says Senator Evans. Kirribilli House was used for a function as part of the program that was put in place for the Liberal Party’s annual federal council and the people that went there—

Senator Chris Evans interjecting—

—apart from delegates, who paid their way to go to the federal Liberal council—were people who were business observers. You do not like it when it hurts, Senator Evans, because your arguments are blown out of the water. In the other place today we heard the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Rudd, ask the Prime Minister some seven questions. When the Prime Minister replied, talking about the fundraiser that was put on by Prime Minister Hawke in order to gain contributions from the millionaires and multimillionaires that attended, Mr Rudd immediately moved a censure motion. He was not going to ask any more questions once the facts came out, once the truth came out.
We have this ridiculous situation where the Labor Party has come into this place harping on about a function at Kirribilli House—where delegates went for a couple of hours, where business observers had paid to attend the federal council where all of the business took place, where they were spoken to and where they had the opportunity to talk to all of the delegates—and they say that this was a Liberal Party fundraiser. I have never heard such rubbish in my life. If you want to talk about a fundraiser, talk about Richo moving amongst people, asking for contributions of $30,000 to $100,000. That is the real thing, isn’t it, Senator Faulkner? Senator Faulkner, who would probably have been well aware of what was going on at the time, knew that this was the way you raised funds. You have a secret dinner at Kirribilli House where you do not know who is going to the function, and when you get there you have Richo moving amongst them, touching them all for between $30,000 and 100 grand, all to be paid after the election. It was a pretty smart move, Senator Faulkner, but do not come in here painting yourselves as lilywhite and try to describe a function held at Kirribilli House for delegates to a council meeting and for business observers as a fundraiser. That is about the most ridiculous description I have ever heard, Senator Evans. You want to go back and check the history. Just check the history. (Time expired)

—I do not need your interjection, Senator Ian Macdonald. Senator Wong, you should address your comments through the chair and others should not interject during your speech. Someone else asked me to invoke that ruling, but the very person who asked me to invoke that is now interjecting as much as the other person who was interjecting upon them. I think a little bit of respect for the chair and the chamber is important.
—Through you, Mr Deputy President: what do we know about this event? First, the Prime Minister holds a function to which only Liberal Party federal council delegates and donors to the Liberal Party are invited. Second, the Liberal Party of Australia pay back just over $5,000—a fraction of the real cost. Where else in Australia can 220 people have canapes, shots of posh soup, oysters, prawns and two hours worth of wine for $5,000?  I want to know where you can get that. You would struggle to pay less at your local pub for a fisherman’s basket and a pint of beer.
—A VB and a party pie!
—Yes. Another thing we know about this matter is that not one cent was paid by the Liberal Party of Australia to the Australian taxpayer or to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet for the use of the venue. Not one red cent was paid for the use of the venue. So you cannot get away with arguing this was full cost recovery, because the Australian taxpayer has, effectively, through their funding of Kirribilli House, subsidised your fundraiser and your venue. Kirribilli House is not a Liberal Party function centre, but that is how this Prime Minister is treating it.
What else do we know? We know that the Commonwealth Electoral Act requires in-kind donations to be disclosed. We know that that is a provision of the Electoral Act. What was this? This certainly was a free venue—I note Senator Minchin in question time today said he may come back to us on this—although, arguably, there may have been some other in-kind donation associated with the cost, because no-one in Australia can believe that you only pay $9.46 for this kind of food and only $6.50 for this kind of wine over two hours. We know that the Electoral Act requires disclosure of in-kind donations and we also know that the Australian Electoral Commission is investigating whether or not there is something here that needs to be disclosed.
—There’s something fishy here!
—Yes, there’s definitely something fishy here. What have we seen over the last few days? We have seen this Prime Minister trying to worm his way out of this. He is in a difficult situation and he is trying to worm his way out of it. We have seen a range of defences put by the Prime Minister. First, he says, ‘I was acting in accordance with the advice of my department’—this mysterious advice that Senator Minchin says he would not mislead us about, but he refuses to table it, refuses to tell us who sought it, refuses to tell us what it says and refuses to tell us when it was provided. So we have no idea whether this is some old advice or some recent advice, but the government will hide behind it anyway. Second, I think Senator Minchin told us, I think, the day before yesterday in question time that this AEC disclosure issue was a bit silly. Well, the AEC is now investigating. And the third thing we have been told is that it is not a fundraiser. What did the Prime Minister say in the press conference? He was asked:
The nub of this is it is fundraising, isn’t it?
You will have to excuse the grammar, Mr Deputy President. The Prime Minister said:
Yes, but, well, it is that and, well, sometimes a gathering of the type that I have alluded to, you know, might in a remote way be associated with fundraising.
So every defence you put up is just drifting away. You say in here it is not a fundraiser. Even the Prime Minister on the public record in his press conference admits that it is a fundraiser. You have no excuse. (Time expired)

"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2007-06-14,"—On Monday I commended Senator Faulkner on the quality and consistency of his confected outrage, but I think Senator Wong has now just eclipsed Senator Faulkner. In the absence of confected outrage, what are the facts here? The facts are, yes, there was a function held on 1 June 2007 at Kirribilli House. The function was for invited guests of the Prime Minister. The guests were, indeed, delegates and business observers of the federal council of the Liberal Party. The costs of the function were fully reimbursed by the Liberal Party. The costs were, on a per head basis, comparable with other functions held at Kirribilli House and the Lodge. The function was held following the decision, which took into account previous advice from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, that it was appropriate to hold functions on a full cost recovery basis. The function was appropriate and the function was at no cost to the taxpayer. End of issue! The Prime Minister of Australia, by virtue of his office, is entitled to temporarily occupy Kirribilli House. Kirribilli House is temporarily his residence and, given the fact that that is temporarily his residence, he is entitled to exercise his discretion and invite whomever he wants to his residence.
Prime Minister Hawke exercised that discretion when he invited then Treasurer Keating, the then Secretary of the ACTU and a prominent business figure to his house to discuss a certain pact. Prime Minister Hawke exercised his discretion there. The opposition are asserting a breach of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. The opposition are asserting a gift in kind and a failure to disclose. The ALP are alleging conspiracy and cover-up. All of these claims are absolutely baseless. The Prime Minister has made it clear that he has received preliminary legal advice from Mr Burmester that there is no issue. The Prime Minister has indicated that he is very relaxed with the AEC conducting inquiries. Despite Labor accusations, the government has not sought—and never would seek—to interfere in an AEC investigation. We have the AEC’s own press release today to prove that. We all know what the ALP focus on Kirribilli House is about: it is a distraction from the ACTU’s megacampaign—a distraction from the Big Brother attempt to manipulate and intimidate unionists to vote Labor. Why wouldn’t regular, decent Australians who happen to be unionists be intimidated? They know that elements of the union movement are into payback. They know, and we know, that the ACTU are keeping a database on the responses—
Honourable senators interjecting—
—It is disorderly to shout across the chamber from both sides. I am trying to listen to Senator Fifield’s contribution to this debate.
—We know, and those union members know, that the ACTU are keeping a database of their responses. This is Orwellian stuff. Imagine that you are at home one night and the union calls. Imagine that a few nights later the union calls again. Imagine a week later that the union calls for a third time. Then a week after that the union knocks on your front door—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order!
—The ACTU today were very quick to roll out for the papers a picture of a nice young 24-year-old ACTU worker. The message was, ‘How could she possibly intimidate anyone?’ No matter who the ACTU send out as their shock troops, we know that they are just a front for the Kevin Reynolds and the Dean Mighells. We know what these people really think of these regular decent union members—these ordinary members of the trade union movement. We know this from the ACTU campaign manual. It says, ‘It may be despicable to you that the member may agree with some of the federal government’s policies, but avoid getting into heated arguments. Such debates are likely to make the member dig their heels in.’ The ACTU holds the views of their own union members in absolute contempt. We know what the ACTU really think of the right of individuals to express their free will. We know what an ALP victory will mean: it will mean a Kevin Rudd ACTU puppet government. That is what awaits Australians if the ALP is elected to office. The ACTU have questions to answer to the AEC about their own database. (Time expired)

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2007-06-14,"—The Prime Minister has turned Kirribilli House into a fundraising venue for the Liberal Party. He has crossed the line in Australian politics in doing so. We in the Labor Party have always said that the Prime Minister’s expenditure at Kirribilli House is scandalous. Just one example is the excessive grog bill since Mr Howard became Prime Minister. Some $243,244 and counting has been spent at the Lodge and Kirribilli House. It has all been guzzled by Mr Howard and his cronies and all paid for by taxpayers. Kirribilli House, as we know, has become the venue for Christmas parties, for New Year’s Eve parties, for all these other knees-ups—for any excuse at all for a knees-up for Mr Howard. A number of years ago I dubbed Kirribilli House as party central. Now, of course, Kirribilli House is no longer party central: it is Liberal Party central. It has become an absolute example of the misuse and abuse of taxpayers money that we see from this government. We ask for answers in relation to the misuse of Kirribilli House by Mr Howard. We ask for some transparency. We ask for some accountability. We ask for the truth. And, of course, just for a change, what do we get? Just the same old response: none at all.
Today in question time we asked: what was the total food and drink bill for the Liberal Party function—not just the cost paid for by the Liberals? There was no answer. We asked what advice was provided by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet about costs that should be paid for by the Liberal Party. There was no answer. We want to know when the advice was sought. We want to know when it was provided. We want to know who sought that advice. We want to know why the government will not table that advice if they have got nothing to hide. Why the cover-up? Instead of the truth, what have we got? Ducking and weaving—a cover-up. The issue now is the definition of a ‘fundraiser’. We saw Mr Howard, before question time, in panic mode. Out he went to a press conference in the Prime Minister’s courtyard, red-faced—
—And this was at 1.30 pm.
—This was at 1.30 pm. He was red-faced, twitching and had that horrible, hollowed out Halloween-pumpkin-like smile he gets on his face when he is under pressure. He almost uttered the whole sentence: ‘I will decide who will come to Kirribilli House and the circumstances in which they come.’ He nearly got the whole sentence out until he realised, ‘Uh-oh, we have a problem.’ He did not quite say it, but he meant it. He will decide who comes, but, I tell you what, he will not pay for it—the taxpayers will be stuck for the bill every single time. And he will not say who goes to these functions; he will not give you a list of attendees. He will not give the cost to the taxpayers. There is no accountability, no transparency, no honesty and no decency in process in relation to this.
Mr Howard in question time solved at least one thing: we know it is a fundraiser. In question time on Tuesday, Mr Howard said, ‘It was not a fundraiser, and you know that.’ Today, Mr Howard was asked:
The nub of this is it is fundraising, isn’t it?’
Let me quote Mr Howard’s answer—I do not often do it, but I am going to enjoy it now. Mr Howard said:
Yes, but, well, it is that and, well, sometimes a gathering of the type that I have alluded to, you know, might in a remote way be associated with fundraising.
Thank you, Mr Howard, for that clear explanation—that clear admission that you are sticking the taxpayers for the bill for these functions at Kirribilli House. The Liberal Party is not paying; Mr Howard is not paying; the taxpayers are paying. (Time expired)

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-06-14,"—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the government response to the report of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee on Mr Chen Yonglin’s request for political asylum.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I do not want to take up too much of general business time, but the simple fact is that these responses have been a long time coming. We need to specifically take note of that fact and examine them—at least those that I have had some experience with. This particular report of the foreign affairs committee was an interim report into Mr Chen Yonglin’s request for political asylum. People, I imagine, would recall that incident in relation to a senior Chinese diplomat from the Chinese consulate in Sydney. This report was tabled on 12 September 2005. The government response has come 20 months later—and the response is one page. It took 20 months to produce one page responding to two recommendations—and they were not exactly complex recommendations.
I suppose I should be thankful that the government has agreed to both of those recommendations. The recommendations were basically that the department of immigration formulate a protocol regarding circumstances where people claiming to be diplomats or consular officials seek asylum and also to remind all officials of their confidentiality obligations, because that was an issue that arose during the course of the inquiry. Thankfully, the department agreed with those. Indeed, they say they issued some guidance about obligations on confidentiality in October 2005. So why it has taken them 19 more months to get around reporting this fact by way of responding to the committee is beyond me.
Perhaps what is worse is that beneath that they say that they are also preparing a more detailed instruction for all the department of immigration staff in Australia and overseas relating to handling possible requests for asylum from consular officials. So even though it has taken 20 months to respond to two single recommendations, they still have not actually fulfilled them. How long does it take to prepare a set of instructions with regard to this sort of incident? This is a shoddy approach. It is contempt towards the Senate to take so long to respond to such a simple, straightforward pair of recommendations. But to then still be churning through actually acting upon those for one set of instructions 20 months later is simply not good enough. It is, once again, an indication of a lack of consideration—what I consider is a contempt for the Senate committee process. There is no reason at all why that response could not have been tabled at the end of 2005 or at the latest in early 2006. And certainly there is no reason why the set of instructions could not have been put together for diplomatic staff well before now as well.
I also note, to save time, a separate government response that is amongst these seven tabled by Senator Scullion, that can sit there on the Notice Paper for another day—a response to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration regarding detention centre contracts, which was originally tabled in December 2005. That also contained two recommendations. Again, it has taken 17 months to respond to two recommendations in a unanimous report of the joint migration committee. It is simply not good enough.
These completely inadequate responses, both in terms of time frame and content, need to be continually highlighted. It is one area that I certainly hope the Senate after the election, whoever is in government and whatever the composition of the Senate, puts renewed energy into trying to improve. A lot of expense goes into producing Senate committee reports, particularly those that engage the public. They are there in part to provide recommendations to government and they should be responded to far more promptly. I should remind the Senate that our standing orders have a guideline that the relevant government department or minister respond within three months. I am not sure I can think of the last report that was responded to within three months. I would be lucky to think of more than one that was responded to sooner than six months. But when we are getting to 18 months and beyond for a single page, then it is simply ridiculous. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2007-06-14,"—I begin this debate by thanking the cosponsors of the legislation before us, the Pregnancy Counselling (Truth in Advertising) Bill 2006, Senator Carol Brown, Senator Nettle and Senator Troeth. I also thank a number of other women in this place who have been directly involved in getting the legislation to where it is today: Senators Webber and Moore, Senator Adams and, of course, the late Senator Jeannie Ferris, without whom we would not have got to this stage. There are many other colleagues, men and women, in both chambers of this parliament who have helped us in this debate and with the construction of this legislation, and I thank them too. I believe there is broad-ranging support for legislation of this type and I am glad to have this debate before us.
—It’s not hard to get it here on a Thursday in general business.
—In some ways it is a historic day for the parliament.
—Everyone gets it.
—You never get anything; what are you talking about?
—Order! Senator McGauran, Senator Stott Despoja is entitled to be heard.
—It’s not monumental; it’s just general business.
—Senator McGauran, you have been called to order. Senator Stott Despoja is entitled to be heard in silence.
—He cannot dampen my enthusiasm today, no matter what he tries. It is very rare for private member’s bills to be introduced and debated in a way that they become law or maybe have an influence on law. That is what I hope for with this piece of legislation. I would love it to be voted on at some stage in the near future, but more importantly I would love it if the government took the initiative to introduce legislation to cover up what I perceive is a loophole in current trade practices law on transparency in advertising when it comes to certain not-for-profit groups—in this specific case, pregnancy counselling.
I said that this was a historic day; I actually think it is a ‘herstoric’ day because it continues something that we have seen in this place in recent times which gives me great joy and which I hope will continue long after I leave this place—that is, cross-party female senators working together. That is something we have seen in recent times that has given us much joy but has also worked towards very positive policy contributions.
It has almost been two years since I introduced my original private member’s bill, the Transparent Advertising and Notification of Pregnancy Counselling Services Bill 2005, into the Senate on 23 June 2005 to regulate pregnancy counselling services to prevent misleading and deceptive advertising or notification of pregnancy counselling services. Today, following the introduction of the Pregnancy Counselling (Truth in Advertising) Bill 2006 to the Senate last December, which was cosponsored by Senator Troeth, Senator Nettle and Senator Carol Brown, we have the opportunity to finally lay our cards on the table and debate the simplest issue: requiring pregnancy counselling services to be subject to comparable laws regarding misleading advertising as those organisations that are engaged in trade or commerce. What is so difficult about achieving this? We are not singling out particular organisations, as some people and services may claim. Nor would we dare suggest that or force those organisations to provide referrals for terminations. All this bill does is require all pregnancy counselling services, whether they have a certain philosophy, principle or perspective, or are anti-choice or pro-choice, to be up-front and truthful in their advertising.
I originally raised the issue of transparency in pregnancy counselling services in this chamber back in August 2004 and subsequently wrote to Sensis, the company which publishes and distributes the white pages, urging it to remove Pregnancy Counselling Australia from the emergency and community help pages of the white pages and replace it with a non-directive pregnancy counselling service. Sensis responded, highlighting that, following concerns raised the previous year, 2003, it had, in conjunction with Pregnancy Counselling Australia, already altered two previous listings. ‘Abortion trauma’ and ‘Crisis pregnancy counselling’ were altered to read ‘Pregnancy Counselling Australia (Pregnancy termination alternatives and post-termination counselling)’. This response, along with my increasing awareness of a number of other counselling services which do not mention that they do not provide termination services in their advertising and notification material, encouraged me to investigate and push for greater transparency.
What does this bill do? While I have already outlined broadly what this bill sets out to achieve—and, of course, I did that in a fuller form when my original legislation was introduced and at the beginning of my second reading remarks when the bill was reintroduced—I want to outline the objectives very clearly so that people are under no illusions. Firstly, this legislation prohibits pregnancy counselling services, whether the services provide the information in person or over the telephone, from publishing, distributing, displaying or broadcasting via internet, television, telephone, radio or like service, or by post, any material that is misleading or deceptive as to the nature of the services it provides or any material that is likely to mislead or deceive as to the nature of the services it provides. Secondly, the bill ensures that services must be up-front about whether or not they refer for terminations. Thirdly, it requires services which do not provide referrals for terminations of pregnancy to include in any advertising or notification material a statement such as ‘this service does not provide referrals for terminations of pregnancies’ or like statement. I am not wedded to a particular use of words or terminology; to make it clear is the most important thing. Finally, this legislation requires services which do provide referrals for terminations of pregnancy to include in any advertising or notification material a statement that the service does provide referrals for all pregnancy options. Basically, it does not matter what you do, you have to be up-front about it. You cannot give the impression that you do something that you do not do. You cannot deceive; you must be up-front. What is wrong with that?
Obviously, there are penalties for breaching conditions. The bill also ensures that Commonwealth funded pregnancy counselling services are ineligible to receive a grant for financial assistance unless the Commonwealth discloses whether it is a pregnancy counselling service which does not provide referrals for terminations of pregnancy or a non-directive pregnancy counselling service which provides referrals for all pregnancy options.
Additional reporting requirements contained in the bill include that the minister must report annually on the amount of each payment to the states and the name of each service provider receiving the payment and whether each service provider is a pregnancy counselling service which does not provide referrals for termination of pregnancy or is a non-directive pregnancy counselling service which provides referrals for all pregnancy options. All you need to do is disclose it. It is not about saying that the Commonwealth will only fund certain types of pregnancy counselling organisations, because I know that is a criticism that has been levelled at the bill. It does not say that; you just have to disclose what you do and what you do not do in order to get taxpayer dollars. It could not be simpler.
For the record, there is currently no pro-choice federally funded pregnancy counselling service in operation. That is something that we have heard about before in this place. During estimates I have repeatedly questioned the government about its continuation of funding to the previously anti-choice pregnancy counselling helpline, Pregnancy Help Australia, despite the closure of the counselling operations and the establishment of the government’s new pregnancy counselling hotline to the tune of around $15 million. The previous hotline, Pregnancy Help Australia, has not been providing counselling since late last year, with callers instead receiving a recorded message.
There are a number of reasons why this issue is timely. Anecdotes and information have been brought to our attention, a Senate committee has exposed some of these issues and there are many heartfelt stories that have been recorded. There are organisations, women’s groups, social workers, individuals, fathers of daughters who have been affected, police and other people who have brought to our attention a range of issues that have highlighted the fact that, if women do not have the right information up front, especially when they are in a traumatised or highly emotional state, a state of crisis, if they do not have clear, concise, honest, up-front, unbiased information, things can go wrong. This bill is making sure that the advertising at least is up-front and honest. It would put Australia at the forefront of not just women’s rights but the recognition of human rights, highlighting the commitment to transparency in advertising as well as beginning the debate on the regulation of pregnancy counselling services. Anecdotal evidence that has been presented to us over the years reinforces the urgency of this particular issue and highlights the fact that misleading and deceptive information is being provided to women.
Essentially this bill does hold pregnancy counselling services accountable for the information and the advertising that they provide. It creates a safety mechanism for protecting some of the rights of women and their families and their partners, ensuring that they have access to non-directive counselling on all three options. All three pregnancy options are pretty obvious, but for the record they are: adoption, keeping a baby or having a termination. Women have said that they have felt bullied and pressured into continuing their pregnancies, that they have been offered baby clothes and assistance in that form and through government funding if they continue. Again, there are a range of mechanisms or options people may use to try to talk to someone, assist someone or counsel someone. It is not necessarily my definition of non-directive—obviously women have the right to receive information if they request it in those areas—but what we are more concerned about are some of the anecdotes which suggest not just misleading information but downright harmful information being given to women about what would happen to them if they chose to get a referral for a termination. I am sure my colleagues are happy to put some of those issues on the record.
A 37-year-old mother of two contacted my office after a recent experience with Pregnancy Counselling Australia. She had an unexpected pregnancy and she wanted to be fully informed about all of the options available to her before she made a decision. She said:
I am pro-choice but abortion is something I have always hoped I never would have to contemplate. I rang up Pregnancy Counselling Australia and the local Pregnancy Help line looking for specific information. Now these national counselling services had absolutely no idea about services in the Northern Territory and when it came to RU486 the best that anyone could say was that they didn’t think that it was available. And these services were quick to steer me towards the disadvantages of abortion. I got told that my uterus could get perforated, that I could suffer a haemorrhage or infection, that I could retain products of conception. I could potentially risk infertility and of course there were the psychological aspects of guilt, anxiety and depression. And potentially risk not bonding with any future babies. They did not give me any statistical information at all to give an indication regarding the actual incidence of these occurrences. They did not give comparative statistics comparing the risks of these problems post termination with the incidence of the same problems in pregnancy itself.
It is hard to imagine how anyone with women’s best interests at heart would provide that kind of information without some kind of substantiation. A woman who contacted an emergency number from the front of the white pages in Adelaide also reported:
I have had an abortion before and they told me if I had another one I would never be able to get pregnant again. They said I was a definite high risk to get breast cancer and that there were plenty of couples who would adopt my child if I didn’t want it. I said to her ‘you won’t give me information about abortion will you’ and she told me ‘No I don’t believe in it, no-one here does.’
I put on record I do not have a problem with people having those differing views; you have just got to be up-front. If a woman thinks she is contacting a counselling or other organisation in relation to these issues expecting to get unbiased, up-front advice on the options available to her, of which there are three, she needs to be able to tell from the advertisement that that is the organisation she is contacting, not be misled into thinking that they provide other services or stand for something else. Another woman—

Senator McGauran interjecting—

—Again, another startling contribution by Senator Julian McGauran to this debate. Again, it will not dampen my enthusiasm for the legislation before us. It is incredibly important; it is needed. Another story from my electorate in South Australia illustrates why this is so important. A woman was told she should name her baby. She was also told that her baby did not have a place in heaven, and the young woman was asked if she thought having an abortion was sinful. A woman also told me of the advice she received form Birthline in South Australia. She said:
I rang them to get information about the Morning After Pill, they told me it can make me have an abortion, and that it can cause foetal defects if I was already pregnant.
These examples are a small number of the hundreds that I have seen over the years. I am not the only person in this place, let alone these organisations, who has received comparable stories. It is not about whether you have a particular opinion, Senator McGauran. I am very up-front about mine. What I am saying is: everyone is entitled to their beliefs, but do not mislead, do not deceive. Get the advertising up-front, transparent and honest—just as we would expect of everybody else in society, including businesses that make a profit and organisations that are subject to the Trade Practices Act. I want these organisations to be covered by comparable legislation so that women and others are not misled, particularly in what could be the most vulnerable and emotional state they could be in.
I am proud of the support this bill has received and the genuine commitment it has received from organisations. I acknowledge the work of people involved in organisations like Marie Stopes International, Children by Choice, Reproductive Choice Australia, Australian Reproductive Health Alliance and, of course, GetUp, who are actively involved in asking men and women of Australia what they think of legislation like this and what they think of some of the stories they have heard and collating signatures for an online petition last year. A campaign jointly sponsored by RCA and GetUp resulted in 20,000 signatures supporting legislation of this kind. I obviously also thank my cosponsors again.
It is worth putting on record some other key facts. A recent survey commissioned by Marie Stopes International produced findings highlighting that 81 per cent of women believe that a pregnancy counsellor should refer for all three options. A further 12 per cent of women confirmed that when they had been faced with an unplanned pregnancy, they relied on pregnancy counsellors for support. There are many other results in that survey that are also of interest. I might add that, during estimates a couple of weeks ago, we learnt that each call to the government’s $15 million pregnancy helpline costs around $442. These are taxpayer dollars. I acknowledge those call costs may change as the service becomes well known; women will be more interested in using it or at least more aware of its services.
Seventy-five per cent of women surveyed in this Marie Stopes commissioned survey said they did not want to talk to a counsellor before making a decision about their unplanned pregnancy. So, yes, pregnancy counselling is important—it is a valuable service, from whatever perspective it may come—but it has to be honest, it has to be up-front in its advertising and it has to be transparent. I prefer non-directive counselling—and I have a very strong view as to what constitutes non-directive counselling—but counselling is not necessary, nor should it be compulsory, for women who are in a situation where they are facing an unplanned pregnancy. The majority of women have said they do not necessarily want it. But for those women who do want it, when they go to the yellow pages or the internet or see an advertisement on the back of a bathroom door, it has to say more than, ‘Pregnant? Upset or distressed?’ It has to explain what services it does or does not provide. At least in those circumstances the woman, her partner and her family are aware of who and what they are contacting and what services and/or counselling may result as a consequence of her picking up the phone or walking in the door and meeting with someone and talking about some of those most personal issues.
The results of the Marie Stopes survey further highlight the need for the regulation of pregnancy counselling services to ensure not only that women are fully informed but also that they have services of a high standard. Across the board, regardless of people’s perspective in the Senate inquiry on this particular bill or its predecessor, there was a strong view that we could look at the regulation and quality of counselling. It did not matter which perspective people came from. Maybe the Minister for Health and Ageing, Tony Abbott, should be looking into that to ensure that, regardless of what perspective people come from, there is quality assurance. That is not my particular debate today; mine is much more simple than that. Again, it is a bill about advertising.
This bill is necessary because, although the Trade Practices Act outlaws ‘conduct that is liable to mislead the public as to the nature, the characteristics, the suitability for their purpose or the quantity of any services’, the majority of pregnancy counselling services are, of course, not bound by the Trade Practices Act because they generally do not charge for the information and other services they provide and, therefore, they are not considered to be engaged in commerce or trade.
I want women to feel safe and secure when they are calling or visiting pregnancy counselling services. I do not want people bullied, I do not want people frightened and I do not want people misled or deceived. It is one of the most delicate and, arguably, traumatic times in a woman’s life. Providing false or misleading advertising to women who are confused or unsure about keeping or not having a child is something all pregnancy counselling services should be held accountable for.
Why would anyone question this basic principle in this legislation? If they are proud of their philosophical beliefs, whether they be anti-choice or pro-choice, then what is the problem? Surely, people are still going to receive calls to this service. Regardless of their perspective, people cannot seriously deny that this is long overdue. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>PREGNANCY COUNSELLING (TRUTH IN ADVERTISING) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,37,1
"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2007-06-14,"—The Pregnancy Counselling (Truth in Advertising) Bill 2006 seeks to promote transparency in the advice given by pregnancy counselling services. It seeks to achieve this by prohibiting pregnancy counselling services from producing or providing advertising material or advice that is misleading or deceptive. It is aimed squarely at making it easier for women to obtain truthful and unbiased advice when faced with the often-difficult situation of an unplanned pregnancy.
I am proud to co-sponsor this legislation with Senator Stott Despoja, Senator Judith Troeth and Senator Kerry Nettle. I wish to make it absolutely clear that this is a bill about promoting and ensuring truth in advertising. It is important that it is not misinterpreted as a bill that seeks to promote any one pregnancy option over another. It does not. It is simply aimed at protecting women from receiving advice that may be false, misleading or even deceiving. It is about promoting the fundamental right of Australian women everywhere to be aware of the nature of the pregnancy counselling advice they will receive.
In this sense, the bill is simply about promoting truth and not prescribing one pregnancy option over another. Anyone who thinks otherwise is incorrect. It does not matter what arguments are put forward by those who oppose the bill to try to fudge or muddy the debate. It does not matter that they deliberately declare that the bill is an attempt to do other than what I have just described and that they link it to moral arguments about the rights and wrongs of the choices women make when confronted with an unplanned pregnancy. Those arguments will inevitably be put forward today by those who oppose the bill. I wish to remind them that this bill is simply about ensuring that pregnancy counselling services disclose the truth.
It was correctly observed in the committee hearing that, up until now, in relation to the provision of pregnancy counselling services much of the focus has been on the rights of the service providers. Indeed, what this bill seeks to achieve is to shift that focus back onto the rights of the women accessing these services. This is where the focus should be.
This bill is necessary because services that provide counselling and advice free of charge—such as the majority of pregnancy counselling services in Australia—are exempt from operating within the confines of the Trade Practices Act—specifically, section 52, which dictates that ‘a corporation shall not engage in conduct that is misleading or deceptive, or likely to mislead or deceive’. As a result, pregnancy counselling services that provide advice free of charge are not governed by any legislative restriction that mandates that they not produce or provide advertising material or advice that is likely to be misleading or deceptive. A black hole exists, because currently there is no legislative guarantee that women accessing such services can be sure that the advice they are being given is accurate. Essentially, this bill makes pregnancy counselling services subject to the same laws as organisations which engage in trade or commerce. It basically provides the necessary legislative framework to ensure that advertising material and advice given by pregnancy counselling services cannot be misleading or deceptive.
As senators would be aware, this bill is an amended version of the Transparent Advertising and Notification of Pregnancy Counselling Services Bill 2005, introduced as a private member’s bill by Senator Stott Despoja. Senators will also be aware that Senator Stott Despoja’s private member’s bill was referred to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee for inquiry. The committee reported in August 2006. There was a minority report which received cross-party support. My colleagues Senators Stott Despoja, Moore, Nettle, Webber and Allison and I were the authors of that minority report, and I congratulate my fellow senators on their work for it. I welcome, too, the comments of Senator Judith Adams who, although she was not a signatory to the minority report, nevertheless supported the former bill.
That committee received a range of submissions and evidence, some of which supported the former bill, in its entirety or subject to amendments, and some of which opposed the bill. The committee report examined: the constitutionality of the bill; advertising a pregnancy counselling service; advertising in telephone directories; contentious terminology; whether the former bill was balanced; the options for dealing with an unplanned pregnancy; funding to pregnancy counselling services; qualifications and professional standards of counselling services and issues confronting women in rural, regional and remote communities.
Clearly, I cannot address today all the issues brought before the committee. However, I will address those issues that I believe are of great importance, not just to the committee members but to those who are most affected by the future of this bill—that is, the couples who need to access services and agencies and clinics, at a time in their lives when they are facing an unplanned pregnancy, and vulnerable women undergoing the sort of stress that only a woman who has experienced an unplanned pregnancy can truly appreciate.
The main issue raised before the committee, one that is very familiar to the sponsors of the current bill, is the fact that, under the law as it stands, there is no requirement for those persons who provide pregnancy counselling services to provide, in advance, a full and frank disclosure of any limitation on the nature of the advice or the referrals that they are willing to provide. The effect of this gap is that some women who, in response to the distress of an unplanned pregnancy, go to counsellors for advice or support find themselves unwilling recipients of advice that does not meet their needs and may even serve to increase their distress.
This bill is designed to prevent the situation in which a woman who wishes to consider all three options open to her—having and keeping the child, arranging an adoption, or terminating the pregnancy—instead finds herself the recipient of pregnancy counselling that is strongly directive in nature—that is, directed to the end of ensuring that, no matter what her wishes may be, her pregnancy will continue. Some providers are not only strongly directive; there are documented instances of counsellors having presented material that can only be called anti-abortion propaganda, because it has no basis in fact or is even contradicted by the findings of reputable research.
This raises a further inadequacy in the current legal framework for pregnancy and counselling services. It contains no proscription against the provision of misleading, inaccurate or untruthful information to a client and no requirement that counsellors or service providers apply professional standards in the advice that they provide and the techniques they employ, which should never be coercive.
During the committee hearings, proponents and opponents of the former bill traded accusations of bias. Such accusations may distract us from the most important consideration here. Where there is convincing evidence of the sort presented to the committee—evidence of the not infrequent provision of half-truths and scientifically inaccurate information and of a failure to provide advice on all available alternatives—the need to support this bill becomes clear. It must be passed to protect the very vulnerable women facing the distress of an unplanned pregnancy.
This bill does not seek to restrict the operation of services that provide only one type of pregnancy counselling service—namely, counselling to assist with the continuation of pregnancy. However, it does seek to ensure that such services are open about that fact. Some women will choose those services; some will not. The point is that potential service users should be able to make an informed choice on the basis of the advertising material made available by the service provider.
Some speakers in this place will have a view that this bill is not needed—that there is no need to require pregnancy counselling services to advertise what services they provide—and will ask, ‘Why would anyone provide misinformation or seek to deceive?’ Unfortunately, it does happen, and it appears to be happening more regularly.
Given the widespread interest and concern in this area, we now have a position whereby the yellow pages pregnancy counselling section offers advice to consumers in the form of an advertisement positioned prominently at the head of the section that reads:
We recommend that you fully understand the type of service each organisation offers before you contact them.
Here we have an organisation that recognises the concerns and has attempted to act. And yet the federal parliament is yet to act by simply putting in legislation that requires that pregnancy counselling services advertise their services—no more, no less.
Frankly, I can hardly conceive of how there could be any objection to the provision of openness, honesty and transparency on a matter of such importance. Yet, clearly, there are some people who disagree with the principles promoted by this bill. Do they really believe that it is justifiable to conceal the true nature and philosophy of a service that will only offer assistance and advice on pregnancy continuation because the end, of dissuading a woman from deciding to terminate a pregnancy, justifies the means—the use of a veil of deceit?
During the Senate committee hearings, the Bessie Smyth Foundation described how many women feel angry that anti-abortion agencies masquerading as impartial counselling services try and tell them what they should do and refuse to provide referral information for termination of pregnancy. This same group explained the state of mind of young women who had been to some service providers. They said that many women have been made to feel petrified about having a termination ‘because of the misinformation’ they were given.
I feel deeply for any young woman or any couple who have been misled or placed in a position where they find themselves unable to gain the information they need at what is a major turning point in their lives. This bill aims to ensure that those who need pregnancy counselling services will be able to choose those services most appropriate to their needs and values, and that they will be able to obtain the best quality information concerning all of the available options that they might wish to consider.
There are no simple answers or one-size-fits-all answers to the complex questions raised by an unplanned pregnancy. Openness, honesty and absolute professionalism should govern those who offer advice and assistance through pregnancy counselling services. Decisions made without full access to the facts and without considering all the choices available could be wrong and a person may regret it for the rest of their life. Such decisions cannot be revisited in the weeks, months or years to come. A decision to terminate a pregnancy, to see a pregnancy to term or to give a baby up for adoption is not one that should be made lightly or in haste; it is a decision that the person making it has to live with for the rest of their life. Australians must have access to open, honest information about the available pregnancy counselling services. Anything else is clearly unacceptable. They deserve nothing less than the truth. They also deserve access to transparent information about the nature of the services funded by the government. Specifically, this bill proposes that the pregnancy counselling service—whether provided in person or over the phone—be prohibited from publishing, distributing, displaying or broadcasting any material that is either misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive. This measure will ensure that such services are subject to the same standards that apply to all other services that fall under the Trade Practices Act.
The application of such a standard to pregnancy counselling services is necessary to ensure that women accessing such services are not provided with information that is skewed or distorted in any way. It is important to note that the bill also provides that it is a defence to the abovementioned prohibition if it can be proved that the people involved in providing the relevant information took no part in determining its content and could not reasonably be expected to have known that the material was in fact inaccurate or misleading. This bill provides that all pregnancy counselling services which do not provide referrals for terminations must include in any advertising or material a statement that indicates that it does not provide referrals for such services. Likewise, the bill also requires that counselling services which provide referrals for terminations must include in any advertising or material a statement indicating that the service provides referrals for all pregnancy options. These requirements are aimed at ensuring that women accessing such services are aware of the nature of the information provided by the service they are planning to access.
I realise that it is unlikely that this debate will result in a decision being made today on this bill. It is my hope that this bill will be taken up by government and afforded the same legislative time that government gave to the stem cell legislation and to the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (Repeal of Ministerial responsibility for approval of RU486) Bill, now known commonly as the RU486 bill, which was again introduced by cross-party senators Moore, Nash, Troeth and Allison. This amended the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 to transfer the responsibility for regulatory approval of RU486 from the Minister for Health and Ageing to the Therapeutic Goods Administration. Both these bills were the subject of heated debate within the parliament and in the wider community. Both pieces of legislation were the start of a historic cooperative approach by women senators across parties, who joined together to start and push debate where there appears to be no party willing to do so.
It is important that transparency in this area is achieved to ensure women are able to make informed choices about who they can contact for information when deciding if they can continue with a pregnancy, when seeking support in continuing the pregnancy or when they have decided to terminate the pregnancy. This is an important issue. Women have the right to know what type of service they are going to. A pregnant woman wanting advice should be able to know whether she is ringing a counselling service that advises her on all options related to her pregnancy or only some of them, and, if she has made a decision and is seeking specific support or referral, she should be able to easily find and access appropriate services for her needs. Without clarity and truth in advertising, this seemingly simple request cannot be fulfilled.",SENATE,<title>PREGNANCY COUNSELLING (TRUTH IN ADVERTISING) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,37,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2007-06-14,"—It is with great pleasure that I rise to speak about the Pregnancy Counselling (Truth in Advertising) Bill 2006, and in consultation with my colleagues Senator Natasha Stott Despoja, Senator Carol Brown and Senator Kerry Nettle. This bill has come about on the basis of the hard work being done by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs and I applaud the foundation and the fundamental basis for this bill that the committee laid down. I was not on that committee but I would like to thank the senators who worked on that committee to make this information available.
This bill is founded on the basis of three choices that should be available to pregnant women, and those choices are: autonomy, the right of governing oneself; informed consent, the ability to make a choice on the basis of authoritative information supplied; and gender equity. Pregnant women should be able to get protection from misleading advertising. There is no trade practices attachment or necessity for many counselling services because, although corporate entities must not mislead, many counselling agencies are not corporate entities as they are free or come at a subsidised cost. It is important to note in the context of this debate the figures that my colleague Senator Stott Despoja noted in the result of a survey carried out by Marie Stopes International, that 75 per cent of women with an unplanned pregnancy do not want or need counselling. They make decisions alone or with the assistance of their partner, their family and/or their general practitioner. So we are thinking here of the 25 per cent of the total of women with an unplanned pregnancy who need to go to a counselling service to seek further advice. Nevertheless, of that entire group studied in the survey, 80 per cent of those women felt that there should be counselling for all three options. Ninety per cent of the women in that group thought they should be able to have access to an abortion in all or some circumstances.
The options available to a pregnant woman are three: adopt the baby after it has been carried to full term; terminate the pregnancy, or abort; or have the baby and rear the child. When women do seek counselling, with these very important consequences in mind, they want integrity and they want quality of care. So where would a woman go for choice?  As Senator Brown mentioned, one of the options is to seek advice from the yellow pages. I would like to take three examples from the yellow pages.
Pregnancy Counselling Australia provides those important words of being free, being confidential and being compassionate. When you are a woman in the first days or weeks of contemplating an unplanned pregnancy, those are the qualities you look for. But Pregnancy Counselling Australia, in its advertising, does not say that it is associated with the Right to Life group, which of course does not include abortion in the three options. The National Pregnancy Support Helpline, which calls itself a non-directive agency, and which has been set up by the Commonwealth government, again is a free call, so it is very accessible. But it does not actually refer for any of the three options and, on occasions, it has referred women to the internet. If women wanted to access the internet, they would do so in the comfort of their own home, as we say, without needing a call to the National Pregnancy Support Helpline. There is a third organisation, which uses the word ‘abortion’ in its visual advertising but does not refer for it. So if this were one of the options that you were contemplating and you thought, ‘Perhaps this organisation will help me,’ you would get there and find out that it only refers for adoption of the full-term baby or having the baby and rearing it yourself. So it does not refer for three options. What those organisations should say—and this is the whole point of this bill—is: ‘This organisation does not refer for termination of pregnancy’ or, ‘This organisation does refer for termination of pregnancy,’ so that before women actually get there and walk in the door, or make the phone call, they have advice on what the agency is about.
We are not dealing with any sector of the population here. These are people in crisis, as Senator Stott Despoja said, and they need clear, unequivocal information. They are not necessarily going to get it from every organisation that is in the phone book. What we want to say is: ‘This organisation does refer,’ ‘This organisation does not refer.’ The services, as Senator Brown correctly pointed out, should be used by the woman to make a decision—her decision, not one that is mandated by the service. As she so correctly remarked, up until now the focus has been on the service and the amount of money given to it or not given to it by the Commonwealth government. What we want the focus to be on is the client, the customer—or, as GPs call them, the patient or the client. False information provided by any of those services to a woman in this fragile state can lead to emotional complications which could affect the rest of the pregnancy and it could delay her final decision, with repercussions for both the mother and the child.
Now let us look at the bill. The main purpose of this bill is as with any trade practices type legislation—and that is what this is—we want to stop misleading and deceptive notification and advertising. If corporate entities and most large retail outlets have a false or misleading advertisement in the paper, they need to correct it immediately as to the false price being advertised or the particular brand not being available. Without making this choice seem in any degree flippant or light-hearted, that is exactly what these counselling organisations should be providing—that sort of information. So we want to stop misleading and deceptive notification in advertising, we want to promote transparency and full choice, we want to improve public health and we want to minimise the difficulties associated with getting advice.
In this bill there are penalties for providing misleading and deceptive information, and services should have to realise that if they provide deceptive and misleading information there will be a penalty. I am anticipating arguments, from people who will oppose this bill, that we are favouring one type of ideology over another. We have dealt equally—I repeat: we have dealt equally—with all types of services. So this bill is not aimed at one particular view of dealing with pregnancy. We have said, ‘You must advertise and you must notify for one type of service or another or indeed all three.’ Who could argue with that?  If people want to extend or falsify our arguments, they in turn are being misleading and deceptive about the types of arguments that we are mounting. This is a machinery-type bill. It is not about promoting ideology for dealing with pregnancy in one form or another. It is a machinery bill which will put another piece in the jigsaw, if you like, of information that should be available to pregnant women.
We also say in the bill that financial assistance from the Commonwealth government would not be payable if these conditions were transgressed. As we know, some pregnancy services are provided with finance by the Commonwealth government. We have also said that the minister is to report annually on the payments to and the performance of pregnancy counselling services.
Some people will see this as an extension of bureaucracy and an overwhelming burden on the minister. It could not be any more difficult than obtaining the present figures for different types of services funded by the Commonwealth government because, currently, these figures are almost impossible to obtain in a legible form and in a form which makes sense. It is no more difficult than providing those figures. It would be a minute part of the Minister for Health and Ageing’s reporting, but one part which would place a standard on those services so that they can do their job properly. It is all about transparency and accountability. That is something we would want for all Commonwealth funding arrangements. I commend the bill to my fellow senators, and I thank my cosponsors for their hard work and cooperation in bringing this bill before the Senate.",SENATE,<title>PREGNANCY COUNSELLING (TRUTH IN ADVERTISING) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,37,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2007-06-14,"—I am pleased to debate the Pregnancy Counselling (Truth in Advertising) Bill 2006 and to have worked with all of the other cosponsors of the bill. This is an important piece of legislation for entrenching honesty in the way in which organisations relate to the public. We all want people to be honest and that is what sits behind the basis of the laws in this country that do not allow people to advertise in a deceptive or misleading way. We all want to see some honesty in the way in which people relate their services to the public.
The cosponsors of this legislation have put it in place for incorporated entities right across the board to ensure that we have that honesty so that when people see an advertisement they know what services they will get. But we have a loophole. This legislation seeks to close that loophole. I am proud to be a part of trying to close a loophole that exists in our current legislation which enables people to be dishonest in the way they advertise. Unfortunately, we are seeing some pregnancy counselling organisations taking advantage of the loophole that exists in our legislation.
The reason why this legislation is so important is that, when those organisations do take advantage of the loophole that exists in the current legislation, it is women who suffer. Women with an unplanned pregnancy want to find support when making a really difficult decision about what they are going to do about their unplanned pregnancy. They want to be able to find support and, when they see a pregnancy counselling service advertised—in the yellow pages, in the newspaper, or wherever—which says it will provide them with the information they need that will help them make a decision, that is what they want and expect. This legislation is about ensuring that that happens.
I want to talk a little about the impact on women with an unplanned pregnancy, their families and supporters when pregnancy counselling organisations take advantage of the loophole that exists in our legislation and when they are misleading and deceptive in the way in which they advertise. I went to visit the Pregnancy Advisory Centre in South Australia, which is a government funded service which provides pregnancy counselling to women with an unplanned pregnancy. It is a great service. They provide information to women about all three options that women can pursue when they have an unplanned pregnancy. I spoke with them about some of the phone calls that they have been receiving. At the centre, they get an opportunity to see what happens to women when these women read one of these false or misleading advertisements, then ring up a service and get something totally different from what they had expected. I want to give some examples that the centre staff told me about, the experiences that they had had and of the women whom they had spoken to.
The mother of a pregnant 13-year-old woman rang the service that had advertised as a pregnancy counselling service to get some information regarding options for her daughter. She was told that if her daughter adopted out her child then it would be the worst thing that she could do. She was also told that if she terminated the pregnancy, ‘Well, that’s just killing the baby.’ It is not support for the mother of a 13-year-old who has an unplanned pregnancy to tell her that if her daughter terminates, ‘That’s just killing the baby.’ That is not pregnancy counselling; that is not support. She was told that there would be support for her daughter to keep the baby, such as cots and baby clothes. She was also told that the government would provide a few thousand dollars to keep the baby. This service is funded by the federal government, and it was advertising itself as being able to provide support to women with an unplanned pregnancy. That is not support to the mother of a 13-year-old with an unplanned pregnancy. That is what this legislation is trying to stop, to ensure that mothers like her do not have to experience that kind of disservice when they ring up to get support.
Again, a woman rang a service advertising itself as providing pregnancy counselling. She mentioned in the conversation that she had had an abortion. She was told, ‘I think you should name your baby.’ How is that providing any kind of support or genuine pregnancy counselling for a woman who rings up to talk about a medical operation that she has had only to be told, ‘I think you should name your baby.’ She was also told that her baby did not have a place in heaven. She was asked whether she thought what she had done was sinful. That is not support; it is not pregnancy counselling. An organisation that provides that kind of disservice should not be advertising itself as a pregnancy counselling service. This legislation is about ensuring that Australian women can have honesty reflected in the advertisements that they read.
It is not just about Australian women; it is also about men. The father of a 16-year-old girl from regional Australia rang up a service—again, one advertising that it would provide pregnancy counselling—when she was five weeks pregnant as a result of having been raped. When he suggested pregnancy termination as an available option for his daughter—which, clearly, she had; there are three options, and one of them is a pregnancy termination—the person at the other end of the telephone called him a murderer for stating that there are three things that you can do when you have an unplanned pregnancy pregnancy: the first is a termination, the second is continuing on and becoming a parent and the third one is to have the child adopted. He mentioned one of those three options and he was told by the person at the other end of the phone that he was a murderer.
That is what we want to prevent occurring—for the father of a 16-year-old girl in this instance. I think that the father of that 16-year-old girl has the right, when he looks it up in the yellow pages, to know whether or not the service that is advertising itself as doing pregnancy counselling is actually going to be able to provide him and his daughter with support. This is a deliberate strategy being taken by particular pregnancy counselling services. To give you an idea of how deliberate it is, I want to tell you about some research that has been done in the United States by right to life organisations. One piece of research was done in 1988. It was called Turning hearts towards life. There was another lot of market research done in 2005. What that research was designed to do was to find out how best these right to life organisations could advertise their services in order to get women who had an unplanned pregnancy to ring them without realising that they were a right to life organisation. That was the intention of the research: to find out how best they could advertise their service to mislead and to deceive women about the service they were providing. What they found in that market research was that they should put themselves under ‘Pregnancy’ in the phone book and that they should talk about being free, low-cost, confidential, caring, friendly, non-judgmental, professional, trained and able to see people quickly. These were all important things.
These were all things that women wanted. But that was not why these organisations were doing the market research; they were doing it to find out how best they could advertise things that women wanted but exclude what they were actually not providing to women—that is, information about one of the three options that women can pursue when they have an unplanned pregnancy. The research told them that they needed to be careful about what they said and that if they put the word ‘options’ in their advertisement then some women may pick that up as being an indication that they were pro choice—that they thought women should have access to the whole range of reproductive rights and look at all of the options when they had an unplanned pregnancy. What they were looking for in their research was the answer to this: ‘What do we not put in the advertisement, because if we put it in the advertisement then people may be able to determine what our particular perspective is?’
I think it is really important when we have this debate to say, ‘We’re not talking about just anyone looking in the yellow pages and trying to find a particular service.’ This is not like trying to find where the nearest squash court is. We are not talking about somebody in that headspace. What we are talking about here is somebody who is in crisis; somebody who is extremely vulnerable. This is somebody who has just found out that they are pregnant or that one of their friends or family members is pregnant and it was not planned. Some people will be wildly excited because they thought they could never get pregnant and they have found out that they are pregnant. For other people it is going to be really frightening because it was not part of their vision for their life or for their future. They are in crisis and they really want to be able to get support. They really want to access someone who can go through with them what their options are—what they are thinking, what their values are and how they going to put in place the big life decision that they are being asked to make at that point. These are people who are in crisis. When you are in crisis you need clear information to make sure that, in the jumble of your confusion about what you are going to do, you are not misled. You need clear information.
I will give you an example. Ms Brigid Coombe, the Director of the Pregnancy Advisory Centre in South Australia, gave this example when she appeared before the Senate committee into this legislation at the hearing in South Australia. I will read her words. She said:
I would like to give you an example of how easy it is for women to misinterpret information describing services on the 24-hour pages. I spoke with a woman at the centre last week who had rung Pregnancy Counselling Australia. As you will note on the White Pages, there it states, ‘Alternatives to abortion and post-abortion counselling.’ I asked her why she had rung them given that their entry states, ‘Alternatives to abortion’. She said she saw the word ‘abortion’ and in her anxious state thought, ‘That’s what I want,’ and rang them.
She needed clear information but she saw the word ‘abortion’ and, in her anxiety, jumped to a conclusion and rang that service. When she rang that service she was given inaccurate and alarming information. She then went to a gynaecologist in a hospital, where she was reassured with accurate information and given information about the counselling service provided by the South Australian government. She was able to get some support to make a really difficult decision.
I want to give that example because, as I said, we are not talking about someone trying to find the nearest squash court; we are talking about somebody who is perhaps not thinking as clearly as they might otherwise because they have in front of them a really difficult life decision. This is something that they did not expect and they need assistance to get through it. As we have heard other people mention, a lot of women are able to make their own decision: in fact, 75 per cent of women who have an unplanned pregnancy are able to decide which of the three available options they are going to choose.
The women who most need pregnancy counselling are those who do not have support networks around them or who feel that they need more information or who need some reassurance about making their decisions. The people who are uncertain about which of the three options they should choose are the ones who are riffling through the yellow pages to find where they can get some support. It is precisely the most vulnerable of the women with unplanned pregnancies who are the ones looking through the advertisements to try to find out if they can get the service that they want.
What this bill says is that those advertisements should be clear about what kind of service they are going to get. It is a simple, straightforward request. Let us be clear about what people are going to provide. As I said before, I thought everyone here agreed with the concept of people being honest about what kind of service they are providing. That is what this legislation is about. It says, ‘Let’s be honest about what kind of service is going to be provided when somebody rings up that number.’ That is not currently the situation because we have got this loophole in our legislation. But that loophole is proposed to be shut by the bill we are debating today.
I spoke to a group of students at the University of Sydney some time ago about the different types of pregnancy counselling services out there and what kinds of experiences women had had when ringing some of those pregnancy counselling services. I told them, as I have just now told the Senate, about some examples where people rang up expecting to get support and found that the phone had been answered by a ‘right to life’ organisation. They were told that they would be a murderer and that they had sinned. They were told to name their baby. The consequence of that for that woman—or for the friend or family member who rang—was disastrous. When I was talking to the students at the University of Sydney they asked me: ‘How do I find out? How do I know whether or not a pregnancy counselling service is going to provide me with genuine information?’ I had to say to them, ‘Well, there is no law that requires those pregnancy services not to mislead or be deceptive in their advertising.’
It was partly as a result of those conversations that I produced out of my office a Greens guide for pregnancy counselling, which I have distributed to many different youth centres in my state. I have also distributed it to women’s health centres, which is where people go to find this information. The guide outlines which are the genuine pregnancy counselling services and which are the deceptive and misleading ones that will not provide women with information—let alone a referral—about one of the three options that they can choose when they have an unplanned pregnancy. But it should not be the case that a young woman with an unplanned pregnancy has to go into the youth centre to see a guide that enables her to determine which services are genuine or not. She should be able to see that in the advertisement. That is why we are proposing this piece of legislation.
It is an issue that other countries have had to deal with as well. In New York, just last year, a Republican member of parliament introduced a piece of legislation called the Stop Deceptive Advertising for Women’s Services Act. It was designed to deal with precisely the same issue that we are dealing with here today. She wanted to ensure that American women would see advertisements for pregnancy counselling services that were honest about the services that they provided. That is what the four women from the spectrum of the political parties are doing today. They are trying to ensure that Australian women who see advertisements for pregnancy counselling services will know that those advertisements are honest. That is what we want, and that is why we want it. We want it because it is in the best interests of not just women but everyone for services like this to be honest in their advertising. That is why this bill is important. It is extremely important if we value things like honesty, and I do value honesty. That is why I support this bill and why I am very proud and pleased to be standing here commending this bill to the parliament. I say that if we care about Australian women and their friends and families we need to support this piece of legislation that is before the parliament today. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>PREGNANCY COUNSELLING (TRUTH IN ADVERTISING) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,37,1
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2007-06-14,"—I too would like to make a contribution to this debate on the Pregnancy Counselling (Truth in Advertising) Bill 2006. I would like to highlight the consequences and the effects of the bill.
The bill was first introduced by Senator Stott Despoja in June 2005. The Senate referred the bill to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by August 2006. It is on the public record—and there was extensive media coverage at the time—that the committee received over 6,000 public contributions to the inquiry. Supporters of the bill organised a petition, which was signed by more than 13,000 citizens and tabled in the Senate in June 2006. As a consequence, the bill that we are debating today is the second iteration of the bill. It is sponsored by Senator Carol Brown, Senator Stott Despoja, Senator Troeth and Senator Nettle.
The bill seeks to prohibit misleading or deceptive advertising or notification by pregnancy counselling services that do not charge for the information they provide. It seeks to promote transparency by requiring services to declare which pregnancy options they provide referrals for. The bill prohibits pregnancy counselling services from publishing, distributing, displaying or broadcasting by internet, television, telephone, radio or like service, or by post, any advertising material that is misleading or deceptive as to the services it provides, or any notification of its services that is misleading or deceptive as to the nature of the services it provides.
The bill requires that advertising and notifications by pregnancy counselling services which do not refer for terminations include the statement, ‘This service does not provide referrals for terminations of pregnancy,’ or a like statement. The bill requires that advertising and notifications by pregnancy counselling services which do refer for terminations include the statement, ‘This service provides referrals for terminations of pregnancy,’ or a like statement. Breaching of either of these conditions would result in a penalty and a loss of any Commonwealth financial assistance until the service ceased to engage in what would be regarded as misleading or deceptive conduct. So the bill essentially seeks to make pregnancy counselling services subject to the same laws on misleading advertising as organisations that are engaged in trade or commerce are subject to.
Given the widespread interest in and the broad general support for the bill, it is very interesting to note why we are debating this bill as a matter of general business on a Thursday afternoon. I can only conclude that our Democrat colleagues consider it to be the most crucial issue that the minor parties want to bring before the Senate prior to the winter break—and that is quite extraordinary.
Organisations in receipt of government money to provide counselling services must ensure that they can provide unbiased, expert, independent and professional advice. Surely that goes for all kinds of services. It should apply to pregnancy counselling services just as much as it applies to financial counselling services, drought support counselling services and a range of other counselling services. I do not think there is one person in this chamber who would argue against the need for balanced and independent pregnancy counselling services to ensure that the full range of options is made available to women.
The bill represents a genuine attempt to ensure that women who find themselves pregnant are able to access counselling that helps them make informed decisions about their future—and, of course, every reasonable person would want that. But I doubt very much that the legislation, as drafted, can achieve its intended purpose. At the end of the day, I am convinced that this pursuit of truth in advertising for pregnancy counselling is a nonissue. This opinion is based on my consideration of these matters from the perspective of the Trade Practices Act—which has been quoted by several speakers as the purpose for bringing in this bill. The Senate economics committee considered the act in its deliberations. The second bill reflects some of the considerations of misleading advertising and deceptive conduct under the Trade Practices Act, but, as I am sure the ACCC and ASIC will attest, such conduct can be very difficult to prove.
Prohibition of misleading advertising is contained in section 52 of the Trade Practices Act and it is mirrored in each of the state and territory fair trading acts. It is also mirrored in the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act in relation to financial services. The prohibition applies to statements about existing facts, predictions about the future, and even silence. Such conduct must convey or contain a misrepresentation and not merely be confusing. Intent is irrelevant in determining whether a contravention has occurred. Prohibition applies to material viewed on a website and to online conduct, including advertising, writing, conducting business and putting information on the internet about business products or services. General corporations are liable under the Trade Practices Act. Licensed service providers are liable under the ASIC Act 1989, and all other organisations are liable under the state fair trading laws. To ensure that there is no misleading or deceptive conduct in pregnancy counselling, the establishment of a regulatory regime would be required—and, without that, this bill is meaningless. Such a regulatory regime, I would argue, would involve significant costs—money which could be better directed to direct counselling services or to strengthen the capacity of the sector more generally.
There is an important issue at stake here. I do not intend to go back to the arguments of the inquiry into the Pregnancy Counselling (Truth in Advertising) Bill 2006, but, in fairness, I would like to make some brief points. The first point is about terminology. Much of the debate around the original bill, which remains just as relevant to this bill, focused on the difference between so-called directive and non-directive counselling. The implication is that ‘non-directive’ refers to counselling with abortion referral as an option, while the more prescriptive term ‘directive counselling’ is defined by the lack of an option of abortion referral. However, this interpretation of non-directive counselling is at best a misrepresentation in its suggestion that best practice counselling inherently involves an ability to refer for an abortion.
In terms of the inquiry into this bill and the submissions received, I would like to quote from the submission by Dr Nicholas Tonti-Filippini, a consultant ethicist. He makes a very important point when he writes:
... the definition of non-directive counselling in the Transparent Advertising and Notification of Pregnancy Counselling Services Bill 2005, and Part 2 of the Bill which contains prohibitions with respect to counselling services that do not refer for termination of pregnancy, would seem to be based on a mistake concerning counselling services in general, and not just pregnancy counselling.
Referral for medical services is a function of medical practitioners and of other health professionals. Referral for specialist medical services is a function of medical practitioners. Counselling services do not normally have a referral function unless medical practitioners undertake them. The effect of the Bill, therefore, would be to limit Government funding of non-directive counselling services to medical practitioners—
it would limit government funding to medical practitioners—
and to prohibit the advertising of all other non-directive pregnancy counselling.
Further, he writes:
Pregnancy counselling services should not be seen as exclusively medical services. There is a need for women to be able to explore non-medical options. There is also a need for women who may want to continue a pregnancy to have access to support services. To medicalise pregnancy counselling would suggest that medical interventions are the only services available.
I think that is a very important point. In fact, I would argue that non-directive counselling is, by definition, unbiased, which is the argument that has been put against this use of the term in the bill. I was very pleased to see that the Commonwealth, when adding pregnancy counselling services to the Medicare regime, argued—and I am quoting from the Department of Health and Ageing website:
It is important that women are able to access non-directive counselling when they are uncertain about a pregnancy and that they are able to do so quickly.
This is a really important issue that needs to be understood in the context of the bill. Services are being defined as being ‘directive’ if they do not provide referral for the termination of pregnancy and ‘non-directive’ if they provide referrals for termination. But, if you have had anything to do with counselling services, you will know that being non-directive in counselling has little to do with whether or not referral is provided, and that it could be argued that providing a referral to a distressed client constitutes pressure to take a certain path. Non-directive counselling actually refers to being able to allow a client to be self-determining in their decision-making process. It is a practice that counsellors use so that the client takes time to think through the issues raised and discussed so that she can make her own choice, having explored what supports are available to her.
One of the arguments that we have heard already this afternoon about directive and non-directive counselling is the issue of the role of counselling versus referral for termination. As I said when I quoted Dr Tonti-Filipini, referral for termination is the role for a medical practitioner who assesses the woman’s medical reasons for termination of pregnancy. The role of the counselling service is to assist a woman to be fully informed of her options, the consequences of those options and the supports available to her if she were to continue with any of these options. Counselling should be about exploring the options, with time given to the client to make her decisions based on her own values, beliefs and supports. Other elective surgeries are dealt with in this way, with transparent, independent counselling provided, so why would we not consider pregnancy counselling in the same way?
It is really quite important for people to understand that the bill defines non-directive counsellors as those who provide referrals for termination. Most commonly, services that provide referral for termination are also termination providers or services with connected business interests. So this counselling, at best, could be seen as pre-abortion counselling, and not independent counselling to explore all options regarding the decision whether or not to continue a pregnancy. There are very strong practice arguments for not referring to medical practitioners who work within termination clinics, and counsellors have an obligation to ensure that their clients receive both independent counselling services and independent medical advice.
Last year in the debates around RU486 we talked about the absolute agreement—more than 90 per cent of people in Australia believe this—that abortion levels in Australia are too high. So it is very important that we ensure that counselling services around pregnancy support include ensuring that people get information that gives them options other than abortion. And yet this is what this bill is trying to address in a difficult and convoluted way. It is an unintended consequence of the way it has been drafted.
The argument in this bill is that, currently, counselling services that do not charge fees are not regulated in any way that might prevent them from engaging in deceptive behaviour or misleading advertising. It is of great concern to me that there are counsellors and counselling service providers who are not governed by legislation and are not bound to operate within the parameters set down by professional bodies. This is an issue that extends far beyond pregnancy counselling, to a range of services that particularly target vulnerable people.
Traditionally, if we talk about misleading and deceptive practices, they generally fall into four categories. Let us think about these categories in the context of the bill that is before us. They are, firstly, pretending to sell something that you do not have while taking money in advance; secondly, supplying goods or services which are of a lower quality than the goods or services paid for, or failing to supply the goods or services sought at all; thirdly, persuading consumers to buy something that they do not really want through oppressive marketing techniques; and, finally, disguising one’s identity in order to perpetrate a fraud.
You can see that, in the debate that we have had so far, those arguments are implicit in the arguments that are being put in support of the bill. I absolutely agree that anyone seeking pregnancy counselling services should not be exposed to such fraudulent and deceptive practices. But we also have an argument that is being played out here that pregnancy counsellors should be value free. We know that that really is a nonsense. The staff of all reputable services are trained to adhere to the Australian Association of Social Workers code of ethics. There is a professional standard about this. But the campaign that has been around this bill has implied a very simplistic position that counsellors should be value free. All counsellors come to their role with a value and a belief system, just as we all do here. There is no such thing as a value-neutral or value-free counselling environment. This is acknowledged by health professionals who offer counselling, such as social workers or psychologists, but they are required, within their supervision, to reflect on their personal value and belief systems to ensure that they do not engage in directive counselling. But the view expressed in this bill of what is seen as directive counselling is very simplistic in terms of the understanding of values in the counselling environment.
We get to this argument about protecting women from misleading and unconscionable conduct—although not in the sense of the expression which I know Senator Brandis would use in respect of the Trade Practices Act—but I still remain very unconvinced that the bill will protect women in the way that proponents suggest. Truth and transparency in advertising is an issue that is much better addressed through professionalising the counselling services, accreditation mechanisms, registration processes and the development of professional standards, guidelines and codes of ethics to support high-quality impartial counselling services. I repeat: I am very unconvinced that the bill will have the effect of addressing this important matter. With regard to the argument that there are no avenues for consumers to make complaints about unprofessional services, I point to the range of state and territory consumer protection and health protection bodies which can serve this purpose.
Let us look a little more at the issue of deceptive advertising. The bill requires pregnancy counselling services to include the statement: ‘This service does’—or does not—’provide referrals for terminations of pregnancy.’ It is certainly entirely reasonable to require all services to declare the services that they provide, but why should any agency or business be required to advertise for services that they do not supply? Whether or not a prospective client determines from the advertising that the services he or she needs are not available from a particular agency is really a matter for the client. An agency that declares the services they offer is being neither deceptive nor misleading. If it declares that it offers alternatives to abortion, what else can that phrase be taken to mean other than exactly what it says? Surely it is a simpler approach that agencies that do make referrals for abortions should advertise that fact and state their own services. As I said, I really believe this truth in advertising argument is a nonissue.
I am sure it would be in the public interest if the Commonwealth published a comprehensive list of pregnancy counselling agencies that include not just the ones mentioned by other speakers but those clinics that currently advertise pregnancy counselling services but provide only termination services with no further counselling—in fact, they are the people who provide no support to a woman who wants to continue her pregnancy, and profit from those who do not.

",SENATE,<title>PREGNANCY COUNSELLING (TRUTH IN ADVERTISING) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,37,1
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2007-06-14,"—I know Senator Barnaby Joyce wanted to speak on the Pregnancy Counselling (Truth in Advertising) Bill 2006, as did Senator Guy Barnett. Both want to make some statements that they are pro life but unfortunately the schedule will not allow them to get up tonight. This bill purports to advocate truth in advertising about abortion. If that were really the case, abortion providers would tell women of the lifetime of emotional and sometimes physical pain that abortions can instigate. Everyone who considers abortion should first read Melinda Tankard Reist’s book Giving sorrow words, which is about women who have suffered so much as a result of abortion. However, this bill comes from another angle. It is an attack on church groups who, as everyone knows, do not support abortion. They have a legitimate role in providing counselling. Often they are the only ones who are there for people in difficult circumstances. They are at the coalface of helping people in distress. They do not mislead in their advertising; they do not tell porkies.
This bill is a direct attack on them for daring to have a different view on whether abortion is a valid alternative to carrying a pregnancy to full term. This is an ideological bill that seeks to punish, censor and repress. It is intolerant. From a practical viewpoint, this bill does not achieve what it sets out to do. The explanatory memorandum says that the bill:
... would require services which do not provide referrals for terminations of pregnancy to declare this in their advertising and notification material, and services which do provide referrals for terminations to state that they refer for all options.
It also aims to redefine non-directive counselling into a counselling service which ‘will provide referrals to termination of pregnancy services if requested to do so’. So non-directive becomes directive. Independent neutrality becomes pro-abortion. The fundamental practical flaw in this bill is that its central concern is about referrals to abortion providers. It wants everyone to either offer referrals to abortionists or to state publicly that they do not provide such referrals.
That seems to be the overall thrust of the bill before the Senate, which ignores the most basic feature of abortion practice in this country. No referral is needed. Abortionists are not specialists requiring a referral from anyone. Anyone can go at any time to an abortion provider without a referral from anyone. Referrals have no official role in abortions. This bill fails to recognise that, which undermines its whole rationale. You need only go to the yellow pages in the Canberra telephone directory to see this. One advertisement under ‘Pregnancy counselling and related services’ says: ‘No referral necessary.’ Another sells its wares with the line: ‘Abortion four to 20 weeks, asleep or awake.’ Another says: ‘Abortion—same day services available.’ Another says ‘Same day consultation and procedure under intravenous sedation; approximately two-hour visit.’ In the yellow pages there is even a separate category, called ‘Pregnancy termination services’, so there is no doubt that everyone is very aware where they can go to if they want an abortion. It is very clear.
There is no need to persecute religious based groups for not providing abortion referrals, or for not saying they do not provide abortion services, when it is so obvious who does provide them—and referrals are not even needed. If we legislated to force providers of other services to state what they do not provide, we would be forever regulating in this parliament.
There are serious flow-on ramifications of the way this bill has been drafted. The definition of a pregnancy counselling service as a ‘service that provides advice to women and their support persons about pregnancy’ makes the group caught by this definition extremely broad. It would include all Catholic schools and hospitals, for example, because they would in the course of their activities provide advice about pregnancy. Under this bill, they would be forced to put up signs or make statements like, ‘This service does not provide referrals for terminations of pregnancy.’ Even IVF and fertility clinics would have to put up such signs, because of the broad definition within this bill.
If the movers of this bill were really concerned about women having all the information necessary to them when considering the fate of a pregnancy, they would have included the mandatory provision of an ultrasound with every counselling event. Then the woman would be able to see the life within her and be better informed as to what an abortion would mean to that new life. If the movers of this bill were serious about misleading advertising in pregnancy support services, they would insist that counsellors warn women of the pain that they may carry all their lives at the memory of an abortion.
The government’s move to offer pregnancy support counselling was a long overdue and most welcome initiative. Women facing unintended pregnancy will at last be given assistance with non-directive counselling by health professionals, independent of abortion clinics. The provision of a Medicare counselling item will allow women to be supported and informed about the choices and assistance available to them. I fully support more information being on the table about alternatives for women facing unintended pregnancies, because there has not been enough.
Most Australians are concerned about the high rate of approximately 90,000 abortions a year—or nearly one-third of all pregnancies. We pride ourselves on being a compassionate society, yet until now those 90,000 women had virtually no professional independent advice they could turn to for support, assistance and information. Despite the sensitivities and controversies of the recent debates on abortion, it is all worth it if we can move forward with such a progressive step as the government’s pregnancy counselling package. The new measures are expected to cost $51 million over four years. The helpline is expected to cost $15.5 million over four years. Medicare funded counselling is expected to cost $35.6 million over four years.
In contrast to the intent of the bill before us, the government’s measures will improve the availability of timely, confidential, professional pregnancy counselling for Australian women and their partners, including those in rural and remote areas. These measures are being implemented in consultation with professional groups. Training programs have been developed to support GPs, other health professionals and phone counsellors, with pregnancy counselling skills. The government has adopted a broad, compassionate, practical and generous approach to helping women facing unintended pregnancy. The bill before us, in contrast, is narrow, ungenerous and impractical. Its real agenda is to tie the hands of those who do the most to help. I will not be supporting the bill.",SENATE,<title>PREGNANCY COUNSELLING (TRUTH IN ADVERTISING) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,37,1
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2007-06-14,"—Family First is strongly opposed to the Pregnancy Counselling (Truth in Advertising) Bill 2006 because it seeks to overturn the current system of pregnancy counselling and replace it with one which pushes agencies to become involved in abortion referrals. The bill seeks to do this in four steps. First, it identifies community groups that the bill’s sponsors disagree with—those being pregnancy counselling groups that do not refer for abortion. It then takes the definition of their work, which is non-directive pregnancy counselling, and redefines it in the bill to what is, in effect, directive counselling that includes abortion referrals.
The third step is to accuse anyone of being misleading and deceptive who does not meet the new definition. Finally, the bill’s sponsors aim to penalise any group or person who does not bend to their will. Family First is extremely concerned about this bill and its consequences, particularly in the light of the harsh penalties it contains. The consequences of failing to meet the bill’s requirements are severe indeed: fines for individuals of $220,000 and fines for incorporated bodies of $1.1 million.
Let us look at the community groups. The Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee reported on an earlier version of the bill last year. The committee majority report did not support the bill. It was interesting in the committee hearings how much the senators focused on pregnancy counselling groups they did not agree with. In fact, I recall asking the chair whether senators could confine their questions to the bill itself, rather than the operations of the various groups they took issue with.
It is disturbing that the bill effectively accuses the many good people working in pregnancy counselling agencies—many of them volunteers—of being deceptive. It accuses these people—mostly women—of lying to the women who approach them. Family First deplores this behaviour by the bill’s sponsors, which is motivated by the fact that others do not share the same ideological views.
It is instructive to look at one of the bill’s sponsors’ websites, which lists what it calls ‘genuine’ pregnancy counselling services as opposed to what it calls ‘deceptive’ counselling services. The bill corrupts the notion of non-directive counselling. It says that to be non-directive you have to be willing to direct your client to an abortion clinic. There is nothing non-directive about that. Unless a pregnancy counselling service is willing to comply with the bill’s support for abortion, the service has to include in all its advertisements and public material the statement: ‘This service does not provide referrals for all pregnancy options.’
Even the Department of Health and Ageing disagrees with the bill’s dodgy definition of non-directive counselling, saying:
Counselling is really about the process of supporting decision making and ensuring that the counsellor assists the client to explore their feelings in relation to the issue. The issue of what happens once the client has made the decision and whether there is ongoing referral is a different issue from whether nondirective counselling is being provided.
Family First believes it is important to stress that pregnancy support agencies that declare a conscientious objection to providing a referral for abortion do still provide information to women on all their options, including abortion. All they do not provide is a referral. Mrs Garratt from Pregnancy Help Australia said:
All our counsellors are trained to say, ‘We cannot provide you with a referral for termination services. We can, however, talk to you about your options and give you information about abortion procedures, et cetera, if that is what you want to do.’
Ms D’Elia from the Caroline Chisholm Society stated:
We do not refer for the termination of a pregnancy. We are not medical practitioners. That is the role of a medical practitioner. But we are happy to talk about all the options that are available for a woman to explore. We do explore all three options that are available. If someone was to ask for a referral for termination we would say that it is really important for them to seek further counselling and support from their GP or local hospital. We do not provide a direct referral to a termination clinic; we believe that it is important for there to be the intervention of a medical practitioner in that process.
Further, the Caroline Chisholm Society argued:
We would be very clear that we are not directive within our counselling and yet having to state that openly works in the reverse, if you like. By stating that I am not a non-directive service under your definition then in fact what I am stating is that I am directive, and my social workers would walk out on that basis, and rightly so, because they would be misrepresented by the organisation if I were to sign a form that effectively said they were directive counsellors.
In conclusion, Family First believes that much of what the sponsors say in support of their bill is in fact a complaint about the quality of pregnancy counselling. It is worth noting that in the Senate committee inquiry there was unanimous agreement that the standard of pregnancy counselling in Australia could be improved. Family First believes this should be a priority to ensure all women get the help and support they need. Instead of targeting particular groups for ideological reasons, we should invest our energies in establishing a proper standards and accreditation system so women do not feel rushed to make a decision, so counselling services are separate to abortion clinics and so all women are aware of practical alternatives to abortion.",SENATE,<title>PREGNANCY COUNSELLING (TRUTH IN ADVERTISING) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,37,1
"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2007-06-14,"—I would like to start my contribution by commencing where Senator Stott Despoja did, and that is by congratulating the co-sponsors of this important piece of legislation, the Pregnancy Counselling (Truth in Advertising) Bill 2006, and by expressing the wish that the cross-party work between women in this place continues. In the five years that I have been a member of this place, one of the things that I have enjoyed most has been working with the other women in this chamber, no matter which political party they belong to. I particularly want to congratulate my good friend Senator Carol Brown for assisting in bringing this important piece of legislation forward today.
A report in the 23 April 2007 issue of Archives of Internal Medicine showed further evidence that neither induced nor spontaneous abortions were associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in premenopausal women. This followed a 2003 international expert panel convened by the National Cancer Institute, which reviewed and assessed research regarding reproductive events and the risk of breast cancer and concluded that, based on existing evidence, induced abortion is not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Obviously this is very good news for the many women who experience terminations and miscarriages.
But there are still some pregnancy counselling services who insist on telling vulnerable women that they risk breast cancer if they have an abortion. Were they to charge for this supposed service, they would be in clear breach of the Trade Practices Act. But, because they provide this service for free, there are no legal methods of preventing them from exploiting vulnerable women or punishing them for making false and dangerous claims to those women. That is the very reason that I rise to speak today on this important piece of legislation.
There has been a lot of talk recently about Australian values. I am sure that all of us in this place are largely in agreement that at the very least Australians value honesty, freedom and a fair go. We are generally of the view that the best person to make decisions about how to live is the person whose life it is—that is, after all, the basis of a free society. But people cannot make informed decisions if they make them on the basis of misleading or false information. That is why we prosecute companies who make false claims in advertising a product or mislead people about the nature of the services that they are paying for—and that is all we are attempting to do here today. We are making sure that when a woman is faced with an unplanned—some say unwanted or difficult—pregnancy she is able to choose the service that is most relevant for her.
Some providers have tried to claim that they choose to outline the risks of abortion in the interests of providing full information so that women can make a fully informed decision. On the surface, this sounds like a reasonable claim, but a quick look at the websites of these agencies shows how this argument has been twisted. Looking at sections on continuing a pregnancy, you will see a discussion about the possible effects on a woman’s life—on her educational and employment concerns, her feelings about her family and the father of the child and her feelings about becoming a mother. There is no talk about the many risks associated with pregnancy and childbirth, including—rarely, I admit—death, and nor should there be. These are issues for her to discuss with medical professionals and not with telephone counselling services.
However, click on the pages concerning abortion and you will find mountains of statistics and talk of steel instruments and infections in an attempt to scare women out of considering a relatively safe procedure—indeed, safer than childbirth. If abortion is as dangerous and damaging as these false providers believe it is, they should not need to resort to misleading women. If they are genuinely interested in educating women, they should be honest enough to provide women with information about the many health risks that come with pregnancy also, no matter how small those risks are.
Some claim that this bill seeks to prevent anti-abortion providers from continuing in their role. This is simply not true. Many women have never considered and would never consider terminating a pregnancy. They do not need a service that will discuss that option. Genuinely pro-life organisations can continue to help these women by providing support and comfort, whether those women choose to keep their baby or put it up for adoption. But many women are open to all options—examples of which have been discussed earlier today in this chamber—because the pregnancy they are concerned about is unplanned. They are therefore genuinely undecided. These women need to know that the service they ring or visit is open-minded and honest and will not judge or coerce them into making a particular decision. All this bill requires is that services that do not meet this description not pretend that they do. Is that so much to ask?
A woman’s time is just as valuable as her money, in my view, and she does not need to have either of them wasted by misleading advertising. I do not believe that this is too great an imposition on any provider. But, more importantly, the right of providers to attract women to their service by whatever means necessary must not override a woman’s right to make decisions based on facts—not on lies and deception—whether that decision is in choosing the provider to speak to or whether or not to proceed with her pregnancy.
I would like to make it very clear that there are many pro-life agencies that provide a compassionate and high-quality service to many women. They do not try to mislead women and trick them into using their services. They rely simply on being very good at their job of counselling women who are experiencing difficulties. There are also some very vocally anti-choice organisations that make it clear that they oppose abortion and want to dissuade women from that option. I do not necessarily agree with their views and am happy to debate their arguments with them, but I am also happy to acknowledge that they are very clear in their motives. But not all agencies are respectful of a woman’s ability to make choices about her health and her future. Some agencies use language that, to someone like me, is very obviously code for anti-choice agencies; but to a woman who is unfamiliar with these tactics it may sound very welcoming and compassionate.
For instance, at the moment in the Perth yellow pages there is an ad for an agency that says:
Are you pregnant? Alone? Needing Help? Need someone to talk to? Confused? Scared? Not sure what to do? For 24 hour assistance phone the Pregnancy Help Line—
and it gives you the phone number and then it says:
and speak to someone who cares.
Not once in that ad is it disclosed that that agency will try and actively dissuade you from choosing one of the three options, it will not refer for one of the three options and, in fact, it will behave in the way that I have alluded to earlier. It will say such things as ‘if you choose abortion as the option, you may never have any more children, as there is an increased risk of infertility; you will get breast cancer’—and the lies go on. Not once in that ad is it made obvious that that service provider does not and will never support one of the three options.
However, if I were a young and vulnerable 16- or 17-year-old woman, and fortunately I am not, and were to read that ad, I would presume that words such as ‘needing help’, ‘want someone to talk to’ and ‘confused’—‘confused’ particularly—meant that you were going to canvass the full range of options about the decision I had to make in a non-judgemental, non-directive way. However, at the moment when agencies like that say to vulnerable young women, ‘We don’t support you having a termination; if you do, you’ll get breast cancer, you’ll never carry a pregnancy to full term,’ and other ridiculous statements, there is nothing we can do. Because vulnerable young women do not pay for that counselling, that agency cannot in any way be prosecuted for its misleading, deceptive and cruel behaviour towards them.
If people in this chamber think this is not an issue that we should be concerned about, that it is all quite clear and people should be allowed to behave like that, as Senator Carol Brown said earlier, it would seem that even the yellow pages publishers themselves no longer agree with that view. They seem to think there is something going on out there and that people are being a bit deceptive. They are concerned that people who use their phone directory to find a particular service are able to find the service that is right for them.
If that were not the case, why else would Sensis themselves go to the trouble of placing an ad right at the front of ‘Pregnancy Counselling & Related Services’ in every edition of the yellow pages published this year throughout Australia that says:
We recommend that you fully understand the type of service each organisation offers before you contact them.
How are we meant to understand the full type of service that each organisation offers when they published ads like the one I have mentioned:
Are you pregnant? Alone? Need someone to talk to?
How are we to get an understanding from that ad that this service automatically dismisses one of the only three options available to young women? It is deceptive, but there is nothing we can do about it. Even if some of the other speakers in this debate do not agree with my view on that, it would seem Sensis themselves actually do.
To pretend that there are providers out there who try to trick women out of continuing with their pregnancy, as has been alluded to by Senator Fielding, is an absolute nonsense. To imply that there are only two kinds of provider—one that pushes abortion, and one that pushes pregnancy—is ridiculous and offensive to providers on all sides of the debate. Indeed, there are quite clear ads in the Perth yellow pages from providers that actually do provide abortion. Those ads are very clear. They say they will refer. Some of them do not actually advertise in the counselling section; they advertise in the abortion section—unlike what Senator Fielding was alluding to—because they actually provide the service.
In coming to this debate, we must separate our own very personal views about abortion from the issue at hand. The issue at hand is the need of pregnant women to be provided with a supportive environment that respects their decision-making abilities. That is all we are asking for today—for respect for decision making and open and transparent advertising by those that advertise those services.
It is a pity Senator Fielding is not still here. During his contribution earlier I was saying to someone that I did not actually recall Senator Fielding being at all of the committee hearings into the first draft of this legislation. So it is interesting that he has a view about the conduct of the entire inquiry and how it was carried out. I will concede that from time to time things did get a little bit heated—on both sides of the debate; not just in what people perceive as my side or Senator Fielding’s side. Sometimes they did get a little heated and I did not envy the job of the chair in dealing with those issues. But I do not recall him being there for all of the hearings—
—He was there for some of them.
—He was there for some of them, indeed, Senator Barnett. But some of us on this side are getting a little tired of Senator Fielding coming in and quoting committee reports as if he was an integral part of all inquiries when in fact we rarely see him at them. A year or so on it does get a little bit hard to bear.
I recall the Festival of Light in Adelaide getting very defensive about the services they offer, because they do provide some of the advice I was alluding to earlier. One of the things I do agree with Senator Fielding on is some of the evidence given by the Caroline Chisholm Centre. I would urge all service providers, including those from Pregnancy Help Line, to look at their recommendation that all counsellors should be trained professionals registered with their relevant professional body. That may be a way out of this. It may be a way of ensuring that we deliver a truly professional standard of counselling.
That was in evidence given by the Caroline Chisholm Centre, and it is something that I agree with. To do that, of course, those services would have to be government funded or they would have to charge for their services, because there are not many professionals of that calibre who are prepared to operate a 24 hours a day, seven days a week phone line free of charge. Having said that, when the Caroline Chisholm Centre raised that as an issue, the Festival of Light—in Adelaide in particular—did not like that idea. They did not like the idea that they may actually be compelled to use professional counsellors who are registered with their relevant professional body—counsellors who have recognised tertiary qualifications in how to provide non-judgmental, non-directive counselling, as would be implied by an ad that says:
Are you pregnant? Alone? Need someone to talk to?
People like the Festival of Light do not like that idea at all. Why would you not want to use professional counsellors? Why would you not want to use professionals? Why would you not agree, if you refuse to discuss one of the three options and refer to one of the three options, to advertise accordingly? People like me are left to draw one particular conclusion—because you do want to mislead and because you do want to manipulate vulnerable women, particularly young women, into phoning your service to then try to guide or coerce them into a decision that you as someone who has never met them before in your life judge to be in their best interest. It is not my job to judge what is in their best interest and it is certainly not the job of some of these people volunteering on some of those counselling lines. It is our job in this place to ensure that people do not mislead or deceive and that we do have an open and transparent process.
The only protection these services have at the moment is that no-one pays, and because no-one pays they can get away with an awful lot of bad behaviour. If it were a commercial transaction they would find themselves in court very quickly. Imagine if these people were offering to sell you something and then they said, ‘We only want to sell you two-thirds of it but not the other third.’ It is deceptive, it is misleading, and it is exploiting some vulnerable women at a very vulnerable stage in their lives. It is our role as legislators to separate our personal views on termination from the issue at hand, as it was our role when we discussed the RU486 bill to separate our views on termination and unplanned pregnancies from the way drugs are treated in an administrative process of access and who is best able to determine safety. It is inconceivable to me that anyone could object to such a simple notion as transparent advertising for counselling services.
Debate interrupted.
 (Senator Watson)—Order! The time allotted for this debate having expired—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I seek leave to record my opposition to the bill.
—Senator Barnett, there has not been a vote. There being no vote I am not sure there is a process for you to record your opposition. The time for the debate has expired.
—Yes, I appreciate that, but I would like to put it on the record that I oppose the bill. I am not voting on the bill but I am recording my opposition. I know there are others who would like to do the same.
—Senator Barnett, your opposition is already on the record. Because the time has expired, you do not have a right to speak.",SENATE,<title>PREGNANCY COUNSELLING (TRUTH IN ADVERTISING) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,37,1
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2007-06-14,"—I would like to refer to the Commonwealth Grants Commission Report on state revenue sharing relativities: 2007 update and its relevance to Tasmania—specifically, the considerable benefits that Tasmania is now receiving as a result of the windfall gains of GST revenue. I want to put it on the record that this report makes it very clear, and the federal budget statements make it very clear—as indeed the Tasmanian budget statements make it very clear—that in this financial year the Tasmanian government will receive a windfall gain of $117 million in the 2007-08 year. That will give the state government an opportunity to axe state business taxes, as was agreed back in 1999. It would also provide the opportunity for the state government to do other things. For example, it could fund 3,500 jobs. It could build six new high schools in Tasmania. We have had a debate in the last day or so about the number of schools that are about to be closed by the state government. It could build 12 new district hospitals. It could buy 805 new ambulances. It could build 483 housing division homes. The GST revenue windfall gain to Tasmania makes it very clear that the state government has a responsibility to the Tasmanian people to use that money wisely, either in cutting taxes or ensuring that essential services are provided, particularly in the areas of health, education, police and so on.
In terms of the ongoing windfall gain, I want to make it clear that the GST windfall from 2003 to 2011 is humungous in size. In 2003-04 it was a $69.5 million windfall gain; in 2004-05, $106.1 million; in 2005-06, $102.2 million; and in 2006-07, $109 million. In 2007-08, it will be $117 million, as I have just indicated; in 2008-09, $131 million; in 2009-10, $140 million; increasing to a $152 million windfall gain in 2010-11. They are very significant numbers. So during that time the estimated GST windfall gain to the Tasmanian government is $927 million more than it would have received under the old tax system—the old tax system that federal Labor supported, the system that the state Labor government supported. They opposed tooth and nail the GST and the introduction of tax reform in and around 2000. The government moved ahead, with good economic management, which is a symbol of this government, and introduced these tax reforms—and what has happened? You have seen the windfall gains to Tasmania. That is approaching $1 billion by 2011. That is a huge amount of money.
So what has that tax reform actually done? At the federal level the tax reform ordered by the Howard government to make way for the GST has reduced or abolished the wholesale sales tax; income tax has been reduced, with 80 per cent of the population now on a 30 per cent marginal rate or less; company tax has reduced; and capital gains tax has reduced. At the state level the financial institutions duty has been abolished, the debits duty has been abolished, the various stamp duties have been abolished—but there is lot more to come. There is a lot more for the state government to do with the rivers of gold that they have in GST dollars flowing into the state of Tasmania—and, indeed, into all of the states of our great country, Australia.
The state government payroll tax is a tax on jobs. This is a particularly iniquitous tax. Tasmania has been benefiting from that tax significantly. That revenue increase in the 2003-04 year to the 2006-07 year was 34.6 per cent. So they should use the GST windfall to start phasing out this anti-jobs tax, in my view. This report makes it clear that the rivers of gold are flowing deep and fast into Tasmania with GST dollars. It is up to the state government to use those dollars wisely. (Time expired)

Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Commonwealth Grants Commission</title>,Documents,38,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-06-14,"—I would like to speak to this report, the environment committee’s report Conserving Australia: Australia’s national parks, conservation reserves and marine protected areas. It is quite a substantial report, 350 pages, and has 18 recommendations. It is a report I feel has not received adequate attention. Unfortunately, it was tabled out of session; it did not get significant debate in the Senate. It contains a lot of important recommendations. All bar one of the recommendations is unanimously supported by the committee across the board, and that to me reinforces the value of those recommendations.
The first thing I want to point out—and it flows on from my comments this afternoon about the disgraceful tardiness of the government in responding to committee reports like this one; a substantial piece of work—is that two of the recommendations contained in this report relate to the government not yet responding to the report from the same committee from 2004 about invasive species. There were mountains of evidence given to this inquiry about the significant impact of invasive species, weeds and the like, escaped aquarium fish and other things causing immense environmental impact as well as economic harm throughout the country, including in protected areas. Frankly, the government cannot pretend it is being serious about this when it is yet to provide a formal response to a comprehensive Senate committee report into just that issue from three years ago.
Another recommendation I want to emphasise is the final one, which requested the Commonwealth to consider substantially increasing funding for World Heritage areas. One of the problems in this area, as with many, is that you have all the finger-pointing about how much the feds should put in and how much the states should put in. The committee tried to stay out of that argument. It recognises that national parks in general are predominantly a state matter, but clearly World Heritage areas do entail a federal responsibility. Of course there is direct responsibility under the federal environment protection act, which the Democrats were pivotal in strengthening and passing in 1999, but we have not had consistent regular funding around World Heritage areas from a federal level.
One example of this is the wet tropics World Heritage area, which covers from the Daintree, past Cairns, south down to Cardwell and almost to Townsville. It is an incredibly important area with massive biodiversity. The committee had the privilege of flying over part of that area to Mission Beach, where there are significant risks with continuing development that is threatening the survival of cassowary in the region. We visited Mossman Gorge, which is featured in this report, which is under significant pressure from visitation but which also has significant opportunities for engagement with local Indigenous people. But the lack of certainty and the inadequacy of funding for the Wet Tropics Management Authority, which is doing such very important work in that area, is holding back the potential of what that area can deliver. It is putting at risk the World Heritage values of the wet tropics World Heritage area. It is holding back the potential for major engagement of Indigenous communities. Eighteen different Indigenous tribal groups have come together and formed a regional agreement under the Aboriginal Rainforest Council, including with the Wet Tropic Management Authority, and there is some amazing potential for properly integrating the continuing cultural reality of the wet tropics area with the biodiversity—the ecological values—but it is being held back because the resourcing is not there. It is a clear area where the federal government can do more and it would deliver great benefits.
I link to that the recommendation about endorsing a recent report, the Gilligan report, which also recommended substantially increased funding for Indigenous protected areas. These not only help strengthen the ecological values of many areas but provide employment opportunities and meaningful connection to country and tap into the immense knowledge that Indigenous people have in land management.
The other recommendation I want to stress goes to that point: recommending that all governments give greater priority to Indigenous knowledge and participation in park management. As a nation we have grossly undervalued the immense knowledge that is there and continues to be there with the traditional owners and other Indigenous people in managing country. The reason so many of these areas still have great ecological values is that they were managed by Indigenous people in a way that enables them to remain sustainable. That is a very important recommendation and I urge all governments to do more.
I note the Queensland government has moved down that path—finally. In evidence given to the committee in Cairns, the Cape York Land Council and others expressed a lot of frustration at the inability of Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service to enable proper engagement of Indigenous people with management of national park areas. I was pleased to see just recently an announcement by the state government that legislation has been introduced that will finally enable joint management of national park areas under Indigenous land use agreements with Indigenous people in the Cape York area. That is a very positive thing. I was speaking on this in the Senate yesterday; I would like to touch a little bit further on the point I was making then. One of the hurdles and frustrations in that area goes back to protected areas having an effect of locking out or disempowering traditional owners and Indigenous people. It is clearly part of the frustration that occurred recently in the north over the wild rivers legislation, but that has also been addressed as part of the agreement. I note that Noel Pearson has said that the wild rivers legislation will be amended to protect native title rights and interests and to provide for mandatory water allocations for Indigenous communities in each of the catchments on the cape affected by the wild rivers declaration. This is an important and positive step.
It had been a source of great tension between some Cape York Indigenous people, including Noel Pearson, and the Wilderness Society. I have been critical of the Wilderness Society in the past, and I have certainly been critical of environmentalists who undervalue the immense knowledge that Indigenous people have. I spoke in this place last year criticising William Lines, an environmentalist who I should say is not directly associated with the Wilderness Society. He was quite derogatory in denying the reality of Indigenous involvement and knowledge in managing country. We need to be encouraging more people in the environment movement to recognise this reality, and that is why I would repeat my call to those on the cape, now this issue has been resolved, to back away from further criticisms with regard to particular individuals in the Wilderness Society who have been singled out. Lyndon Schneiders and Anthony Esposito are two environmentalists who I believe have done more than most to try to work with and engage with Indigenous people and to ensure their expertise is recognised and that employment opportunities are produced from that. It sends a dangerous message to the wider environment movement if they see some of those who have done the most over the years being singled out and attacked. We can all criticise, and I have done that myself; it is time now to work constructively. I think the opportunities are there to do that, and we really need to try to focus on that. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

I take them in the spirit in which you have presented them, and I acknowledge that has been the private position that you have held. However, I draw to your attention the commitment that the department gave to have this material provided on the day of the estimates hearing, not the day of return for answers to questions taken on notice. It was my understanding that I would have that information provided to me. It is not an extensive question; it is a percentage figure. The answer I am seeking is the official calculation of the percentage increase by this government for non-government schools—just as the officials have announced that they have provided that information to the government for government schools. So it is on that basis. I was advised, and I was clearly under the impression, that the information would be provided on the day of the estimates hearing. I asked questions several times to that effect, so that I could have no misunderstanding about that. So it is not a question of waiting until the relevant time. If the information is available, I seek from you an assurance that it will be delivered to me immediately.",SENATE,<title>SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE (LEARNING TOGETHER—ACHIEVEMENT THROUGH CHOICE AND OPPORTUNITY) AMENDMENT (2007 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,41,1
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2007-06-14,"—Senator Carr, I am not in a position to give you the assurance that it will be delivered to you immediately. Senator Carr, may I say—and I think you know this—that, since I have been a minister, I have taken a very punctilious view about the obligations of the government to respond to questions properly put and taken on notice by departments in estimates. I am of the view that the government has obligations to the parliament, which, in particular, means obligations to the opposition, and that this process would be made a nonsense of unless those obligations were discharged. I do not think you doubt my good faith about this, Senator Carr. You have me at a disadvantage. I do not recollect the particular question and I do not recollect the particular undertaking, but, if you say so, Senator Carr, I of course take you at your word. If the undertaking was given that the information would be provided that day then it ought to have been provided on that day, and you are entitled to expect that the public servants would have used their best endeavours to get it to you. All I can tell you is that my advice is that the information has been assembled. Obviously, it was not provided to you on the day, and there may well have been very good reasons why it was not able to be provided to you on the day. However, I am told that your information has been assembled, that it is being checked and that it will be provided as soon as that has been done.",SENATE,<title>SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE (LEARNING TOGETHER—ACHIEVEMENT THROUGH CHOICE AND OPPORTUNITY) AMENDMENT (2007 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,41,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2007-06-14,"—I appreciate the answer. If the information is provided to me as soon as it has been checked, I will be more than happy. I am concerned that it not be dragged out, because there is an unfortunate record here of a very large number of questions from this department not being provided to the committee within the designated time. At the last estimates, I had to go through the situation where material was provided to me on the day of the estimates or the day before the estimates, which was well in excess of the time that had been allotted for the return of questions on notice. In this particular case, I have absolutely no doubt that Mr Burmester gave me those undertakings. I checked this on several occasions, and I was told on several occasions that the officers were still working on it. I would have thought, given that I am not unknown to the officers, that if there had been a problem I would have been advised of it.
I have taken this opportunity to draw the minister’s attention to this difficulty and to draw to the attention of the departmental officers that I am not going to be taken for granted in this way. I do not think the opposition should be treated in this way. We are entitled to information. This is a very simple request. I take your commitment on the basis on which it has been offered. If that information is provided to me as soon as it is available, I will be only too grateful.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2007-06-14,"—I rise to speak on the Evidence Amendment (Journalists’ Privilege) Bill 2007. This bill represents a quick fix for the Howard government. It moves to provide a form of professional privilege in the Evidence Act 1995 for the purpose of protecting journalists who refuse to name their sources. There are two main reasons why this bill is being pursued by the government at this time. The first reason is that it is an attempt to pacify the recently formed coalition of media interests under the banner of the Australia’s Right to Know campaign. The second reason is to take the heat out of the Harvey and McManus case in time for the upcoming election. I will make a few remarks on these reasons in my concluding remarks this evening, but, firstly, I will take the Senate through the detail of the bill.
The bill is modelled on division 1A of the New South Wales Evidence Act 1995, but it differs in that, whereas the New South Wales act proposes a general scheme of protected confidence, this bill, as its title suggests, is more limited in its application. The division title of the proposed new 1A in the bill is the same as that in the New South Wales Evidence Act—that is, professional confidential relationship privilege. However, when this definition of protected confidence in the proposed section 126A is compared with the New South Wales act, we see that it is vastly different. In the bill before us, the definition is exclusive to journalists; whereas, in the New South Wales act, the definition relates exclusively to conduct. While the New South Wales example would allow other professions to access privilege, the definition in this bill sets up a system of protected confidentiality whereby only journalists, otherwise called ‘confidants’ in the proposed division, may be entitled to a form of qualified privilege if they are communicating in confidence while (a) acting in a professional capacity and (b) acting under an express or implied obligation not to disclose the contents of the communication.
Proposed section 126B provides the means by which courts may exclude evidence derived of a protected confidence. Subsection (1) provides that the evidence may not be adduced where it would disclose the protected confidence, the contents of a protected confidence or protected identity information. Subsection (2) provides that this exclusion may occur via application of a party to the proceedings or via the presiding officer’s own initiative. Subsection (3) removes the application of judicial discretion and directs that the evidence must be excluded where harm would occur to a protected confider—in that instance, it would be journalist—and where the nature and extent of the harm outweighs the value of the evidence to be adduced. Subsection (4) provides a non-exhaustive list of factors the court must take into account in weighing the potential harm to the journalist against the potential value of the evidence, but also directs that a presiding officer must give greatest weight to any risk of prejudice to national security. Subsection (5) of the bill provides that whatever its decision on whether to adduce the evidence, the court must state reasons for its decision.
It is interesting to note that the key diversion from the New South Wales template is the removal of discretion in consideration of national security information. In the bill before us this evening, section 126B(4), which I have just gone to, sets out the factors which must be taken into account by the court when deciding whether or not to exclude the evidence. It states that the courts must take into account and give the greatest weight to any risk of prejudice to national security. The criteria does not appear in the corresponding list in the New South Wales act. This may be a reflection of the differing responsibilities of our respective levels of government.
So we see that the application of the qualified privilege comes down, to a large part, to judicial discretion. There has been some comment that judicial discretion is undesirable and that journalists should be afforded some type of absolute privilege merely by claiming it. Of course, absolute privilege simply does not exist for lawyers, politicians, priests, doctors or any of the other professions; they are all subject to elements of judicial discretion. Judicial discretion in these matters is not something to be anxious about; it is to be desired. The parliament is best placed to provide a framework as, in constructing rules, we cannot foresee all things and all circumstances, and that is why these matters are best weighed in each instance on the facts of the case itself.
Proposed section 126C provides for a loss of qualified privilege when the journalist consents to the evidence being adduced. Proposed section 126D provides for the loss of privilege in circumstances of misconduct in the form of fraud, a criminal offence or an act which is liable to a civil penalty. If the journalist was involved in such misconduct, the court may decide that the privilege was not available. According to the government, however, the clear intention of this legislation is to introduce a privilege which provides the court with a guided discretion to balance the competing public interests of the freedom of the press with the public interest of disclosure of that information.
Again, it will be up to the courts to make the decision. In some circumstances, unlawfully receiving national security information is, in itself, an offence. The court will have to weigh the value of granting qualified privilege with the value of ensuring our national security.
Proposed section 126E provides that the court may make various orders to protect the safety and welfare of the protected confider, short of refusing the privilege. These include media suppression orders and orders that certain information be heard in camera.
Proposed section 126F provides that the cases that are currently before the court will not enjoy the protection of this section, but a protected confidence which occurs before the act comes into force may be covered. This is a sensible approach.
The rest of the proposed bill, in essence, is of a minor technical or consequential nature, so I will not dwell on it here this evening—although I may have more time than I had considered, so I will go to some of the comment about it. Labor’s view on the bill is that it is welcome but insufficient. The Australian Law Reform Commission 2005 review of the uniform evidence law report, report No. 102, did recommend protection for journalists. It is worthwhile taking the Senate to it this evening. It said:
Since the publication of DP 69, the issue of protection of journalists’ sources has received significant media attention. Under the common law, courts have consistently refused to grant journalists a privilege or lawful excuse under which they can refuse to reveal their sources. The journalists’ code of ethics prohibits a journalist from revealing a source once a commitment to confidentiality has been made. At the time of writing, legal proceedings had commenced against two Herald Sun journalists for protecting the source of leaked government documents regarding changes to veterans entitlements. The Attorney-General of Victoria has indicated his support for a uniform national approach to journalists’ sources. The Australian Government Attorney-General has also announced that the issue would be considered by the Government.
At the recent national conference, the national platform of the Australian Labor Party was amended to include the following: Labor will legislate for proper freedom of information laws that enable Australians to access appropriate information about government activities, move to implement the ALRC recommendations on sedition laws, provide shield laws for protecting confidential sources and whistleblowers, and review laws that criminalise reporting of matters of public interest.
This is where we come to the heart of the matter. The Howard government is not genuinely committed to bringing about an open or transparent government. It is for this reason that it spends hundreds of thousands of dollars chasing leaks that have not detracted from good governance or national security but have, in fact, enhanced it. The two journalists that the ALRC report referred to are Gerard McManus and Michael Harvey. The bill will not help their case by directly changing the substantive law that applies. Neither is it retrospective in that sense nor does it seek to override the Victorian Evidence Act. What it might do is send a message to the courts of the Commonwealth parliament’s clear intention in relation to journalists’ privilege—that is, to recognise its existence. On that basis the Attorney-General, is seems, has given an assurance in revisiting this area with further legislation.
As it said at the outset, Labor supports this bill despite the fact that it is clearly less than ideal. The Howard government stands condemned that it did not act earlier; it did not act until this time, and it stands further condemned for the piecemeal nature of reform that this bill represents.
It is simply not good enough to blame the states. Some states and territories have whistleblower protection legislation in place. Some have professional privilege in place. As Mr Ruddock well knows, there is nothing to stop a parliament legislating within its jurisdictional competence to protect the rights and freedoms of Australians, especially with regard to transparency of government, the free flow of information or other related matters.
Be clear: this government is no friend of Australia’s right to know and no friend of anyone who desires freedom of information or transparent government. No other federal government has done more to clamp down on the flow of information, whether it be collapsing of government media units into the minister’s office; the direction of the AFP for the purpose of conducting fruitless but intimidatory raids against public servants; the crackdown on whistleblowers like Alan Kessing, who exposed the massive security failures of the Howard government at airports, despite all its talk of national security since September 11; the directives to public servants at Senate estimates not to answer questions about the channelling of $300 million to Saddam Hussein; the slack and tardy way that ministers like Mr Joe Hockey answer questions on notice that have been put on the record, if, indeed, he answers them at all; the explosion in government entitlements, staffing and blatant political advertising in order to maximise the benefits of incumbency and the gigantic Liberal Party spin machine; the abuse of its control in the Senate; or the effective neutering of freedom of information legislation. This is a tired and arrogant government that does not enjoy scrutiny at all.
As I have said, Labor will support this bill to send a clear and unambiguous message of the parliament’s will. But we expect this area to be revisited before the election so that reform to the Evidence Act may be considered more broadly. With those remarks, I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>EVIDENCE AMENDMENT (JOURNALISTS’ PRIVILEGE) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,43,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2007-06-14,"—A free press is fundamental to a free society. When cities first began, democracy relied on the debate and argument that occurred in the Greek marketplace, where information was shared, ideas were aired and discussed. Now the marketplace of ideas is much bigger, and a free media is fundamental to our modern conceptions of democracy. Indeed, Thomas Carlyle argued that what he called the Fourth Estate can be conceived as democracy itself because it allows the people to debate and discuss the affairs of state. For a long time a free press has been an essential part of Australia’s democracy.
In 1824, in my state of New South Wales, the first Australian born politician, William Charles Wentworth, founded one of Australia’s first independent newspapers, the Australian. The birth of a free press was a breath of fresh air to the colonies, which had been weighed down by almost 40 years of government control and censorship. While there is much to criticise about today’s media, not least the monopoly of its ownership, the Greens believe the newspapers, now joined by the internet, television and radio, still form the backbone of our democratic processes. That is why we share the concerns of most of the Australian media outlets and much of the Australian public about the direction of media and public freedom in this country. Ten years of the Howard government have put a clamp on free speech and the public’s right to know about the workings of government. Policy has been replaced by spin, substance by rhetoric, and the cold hand of censorship is on the march again. Sydney journalist David Marr describes it this way:
John Howard has the loudest voice in Australia. He has cowed his critics, muffled the press, intimidated the ABC, gagged scientists, silenced NGOs, censored the arts, prosecuted leaders, criminalised protest and curtailed parliamentary scrutiny.
Australia’s Right to Know, a coalition of Australia’s major media outlets, say:
Australia risks undermining one of its main pillars of democracy if erosions to free speech continue.
They say this is a bipartisan problem of ‘national importance regardless of who is in power’ and that the problem is longstanding, with both ‘Labor and the coalition governments at state and federal levels presiding over a serious deterioration in the freedoms we take for granted’. They describe it this way:
There has been an alarming slide into censorship and secrecy that has severely reduced what ordinary Australians are allowed to know about how they are governed and how justice is dispensed.
They say there are more than 500 separate prohibitions governing the things that Australians are not allowed to know. These laws and restrictions vary from state to state, making it hard for the media to report.
The government would like to claim that the Evidence Amendment (Journalists’ Privilege) Bill 2007 bucks this trend. They claim that the bill seeks to protect journalists and their sources. In fact it does nothing of the sort; rather this bill is further window-dressing of the government’s attack on free speech in this country. This bill does the bare minimum that could be done to protect journalists’ sources. It does not afford any protection to whistleblowers. It does not afford any protection to other professionals and their sources. It does not recognise the public interest in ensuring journalists’ sources are kept confidential and, once again, it drops the veil of national security over the whole bill, making it the overriding factor in any decision about whether or not a source can be protected.
I will say more on the problem of national security later, but first I want to talk about the inadequate scope of the bill. The bill is based on division 1A of the New South Wales Evidence Act 1995. However, there is a significant difference. This bill only applies to journalists, while the New South Wales bill allows a range of other professionals—doctors and counsellors, for example, and their informants or their clients—to claim protection. This bill explicitly limits protection to journalists and their sources. It is a major flaw in the bill.
There are a range of professionals that should be able to claim these types of protection: medical and health professionals, counsellors and religious advisors. There is no reason why a court could not weigh the balance of the harm caused by revealing a source for these professions against the importance of the evidence or information in the particular proceedings—just as they could in relation to a journalist. But it seems that, because the government wants to deal with a political problem of journalists being prosecuted for contempt, rather than dealing with the policy question it has opted for this narrowly framed bill. In fact, so narrow is the scope of the bill—combined with the limitations and qualifications contained in the bill—that it seems almost certain that journalists, such as Gerard McManus and Michael Harvey, and their sources, would still be prosecuted if this bill were to become law.
Proposed section 126D of the bill provides that when a communication between the source and the journalist involves fraud or an offence, the privilege or protection cannot apply. As a result, public servants, who in most cases would be committing an offence if they carried out an unauthorised disclosure to the media, would not be shielded by these laws, and nor would the journalists involved. In other words, whistleblowers remain out in the cold. Given this incredible inadequacy of the bill one could say, as the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance says, that this bill ‘will amount to nothing more than rhetoric without accompanying protected disclosure laws to prevent whistleblowers from being hunted down and prosecuted’.
Now more than ever there is a profound need for whistleblower protection in this country. Whistleblowers are, and have been, an essential bulwark in the rise of executive power at the expense of democracy, not just in Australia but around the world. Let us recall this important role. Without whistleblowers, the Watergate scandal would never have become public, and Nixon would not have had to resign. Without anonymous sources we would never have learnt about the torture at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. Yet once again the government has dumped the opportunity that this bill could have provided to protect whistleblowers. The Australian Press Council’s Charter for a free press in Australia states:
Freedom of opinion and expression is an inalienable right of a free people.
That right is recognised in article 19 of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. The Press Council’s charter has six principles, and the sixth principle states:
Laws, regulations and practices which in any way restrict or inhibit the right of the press freely to gather and distribute news, views and information are unacceptable unless it can be shown that the public interest is better served by such laws, regulations or practices than the public interest in the people’s right to know.
It is the public interest that should be at the heart of any laws to protect journalists’ sources, and it is the public interest that is missing from this bill.
A court that is examining whether or not a journalist’s source should be protected should be able to assess not only the public interest of the particular case but the wider public interest of a free press that is in part built on the public’s confidence that information provided should remain confidential. That is why the Greens will move an amendment to this legislation to include consideration of the public interest as a factor in a judge’s deliberation on protecting a journalist’s source. The amendment will add an additional item to the proposed section 126B of the Evidence Act that lists the matters a court should consider. The Greens amendments ensure that, in addition to the matters already listed, the court will now also be required to consider ‘the public interest in maintaining the protected confidence of journalists’ sources’. I urge senators to support this amendment.
Irene Khan, Secretary General of Amnesty International, says in this year’s Amnesty report on the state of the world’s human rights that ‘national security has often been used as an excuse by governments to suppress dissent’ and that ‘in recent years heightened fears about terrorism and insecurity have reinforced repression’. The report shows how, around the world, national security has become a catch-all used and abused by governments seeking to justify suppression of political and civil rights, the removal of civil liberties and the abuse of human rights. In this country national security has underpinned the suppression of the truth about David Hicks and Mamdouh Habib and attacks on the rights of refugees. It has been the platform on which a raft of new terrorism laws has been introduced. The Greens have always supported sensible measures like increases to airport security, but the government has gone overboard with laws like new sedition offences, control orders and banning organisations.
One of the worst aspects of the new terrorism laws is the use of national security to suppress government information and create closed trials. The National Security Information (Civil and Criminal Proceedings) Act 2004 allows the Attorney-General to suppress evidence in proceedings, based on a very broad definition of national security. This new bill includes a clause, which is not included in similar state legislation, which will require a judge to use the same definition of national security as in the terrorism laws, when assessing whether to protect a journalist’s sources. This clause goes to the heart of the failure of this bill because it clearly would not protect whistleblowers such as those who are in fact acting in the public interest by revealing major flaws in Australia’s airport security. Worst of all, it requires a judge to give the ‘greatest weight’ to national security when deciding whether the protection should be maintained. The Greens will move an amendment to remove this bias in the bill towards national security. We accept that national security is a factor that a judge should consider in assessing the necessity of protecting journalists’ sources, but it should not be the overriding factor, and I urge senators to support this amendment.
This bill is extremely flawed. It has been rushed in as a political fix for the very public criticisms levelled by media outlets and concern amongst journalists about the prosecution of their colleagues. There are other models that could have been looked at, like that in New South Wales, in its entirety, and the New Zealand model, which offers much more robust protection, with protection of a source the default position from which a case has to be argued to vary. It should have been part of a package of reform that also protected whistleblowers. The fact that the government has refused to allow a Senate inquiry into this bill has prevented the parliament from being able to examine these other options. The government has again wasted an opportunity to improve the framework for public debate and free discussion in Australian society. Once again, while paying lip-service to freedom, it has done the opposite, relying on spin rather than substance. And, once again, freedom of the press has taken a back seat to the government’s political ambitions.",SENATE,<title>EVIDENCE AMENDMENT (JOURNALISTS’ PRIVILEGE) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,43,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2007-06-14,"—I rise to speak on behalf of the Australian Democrats to the Evidence Amendment (Journalists’ Privilege) Bill 2007. As we have heard, this bill seeks to amend the Commonwealth Evidence Act 1995 and various other acts so that journalists’ sources are given some protection from discovery in federal legal proceedings, either in court or in out-of-court matters. This is a qualified privilege. The court has discretion to grant the privilege based on a number of matters. The court must consider freedom of press—association—and the public’s right to know. The law is said to be based on a New South Wales model, albeit with one modification: the court must give greatest weight to the risk of prejudice to national security. Privilege can also be obtained on behalf of a child. It will not apply to situations where legal professional privilege already applies or where there is misconduct between the journalist and his or her source, nor will it apply to matters related to James Hardie or the Proceeds of Crime Act.
As we are all too familiar with, the true reason behind this legislation—which the Democrats consider has aspects which are somewhat ill-considered, shall we say—is the enormous media pressure stemming from the case of Michael Harvey and Gerard McManus, which has already been referred to. I suspect that some sceptics among us may simply view this legislation as the government trying to solve a potentially embarrassing problem.
As honourable senators would be aware, for as long as the Democrats have been around we have desired open and transparent government at all levels and also government guarantees of freedom of the press, freedom of speech, free media, independent institutions and an informed and educated population. So it is worth noting that the issue raised by the bill is of fundamental importance to the Australian community, from the perspective of both the administration of justice, which dictates that a witness must generally answer all questions put to him or her—obviously, this is how a court obtains and weighs evidence—and freedom of speech and press.
We do not oppose the establishment of laws which aim to improve Australians’ participation in democratic processes. Indeed, the Democrats have put on record a number of ideas, policy suggestions and private members’ bills that deal with the issue of reform in these areas. We have called for greater protection in the area of Australian privacy rights and the revocation of the sedition laws. We drafted the Parliamentary Charter of Rights and Freedoms Bill 2001, relating to freedom of association and the press, which is a fundamental right. We have put whistleblower legislation on record. The Public Interest Disclosure (Protection of Whistleblowers) Bill, which I think Senator Murray, coincidentally, tabled this week, supports the role of public servants as well as MPs and journalists with an open, transparent and accountable government. So our record on this is pretty clear.
We would argue that such measures, if introduced, would counter some of the negative press that we have seen on this government in recent months. I note that in Senator Nettle’s comments to the chamber she referred to a litany of encroachments on freedom in Australia today, including, arguably, press freedom. Negative reactions include the annual press freedom report commissioned by the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance titled Official spin: censorship and control of the Australian press 2007. This report lists 19 areas in which the media’s ability to report freely has been constricted. It highlights restrictions caused by policymaking, law enforcement, government comments and public actions. In relation to the issue of journalists’ privilege, generally the Democrats support the rights, powers and immunities that will flow from the creation of a new privilege for journalists.
But, far from being uncontroversial, there are several aspects of the legislation before us which clearly demand attention. It is unfortunate too that the scrutiny and analysis of the legislation before us is occurring tonight on the floor of the Senate, albeit with a committee stage to follow, and not within the auspices of a Senate committee. As you may know, Mr Acting Deputy President, I attempted to refer this matter when it came to Selection of Bills. I wanted to refer this legislation to a Senate committee. That attempt was rejected by the government, and I understand that the Labor Party have argued that they would prefer to wait to see the next bill in this series before considering a committee. I want to put on record the Democrats’ concern that, once again, an attempt to refer legislation, with good reason, to a committee has been thwarted by this government. I have become used to death by committee in this government, where the government automatically refers legislation with minimal analysis and scrutiny and a time frame that is usually quite constricted. This is a case where the Democrats were actually prevented from referring a bill to a Senate committee, namely the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs.
We are concerned that the journalist shield laws’ focus is too narrow in this bill. Missing from its protection are other professionals who handle confidential or sensitive information and, as have been referred to, potential whistleblowers who, in good faith and acting in the public interest, may turn to a journalist to reveal corrupt or inappropriate conduct on the part of public servants—individuals who, like journalists, are faced with a daily ethical dilemma about whether to disclose information obtained in confidence.
In relation to the absence of protection for other professionals, it is generally accepted that confidentiality and privilege issues arise in relation to doctors, social workers, counsellors and priests, among others. In my home state of South Australia at the moment, health professionals are grappling with quite a difficult public health and legal policy issue that arises from the provision of counselling services to people living with HIV. While I note, as foreshadowed in the Attorney-General’s second reading contribution, that this bill is part of a wider legislative reform agenda, a decision by the government not to include these professionals in this scheme today is of great concern to the Australian Democrats. The decision to exclude priests, doctors and others also apparently sits uncomfortably—certainly according to the Sydney Morning Herald—with the New South Wales Attorney General, who has accused Mr Ruddock of going back on an agreement to extend the protections to people other than journalists.
In light of such criticism, the Democrats urge the government not to delay in any way bringing to parliament or releasing for public comment—for example, as an exposure draft—its second proposal. I think that should be done with alacrity. These issues are of grave importance to the community as a whole and need to be finalised quickly. It is unfortunate that the government has not seen sense in introducing the measures as part of a single package. I hope that this decision will not compromise state government cooperation in working towards uniform evidence laws across the country.
As for the absence of protection for whistleblowers, how appropriate that we should be debating this bill in the Senate in the week that Allan Kessing is to be sentenced—and I know that this was referred to in the original contribution by Senator Ludwig—for breach-ing confidentiality despite having exposed real problems at Australian airports. It is a little coincidental and a bit ironic. It is shameful how the government treats the case of Michael Harvey and Gerard McManus on the one hand and the case of Mr Kessing on the other. It is simply a case of Harvey and McManus being protected under this regime and Mr Kessing not being protected.
The Democrats caution the government that, unless it acts to protect whistleblowers, this law may actually backfire on it; there is the potential for unreliable sources to abuse this qualified privilege and to go to journalists to blow the whistle instead of following a suitable whistleblower protection scheme, which would emphasise escalation steps, if you like. This is just further evidence as to why we desperately need a private member’s bill or, indeed, a government initiated bill on whistleblowers and protected disclosures. We also echo the concern that has been stated by the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance that the bill risks ‘amounting to nothing more than rhetoric, without accompanying protected disclosure laws to prevent whistleblowers from being hunted down and prosecuted’.
In addition to these concerns—as you may be aware, Mr Acting Deputy President Barnett—the Parliamentary Library in its Bills Digest has also helpfully identified several aspects of the legislation that are problematic. I think Senator Nettle referred to a couple of these, as did the Labor Party in their contribution. Nonetheless, there is the proposed protection of confidences where they are made in the presence of a third party, if the third party’s presence is necessary to facilitate communication. The problem with that is that ‘third party’, unfortunately and perhaps unhelpfully, is not defined nor explained in the explanatory memorandum. I am happy for the minister to perhaps elaborate or define for the benefit of the Senate what is meant by the terminology ‘third party’.
Secondly—I know that Senator Nettle referred to this in her contribution—proposed section 126D is controversial in that it provides that the protection provided for by the professional confidential relationship privilege will not apply when the information contained in the document itself contains or its communication involves fraud, an offence or an act that renders a person liable to a civil penalty. ‘Fraud’ is defined broadly and again without any protection for whistleblowers. Almost any unauthorised release of information by a Commonwealth public servant may constitute an offence of some sort. Thirdly, the proposed section 4A to be inserted in the JHIPA excludes the application of the professional confidential relationship privilege from a James Hardie proceeding, although this exclusion does not apply to authorised persons—that is, people who have seen the conduct of a James Hardie proceeding.
The Democrats are also concerned about the absence of a clear definition of ‘a journalist’. I am not sure whether in her contribution—which no doubt will follow mine—Senator Wortley will give her view on this particular issue. I note that the explanatory memorandum states merely that ‘a journalist’ is to be given its ordinary-usage meaning. But who and what is a journalist? I am sure that people in the chamber have their views, but I am sure that the minister will articulate his view as well.
There is also an absence of clear guidance as to when a journalist may be acting in their professional capacity, which begs the question: what constitutes professionalism in that instance? Formulating and enforcing a code of ethics and a code of conduct are two characteristics of many occupations which we may regard as professions. While law, medicine and teaching have had their share of adverse publicity, it is true that they are still seen probably as the leading and most attractive occupations because their ethical obligations are clearly spelt out in primary legislation. As to journalists, I note that the Attorney-General in his second reading contribution rightly states that journalists:
... operate under a strict code of ethics which stipulates a clear obligation to keep a source’s confidence.
But different from other professions is the fact that a journalist’s code of ethics is self-imposed. I am not necessarily debating the worth of that or otherwise, but clearly there is a differentiation.
In this proposed bill there is the opportunity for such a code to be enacted in the legislation. The Democrats would welcome seeing reference somewhere in the bill that a journalist acting in their professional capacity is someone who has agreed to be bound by a code of ethics. I am not sure what Senator Wortley’s view of that is. Again, I refer to her because of her former capacity. She may shed some light on this that may benefit the Senate.
A further issue with journalists’ professionalism in this bill is the way the bill also seeks to determine professionalism by reference to the chosen medium in which a journalist may report the news. The explanatory memorandum states that a journalist may sometimes not be acting in their professional capacity—for example, if they blog. The Democrats take issue with this idea of narrowing a journalist’s professionalism in this way. We would suggest that a technology neutral approach to journalism that is more clearly spelt out in the proposed bill would be more appropriate.
It is also unclear what impact, if any, this legislation may have on other areas of the law. Uniform defamation laws were introduced in January 2006 in every state and territory. Presumably, given that this bill establishes a qualified privilege for journalists, it recognises that in the interests of society a journalist should be able to communicate frankly with their source without fear of a defamation action. Of course, a well-known principle of defamation law is that, if a communication is covered by qualified privilege, a plaintiff can only succeed in an action of defamation by showing, in addition to the usual matters which must be proved, that the defendant was motivated by malice in making this statement. I ask the government, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President: has the government assessed the impact of this proposal on defamation law?
Another type of privilege, legal professional privilege—or client legal privilege—has proved to be one of the more common exemption claims under Australian freedom of information laws and has featured in a lot of the reported decisions. As honourable senators may be aware, the current Australian Law Reform Commission inquiry into privilege focuses primarily on the concept as it applies to federal investigatory bodies, but the issues paper recently released gives a comprehensive overview of the concept and raises some important questions about the extent to which privilege should be abrogated and in what circumstances. I have no doubt that this inquiry was prompted by issues raised in the AWB and HIH royal commissions, where there were attempts to claim privilege in order to frustrate investigations. Some of the discussion of privilege in the Australian Law Reform Commission issues paper will be grist for the mill in considering the privilege exemption in the context of this bill.
Equally, another impact which appears to have been overlooked is the protection for disclosures outside courts. Many statutory non-court bodies or administrative bodies have come to play a significant role in the resolution of disputes at the federal and state levels. Although differences in operation vary substantially between these bodies, in some cases the rules of evidence may apply. Even the royal commission process, which might hear evidence of journalists, in most instances will observe court etiquette and the rules of evidence, at least in part.
Senator McGauran, as an example, gained access to a woman’s private hospital records and medical records, despite the patient’s refusal to give her consent to their disclosure and despite her doctor’s refusal to provide the information on the basis of a well-established privilege—doctor-patient privilege—and then used his parliamentary privilege to discuss the case. I believe this did much harm to public confidence. So clearly there are a number of privilege issues that are worthy of discussion in a community context and, particularly in light of this legislation, in the Senate as well. I am sure that there are a number areas of parliamentary privilege—discussions, maybe outbursts, under parliamentary privilege—that are worthy of examination.
Such is the magnitude of the decision before us to enact this bill that, rather than ram it through the Senate, as we are about to do, the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee would again have been the most appropriate place for us to examine some of these outstanding issues in relation to broader issues of privilege, the absence of protection for whistleblowers and some of the other issues that have been raised by me and other members in this place.
I really do not understand—and I am happy for the minister, Senator Johnston, to explain to us—why there was a need to push this through the parliament tonight. I do not understand why agreeing to a reference, even on Wednesday through the selection process, would have unnecessarily delayed such an important piece of legislation. Why was it that we could not explore some of these issues through the committee process—not necessarily a long one? Why couldn’t we have invited members of the community, including the journalist community, to play a role in this debate? (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>EVIDENCE AMENDMENT (JOURNALISTS’ PRIVILEGE) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,43,1
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2007-06-14,"—The Evidence Amendment (Journalists’ Privilege) Bill 2007 is quite an important piece of legislation. By way of introduction, it is also way overdue. Such legislation has been in operation in New South Wales for the best part of 10 years. That begs the question: how serious is this government in implementing these amendments? I ask that question because the policy behind the amendment is about protecting freedom of information in the public interest. Yet, as we know, this policy is anathema to the current government. The Howard government’s hallmark in this area is to stem and control the flow of information and squash or reduce informed public debate. The government is not interested in transparency or in serious accountability. As we have just seen in the Customs portfolio, it is determined to jail anyone who dares to speak out, even if the information revealed by the whistleblower is correct. The threat of the Crimes Act being applied to whistleblowers is now commonplace—
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. With respect to Senator Bishop suggesting that someone in Customs is to be jailed: he is to be sentenced on the 22nd of this month. I would appreciate it if the senator did not mislead the chamber. For his own benefit—I am not carping at him politically—I simply say that I would hate for him to have to come back and correct the record.
 (Senator Moore)—Thank you, Minister. Senator Bishop, in your contribution just be aware of that process.
—On the point of order, if the particular person is to be sentenced, necessarily an option is a period of confinement.
—Senator, I have ruled on the point of order and I have asked you to be aware of the process as you continue with your contribution. Thank you.
—That is why we say that this amendment seems to be an aberration for this government. Nevertheless, putting that contradiction aside, we do not hesitate in saying that this bill before the parliament is welcome. In the interests of free speech and in protecting those brave enough to speak the truth, we welcome the amendment. We particularly welcome it for those in the media. They have been threatened with jail if they print those same facts and refuse to reveal their sources to the thought police from this government. I will not go into the technicalities of the amendment—the minister’s second reading speech has done that adequately—but I will spend time reminding the Senate and those listening about the stupidity which brought this issue to a head.
I addressed the Senate in similar terms in September 2005. Let me for the record reiterate those circumstances. This is especially important because that stimulus was trivial in the extreme. In fact, as a test case for the basic principle of journalistic protection, it is absurd. The circumstances were as follows. The then Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, having procrastinated and stalled on policy for veterans, took recommendations of the Clarke review of veterans entitlements to cabinet. Instead of getting anything like what Clarke recommended—more than $600 million—the minister was rolled in cabinet. She got a touch over $100 million. Anticipating the announcement of her then coup, the PR machine had gone into overdrive. Veterans from across Australia were flown to Canberra for afternoon tea and cream cakes with the minister. They assembled for the planned announcement, straight after the government party room endorsed the package. Draft media releases for the minister, backbenchers and senators were drafted and printed. Fact sheets and questions and answers were also prepared. All were distributed around the DVA state network, in every state, for a coordinated splash. It was to be the peak of the minister’s career—and properly and rightfully so, had she been successful: the crowning glory of three years of doing little but cutting ribbons and handing out badges. But tragedy struck that morning.
The party room rolled the minister, the Prime Minister and the cabinet. They said it was not good enough, and veterans would not be happy, and they were absolutely right at that time. As a consequence, the PR machine was shut down. The veterans’ representatives were sent home without their cream cakes and the minister was sent back to try another set of proposals. Immediately after the party room revolt, details of the rejected package were revealed. Later media reports gave most of the detail. This was sourced to numerous backbenchers. They were proud of their nerve, and seeking credit for their rebellion. The humiliation of the minister began. She wore the shame of an incompetent cabinet decision—her grand parade had been rained upon in torrents. But there was more. The PR material, now on the public record, was junked. One set of that junk found its way to the Herald Sun. Of course, all the detail was revealed. More humiliation. No doubt the minister was enraged and, after counsel from those obsessed with secrecy, the witch-hunt began.
The department set off to find the leaker of this three-day-old material, which was already public knowledge. The department, to cover itself, called in the Australian Federal Police, who, by analysis of computerised phone records, identified a suspect. That person was charged under the Crimes Act by the DPP and suspended without pay. This minor misdemeanour, of revealing old information, became a hanging offence. This heinous criminal was to be punished. Dismissal was to be the most likely outcome—a career ruined and retirement plans in shreds. It was not a matter of national security, nor was it concerned with any great matter of government policy—this was a petty offence, barely an offence at all. But it was a serious political error. Hell hath no fury like an incompetent minister shown to be so publicly. The minister’s ego was smashed, her career about to end in ruins. Someone had to pay, with his head set on a pike in front of the Public Service gates for everyone to see and to learn from.
The tale continued to the Victorian County Court. A jury found the accused public servant guilty. Fortunately, the triviality of the offence was recognised. On appeal, the charges were dismissed—common sense at last prevailed. In fact it is a little bit like that Australian short story we all read as kids: John Price’s Bar of Steel, set in convict times. The bar of steel wrongfully possessed by the convict John Price was really a pin—but, by strict definition, an offence to be punished, with a severe lashing. The lesson had to be learned, and what better way of teaching it. Things have not changed since with the current government.
Meanwhile, none of this absurdity matters a tuppeny damn. The journalists who revealed the stale information—already on the public record for three days—refused to reveal their source. For that the court threatened them with a charge of contempt. That carries a penalty of jail. So, what was a trivial issue took on a more serious nature. Commentators, journalists and editors were all concerned. There have been far more important and high-profile leaks, including, many years ago, an entire annual budget, but to threaten the journalist concerned with contempt and jail was sensibly not pursued. So we say this bill is a useful circuit-breaker.
It is to be noted that this protection for the media, as Senator Stott Despoja outlined, is not absolute. The criteria set out to achieve that protection are clear, though unfortunately discretionary. There is still a strong public interest provision in the amendment. We say, openly and up front, that none of this should be taken as support for the practice of leaking information, but there needs to be balance, especially when other means of obtaining public information are strictly curtailed, as they presently are in Australia.
We all know that as a practice, illegal or otherwise, leaking works. It works as a check against those who transgress good governance and accepted values. It has often worked to reveal corruption, lies and incompetence. Many instances have been referred to in media commentary. The Prime Minister himself—we should acknowledge this—is a past master of grasping the political opportunities that leaking offers. His recent attempts to deny his advertising budget are just one example of his own exposure. Devious and deceitful behaviour is properly abhorrent to all Australians. Leaking is a direct result of that offence being caused to honest people. For the Prime Minister, it is a case of the biter bitten. It simply depends on which direction the information is flowing in and who is in control.
When I last addressed this issue in this place I offered support for the Liberals who might prevail and get this proposal introduced. I congratulate them for prevailing over the forces of darkness. It is therefore pleasing to see this amendment before us today, and we in the opposition are very pleased to be able to support it. If my memory serves me correctly, the minister who is introducing the bill before us today was one of those who were sensibly and critically involved in some of those discussions in 2005. On that note, I close my remarks and thank the minister for his interjection.",SENATE,<title>EVIDENCE AMENDMENT (JOURNALISTS’ PRIVILEGE) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,43,1
"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2007-06-14,"—I rise to speak on the Evidence Amendment (Journalists’ Privilege) Bill 2007. In doing so I indicate my general support for the bill but stress that the bill does not go far enough and that the protection afforded is limited.
This is a bill to amend the Evidence Act 1995 to introduce a new privilege that allows journalists facing trial to refuse to disclose the identity of their sources. It would give the court discretion on the matter, requiring it to exclude evidence where the nature and extent of the likely harm to a protected source outweighs the desirability of the evidence being given. There are, however, several caveats to this which relate to specific instances in which the discretion may not be used. What this bill fails to do is address the issue of legal protection for the journalist’s sources—for whistleblowers and others who provide information to journalists. I would not be overstepping the mark by saying that it is too little and, for some, too late. The reality for anyone with their eyes open is that this is just another example of the Howard government’s approach to legislation in an election year. We have been waiting since 2005 for the Attorney-General to make good on the commitment to pass ‘shield laws’ to protect journalists. Now, two years later, what we have before us is a step in the right direction, but it is not the leap that it could have been and this in itself is disappointing. The absence of protections for public interest disclosures means that we have again missed an opportunity to address inadequacies in our laws. The broader question of protections for whistleblowers and for all professionals with a confidential relationship to their clients remains to be addressed.
This bill has made the legislative agenda because of the plight of two journalists, Michael Harvey and Gerard McManus, who are awaiting sentence for refusing to identify their source for a story that forced the government to abandon their plan to cut war veterans benefits. While these laws will not be retrospective, the Solicitor-General has made representations to the court that the law was in need of reform.
At our national conference, Labor committed to a national platform that includes the following: we would legislate for proper freedom of information laws that enable Australians to access appropriate information about government activities, we would move to implement the Australian Law Reform Commission recommendations on sedition laws, we would provide shield laws for protecting confidential sources and protecting whistleblowers, and we would review those laws that criminalise reporting of matters of public interest.
It has been argued that this bill provides some protection but that it could fail to be effective when journalists were speaking the truth about matters the government did not want revealed. Legal academic Dr Alexander Brown of Griffith University is head of a national project to reform whistleblower laws. He said in relation to the bill that journalists would still be dragged into prosecutions unless the government introduced whistleblower protection laws. The Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance has said that the changes will amount to nothing more than rhetoric without accompanying protected disclosure laws to prevent whistleblowers from being hunted down and prosecuted. The Australian Press Council has also stated that the bill is too general to adequately protect journalists. The media alliance federal secretary and immediate past President of the International Federation of Journalists, Christopher Warren, said:
While journalists’ sources remain unprotected at federal law by anti-corruption body and whistleblower legislation, it is a farce to suggest this bill will in any way address the deplorable state of press freedom in this country.
The Age, while welcoming the new laws, also highlighted concerns in its editorial on 4 June when it wrote:
... the law also contains a glaring deficiency, because it neglects the vital role of whistleblowers who act in the public interest when they go to the media. In debate, Labor rightly lamented the failure of this legislation to protect the source on whom the journalist relies in the first place. That is of particular concern given the zeal with which governments have in recent times pursued whistleblowers, even when the public interest clearly justified bringing to light the information they had. Until that half of the press freedom equation is resolved, Australians’ right to know what their governments are up to will remain compromised.
The media alliance report Official spin: censorship and control of the Australian press 2007 highlights freedom of information, sedition, protection of whistleblowers and shield laws for journalists as areas where press freedom is suffering, and where there is a pressing need for legislative review.
The report also raised the issue that a question on notice in parliament last year revealed that, between 2002 and 2006, there were 53 referrals from Commonwealth government departments and agencies to the Australian Federal Police over ‘unauthorised disclosures of government information’. To quote from that report:
The introduction of laws protecting journalists from prosecution for maintaining the anonymity of their sources is merely nominal if whistleblowers can and will be uncovered and prosecuted by the authorities.
In May this year the Australia’s Right to Know media coalition was formed by a broad cross-section of the media, including the ABC, AAP, News Ltd, SBS, Fairfax and Sky News as well as commercial TV and radio organisations. The coalition announced that court suppression orders, the rejection of freedom of information applications, antiterrorism laws and increased government and police intervention had severely eroded press freedom in recent years. They quoted Reporters Without Borders ranking Australia at No. 35 on its worldwide press freedom index. Shamefully, that is a ranking which puts Australia below Estonia, Bosnia, Bolivia and Ghana in the press freedom index.
The Australia’s Rights to Know coalition has also compiled a list of examples of some current impediments to free speech, including:
The Federal Government has finally agreed to release its 18-month-old polls into what the public think of its WorkChoices law – but not until after the election ...
The Federal Government claimed it was “not in the public interest” to release information on the first home owners’ scheme, including the number of wealthy people fraudulently claiming the $7000 grants under the scheme. A newspaper took the case to the High Court and lost.
It has become almost impossible to get balanced reports from war zones as it has been in the past. Our military will cooperate only with embedded journalists to ensure only the official line is reported.
So, while I speak in support of the Evidence Amendment (Journalist’s Privilege) Bill 2007, I highlight that it does not address many of the reforms necessary to deliver true press freedom in Australia; it is a starting point only. I look forward to the introduction of legislation that addresses areas that have been neglected in this bill, including the adoption of the ALRC recommendations on sedition laws and the introduction of more effective shield laws for protecting confidential sources and whistleblowers.",SENATE,<title>EVIDENCE AMENDMENT (JOURNALISTS’ PRIVILEGE) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,43,1
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2007-06-14,"—I would like to thank senators for their contributions to this debate. The Evidence Amendment (Journalists’ Privilege) Bill 2007 assists to reconcile the legal and ethical obligations of journalists. It does this by amending the Evidence Act to provide for judicial discretion to exclude evidence that would otherwise disclose a journalist’s source. In making these decisions, the court must consider a number of facts, including the nature of the proceeding, the likely harm to the journalist’s source and any implications for national security. The bill provides an appropriate balance between the competing public interests—the public’s right to information and the freedom of the press—and the public’s confidence that judicial decisions are based on relevant information.
The privilege is largely modelled on an existing privilege relating to confidential communications that exists in New South Wales. I cite the New South Wales Evidence Act 1995, which has a comprehensive model that, for the sake of uniformity, has been followed. The Commonwealth agreed to adopt the New South Wales provisions as the appropriate model for that reason. This approach was recommended by the Australian, New South Wales and Victorian law reform commissions following an 18-month review of uniform evidence law.
As the Attorney-General has said, the Australian government’s move to introduce this legislation demonstrates the Commonwealth’s position on this issue. This was necessary, as senators have noted, in light of the proceedings involving two journalists, Gerald McManus and Michael Harvey, currently before a Victorian court. The Commonwealth Solicitor-General made submissions in that case that a judge ought to have discretion to ensure that, in appropriate cases, broader public interest can be taken into account, which might mean that penalties, particularly terms of imprisonment, would not be imposed. As these proceedings are in Victoria, it will be equally important that the Victorian government also demonstrates its commitment by legislating on the issue. I note that senators have conveniently failed to acknowledge that obligation.
I would now like to address some specific concerns raised by senators and dealing with the issue of uniformity. Although this bill applies only to journalists, it is wrong to suggest that the introduction of the bill reneges on the Commonwealth’s commitment to uniform evidence law. The Standing Committee of Attorneys-General is still in the process of finalising the model evidence bill. The working group of officers from the Commonwealth, states and territories is currently considering an expert reference group report and finalising a model for the consideration of the SCAG ministers. The Attorney-General has indicated that he is optimistic that the standing committee will reach agreement soon. The Attorney-General hopes to introduce a second bill to implement the remainder of the government’s response to the Uniform evidence law report.
There are a number of mechanisms already in place to address the issues raised by whistleblowers. The term ‘whistleblower’ should not be used glibly or recklessly when people are breaching their contracts of confidentiality. Governments must be able to conduct their business with a degree of confidentiality.
Federal public servants who report breaches of the Australian Public Service code of conduct for discrimination and victimisation under the Public Service Act are already protected. Similarly, the Commonwealth Ombudsman examines complaints over the actions and decisions of Commonwealth agencies. These mechanisms provide appropriate avenues for public servants to raise issues they are concerned about. It is not always in the public interest that information be disclosed. That is quite a trite statement and obvious. In some instances releasing information may be an infringement of privacy, damage reputations and undermine national security, as I have already mentioned.
It is discouraging that a number of senators have sought to take this debate to areas which range more widely than the issues before the chamber tonight. I see little point in addressing those save to say that, whilst the opposition uses the opportunity of this bill to criticise this government, I note that it supports the bill. It criticises the bill and it criticises the government, yet it has no policy on this matter. On this subject, the opposition has a very clear model to copy—that is, the New South Wales model. As I have said, for the sake of uniformity we have conducted this legislation in line with that model. I note the Greens have amendments here tonight, yet the opposition is prepared to complain and talk about the bill and say that there are things wrong with it and yet they have no amendments. As usual, the opposition is simply conducting a hollow political exercise of carping while having done no real work to address the issues about which they complain.
The bill is a significant amendment to evidence law and I welcome the opposition’s support. I pause to also say, in addressing Senator Stott Despoja’s issues, that the measures contained in the bill will impact on the evidence that may be adduced in any defamation case. However, these amendments to the Evidence Act will not affect the substance of the law that has to be established or proved to the standards required. The bill recognises the important role journalists play in our democracy and the need for journalists to protect their sources. This bill reconciles that need with the need to ensure that all appropriate evidence is before the courts. Accordingly, I commend the bill to the Senate.
Question agreed to.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2007-06-14,"—We are now dealing with the Food Standards Australia New Zealand Amendment Bill 2007. This bill proposes to amend the Food Standards Australia New Zealand Act 1991 in a number of ways. Firstly, it reforms the assessment and consultation process.  The current one-size-fits-all model for assessing different applications and proposals by the Food Standards Australia New Zealand Authority, FSANZ, will be replaced by three different streams so that applications and proposals can be assessed according to their nature and scope.  Secondly, the bill contains amendments to strengthen the alignment of the policy-setting process of the ministerial council and the standard development and approval process of FSANZ. The bill enables FSANZ to suspend consideration of an application for up to 18 months where the council has notified FSANZ that it is developing a policy guideline on the same issue. Thirdly, subject to necessary changes to the food treaty between Australia and New Zealand, the bill streamlines the process for finalising standards, removing the option for a second review by the ministerial council after FSANZ has approved the standard. Fourthly, the bill introduces a new process for the scientific pre-market assessment and approval of high-level health claims. Finally, the bill makes several minor and consequential amendments to the act to reduce red tape and duplication and to improve clarity.
According to the explanatory mem-orandum, the purpose of this bill is to amend the act to expedite the development of food regulatory measures and to improve the framework within which FSANZ operates and food standards are made. The bill represents the government’s response to ongoing feedback from consumers, government and industry highlighting a number of areas for improvement in the framework for developing and assessing food standards by the authority. This framework originated in the National Food Authority, established in 1991 when states and territories entered into an arrangement with the Commonwealth. When New Zealand became a partner in the Australian food regulatory system in 1996, the Australia New Zealand Food Authority was established. In November 2000, the Council of Australian Governments, COAG, agreed to a new food regulatory system in response to the food regulation review recommendations contained in the Blair report.
The Food Standards Australia New Zealand Act 1991 established a new independent statutory authority, Food Standards Australia New Zealand—which we know as FSANZ—to develop and approve science based food standards, and conferred policy responsibility for the food regulatory framework on a ministerial council, comprising ministers representing all relevant portfolios. New Zealand, again, joined the system by way of a treaty. In 2004, the Food Regulation Standing Committee, comprising senior officials from the New Zealand, Australian and all state and territory governments, undertook a review of the food regulatory system aimed at identifying opportunities for reducing delays in the authority’s food standards assessment and approval processes and enhancing the protection of confidential commercial information. During 2005, as part of the review, industry and consumers were consulted on any additional concerns with the current standards development process.
A range of possible improvements was identified through these processes. These improvements included, firstly, the time frame for decision making. The average time taken to complete a full assessment of an application had blown out to 16.8 months, leading to a considerable backlog of applications. Secondly, the one-size-fits-all approach fixed in the legislation for developing or amending a food standard meant that virtually all applications and proposals were being processed in the same way regardless of whether they were for a major or minor amendment to a standard or for a new standard altogether. Under the current framework, even applications for minor technical amendments are subject to the full gamut of two rounds of public consultation, three sets of reports and the opportunity for two rounds of ministerial council reviews. Thirdly, problems were identified relating to the interaction between the role of FSANZ and the ministerial council. Crossover between the standards development process undertaken by FSANZ and the policy development and final checks-and-balances role of the council were resulting in long delays and uncertainty. Fourthly, there were substantial industry concerns around the ‘free rider’ effect that resulted from generic standards. Currently there is no capacity for industry to capture exclusive benefits because all of the details of their applications were immediately made publicly available and because, once amended, the new standard applies to everyone. The absence of protections for commercially valuable information was identified as a disincentive for innovation, particularly in relation to health claims and novel foods.
The government has advised that the issues addressed in the bill were the subject of consultation with Commonwealth, state and territory governments, the New Zealand government, the food industry, consumer and public health groups and members of the public. Consistent with Australia’s obligations under the Australia-New Zealand Joint Food Standards Treaty, schedule 3 does not take effect unless and until amendments to reflect this new process have been made to the agreement with New Zealand. Labor calls on the government to promptly negotiate the requisite amendments to the agreement so that the amendments in schedule 3 may come into effect as soon as possible. Labor supports these changes, representing as they do an effort to improve and streamline processes for assessing applications and proposals by FSANZ. It is hoped that these changes will improve the timeliness of FSANZ decisions, as the government has promised.
On 29 March this year, the bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs for inquiry. The committee received 15 submissions on the bill and considered it at a public hearing in Canberra on 23 April. Submissions to the Senate inquiry highlighted a range of views concerning particular aspects of the bill. The Australian Medical Association expressed disappointment that the bill:
... seems to place greater emphasis on improving processes for industry (reducing red tape and streamlining) than it does on the public health implications of food regulation activities undertaken by FSANZ.
The AMA proposed the adoption of a clear definition of ‘public health’ in the act and raised concerns in relation to changes to public consultation in some of the new assessment processes.
CHOICE raised a series of concerns about changes in the bill which it felt impacted poorly on consumer interests and the transparency of FSANZ’s processes. CHOICE particularly highlighted concerns about the new processes for assessing high-level health claims and argued that they compromised consultation and transparency, therefore undermining FSANZ’s integrity and primary objectives. CHOICE was concerned about changes to public consultation in some of the new assessment processes and that limitations on the capacity of ministers to request a review would limit their ability to protect the interests of consumers. Like the AMA, CHOICE also noted a lack of definition of ‘public health’ in the act.
CHOICE supported the new stop-the-clock provision and noted that it would be illogical for FSANZ to consider an application where the ministerial council had not yet finalised policy guidelines.
In common with the AMA and CHOICE, the Public Health Association raised concerns about changes to public consultation in some of the new assessment processes and noted the lack of a definition of ‘public health’ in the act.
The Dietitians Association of Australia was critical of changes to public consultation in relation to new processes for assessing high-level health claims and called for more information concerning the establishment and membership of expert committees. The association called for greater focus on the public health implications of food regulation activities.
The Cancer Council of Australia raised concerns that weaker measures in relation to food regulation could potentially lead to negative health outcomes for the public.
The Australian Food and Grocery Council argued that the amendments provided for a more efficient approval process where it was appropriate and particularly supported the new high-level health claims process, which it argued would address the significant ‘free rider’ effect. However, the council did raise concerns about the power of the ministerial council to amend standards and the lack of clarity in relation to the process for amending editorial notes. It suggested further amendments to ensure certainty for business.
The Australian Beverages Council also raised concerns around the lack of clarity in relation to the process for amending editorial notes. The council argued that the proposed stop-the-clock provision was unnecessary and would seriously inhibit innovation and the competitiveness of Australian industry. Bayer CropScience, Monsanto and Dairy Australia similarly raised concerns with the stop-the-clock provision. Bayer CropScience and Dairy Australia suggested further amendments to ensure certainty for business.
The Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs considered these submissions and raised a number of issues in its report: the assessment of applications; changes to clarify the status of editorial notes in the standards; the role of the ministerial council; and the stop-the-clock provision allowing for the suspension of an application by FSANZ under specified circumstances. It suggested further amendments to ensure certainty for business. It raised issues around new processes for assessing high-level health claims and the public health implications of food regulation activities.
The committee made three majority recommendations, all of which Labor supports: firstly, that the Commonwealth consider clarifying the definition of ‘public health’ in relation to the objectives of the Food Standards Australia New Zealand Act 1991 and the assessment of food standards; secondly, that the definition of ‘standard’ contained in proposed subsection 3(1) of the act be amended to clarify the process for amending editorial notes; and, thirdly, that the stop-the-clock provisions contained in proposed section 109 be amended to provide applicants with an option to proceed with the assessment process, on the understanding that approval may, if necessary, be rescinded or amended following any contrary policy decision by the ministerial council.
We are pleased that the government has moved on two of these issues, proposing amendments to address the committee’s recommendations dealing with editorial notes and the stop-the-clock provisions. Labor support these amendments. As it is always important that everyone is clear as to the intended meaning of legislators in regulatory regimes such as the FSANZ bill, we support the effort to clarify the use of editorial notes in the legislation.
Labor also support the government’s amendment of the stop-the-clock provision for greater flexibility. However, we are disappointed that the government has not adopted the third recommendation of the Senate committee, to include a definition of ‘public health’ in the bill. Labor had intended to move amendments to strengthen the public health objectives of the act, and we are happy to support the Democrats amendment in this regard as it has the same result as our intention.
Labor is conscious that efforts to improve processes for industry—reducing red tape, streamlining assessments and providing greater protections for intellectual property—must always be balanced with protecting the public health implications of food regulation activities undertaken by FSANZ. The government has a third amendment in its package—to omit subsection 112(6), a provision that has been removed after consultation with FSANZ. It appears that the provision has never been utilised and there are no existing regulations to this effect. Under these circumstances Labor will support this amendment.
The Greens and Democrats have proposed a number of additional amendments. Labor will be supporting some of these amendments—notably those which reflect concerns raised during the Senate committee hearings—but I will wait until the detailed consideration of the bill to go through each of these individually. In conclusion, I repeat that Labor supports this bill and the amendments I have noted. We believe this package represents an effort to improve and streamline processes for assessing applications and proposals by FSANZ and hopefully to improve the timeliness of FSANZ decisions.",SENATE,<title>FOOD STANDARDS AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,44,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-06-14,"—The principal objectives of the Food Standards Australia New Zealand Amendment Bill 2007 are to meet and maintain high-level food regulation standards. FSANZ, as it is commonly known, is responsible for developing food standards and codes of practice covering the content and labelling of food, as well as food safety standards in Australia and New Zealand. While the Australian Greens are supportive of the need for review and revision of the current act, we do not believe that the bill before us adequately meets the needs of a modern and dynamic food standards process.
We are concerned that the act does not meet some of its basic objectives, in that it fails to provide a definition of ‘public health’ and, in doing so, fails to ensure that the legislative measures of the act are squarely aimed at delivering public health outcomes as opposed—as some would say—to being more focused on delivering food industry outcomes, in some cases. We also believe the act should include a stronger component of public consultation and address the advertising of unhealthy food to children. And we are concerned that the measures relating to the identification and labelling of genetically engineered food products are not in line with community concerns or a reflection of the desired community standard.
The Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs undertook an inquiry into the provisions of this bill. While the Australian Greens are supportive of the main body of this report, we did include additional comments to address the definition of ‘health’, the issue of editorial notes, public consultation, some of the aspects of advertising to children, and genetically modified foods.
When we come to the issue of public health we believe that a very considered approach is needed. The Food Standards Australia New Zealand Act 1991 clearly sets out its objectives. They are: the protection of public health and safety; the provision of adequate information relating to food to enable consumers to make informed choices; and the prevention of misleading and deceptive conduct. These objectives place the context of food regulation clearly in a public health framework, highlighting the need for safety and health outcomes. Yet the act does not have a clear definition of public health.
So here we have legislation whose main objective is public health—but what is public health? With this in mind, we believe that the bill should include a definition of public health. Unfortunately, sometimes you would think that the interests of the food industry were being placed ahead of the interests of consumers and public health. The AMA put this opinion to the Senate committee in their submission. The report on this bill by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs made a recommendation that the definition of public health be clarified, but, as far as I can tell from reading the latest lot of amendments, the government has not done that. The Greens believe that more is needed, and we highlighted that in our additional comments report.
We believe very firmly that the act needs a clear definition of public health. The Greens support the AMA’s proposal that any definition of public health needs to include a commitment to the precautionary principle, which they defined in their submission:
The precautionary principle states that when an activity raises threats of harm to the environment or human health, precautionary measures should be taken even if some cause and effect relationships are not fully established scientifically.
As such, I have proposed an amendment to include the following definition of ‘public health’ in this bill, with the definition of the precautionary principle in mind. The definition is: public health is the organised response by society to minimise illness, injury and disability and to protect and promote health; it recognises that health and health care occur in an economic and sociocultural system both nationally and internationally, and therefore seeks to influence all sectors to maximize the health and wellbeing of society; and the precautionary principle should be applied in relation to all public health outcomes considered within this act. I will talk further about the definition when I move the amendments.
I now move on to the issue of public consultation. If passed, the bill will also see the implementation of three different options for the development and changing of food regulation arrangements. These are: a truncated process for minor variation of a food regulatory measure; a more extended process for a new food regulatory measure or a major variation to a food regulatory measure; and a general procedure for all other changes.
A number of submissions to the inquiry were from groups representing consumer and public health interests who indicated concern about the limitations imposed on public consultation proposed within the bill. The point they make is that, while there is a need for streamlining the consultation process, the current bill does not provide adequate opportunities for public consultation, particularly in relation to health claims on food and the maximum residual levels of pesticides and veterinary medicines. The submission from CHOICE recommends:
... that the proposed amendments to the FSANZ Act should also include a definition or further clarification of what applications or proposals would be considered to be a “major variation”, such a “significant change” or involve such “scientific or technical complexity” that they would require the full assessment and consultation processes. This would be consistent with the information provided in Section 36 of Subdivision E which outlines what is considered to be a “minor variation”.
CHOICE also point out in their submission that the establishment of an expert panel to advise FSANZ on applications to amend the health claims standard does not go far enough. They think appropriate consultation measures with an adequate time frame are essential to meet the public interest needs in this area. In response, the Australian Greens are recommending that the bill retain the current provisions that applications for amendments to the health claims standard must be subject to public consultation in a way which enables all public health and consumer stakeholders to comment on the implications and on the evidence provided for the proposed changes.
Then we come to the issue of editorial notes. The bill also amends the definition of a standard in subsection 3(1) to clarify that boxed text identified as an ‘editorial note’ or ‘example’ is not part of a food standard. The Australian Beverages Council commented in response to this that they are of the strong opinion that editorial notes:
... should not be used at all within the written content of the FSC or any individual Standard as they represent a “lazy” form of regulation. Even though the Act may state that editorial notes are not regulations, no court of law would fail to take note of them. We therefore strongly suggest that such editorial notes be removed from the body of the FSC ... Regulations should in themselves be clear and unambiguous and not require “editorials” that are claimed not to be regulations.
A number of other submissions to the inquiry argued that, if editorial notes are important enough, they should be specified as regulations in the legislation and hence become disallowable instruments. The Greens support these views and the committee report, which states that there needs to be a ‘clear process of amendment to the editorial notes which will ensure appropriate public oversight and consultation’. In fact, the Greens believe that all editorial notes, boxed or otherwise, should be adopted as regulations to make the process clear.
Then we come to something that was not addressed in the bill but that we think should have been, and that is the issue of television advertising standards, or what we call the junk food clause. We believe very firmly that this is a public health issue. Health experts say that there are now more than 1½ billion overweight people around the world. One-quarter of Australian children are either overweight or obese and it is expected that this proportion will grow to one-half by 2025. We have one of the fastest growth rates of childhood obesity in the world. Professor Philip James, head of the International Obesity TaskForce, says the long-term costs of obesity will be huge. He says:
The problem of obesity is so big it was classified by WHO (World Health Organisation) as the biggest unrecognised public health problem in the world.
Private research puts the cost of obesity in terms of health and productivity losses at $11 billion per annum. The AMA has expressed concern that the rise in childhood obesity may, for the first time in Australian history, result in a decline in the life expectancy of newborns.
The International Association for the Study of Obesity says that government insistence that people need merely to exercise more and improve their diets is not enough. It has renewed calls to ban junk food advertising aimed at children. In 2004, Australian advertisers spent $410 million on food advertising. More than 90 per cent of food advertising promotes fast food, chips, lollies, soft drinks, ice-cream and other junk foods—in other words, it is directed at children. A recent study commissioned by New South Wales Health found that overeating, not a lack of exercise, is the real cause of the growth in childhood obesity. Experts agree that kids cannot distinguish between advertisements and what their parents tell them, and we know that more than 90 per cent of food ads are for junk food and that overeating is the real cause of childhood obesity.
It is not hard to join the dots and come up with a ban on junk food advertising as being a sensible, logical solution. A ban on junk food advertising directed at children is what the Greens propose. The Greens propose amendments that prevent children from being exposed to advertisements pushing chips, lollies, fast food and soft drinks, where 90 per cent of the advertising dollar is spent, but allow for advertisements for food deemed beneficial to children’s health, such as fresh fruit. We believe this is a sensible approach and hope that the Senate sees it that way too.
A serious response to this growing public health issue must include measures to prevent advertising directed at children of food products which damage their health. This is why the Greens recommend that this bill should include a standard to remove the advertising of junk food during children’s television hours. This is a public health issue. This standard is entirely consistent, we believe, with the primary objectives of food regulation and public health as set out in this act. If there is a role for food standards in achieving public health outcomes and in assisting consumers to make informed choices about the health implications of particular foods for themselves and for their families then this is undoubtedly an area where FSANZ could be actively used in the community to combat the lifelong impacts of obesity. Therefore, we will be making the following amendment: that the advertisement of food or beverages during children’s television viewing hours should not occur unless the minister for health, having determined that such an advertisement is beneficial to the health of children, allows such an advertisement.
I would like to move on now to another area that we believe should be addressed in the standards, and that is genetically modified food. Truth in labelling is an extremely important issue, which I and the Greens believe is gaining increasing public awareness in Australia. The Australian Greens are very conscious of the right of every Australian to know exactly what food they are eating and where it has originated from. I do not believe that you can discuss food standards and safety in the absence of a requirement to tell people whether or not they are eating genetically engineered food products. Irrespective of whether or not you support the more liberal use of GMOs in agriculture, I believe that consumers have a right to make an informed choice about the social, economic and environmental impacts of their purchases. This includes the right to determine for themselves whether they actually want to eat genetically modified food.
This issue is about choice and knowledge; it is about the right to know. It is about allowing the public to be informed of what is in their food and how it is produced in order to let them decide whether it is really what they want to eat and whether they are prepared to pay for it. It should not be up to industry and its lobbyists to determine what they will and will not tell Australians about what is in their food and where it came from. Manufacturers and producers should be required to tell people what is in their products and where they came from so that people can decide for themselves whether they want those products. Australian consumers deserve to be listened to in this debate; it is important that their opinion is also taken into account. There is wide community expectation that the contents and components of goods and their country of origin—or the countries of origin of their various parts—will be accurately disclosed. Consecutive surveys have demonstrated that the consumer’s need for accurate country of origin labelling and for detail of what is in the food is very high.
A Taylor Nelson study in 2002 showed that 92 per cent of Australians thought that food derived from GE crops, such as oils, should be labelled; and 92 per cent thought that labelling should include highly refined products derived from genetically modified crops. This was reinforced by 61 per cent of Australians saying that they thought they would be less likely to buy a product if they knew it came from an animal that had been fed genetically engineered grain. Further research undertaken that same year by Taylor Nelson showed that 68 per cent of Australians would be less likely to eat a food that they knew had been genetically modified.
For these reasons, I think we need to amend the food standards to require full disclosure of genetically modified content. At the moment the requirement to label accurately for genetically modified organisms is extremely lax and most products do not disclose whether they contain genetically modified organisms or whether any of their component products have been genetically modified. We believe that the community want to know what is in their food and their requirement to know is growing. Therefore, I will also be moving amendments in the committee stage that the standards require notification of the content of genetically engineered organisms.",SENATE,<title>FOOD STANDARDS AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,44,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-06-14,"—I would also like to speak to the Food Standards Australia New Zealand Amendment Bill 2007. I want to focus on a particular aspect of issues raised by the food standards legislation. The legislation as a whole covers a range of areas, and previous speakers, particularly Senator McLucas, outlined the detailed aspects of the bill and all the different measures contained within it. Senator Siewert has detailed wider issues of labelling. As she points out, the objectives in the food standards act relate to the protection of public health and safety, the provision of adequate information relating to food to enable consumers to make informed choices and the prevention of misleading and deceptive conduct.
The authority deals with its responsibilities within a public health framework. But, even with existing labelling where there are requirements—for example, regarding country of origin—it goes beyond just narrow definitions of human health to wider issues. A food label can tell us a lot about the food we put on our plate, like its country of origin or how much fat or sugar it might contain, but the quality of food labelling is often called into question and it can be very controversial. I think this issue of preventing misleading and deceptive labelling is an important one. One only has to think about the debates over the labelling of GMOs in food, which Senator Siewert has just alluded to, to be aware of how passionately people can feel about having the information they want and need in order to make choices to protect their own health and wellbeing or to address other consumer concerns they have regarding, for example, environmental impacts of the production of certain types of food.
People are concerned not only about their own health and wellbeing but also about the wellbeing of others; they are concerned at the moment about childhood obesity and the health and wellbeing of the planet, the environment and the animals that are often used in the production of some of this food. There is a growing awareness within the community about the treatment of animals in food production and the practices of factory farming. Each year more than 540 million farm animals are raised in Australia for food or food production. The clear majority of these animals live their lives in conditions that, I argue, most people would find unacceptable if they were fully aware of them. While many people do not think too closely about the source of their food, more and more are becoming aware of the cruelty associated with many factory farmed meat, dairy and egg products. In addition, many people, whilst they might not think too closely about the source of their food, are nonetheless influenced by words used on labels that might imply that all is well and good, which in some cases is clearly misleading.
A 2001 study of people in Queensland regarding their attitudes to buying meat revealed that consumers ranked the humane treatment of animals ahead of issues such as price. More people are choosing free-range or organic meat and eggs in the belief that they are buying a more humanely produced food as well as, in some cases, for environmental reasons. In 2006 the free-range egg market comprised 20.3 per cent of the total volume of the grocery retail egg market in Australia, which represents a 200 per cent increase since 2000. I would argue that that has been driven by significant and growing community concern based on growing community awareness of the conditions in which battery eggs are produced and that those hens endure. Alongside that, labelling has gone some way towards more accurately reflecting whether eggs are produced from caged birds. Inglewood Farms, which produces 60 per cent of Australia’s free-range chickens, reported a tripling in sales in six months. A 2006 survey focusing on Australian attitudes towards meat found that 63 per cent of respondents were more inclined to buy free-range pig products after becoming aware of the plight of factory farmed pigs.
I have to note in passing that it is quite unfortunate that the recent review of the animal welfare code of practice regarding the housing of pigs, particularly breeding sows, produced such a poor outcome in the face of such clear and overwhelming evidence of the appalling cruelty that sows are kept in for prolonged periods of time. Amendments to the code barely improve that at all and in some cases will make enforcement and oversight of those conditions and meeting of those codes even more difficult.
I would refer to a report that was recently produced by the animal protection and awareness organisation, Voiceless, a very professional organisation that looks at the facts and the details regarding the treatment of animals. They produced a report called From label to liable: scams, scandals and secrecy—lifting the veil on animal-derived food product labelling in Australia. I think it might have been sent to all parliamentarians. I know we all get a lot of mail—a lot of reports in our mail—but I would recommend people to dig that out of the big pile at the back of their desk and have a look at it, because it is very well written, well researched and quite straightforward in the information that it provides. That report highlights that our current food labelling system is woefully inadequate when it comes to the labelling of animal derived food products. Yes, there is certain information about animal derived food that has to be disclosed, but it is information like the lot identification or the date of packaging. There is no requirement under federal legislation in Australia which requires labelling that identifies how products such as meat or poultry were produced. Alongside that, of course, you may well get labelling that carries a very strong implication that it is produced in the open air, on green fields and under sunny skies when in many cases that is far from the reality.
The reality is that many of the commonly accepted terms that we might use to help us make more humane choices are not defined in federal legislation, such as the current law that we are debating at the moment, and they are not linked to any animal protection standards, leaving aside a separate debate about the adequacy and enforceability of our current animal protection standards when it comes to farm and factory animals. There is no certainty about what terms such as ‘free-range’, ‘organic’, ‘barn laid’ or ‘grain-fed’ actually mean. The term ‘free-range’ can and is still interpreted differently by different producers for different products. Animals produced in free-range conditions may still be subject to painful procedures like tail docking, mulesing or dehorning, or subject to limited food, early weaning, routine antibiotics et cetera. As the report from Voiceless says, many producers are hiding their inhumane factory farming through feelgood product labelling, using terms such as ‘farm fresh’ or ‘naturally perfect’ along with positive imagery of happy, healthy cows or chickens frolicking in green fields. I would once again remind the Senate that one of the aims or objects of the food standards legislation is the provision of adequate information and the prevention of misleading and deceptive conduct. I think this is an area that does merit further examination over the coming period.
It is true that we have a number of voluntary certification or quality assurance schemes. Some people may be aware of the RSPCA accreditation system for egg production and pigs. I did mention previously some improvement and standardisation in the basic labelling of eggs in terms of whether they are caged eggs. Even that small advance in accuracy in the labelling of eggs came about only after a very concerted community campaign over long period of time which sought to phase out the battery cage. Indeed, here in the ACT, legislation was actually passed by the ACT legislative assembly to ban battery cage produced eggs, but that was not agreed to by other state governments. Instead a very poor compromise of just a small increase in the size of the cages was put in place.
You might recall, Mr Acting Deputy President Murray, a particularly fetching photograph of me with a chicken on my knee, helping to promote that campaign! I am not sure if that helped or hindered—it depends on people’s views. That was just one part of a large number of efforts to campaign on that issue. The end result of that campaign was to get some labelling that at least had that basic message: ‘This egg comes from a bird in a cage.’ Systems like the RSPCA accreditation system have developed because the public is concerned about animal welfare. People have not done this just for the hell of it; it has been agreed to in various ways. They are concerned about how food is produced and they want information. But as this report makes clear, these schemes are largely self-regulated. They apply a variety of standards. Some adopt a very narrow approach to animal welfare, some are more prescriptive than others and some are more open to public input than others.
These systems are helpful as far as they go, assuming they are accurate, but they limited. We need uniform enforceable laws. Without mandated labelling and terms defined in law, there is no easy way of differentiating between more humanely produced products and intensive factory farmed products. This can be done. I understand that the ACT and Tasmania have legislation that requires the way that food is produced be identified, but this is limited to the labelling and sale of eggs.
Mandatory labelling of the way eggs are produced is also legislated in the European Union. Last year the European Commission also adopted an animal welfare action plan which includes a proposal for an EU animal welfare label. This label would identify products produced under high welfare standards linked to scientific standardised indicators. Australia has a precedent for providing information that is not focused just on food safety or public health on food labels. Our country of origin standards for labelling let consumers know where the food was produced—an issue of importance to many people. Food labelling that lets consumers know how their food was produced is another step in helping people make informed choices and using the power of the market to encourage producers to operate in more humane ways.
As well as not having labelling requirements to identify whether animal derived food was produced humanely, Australia also does not have any enforceable standards for the labelling of vegetarian or vegan products. This means that the many people who now, for environmental, ethical or health reasons, choose not to buy or eat animal products and by-products, may, and indeed often do, inadvertently end up consuming these products. Many people may not be aware that marshmallow and liquorice often contain items made from the bones, tissue, hoofs and skin of animals such as cows, pigs and fish, or that emulsifiers that have innocuous numbers like 481, 472 and 471, which are frequently found in basic products like bread, can sometimes contain animal derived fats. Again, some organisations such as the Vegetarian Society have developed their own labels to help consumers. But we should not have to rely just on NGOs to provide us with information. I probably should declare in passing, Mr Acting Deputy President Murray, that I am a patron of the Vegetarian/Vegan Society of Queensland. If you want to come along to one of our meetings some time, they are a bundle of fun, I can assure you.
—What do you have for dinner?
—Great dinners, Senator Evans—wonderful stuff! The issue here, though, is not to try and impose a moral code on people. I should also note that, even though I am a patron of that society, I am not vegan and I am actually wearing leather shoes at the moment. So there is full disclosure going on here. The issue is about knowledge and choice. These are issues that are of concern and interest to many people. I would argue, as we have greater awareness about the environmental impacts of every aspect of our behaviour and the greenhouse impacts of every aspect of our behaviour, including our food consumption, that people will become more and more interested in how their food is produced and whether or not it contains animal derived products. I believe the public should be provided with information that lets them decide whether the food product is what they want and how they want to spend their money. Australians have a right to make informed choices and to take a personal stand against animal suffering with each dollar they spend at the supermarket. I have said previously that this not only enables them to make a more informed choice but also provides direct incentives for producers to, I would argue, expand market opportunities for them, for the growing band of consumers who take these issues into account in choosing what they buy in the area of food.
I am raising this issue at this stage, taking the opportunity of the second reading debate on this legislation, not to put forward amendments at this stage or anything like that but really to just open up the issue for wider consideration by the community, by the parliament, by the food standards authority. As I said, a lot of the issues and the greater detail are contained in that report put out by the Voiceless organisation. It is one that I think does need further consideration. It would need a lot of thought for it to be done properly and effectively in a way that did not create a lot of unnecessary costs on producers. But I would also argue that having a single, standardised, clear and enforceable national standard may actually assist producers and may assist in efficiency, compared with a lot of varied, imprecise, voluntary based and unenforceable regulatory regimes, which can actually provide people who are less scrupulous and more willing to be misleading with opportunities to exploit market opportunities that really they have no right to.
I leave my remarks for the pondering of the Senate and the wider community. These are issues that I will continue to raise in the future. I also seek leave to incorporate the speech of Senator Allison so we can get on to the committee stage of the debate.
Leave granted.",SENATE,<title>FOOD STANDARDS AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,44,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2007-06-14,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—
The Food Standards Australia and New Zealand Amendment Bill 2007 is aimed at making FSANZ a more efficient Authority by moving away from a one-size fits all assessment process for food regulatory measures.
Under the arrangements proposed in this there will be three different options for developing and changing food regulatory measures;
a truncated process for minor variations of a food regulatory measure,
a more extended process for a new food regulatory measure or a major variation to a food regulatory measure and
a general procedure for all other changes.
The Bill also puts in place a legislative framework for variations to the Nutrition, Health and Related Claims Standard which relate to high level health claims – a standard which is still under development.  Health claims are of course quite contentious and the Democrats have concerns about moves in food labelling in this direction above and beyond the matters in this bill.
The Democrats are broadly supportive of changes that encourage efficiency within agencies.  Such changes should be encouraged.
However we do not support moves that weaken regulatory controls, reduce public consultation or give higher priority to industry needs than public health or safety.
The Foods Standards Australia and New Zealand Act 1991 clearly sets out that the objectives of food regulation are;
the protection of public health and safety
the provision of adequate information relating to food to enable consumers to make informed choices and
the prevention of misleading and deceptive conduct
These are desirable gaols and any changes to the regulatory regime must keep these in mind.
A number of submissions to the inquiry into the Bill raised the issue that the Act does not contain a definition of public health.
Both the AMA and CHOICE commented on the omission of a definition and the potential that this has for decisions about food regulation to be based on a limited view of public health – one which only looks at food safety and food borne illness – rather than a broader view of food regulation which includes its potential impact on health and nutrition.
At a time of unprecedented levels of obesity and the associated chronic disease burden, this is a major concern.
Food safety is an important issue.  Moves towards intensive farming practices, the introduction of genetically engineered ingredients, more extensive food distribution, all have implications for the quality and safety of our food.
In a context in which food supply is constantly evolving we need a regulatory framework that can manage any potential hazards from these changes.
But food safety is not the only element that we need to keep in mind when it comes to food regulation and public health.
We are all aware that Australia is in an unprecedented epidemic of obesity and diet related illness such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
And yet there has been little response from the Government to this burgeoning epidemic.
We are all aware of this government’s continuing refusal to support bans on television food advertising to children.
They have been equally lax in pursuing improvements to food labelling which would provide clear and consistent information to help people make healthy choices.
Food labelling is a tool and it should be used to help us choose healthier foods but as it stands they are a joke - designed more to confuse than to enlighten.
There is a lot of information provided on packaged and processed food.  Many people understand the importance of thinking about how much salt, fat and sugar they eat.
But lists expressed in terms that few of us can understand and don’t have the time to look at are not good enough.
The fact that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health had to launch a 155 page guide to explain food labels last month shows that the present system is not working.
It is not acceptable that FSANZ is charging people $14.95 for a book to explain what is in an ingredients list, what percentage labelling of ingredients means, how people should read claims such as ‘low fat’ and ‘reduced salt’ and what kilojoules and fat is in commonly eaten foods and drinks.
And that people should have to take this book with them to see what’s in the 2000 or so foods that are listed in the book.
And the online information system that the Parliamentary Secretary also launched last month is no more help.
It may sound nice that you can look up 2,600 different foods and view data for up to 169 nutrients per 100 g for these foods but what does that actually mean for making healthy food choices during the day and how much help is an online system like that when you are doing your shopping?
What we need to know is where a particular food fits in a healthy diet and that information has to be easy to understand and easy to see.
Choosing the healthiest foods quickly is almost impossible at the moment for busy shoppers.
We need a clear, meaningful, coding system that people can understand which is what our amendment seeks to introduce.
“Traffic-light” food labels for nutritional quality (red, amber, green for high, moderate and low levels of sugar, fat, and salt) are an easy way for shoppers to see at a glance a food’s ranking on important dimensions.
A ‘traffic light’ system helps people make comparisons between products and to see what is the healthier option.
The intention of these traffic lights is obviously to guide the traffic and clear health profiles on food could dramatically change people’s choices.
Yes these labels would need to be flexible and specific for foods.
Obviously olive oil even though it is 100% fat is not all bad and an amber light might be appropriate, rather than red.
Similarly the natural sugar content of fresh fruits is often high but we would not want to be suggesting that people should limit their intact of fruit.
These issues can be accommodated in a traffic light system.
Many shoppers would be surprised to find that several of Australia’s best-selling breakfast cereals would carry red lights.
Choice’s recent analysis of children’s cereals showed that many are closer to confectionary than a health food – many were highly processed, high in sugar and salt and low in fibre, despite the marketers suggesting that they were a source of vitamins and minerals.
We also need to consider how trans fat are dealt with in such a labelling system.
There is growing evidence that trans fats pose a serious health risk and there are moves worldwide to deal with this.
Other countries have mandated the labelling of trans fats contents on foods.  Australia should follow this lead – perhaps expanding the saturated fat category to include trans fat and with very low levels triggering automatic red lights.
Of course we should be banning the addition of trans fatty acids from all food.  Denmark banned these fats in 2004 with no adverse effects on taste or price.  Reports suggest that Starbucks is on its way to abandoning the use of trans fatty acids and that all US stores will be free of trans fats by the end of this year.  McDonalds are also moving that way.
Unfortunately the agency in Australia charged with protecting our health has done nothing.
Some foods naturally contain trans fat but it is the addition of them in products such as biscuits and cakes and fast foods which is most problematic.
It’s true that industry will probably not like a traffic light type system.  They will argue for voluntary schemes or try and make it more complicated so that it is too difficult for people to work out where a food really stands.
This is because traffic light approaches make it easy for people to see what foods are good and bad for health.
Industry is not going to want to see red lights on foods that are selling well.
But this sort of system can have a radical effect on people’s choices.  Since the introduction of this type of system in the UK there have been drops in the sale of some products.
We are aware that the Australia and New Zealand Food Regulation Ministerial Council is looking into front of package food labelling and has been doing so for sometime.
But we can not afford to draw this process out indefinitely.
There is considerable international evidence from overseas about the value of a simple traffic light system.
Back in October 2006 the food ministers stated in their communiqué that it was important to involve the food industry in the work of developing a scheme for Australia.
Consultation is always important but we can not let the demands of industry outweigh the needs of public health.
We need a mandatory system, a simple system, and a system which is not sponsored by the industry.
And we need that system brought in sooner rather than later.
Yes food labelling is only one step towards making the healthy choice the easy choice.  There is certainly more that the government can and should be doing.
Healthy food needs to be easy and cheap to get for all people.
As we have said on other occasions food marketing to children needs to be tackled urgently.
Junk food and soft drinks should be kept out of schools and sponsorship by fast food companies banned.
Our town planners need to be designing cities that are more pedestrian and cycling friendly.
We could arrest the development of obesity in children and adolescents and address the problem in adults if we put in a concerted effort.
Better food labelling is part of such an effort.
The Democrats are also concerned about the reduction to public consultation that this Bill will enact if passed unamended.
As it stands the Bill does not contain any requirement that FSANZ seek public comment where an application has been lodged to vary a standard dealing with a high level health claim.
It would also appear that only one round of consultation will be necessary when vitamins and minerals are being added to food.
The use of health claims on foods and the addition of vitamins and minerals are both controversial measures.
Many health professionals would argue that health claims on food are little more than a marketing tool which doesn’t provide any meaningful information.
There is little evidence that health claims contribute to educating the public or benefiting public health.
Indeed more and more industry driven claims on food may actually increase the public’s scepticism about food labels
Health claims may contribute to a ‘medicalisation’ of food, so that individuals think individual foods are the magic bullet that will reduce risk or solve health problems.
This will undermine whole-of-diet messages and distort the value of balance, variety and moderation in food selection
The truth is that individual foods do not cause or prevent a disease and for many diseases the role of diet is unclear.
In those diseases in which diet may play a role, there are many other factors also at play and we can not predict the individual level effects of any one food.
The addition of vitamins and minerals is also problematic.
Fortified foods, similar to foods which carry health claims, are often highly processed foods which have lower nutritional content.
Adding vitamins and minerals doesn’t make these healthy foods.
Fortification can be used as a way to market food and try and project a healthy image, but if the food is still high in sugar, fat and/or salt, the public can be mislead about its overall nutritional content.
Alternatively the fortification could be at such a low level that it is meaningless and yet consumers will think they are getting adequate calcium or vitamin C or whatever it is they are being sold.
And how will consumers manage all these fortified products?  If they are having a fortified breakfast cereal, fortified bread for lunch, vitamins in there fruit juice  - how will they know when is all too much?
Apples are apples and chocolate is chocolate.  But what happens when we start adding vitamins to chocolate?  Does this mean its as good as eating an apple?
If you’re trying to get you child or grandchild to eat something, are they more likely to go for the chocolate with added vitamins or the apple?
The line between what is healthy and unhealthy will become more unclear.  There will be more confusion.
This will make it all more difficult to sell the message that we need to be eating more natural and unprocessed foods, more fruit and vegetables.
It is true that there are cases of micronutrient deficiency – where adding folate or iodine or iron– may be generally beneficial but these are few and far between.
Generally we have access to the food that we need to meet our vitamin and mineral needs.
We should be concentrating our efforts on encouraging a healthy diverse diet, not clutching at fortification as the answer.
And we should be providing for a broad input into decisions about how far down this path we go.  We should be allowing all public health and consumer groups to have input into these decisions.",SENATE,<title>FOOD STANDARDS AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,44,1
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2007-06-14,"—I thank Senator McLucas, Senator Siewert and Senator Bartlett for their contributions to this debate. The Food Standards Australia New Zealand Amendment Bill 2007 proposes amendments to the Food Standards Australia New Zealand Act 1991. It sets out the process for developing and amending joint food standards for Australia and for New Zealand. In summary, the bill introduces a risk based standards assessment and consultation process that will make the process more efficient and more effective. The bill aligns and harmonises standard development processes to eliminate unnecessary duplication and red tape, recognises the changing environment and creates processes to improve the management of issues in relation to food innovation.
On 29 March 2007 the Food Standards Australia New Zealand Amendment Bill 2007 was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, which delivered its report on 1 May this year. The Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills also reviewed the bill and included comments on the bill in the Alert Digest No. 5 of 2007. Both reports make recommendations that propose the development and tabling of relatively minor government amendments.
In light of these reports it is proposed to move three government amendments to the bill: firstly, to amend the definition of ‘standard’ contained in proposed subsection 3(1) of the bill to also exclude editorial notes and examples which are not boxed; secondly, to amend the stop-the-clock provisions contained in proposed section 109 to provide applicants of paid applications with an option to proceed with the assessment process if they so wish; and, thirdly, to remove new subsection 112(6) of the bill. Subsection 112(6) of the bill authorises the amendment of the standards development process in the Food Standards Australia New Zealand Act 1991 by regulation. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee is concerned that such a provision involves a delegation of legislative power.
The Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs report also recommended including a definition of ‘public health’—and I know honourable senators mentioned this in the preceding debate. A determination on this complex issue cannot be made by the Commonwealth alone, as such a definition will have significant impact on all jurisdictions, including state jurisdictions, territory jurisdictions and New Zealand. This issue is being considered by the Food Regulation Standing Committee Strategic Working Group presently. The government is actively monitoring the progress on this issue and will consider whether the objectives of the FSANZ Act ought to be clarified once this consultation process among jurisdictions is complete. It notes, however, that there is a need to avoid any clarification of a definition of public health that would result in unintentionally narrowing the scope of the act’s objectives. Additional clarification on a number of comments made by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee has been included in a supplementary explanatory memorandum for the bill.
The state, territory and, indeed, New Zealand governments have all been closely involved in the development of this legislation. All parties are committed to a food regulation system that runs as smoothly and efficiently as possible while maintaining the existing transparent and accountable arrangements. The bill demonstrates this government’s continued commitment to the protection of public health and safety and it improves upon the already robust regulatory arrangements that protect the safety of food for all Australians. I commend the bill to the Senate.
Question agreed to.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>FOOD STANDARDS AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND AMENDMENT BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,44,1
"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2007-06-14,"—The outbreak of hostilities between two rival Palestinian factions, Hamas and Fatah, has come at a very difficult time and threatens the Middle East peace process. I speak with some experience, because recently I visited Israel as a guest of the Australia/Israel and Jewish Affairs Council, as part of a bipartisan parliamentary delegation. The visit provided me with an insight into the realities of Israeli politics, Israeli social life and the country’s role within the Middle East. Despite having been subjected to a relentless campaign of terror during its entire existence, Israel has remained a vibrant and robust democracy. It has remained a country governed by the rule of law. It has an independent judiciary which the government and military are both answerable to. It also maintains freedom of speech and religion, which are two values we hold so dear in this country.
However, Israel does face a number of grave challenges, the most important of these being the search for peace. Of course we are all aware of the geography of Israel. To the south, in the Gaza Strip, Hamas refuses to recognise Israel’s right to exist and it remains committed to Israel’s destruction. We saw evidence of the hundreds of rockets being fired at Israeli towns and settlements by terrorists given safe haven in the Gaza Strip. To the north of Israel, Hezbollah is frantically rearming and reorganising to prepare for its next unprovoked attack on Israeli sovereignty. Here the United Nations is entrusted with keeping the illegal terrorist organisation Hezbollah from gaining strength and with preventing them from once again invading Israeli territory. Let me make this clear: Hezbollah is an illegal terrorist organisation. So, imagine my surprise to see the Hezbollah official flag flying within metres of a United Nations compound—serving as a direct antagonism towards Israeli citizens.
Some of the threats to Israel, however, are less well known—so much so that I only became aware of them through talking with a number of Palestinians and Israelis during the delegation. One such person was respected Palestinian journalist Khaled Abu Toameh. Mr Toameh made it clear that whilst the West regards the Palestinian Fatah party as relatively moderate and pragmatic, he regards them to be at least as dangerous as Hamas, and far more corrupt and incompetent.
But the most alarming aspect of my visit was two meetings linked not by personalities but by the content of the discussion. One of these meetings was with Mr Itamar Marcus of Palestinian Media Watch. Palestinian Media Watch is an organisation that monitors and translates what the Palestinian media, schools and imams are saying to their people in Arabic. As happens in Australia, there have been the usual claims that comments are taken out of context or have suffered through mistranslation, but there can be no denial of the sinister message that was presented so clearly to us. We were presented with images that would disturb even the most open minded of people.
Mr Marcus visited Australia last week and shared with some members of the Australian public much of what he shared with the delegation. This included many examples of incitement on Palestinian TV, which is the equivalent of our ABC. And when I say incitement, I do not just mean incitement to dislike, or even to hate; I mean incitement to murder, and to commit suicide in doing so. He showed us a music video, aimed squarely at children, urging them to become martyrs and to enjoy the delights of heaven, which, in his video, resembled a brightly coloured fairground. And the video was not shown just once; it was shown 50 times in a single month on Palestinian TV. We also saw a children’s show in which a young, articulate 11-year-old Palestinian girl told the host that her goal in life was to become a martyr for Palestine. In May 2007, Palestinian Media Watch reported that Hamas was using a clone of Mickey Mouse on a weekly children’s television program to teach Islamic supremacy and hatred of Jews and Americans.
This problem, unfortunately, is certainly not confined to Palestinian television. Mr Marcus showed a notice for a youth soccer tournament run by the Palestinian Ministry of Education, at that time also under the control of Fatah. Each of the teams was named after a Palestinian suicide bomber, while the tournament itself was named for a terrorist leader who was finally hunted down by Israel. The Department of Education was also responsible for textbooks denying Israel’s right to exist and calling for constant conflict with it. In sermons broadcast on Palestinian TV, popular imams preach anti-Semitism and call for the destruction not only of Israel but of the Jews, in the most blood-thirsty of terms. We have been told on numerous occasions that the cause of Palestinian hatred towards Israel is the occupation and the ill-treatment of Palestinians. I now know, through my own experience, that the source of this hatred is far more insidious and will be far harder to overcome than simply granting a Palestinian state. Yet it must be overcome for there to be any chance of a genuine and lasting peace. Clearly, such a peace objective is not on the agenda of all those responsible for this incitement.
Sadly, my belief that this hateful behaviour was the exclusive preserve of the Hamas terrorist group proved very short lived. The following day we met with Ziyad Abu Ziyad, until recently a Fatah representative on the Palestinian Legislative Council. Mr Abu Ziyad is regarded as a moderate within the Fatah group. He is the co-editor of a joint Palestinian-Israeli journal and has been an important member of Palestinian delegations to various peace negotiations. His message to me, though, was far from impressive. Perhaps the most disturbing of it was that every time the issue of Palestinian incitement of hate, particularly directed towards children, was raised, he told us that he did not agree with 14-, 15- or 16-year-olds carrying out suicide bombings, because he felt that at that age they were too young to be making that kind of decision. He could not explain to me when pressed at what age it was appropriate for a person to become a suicide bomber or a mass murderer or whether it was all right for a Palestinian youth to carry out killings in ways that did not necessarily involve their own deaths. When he was further pressed on this issue, he claimed that Palestinian TV was so bad that no-one really watched it anyway so it did not really matter what was put on it.
Mr Abu Ziyad explained that all Palestinians had satellite dishes and they watched channels on that instead. This undermined the argument that he had been trying to impress upon us about the grinding poverty of the Palestinians, especially due to the blockade of Hamas. Somehow they could all afford satellite dishes! Since then, I have been advised that the Palestinians actually receive more aid per capita than any other population in the world.
Mr Abu Ziyad also sought to put a spin on various topics that simply did no credit to his cause. The most outrageous claim was that President Abbas was so concerned about peace with Israel that he even did his doctoral thesis on Jewish history. I have since been informed the thesis was a denial of the Holocaust. Mr Abu Ziyad blamed the Israeli occupation for the lack of peace, but there was a persistent refusal to acknowledge or accept that his own people must refrain from terrorism and meaningfully recognise Israel.
Of course, the occupation could have ended in 2000, had then leader Yasser Arafat accepted Israel’s proposal for a Palestinian state or even continued the negotiation process. When I asked why Arafat did not do so, Mr Abu Ziyad claimed it was because the Israeli Prime Minister at the time, Mr Barak, had demanded Israeli sovereignty over the Temple Mount. In fact, Mr Barak’s offer was for Palestinian sovereignty over the top of the Temple Mount, where the Islamic holy places are, and Israeli sovereignty under the mount, the site of Judaism’s holiest site, the Western Wall.
The truth is that Palestinians have the opportunity to pursue a peace process. Like most Australians, I fervently hope that they do pursue this process in the Middle East, but we have to understand that peace can only come when Israel has a genuine partner to negotiate with. Sadly, given my experience with the so-called ‘moderates’ on the Palestinian side, peace in Israel is a long way off. Until that time, I take comfort in our government’s strong support for Israel and its right to take the necessary steps to defend itself and its citizens from the evil that is terrorism in all its forms.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Middle East</title>,Adjournment,45,1
