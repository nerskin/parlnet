Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (12:01):  I move:


That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:


""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House notes that the Turnbull Government's return to surplus in 2019-20 is reliant on a one-off tobacco tax collection timing trick"".


I rise to speak on the Customs Amendment (Illicit Tobacco Offences) Bill 2018. This piece of legislation, together with the Treasury Laws Amendment (Illicit Tobacco Offences) Bill 2018, provides a new framework for strengthening illicit tobacco offences by removing existing obstacles to prosecution. The Treasury Laws Amendment (Illicit Tobacco Offences) Bill 2018 is currently before the Senate, and Labor has agreed to support that bill, as I outlined in this place on the 28 February. Naturally Labor will support the bill currently before the House, because we believe in cracking down on illicit tobacco as well as eliminating smoking related illness and death. Illicit tobacco refers to tobacco sold to Australian consumers without the payment of relevant taxes. There are several types of illicit tobacco, including contraband, which is manufactured legally outside of Australia and smuggled into the country; counterfeit, which is manufactured illegally without permissions and smuggled into Australia; and unbranded tobacco, which usually comes in loose leaf and is known colloquially as chop-chop. I suppose the Australian public would know that one more than the others.


The report Illicit tobacco in Australia released on 20 April this year by KPMG states that Australian tobacco consumption for the 2017 calendar year was 15.6 million kilograms, and around 15 per cent of this, or 2.3 million kilograms, was illicit tobacco. According to the report, the illicit tobacco consumed would have had an estimated excise value of $1.91 billion if it had been consumed legally. There are, however, other estimates of this figure because measuring the illicit tobacco market is, naturally, inherently difficult. The Department of Home Affairs has estimated the excise value at between $0.5 billion and $2.3 billion, whilst others have estimated the cost to the Australian public purse to be up to $6 billion. Regardless of this figure, as illicit tobacco enters the market, lost excise normally charged as a tax or duty is not being collected by the Australian government to be spent on other services such as health, infrastructure, education et cetera for our society and our community.


Last week two students in Sydney's north were arrested after attempting to import 778 kilograms of loose-leaf tobacco sent as sea cargo from China, with the excise for this shipment alone estimated to be worth more than $780,000. I commend the Australian Border Force officers for intercepting this shipment in Adelaide last month and for the daily work they do in protecting our borders. Another such instance uncovered by Australian Border Force officials was an alleged Chinese syndicate smuggling into Australia tobacco and cigarettes hidden in children's toys. There are other instances I could outline to the House. For example, six tonnes of illegal tobacco leaves and vast fields of mature plants worth more than $13 million in excise were seized in a raid on a rural property in the Northern Territory in July. The media has reported these events on numerous occasions.


I have heard from my own constituents and from small business operators in my electorate of Blair in South-East Queensland stories about businesses being undercut by those purportedly selling illicit tobacco to sometimes unknowing customers who think they're just getting cheaper cigarettes and cheaper tobacco. In Queensland, as recently as Saturday, The Queensland Times reported that a local store in Ipswich in my electorate was selling 50 grams of loose-leaf tobacco for just $20, compared to $69 in the supermarket. Illicit tobacco may seem harmless, but purchasing it actually helps fund the criminal networks that run these operations. They use illicit tobacco as one of the many branches of their criminal operations, which include such things as human trafficking, people smuggling, illicit use of firearms and drug smuggling. People who innocently buy tobacco on the cheap from local shops may be surprised to find out they may be partaking of this illicit tobacco trade. They're actually funding these operations by buying chop-chop.


We must take every step possible to crack down on illicit tobacco and the people who run these illegal operations. Since 1 July 2015, over 114 people have been charged with tobacco related border offences. However, only 69 of those charged have been successfully prosecuted under the Customs Act. There are a number of limitations with the existing tobacco related revenue evasion offences in the Customs Act and the Excise Act because the offences are inconsistent. The Customs Act offences only apply when knowledge of defrauding or intention to defraud revenue can be proven. By comparison, the Excise Act offences are associated with relatively low penalties and do not provide a sufficient deterrent to those dealing in illicit tobacco. Events can only be successfully prosecuted if it can be proven whether tobacco was imported or produced domestically. Because of these inconsistencies, neither officers of customs, who administer the Customs Act, nor officers of the Australian Taxation Office, who administer the Excise Act, are currently able to target the full range of illicit tobacco offences.


The bill before the House amends the Customs Act 1901 to create two new offences in respect of importing illicit tobacco based on recklessness and ensures customs officers can investigate and enforce new illicit tobacco offences relating to the proof of origin in the Taxation Administration Act 1953. In addition to this, there are paragraphs that create new offences which lower the standard of proof from intention to defraud or knowledge of defrauding revenue to recklessness. Recklessness is a lower standard of culpability than intention or knowledge. With these amendments, customs officers will be able to target a wider range of participants in the illegal tobacco trade and strengthen the illicit tobacco enforcement regime in Australia. In turn, this will allow greater opportunities for successful prosecution of those involved in the illicit tobacco market.


The bill also proposes to extend the power to arrest without warrant under section 210 of the Customs Act if an officer of customs or police believes on reasonable grounds the person has committed or is committing an offence. Labor supports this. It should be noted, however, that the power of arrest without a warrant can only be exercised if an officer believes on reasonable grounds that proceedings by summons against a person would not achieve one or more of the several purposes set out in the Customs Act. It's appropriate for the power to arrest without warrant to be extended to prevent the continuation of illicit tobacco offences and to ensure that people appear before the court in relation to those offences.


Whilst we welcome the measure to combat illicit tobacco, we on this side of the House are always prepared to hold this out-of-touch Turnbull government to account. As I referred to in my second reading amendment, the Turnbull government is relying on a one-off tobacco tax collection timing trick to help them bring up a budget surplus. In the 2018-19 budget, the Turnbull government miraculously announced that they were going to achieve surplus in 2019-20, a year earlier than previously anticipated. 


Currently, importers who import tobacco are required to pay duty when the tobacco leaves a warehouse. As a result of this, there have been instances of tobacco being removed from warehouses without duty being paid, resulting in the illicit tobacco entering the Australian supply chain. In an effort to combat this, from 1 July 2019 importers will be required to pay all duty and tax liability when tobacco enters the country rather than when it leaves a licensed warehouse and enters the domestic market.


As a result of this measure, the Turnbull government announced a transitional measure, with importers having 12 months to pay tax on tobacco stored in warehouses. This means that, instead of duty being collected in the latter years, when it leaves a warehouse the revenue of over $3 billion will be collected in the 2019-20 financial year—a timing trick perpetrated to achieve a budget surplus. The 2019-20 financial year is also the year in which the Turnbull government says it will reach a $2.2 billion surplus—a $2.2 billion surplus and a $3 billion timing trick to achieve it. The Turnbull government is using the risk of illicit tobacco entering the market to reach a surplus a year earlier than they previously anticipated or expected to announce it. It is clear that, without this one-off tobacco tax collection timing trick, the Turnbull government would not be able to achieve a surplus in 2019-20 as they claim they will. I note that this measure will require another piece of legislation, currently titled the Customs Amendment (Collecting Tobacco Duties at the Border) Bill in the legislation proposed to be introduced in the spring sittings, as circulated by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.


Labor is awaiting this legislation to be introduced in the House and the government's further admission that without this additional revenue they will not be able to achieve a surplus one year ahead of schedule. Of course Labor have supported measures before the House when we've seen better and more improved economic reforms to pay down Australia's debt and to ensure bigger surpluses and a fair and sustainable taxation system for all Australians. For example, this plan from our side of the chamber involves capital gains tax reforms and reforms in relation to excessive dividend imputation credits, which crack down on an unsustainable tax loophole that gives tax refunds to people who don't actually pay income tax.


Labor has made a strong commitment historically in relation to getting rid of the scourge of smoking. Smoking accounts for 15,000 deaths every year in this country. Policy reforms implemented by former Labor governments made significant advancements towards drastically reducing that number—for example, what Australia did under the last Labor government in becoming the first country in the world to introduce plain packaging for cigarettes. We also increased the excise rate applying to tobacco products by 25 per cent as part of our budget, and we commend the government for mimicking what we had to do. We invested money—for example, $61 million in a national tobacco campaign. We introduced legislation to bring restrictions on internet advertising of tobacco products into line with advertising on other media. We took a strong, principled stance.


Unfortunately, there are parties on the other side of the chamber who have been shamelessly accepting donations from big tobacco. The latest records from the Australian Electoral Commission show that the National Party accepted $15,700 in donations from the tobacco industry in the 2016-17 financial year. This is simply not good enough. It's not good enough to say one thing in this chamber, to say one thing about the tobacco scourge and reducing deaths and illness in relation to tobacco related illness in this country, but to do another thing in Canberra or organisationally in your party. We don't think that's good enough.


I think the Prime Minister should explain why it's acceptable for his coalition partners to fill their coffers with donations from the tobacco industry. On this side of the chamber we've consistently shown our commitment to policies to reduce the instances of tobacco related illness and disease in this country. We support the passage of this bill through the House to stop the scourge of illicit tobacco and ultimately improve health outcomes for all Australians. I commend the legislation and the amendment to the chamber.



The SPEAKER:  Is the amendment seconded?




Mr Snowdon:
  Yes, and I reserve my right to speak.



The SPEAKER:  I thank the member for Lingiari. The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Blair has moved as an amendment that all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. If it suits the House, I'll state the question in the form that the amendment be agreed to. The question now is that the amendment be agreed to.

"O'Brien, Ted, MP",LP,2018-08-14,"



Mr TED O'BRIEN
 (Fairfax) (12:14):  The Customs Amendment (Illicit Tobacco Offences) Bill 2018, with measures making policing of the market in illicit tobacco more fit for purpose, is a very important part of the long-running, largely bipartisan effort to reduce the human and dollar costs of smoking. These costs come in at around 15,000 lives and $30 billion in health services on an annual basis, and we can add to that a recent and rapidly increasing loss of revenue from the surging black market in illicit tobacco. These are enormous costs, and governments at all levels—federal, state and local—have been working to reduce them since the mid-1990s—with considerable success, I might add.


As recently as the mid-1990s, almost one-quarter of all Australian adults smoked. That is now down to about 13 per cent, with the trend suggesting it can and will be driven considerably lower, saving lives and billions of dollars, in what has been a remarkable policy turnaround spaced over several decades. In the 1930s, before the links between smoking and disease were established, the tobacco industry in Australia was actually promoted and protected. Federal law in that era required that 50 per cent of the tobacco in cigarettes be Australian grown, which embedded a strong tobacco-growing industry in Queensland and Victoria. The proportion of local content was even boosted, to 57 per cent, as late as 1977.


But progressively, and certainly very strongly by the early 1990s, a range of factors came into play that led to a pretty sudden and absolute about-face. Freer trade, with significantly lower tariffs, meant that previous constraints on the importation of cheaper tobacco were reduced, which in turn crippled the relatively high-cost local industry. After a restructuring scheme, the industry shrank from about 600 growers in the 1970s to no growers by 2006. Almost simultaneously, there was a growing awareness of the appalling health and financial costs of smoking, which quickly gave rise to a highly effective legislative and regulatory campaign against tobacco use in this country. Advertising was banned in 1992, and since then, especially over the past decade, antitobacco, pro-taxpayer measures have proliferated. Excise was increased by 25 per cent in 2010. Plain packaging with graphic health warnings was instituted in 2011. In 2013, annual 12½ per cent increases in excise began, going through to 2017. In the 2016-17 budget, those increases were extended through to 2020 as part of a broader package of measures instituted by this government to increase the national effort against smoking, with this bill being part of that package. As a result, thousands of lives will be extended, and many billions of dollars will now be available for more productive work on behalf of Australian taxpayers.


But the success of this ongoing campaign to reduce the human cost and the dollar cost of tobacco consumption has created major challenges for law enforcement. As a direct result of having created the most expensive tobacco market in the world, we have made ourselves a big target for illegal products, especially from countries to our north, who have some of the lowest tobacco prices in the world. In China, for example, a pack of 20 cigarettes retails for about $3.40, compared with about $25 to $26 here. In South Korea, the price is about $3.60. In Indonesia, it's under $2 a pack. The temptation for criminals is obvious: produce or buy cheaply in any number of countries then smuggle the product into Australia, deliberately avoiding customs duties, and you'll make a lot of money. Today's illicit tobacco trade operates in much the same way cheap booze from Canada and the Caribbean flooded into the United States during the prohibition era—to enrich and empower vast criminal enterprises. 


The ATO and the Department of Home Affairs estimate that almost $600 million in tobacco duty was forgone in the 2015-16 financial year due to Australia's illicit tobacco trade. Regular reports by KPMG that seek to quantify the scale of the illegal market suggest the cost of this illicit tobacco could be as high as $1½ billion in avoided duties, based on the estimate that about 14 per cent of tobacco sold in Australia is now illegal. If KPMG is right, one in seven cigarettes smoked in Australia avoid excise duty. The impact of that at a national level is twofold. One is revenue lost. Tobacco taxes currently contribute around $9 billion annually for taxpayers, with that number set to grow exponentially given the ongoing big increases in excise. By 2020, excise revenue will likely be around $13 billion. The second highly likely impact is a reduction in the rate at which people either quit or resist the smoking habit due to an increasingly ready access to cheap illicit tobacco products. Should this impact be felt, any resurgence of tobacco use will, as a consequence, have a discernible negative impact on national life expectancy and health costs.


But, in addition to the border national impacts of lower revenue and higher health costs, there are also some very important local impacts, including loss of income for many hardworking small businesses who are in fact selling the real deal, the real thing. While regularly doorknocking businesses across my electorate, it has become apparent to me how many small businesses are being hurt by this illicit trade. Many of these are convenience stores; they're tobacconists; they're newsagencies—businesses that already operate on very tight margins, and they rely on their local trade. These businesses already face the challenge of supplying a highly regulated product to an even smaller customer base—a customer base that has reduced significantly over the years, as we have already noted. However, while it has been government policy for many years to discourage tobacco use and offset the burgeoning public health cost, these retailers do remain law-abiding tax-paying businesses. These are Australian businesses, employing Australians. And while the ultimate public policy objective, through education, excise and regulation, remains consistent, this does not mean that small businesses should face the added burden of aggressive competition from a criminal black market in illicit tobacco. Clearly we need to increase our efforts to not just stall the growth of smuggled product but cut into it as deeply as possible with tougher laws and more rigorous controls at the border via new agencies, such as the Tobacco Strike Team recently established by Australian Border Force.


That's one task, but it's not the only one, because a second layer of activity in relation to excise avoidance is now also in play, with illegal onshore tobacco cultivation making something of a comeback. In March last year, a crop worth $11 million was discovered in New South Wales near Cooma. In March this year, 4.2 tonnes of tobacco leaf and 12 acres of crop were discovered near Ballarat in Victoria. In April, in the largest cross-agency investigation that that Australian tax office has been involved in, a $60 million operation was discovered in the Bundaberg region in Queensland. There are many other examples, but that sample is indicative of the fact that the profit motive for criminals intent on avoiding their liability to pay excise duty has grown domestically as well as internationally, in lock step with the increase in tobacco price.


In a 2015 report, the Australian Crime Commission suggested that organised crime syndicates are deeply involved in this multibillion dollar racket because the rewards are great and, currently, the risks are slight. The very clear likelihood—the inevitability, you could say—is that this sort of activity is going to increase unless it is checked by tougher laws and more rigorous activity by our border and tax authorities.


This bill involves giving Australian Border Force personnel improved tools for dealing what has proved to be a significant problem in prosecuting smugglers at the border under the current form of the Customs Act. The act requires that, in order to lay the groundwork for a prosecution, knowledge or intent by principals to avoid excise-equivalent customs duty is required. Experience has established that proving such knowledge or intent to the level necessary for a successful prosecution is extremely difficult. Indeed, it is nigh on impossible in the face of people who are well-trained agents of, typically, highly organised crime syndicates, with a fine understanding of the fact that the Australian law requires extremely high levels of proof.


The bill therefore amends the Customs Act. The Customs Act will be changed to reduce the onus from knowledge or intent to avoid duties to one of recklessness, whereby perpetrators will be culpable for what is a lesser offence if it is established that their involvement with the importation of illicit product was undertaken with a reckless attitude towards whether duty was intended to be paid or not.


Other linked measures are contained in a separate bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Illicit Tobacco Offences) Bill, which was introduced into the parliament on 15 February. That bill eases one of the biggest problems that officers of the Australian Taxation Office have in prosecuting matters around illicit tobacco when it is discovered beyond the border. A current requirement of the law is that officers must be able to determine whether the product they are dealing with has been produced domestically or overseas to establish whether the issue is one of customs duty or excise evasion. That is a requirement that has also proved extremely difficult to establish. Attempts have been made to analyse samples to establish whether their origins are local or international to settle that question, but such is the nature of tobacco plants that that has proved impossible. Lack of cooperation from those being investigated, or their lack of knowledge, can stymie authorities on the spot. The Treasury bill therefore removes the need to establish origin. What will have to be established is a reasonable suspicion that either customs duty or excise duty has been avoided, whatever the actual source of the product.


This is an important battle and these are important bills in that context. At stake is an improvement in life expectancy for a significant number of Australians. At stake is the massive health bill that this significant number incur. Also at stake are billions of dollars in revenue that should accrue on behalf of taxpayers but is currently going to criminals and often to well-organised crime syndicates that channel their gains to help finance even further crime. Destroying this criminal enterprise completely may be beyond us. Nonetheless, doing all we can to minimise it remains our key responsibility, and it's for these reasons that I commend the bill to the House.

"Wilson, Tim, MP",LP,2018-08-14,"



Mr TIM WILSON
 (Goldstein) (12:29):  I would like to continue on from the contribution of the member for Fairfax, an excellent contribution no less, to this important discussion around the Customs Amendment (Illicit Tobacco Offences) Bill 2018. The basis of my short remarks is to support the bill and the spirit and the intent in which it seeks to achieve its outcome in the context of existing law, because I do have broader concerns about the operation of the regulatory framework and the way in which we engage with this product—tobacco—and the consequences it has in fuelling the illicit trade.


Illegal tobacco threatens the safety and health of our community and the viability of local business operators, and the measures in this bill will arm customs officers, Border Force agents, with the tools to fight organised crime and their illegal tobacco trade. I don't dispute its objectives, and they're very good ones, and that's the basis upon which I will be supporting this bill. But we also cannot forget part of the reason we are in this situation. It is because of the measures that we have taken to date and what they have done to fuel the illicit trade. I was not in this parliament at the time these matters were considered, but had I been I would have raised my deep reservation around, particularly, some of the ways that we sought to tackle the challenges around illicit tobacco, as well as the incapacity, or the inability, to address some issues that we confront today. 


From 2013 to 2016, Australia's smoking rate fell by a dismal 0.6 per cent. This came off the back of a long period of reform to try and reduce the consumption of tobacco. In many cases, I support those measures. As somebody for whom tobacco contributed to the early death of three out of four grandparents, I believe strongly in tackling these issues. But we made a series of questionable judgements in the past. The first is the constant increase in tax rates and excise on tobacco. This makes it a more desirable product because the cost basis of production is becoming increasingly distant from the price of consumption. That gap, or the consumer surplus that grows with the increase in the tax rate, means that it becomes a more desirable product for organised crime, because the margins that can be secured from engaging in the trade are considerable. And that will not change. So long as we keep the excise at the rate that it is we will continue to encourage illegal gangs and those engaging in ill means to engage in the illicit tobacco trade. But we've doubled down on that by not just increasing the tax rate, increasing the consumer surplus and increasing the desirability and attractiveness of this trade by increasing the tax rate; we have also increased the desirability of this product by making it interchangeable. 


A couple of parliaments ago this parliament introduced plain packaging legislation in the Commonwealth of Australia. And what was the consequence of plain packaging? It took a product that was already of high value and had a high consumer surplus and said, 'Now it is interchangeable, indistinguishable.' That's the whole point of plain packaging legislation—to take a product and remove its branding so consumers can see no difference, while at the same time increasing and ratcheting up the price. So, its desirability goes up, it's capacity to be engaged in counterfeiting and illicit production increases even more dramatically, as do the benefits of illicit trade. This is the fundamental problem with this approach to dealing with issues around tobacco regulation. You're actually fuelling, or at least increasing the risk of fuelling, the illicit trade, mostly to the benefit of criminal gangs. That's what comes out very clearly in different pieces of research and reports. We know that illicit consumption is up. We know the illicit trade is up. We know that the loss to government revenue continues to increase, year on year, and it's aided and abetted by the measures that have been consistently applied by previous parliaments. 


The challenge for us, if we want to cut tobacco consumption—and I do—is to introduce measures that actually help cut consumption, reduce the desirability for criminal gangs to be involved in the trade and to take advantage of the consequences of our legislative arrangements, and look at measures that work. We actually did an entire inquiry, in the Standing Committee on Health, Aged Care and Sport, on the legal accessibility of e-cigarettes and vaporisers and the legalisation of vaping as an alternative to smoking. What the data showed from these reports, looking at international research and the experience of other countries—even when I was in Manchester only recently speaking to health officials—is a very clear and consistent message. People did not think that vaping was necessarily the best measure that they would like to see. They'd rather see people quit, as would I. If they don't quit, particularly those stubborn lifelong smokers, then in the absence of that finding a harm reduction alternative is incredibly important. Vaping fills that critical and important gap. That is so much so that, as I learned when I was in the UK recently and spoke to health officials in Manchester, they now actively promote it as a measure to help reduce people's consumption and behaviour in light of the circumstances. So we put that against the backdrop of what we've been doing in tobacco, which is making it more profitable and more substitutable for criminal gangs, but we haven't then gone on and said that we should support the measures that we need to make sure that we can actually cut smoking rates.


I have to say that I have real concerns about the framework of the approach that many people are taking in this policy space, because it's not actually cutting smoking rates. It is rewarding criminals. It's not helping the consumers. It's also not helping, of course, one of the critical bases on which we have been told we have to support various bits of legislation, which is to increase government revenue to offset the consequences of tobacco consumption. Sadly and tragically, this approach that we have taken, for which we have sometimes been extolled internationally for being a world leader, is being adopted everywhere else. That isn't to say that there isn't a role for tax as part of disincentivising people from consuming tobacco. That's true, and that is a critical part of what we need to do, because there are some people who do have an inelastic approach and do need that incentive. But it would be foolhardy to say that it has not gone to quite incredible extremes in recent years. As I said, when you overlay that with the issues around plain packaging, you see the same consequences. We know that other countries have followed suit and followed us. Despite extolling the virtues of the plans around these policies, the UK, Ireland, France and New Zealand have, frankly, had deeply questionable outcomes, as we have, in the efficacy of these policies.


Of course, when we talk about the efficacy of these policies, yes, we're talking about things like government revenue. That's an impact, but the real impact is on human lives. Sadly, there are too many health sociologists parading themselves as public health officials who would rather keep supporting bad ideas they've come up with and taken ownership of than do the right thing and change the laws to enable people to have a pathway to reduce their consumption and hopefully move towards cessation.


I would hope that this parliament takes note. I would hope that this parliament seeks to consider other alternatives to reduce tobacco consumption in Australia and to improve the livelihoods, the health and the wellbeing of Australians who are caught in the trap and curse of tobacco consumption and nicotine addiction. That is why I am a proud supporter of people being able to access vaporisers and vape legally, not just with vaporisers but also with the capsules. If you want to introduce a policy framework which actually cuts tobacco consumption, that is the pathway in which you do it, on top of constraining and suffocating the criminal gangs who engage in taking advantage of the consequences of the laws we now have on the book. The consequences of the laws are the increase in the price of a product, the increase in the consumer surplus and the increase in the gap between the production and the consumption and the price, which makes it a very profitable industry for those who want ill-gotten gains. The measures we have taken have also made it a substitutable product, which has only exacerbated the already existing problems of that regime.


That's why I support this bill, because ultimately it works to empower and enable those Customs officers to do what they need to do to suffocate that trade. But that trade can be supported in its suffocation by reducing demand from consumers, because people no longer see the advantage of engaging in tobacco consumption and see the advantage of alternatives as a pathway to at least harm minimisation and hopefully cessation. If we do that, we would have a healthier, happier, longer living nation of people, with reduced dependence on nicotine addiction.




Mr Hawke:
  Tell us a bit more about that, would you? Keep going. Give a bit of a recap!




Mr Tim Wilson:
  I know I'm not alone in supporting this important issue in this parliament. I know a number of other members have spoken very directly about the importance of reducing tobacco consumption, some on the other side of this parliament and some on this side of the chamber as well. I know that there are other members who have been steadfast, dutiful and loyal to the pursuit of trying to reduce consumption, like the member for North Sydney and the member for Bowman, who support me on the quest to try to remove the barriers that stop people from getting off tobacco and onto alternatives, particularly vaporisers. I congratulate them for their efforts, their leadership and their courage in standing and doing the right thing. I wish I could see many more people stand up and follow their leadership on this important issue.


In the same way, I'd like to see an honest assessment of and honest reflection on the challenges we face in the tobacco consumption space and a proper consideration of the laws that are already on the books. I remember that back in the day when legislative arrangements around plain packaging were introduced, people said it was going to deliver all these wonderful things. But the truth is that consumption largely stagnated. It didn't actually have that effect, but we've gone on and extolled its virtues all around the world, mostly to fan the notoriety, professionalism and awards showered on the former health minister. But has it actually delivered the outcome? It's a classic problem that many people, including people like Milton Friedman used to argue, which is that you shouldn't judge a policy on its intent, but on its outcomes. When you judge a policy on its intent and not its outcomes, this is the situation you end up with—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Rob Mitchell
):  Member for Goldstein, don't bang the desk any more. Enough! You've previously been warned by the Speaker.




Mr Tim Wilson:
  It's the passion I feel for the topic.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  It is not appropriate behaviour in the chamber.




Mr Tim Wilson:
  This is the consequence when you judge a policy on its intent and not its outcomes: you have a ballooning illicit trade, which is to the benefit of those people who, let's face it, are the scum of the earth—organised gangs and those who seek to take advantage of the legislative arrangements and work the consequences of legislation and regulation to their own commercial benefit. I would have thought that people in this parliament would look at that situation and say, 'It is a travesty.' We have, of course, seen this before. If we go back to the prohibition movement in the United States in the 1920s, unsurprisingly, people produced products at a low price but were able to charge high prices because of their seemingly illicit and illegal nature. What occurred, of course, was that people found ways to profiteer and to make enormous benefits out of it for their own personal gain. And, frankly, they left a trail of human tragedy and misery behind them; but that did not concern them, hence I use the expression 'scum of the earth'.


That is the problem that we continue to face in this policy space. That's why we have to reflect very seriously on our policy objectives and what we're seeking to do in terms of achieving them and implementing them. We know that where there is a regulation that is unjust or has some sort of exceptional consequence, particularly for an interchangeable product, there is a way around it. There has been a long tradition of this. I used the example going back to the prohibition movement, where people found justifications to continue their consumption of alcohol. Some people used to shroud it in the environment of their faith and that they needed it as part of their access to faith. But, more critically, even people who were trying to do the right thing and comply with the law found ways around it—like people selling hops, barley and water and putting warning signs up: 'Warning, if you mix these ingredients then you will break the law and create beer.' That's how people got around it and took advantage of the legislative arrangements. Those are the sorts of lessons we should learn from and not repeat.

As those members well know—indeed, as some of them have raised it with me on prior occasions—criminals who profit from the trade in illicit tobacco undermine the government's strategies to promote good public health outcomes and they threaten the viability of law-abiding local business operators.


This bill enhances border and law enforcement agencies' ability to investigate and prosecute the illegal importation of tobacco and supports the new illicit tobacco offences contained in the related Treasury Laws Amendment (Illicit Tobacco Offences) Bill 2018. Together these two bills establish a comprehensive set of offences targeting the importation, possession, purchase, sale and production of illicit tobacco. The amendments will make it easier for the Australian Border Force and the Australian Taxation Office to investigate and prosecute criminals who are involved in the illicit tobacco trade, regardless of its origin, whether smuggled or grown domestically. New offences will allow enforcement officers to target a wider range of participants in the illicit tobacco trade and will enable our courts to impose severe fines and lengthy prison sentences on criminals who engage in deliberate and highly calculated defrauding of the Australian public.


The framework the government seeks to legislate is backed up by our commitment to over $70 million in funding to the ABF-led Illicit Tobacco Taskforce in the 2018-19 budget. Together with its predecessor, the Tobacco Strike Team, the Illicit Tobacco Taskforce has seen considerable operational success since its establishment, including as recently as last weekend. Last financial year the ABF detected more than 240 million cigarettes and 217 tonnes of tobacco at the border. Worth over $356 million, it evaded duty that would otherwise have belonged to the Australian taxpayers, the Australian public. While it has been illegal to grow tobacco in Australia for over a decade, since July 2016 the ATO has seized 231 tonnes of illicit tobacco, worth an estimated $194 million in forgone tobacco duty.


The Turnbull government is committed to stamping out the trade in illicit tobacco and disrupting the serious and organised criminal groups that profit from it. On that note, I commend the bill to the House.

I rise to speak on the Customs Amendment (Illicit Tobacco Offences) Bill 2018. This piece of legislation, together with the Treasury Laws Amendment (Illicit Tobacco Offences) Bill 2018, provides a new framework for strengthening illicit tobacco offences by removing existing obstacles to prosecution. The Treasury Laws Amendment (Illicit Tobacco Offences) Bill 2018 is currently before the Senate, and Labor has agreed to support that bill, as I outlined in this place on the 28 February. Naturally Labor will support the bill currently before the House, because we believe in cracking down on illicit tobacco as well as eliminating smoking related illness and death. Illicit tobacco refers to tobacco sold to Australian consumers without the payment of relevant taxes. There are several types of illicit tobacco, including contraband, which is manufactured legally outside of Australia and smuggled into the country; counterfeit, which is manufactured illegally without permissions and smuggled into Australia; and unbranded tobacco, which usually comes in loose leaf and is known colloquially as chop-chop. I suppose the Australian public would know that one more than the others.


The report Illicit tobacco in Australia released on 20 April this year by KPMG states that Australian tobacco consumption for the 2017 calendar year was 15.6 million kilograms, and around 15 per cent of this, or 2.3 million kilograms, was illicit tobacco. According to the report, the illicit tobacco consumed would have had an estimated excise value of $1.91 billion if it had been consumed legally. There are, however, other estimates of this figure because measuring the illicit tobacco market is, naturally, inherently difficult. The Department of Home Affairs has estimated the excise value at between $0.5 billion and $2.3 billion, whilst others have estimated the cost to the Australian public purse to be up to $6 billion. Regardless of this figure, as illicit tobacco enters the market, lost excise normally charged as a tax or duty is not being collected by the Australian government to be spent on other services such as health, infrastructure, education et cetera for our society and our community.


Last week two students in Sydney's north were arrested after attempting to import 778 kilograms of loose-leaf tobacco sent as sea cargo from China, with the excise for this shipment alone estimated to be worth more than $780,000. I commend the Australian Border Force officers for intercepting this shipment in Adelaide last month and for the daily work they do in protecting our borders. Another such instance uncovered by Australian Border Force officials was an alleged Chinese syndicate smuggling into Australia tobacco and cigarettes hidden in children's toys. There are other instances I could outline to the House. For example, six tonnes of illegal tobacco leaves and vast fields of mature plants worth more than $13 million in excise were seized in a raid on a rural property in the Northern Territory in July. The media has reported these events on numerous occasions.


I have heard from my own constituents and from small business operators in my electorate of Blair in South-East Queensland stories about businesses being undercut by those purportedly selling illicit tobacco to sometimes unknowing customers who think they're just getting cheaper cigarettes and cheaper tobacco. In Queensland, as recently as Saturday, The Queensland Times reported that a local store in Ipswich in my electorate was selling 50 grams of loose-leaf tobacco for just $20, compared to $69 in the supermarket. Illicit tobacco may seem harmless, but purchasing it actually helps fund the criminal networks that run these operations. They use illicit tobacco as one of the many branches of their criminal operations, which include such things as human trafficking, people smuggling, illicit use of firearms and drug smuggling. People who innocently buy tobacco on the cheap from local shops may be surprised to find out they may be partaking of this illicit tobacco trade. They're actually funding these operations by buying chop-chop.


We must take every step possible to crack down on illicit tobacco and the people who run these illegal operations. Since 1 July 2015, over 114 people have been charged with tobacco related border offences. However, only 69 of those charged have been successfully prosecuted under the Customs Act. There are a number of limitations with the existing tobacco related revenue evasion offences in the Customs Act and the Excise Act because the offences are inconsistent. The Customs Act offences only apply when knowledge of defrauding or intention to defraud revenue can be proven. By comparison, the Excise Act offences are associated with relatively low penalties and do not provide a sufficient deterrent to those dealing in illicit tobacco. Events can only be successfully prosecuted if it can be proven whether tobacco was imported or produced domestically. Because of these inconsistencies, neither officers of customs, who administer the Customs Act, nor officers of the Australian Taxation Office, who administer the Excise Act, are currently able to target the full range of illicit tobacco offences.


The bill before the House amends the Customs Act 1901 to create two new offences in respect of importing illicit tobacco based on recklessness and ensures customs officers can investigate and enforce new illicit tobacco offences relating to the proof of origin in the Taxation Administration Act 1953. In addition to this, there are paragraphs that create new offences which lower the standard of proof from intention to defraud or knowledge of defrauding revenue to recklessness. Recklessness is a lower standard of culpability than intention or knowledge. With these amendments, customs officers will be able to target a wider range of participants in the illegal tobacco trade and strengthen the illicit tobacco enforcement regime in Australia. In turn, this will allow greater opportunities for successful prosecution of those involved in the illicit tobacco market.


The bill also proposes to extend the power to arrest without warrant under section 210 of the Customs Act if an officer of customs or police believes on reasonable grounds the person has committed or is committing an offence. Labor supports this. It should be noted, however, that the power of arrest without a warrant can only be exercised if an officer believes on reasonable grounds that proceedings by summons against a person would not achieve one or more of the several purposes set out in the Customs Act. It's appropriate for the power to arrest without warrant to be extended to prevent the continuation of illicit tobacco offences and to ensure that people appear before the court in relation to those offences.


Whilst we welcome the measure to combat illicit tobacco, we on this side of the House are always prepared to hold this out-of-touch Turnbull government to account. As I referred to in my second reading amendment, the Turnbull government is relying on a one-off tobacco tax collection timing trick to help them bring up a budget surplus. In the 2018-19 budget, the Turnbull government miraculously announced that they were going to achieve surplus in 2019-20, a year earlier than previously anticipated. 


Currently, importers who import tobacco are required to pay duty when the tobacco leaves a warehouse. As a result of this, there have been instances of tobacco being removed from warehouses without duty being paid, resulting in the illicit tobacco entering the Australian supply chain. In an effort to combat this, from 1 July 2019 importers will be required to pay all duty and tax liability when tobacco enters the country rather than when it leaves a licensed warehouse and enters the domestic market.


As a result of this measure, the Turnbull government announced a transitional measure, with importers having 12 months to pay tax on tobacco stored in warehouses. This means that, instead of duty being collected in the latter years, when it leaves a warehouse the revenue of over $3 billion will be collected in the 2019-20 financial year—a timing trick perpetrated to achieve a budget surplus. The 2019-20 financial year is also the year in which the Turnbull government says it will reach a $2.2 billion surplus—a $2.2 billion surplus and a $3 billion timing trick to achieve it. The Turnbull government is using the risk of illicit tobacco entering the market to reach a surplus a year earlier than they previously anticipated or expected to announce it. It is clear that, without this one-off tobacco tax collection timing trick, the Turnbull government would not be able to achieve a surplus in 2019-20 as they claim they will. I note that this measure will require another piece of legislation, currently titled the Customs Amendment (Collecting Tobacco Duties at the Border) Bill in the legislation proposed to be introduced in the spring sittings, as circulated by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.


Labor is awaiting this legislation to be introduced in the House and the government's further admission that without this additional revenue they will not be able to achieve a surplus one year ahead of schedule. Of course Labor have supported measures before the House when we've seen better and more improved economic reforms to pay down Australia's debt and to ensure bigger surpluses and a fair and sustainable taxation system for all Australians. For example, this plan from our side of the chamber involves capital gains tax reforms and reforms in relation to excessive dividend imputation credits, which crack down on an unsustainable tax loophole that gives tax refunds to people who don't actually pay income tax.


Labor has made a strong commitment historically in relation to getting rid of the scourge of smoking. Smoking accounts for 15,000 deaths every year in this country. Policy reforms implemented by former Labor governments made significant advancements towards drastically reducing that number—for example, what Australia did under the last Labor government in becoming the first country in the world to introduce plain packaging for cigarettes. We also increased the excise rate applying to tobacco products by 25 per cent as part of our budget, and we commend the government for mimicking what we had to do. We invested money—for example, $61 million in a national tobacco campaign. We introduced legislation to bring restrictions on internet advertising of tobacco products into line with advertising on other media. We took a strong, principled stance.


Unfortunately, there are parties on the other side of the chamber who have been shamelessly accepting donations from big tobacco. The latest records from the Australian Electoral Commission show that the National Party accepted $15,700 in donations from the tobacco industry in the 2016-17 financial year. This is simply not good enough. It's not good enough to say one thing in this chamber, to say one thing about the tobacco scourge and reducing deaths and illness in relation to tobacco related illness in this country, but to do another thing in Canberra or organisationally in your party. We don't think that's good enough.


I think the Prime Minister should explain why it's acceptable for his coalition partners to fill their coffers with donations from the tobacco industry. On this side of the chamber we've consistently shown our commitment to policies to reduce the instances of tobacco related illness and disease in this country. We support the passage of this bill through the House to stop the scourge of illicit tobacco and ultimately improve health outcomes for all Australians. I commend the legislation and the amendment to the chamber.



The SPEAKER:  Is the amendment seconded?




Mr Snowdon:
  Yes, and I reserve my right to speak.

"O'Brien, Ted, MP",LP,2018-08-14,"



Mr TED O'BRIEN
 (Fairfax) (12:14):  The Customs Amendment (Illicit Tobacco Offences) Bill 2018, with measures making policing of the market in illicit tobacco more fit for purpose, is a very important part of the long-running, largely bipartisan effort to reduce the human and dollar costs of smoking. These costs come in at around 15,000 lives and $30 billion in health services on an annual basis, and we can add to that a recent and rapidly increasing loss of revenue from the surging black market in illicit tobacco. These are enormous costs, and governments at all levels—federal, state and local—have been working to reduce them since the mid-1990s—with considerable success, I might add.


As recently as the mid-1990s, almost one-quarter of all Australian adults smoked. That is now down to about 13 per cent, with the trend suggesting it can and will be driven considerably lower, saving lives and billions of dollars, in what has been a remarkable policy turnaround spaced over several decades. In the 1930s, before the links between smoking and disease were established, the tobacco industry in Australia was actually promoted and protected. Federal law in that era required that 50 per cent of the tobacco in cigarettes be Australian grown, which embedded a strong tobacco-growing industry in Queensland and Victoria. The proportion of local content was even boosted, to 57 per cent, as late as 1977.


But progressively, and certainly very strongly by the early 1990s, a range of factors came into play that led to a pretty sudden and absolute about-face. Freer trade, with significantly lower tariffs, meant that previous constraints on the importation of cheaper tobacco were reduced, which in turn crippled the relatively high-cost local industry. After a restructuring scheme, the industry shrank from about 600 growers in the 1970s to no growers by 2006. Almost simultaneously, there was a growing awareness of the appalling health and financial costs of smoking, which quickly gave rise to a highly effective legislative and regulatory campaign against tobacco use in this country. Advertising was banned in 1992, and since then, especially over the past decade, antitobacco, pro-taxpayer measures have proliferated. Excise was increased by 25 per cent in 2010. Plain packaging with graphic health warnings was instituted in 2011. In 2013, annual 12½ per cent increases in excise began, going through to 2017. In the 2016-17 budget, those increases were extended through to 2020 as part of a broader package of measures instituted by this government to increase the national effort against smoking, with this bill being part of that package. As a result, thousands of lives will be extended, and many billions of dollars will now be available for more productive work on behalf of Australian taxpayers.


But the success of this ongoing campaign to reduce the human cost and the dollar cost of tobacco consumption has created major challenges for law enforcement. As a direct result of having created the most expensive tobacco market in the world, we have made ourselves a big target for illegal products, especially from countries to our north, who have some of the lowest tobacco prices in the world. In China, for example, a pack of 20 cigarettes retails for about $3.40, compared with about $25 to $26 here. In South Korea, the price is about $3.60. In Indonesia, it's under $2 a pack. The temptation for criminals is obvious: produce or buy cheaply in any number of countries then smuggle the product into Australia, deliberately avoiding customs duties, and you'll make a lot of money. Today's illicit tobacco trade operates in much the same way cheap booze from Canada and the Caribbean flooded into the United States during the prohibition era—to enrich and empower vast criminal enterprises. 


The ATO and the Department of Home Affairs estimate that almost $600 million in tobacco duty was forgone in the 2015-16 financial year due to Australia's illicit tobacco trade. Regular reports by KPMG that seek to quantify the scale of the illegal market suggest the cost of this illicit tobacco could be as high as $1½ billion in avoided duties, based on the estimate that about 14 per cent of tobacco sold in Australia is now illegal. If KPMG is right, one in seven cigarettes smoked in Australia avoid excise duty. The impact of that at a national level is twofold. One is revenue lost. Tobacco taxes currently contribute around $9 billion annually for taxpayers, with that number set to grow exponentially given the ongoing big increases in excise. By 2020, excise revenue will likely be around $13 billion. The second highly likely impact is a reduction in the rate at which people either quit or resist the smoking habit due to an increasingly ready access to cheap illicit tobacco products. Should this impact be felt, any resurgence of tobacco use will, as a consequence, have a discernible negative impact on national life expectancy and health costs.


But, in addition to the border national impacts of lower revenue and higher health costs, there are also some very important local impacts, including loss of income for many hardworking small businesses who are in fact selling the real deal, the real thing. While regularly doorknocking businesses across my electorate, it has become apparent to me how many small businesses are being hurt by this illicit trade. Many of these are convenience stores; they're tobacconists; they're newsagencies—businesses that already operate on very tight margins, and they rely on their local trade. These businesses already face the challenge of supplying a highly regulated product to an even smaller customer base—a customer base that has reduced significantly over the years, as we have already noted. However, while it has been government policy for many years to discourage tobacco use and offset the burgeoning public health cost, these retailers do remain law-abiding tax-paying businesses. These are Australian businesses, employing Australians. And while the ultimate public policy objective, through education, excise and regulation, remains consistent, this does not mean that small businesses should face the added burden of aggressive competition from a criminal black market in illicit tobacco. Clearly we need to increase our efforts to not just stall the growth of smuggled product but cut into it as deeply as possible with tougher laws and more rigorous controls at the border via new agencies, such as the Tobacco Strike Team recently established by Australian Border Force.


That's one task, but it's not the only one, because a second layer of activity in relation to excise avoidance is now also in play, with illegal onshore tobacco cultivation making something of a comeback. In March last year, a crop worth $11 million was discovered in New South Wales near Cooma. In March this year, 4.2 tonnes of tobacco leaf and 12 acres of crop were discovered near Ballarat in Victoria. In April, in the largest cross-agency investigation that that Australian tax office has been involved in, a $60 million operation was discovered in the Bundaberg region in Queensland. There are many other examples, but that sample is indicative of the fact that the profit motive for criminals intent on avoiding their liability to pay excise duty has grown domestically as well as internationally, in lock step with the increase in tobacco price.


In a 2015 report, the Australian Crime Commission suggested that organised crime syndicates are deeply involved in this multibillion dollar racket because the rewards are great and, currently, the risks are slight. The very clear likelihood—the inevitability, you could say—is that this sort of activity is going to increase unless it is checked by tougher laws and more rigorous activity by our border and tax authorities.


This bill involves giving Australian Border Force personnel improved tools for dealing what has proved to be a significant problem in prosecuting smugglers at the border under the current form of the Customs Act. The act requires that, in order to lay the groundwork for a prosecution, knowledge or intent by principals to avoid excise-equivalent customs duty is required. Experience has established that proving such knowledge or intent to the level necessary for a successful prosecution is extremely difficult. Indeed, it is nigh on impossible in the face of people who are well-trained agents of, typically, highly organised crime syndicates, with a fine understanding of the fact that the Australian law requires extremely high levels of proof.


The bill therefore amends the Customs Act. The Customs Act will be changed to reduce the onus from knowledge or intent to avoid duties to one of recklessness, whereby perpetrators will be culpable for what is a lesser offence if it is established that their involvement with the importation of illicit product was undertaken with a reckless attitude towards whether duty was intended to be paid or not.


Other linked measures are contained in a separate bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Illicit Tobacco Offences) Bill, which was introduced into the parliament on 15 February. That bill eases one of the biggest problems that officers of the Australian Taxation Office have in prosecuting matters around illicit tobacco when it is discovered beyond the border. A current requirement of the law is that officers must be able to determine whether the product they are dealing with has been produced domestically or overseas to establish whether the issue is one of customs duty or excise evasion. That is a requirement that has also proved extremely difficult to establish. Attempts have been made to analyse samples to establish whether their origins are local or international to settle that question, but such is the nature of tobacco plants that that has proved impossible. Lack of cooperation from those being investigated, or their lack of knowledge, can stymie authorities on the spot. The Treasury bill therefore removes the need to establish origin. What will have to be established is a reasonable suspicion that either customs duty or excise duty has been avoided, whatever the actual source of the product.


This is an important battle and these are important bills in that context. At stake is an improvement in life expectancy for a significant number of Australians. At stake is the massive health bill that this significant number incur. Also at stake are billions of dollars in revenue that should accrue on behalf of taxpayers but is currently going to criminals and often to well-organised crime syndicates that channel their gains to help finance even further crime. Destroying this criminal enterprise completely may be beyond us. Nonetheless, doing all we can to minimise it remains our key responsibility, and it's for these reasons that I commend the bill to the House.

"Wilson, Tim, MP",LP,2018-08-14,"



Mr TIM WILSON
 (Goldstein) (12:29):  I would like to continue on from the contribution of the member for Fairfax, an excellent contribution no less, to this important discussion around the Customs Amendment (Illicit Tobacco Offences) Bill 2018. The basis of my short remarks is to support the bill and the spirit and the intent in which it seeks to achieve its outcome in the context of existing law, because I do have broader concerns about the operation of the regulatory framework and the way in which we engage with this product—tobacco—and the consequences it has in fuelling the illicit trade.


Illegal tobacco threatens the safety and health of our community and the viability of local business operators, and the measures in this bill will arm customs officers, Border Force agents, with the tools to fight organised crime and their illegal tobacco trade. I don't dispute its objectives, and they're very good ones, and that's the basis upon which I will be supporting this bill. But we also cannot forget part of the reason we are in this situation. It is because of the measures that we have taken to date and what they have done to fuel the illicit trade. I was not in this parliament at the time these matters were considered, but had I been I would have raised my deep reservation around, particularly, some of the ways that we sought to tackle the challenges around illicit tobacco, as well as the incapacity, or the inability, to address some issues that we confront today. 


From 2013 to 2016, Australia's smoking rate fell by a dismal 0.6 per cent. This came off the back of a long period of reform to try and reduce the consumption of tobacco. In many cases, I support those measures. As somebody for whom tobacco contributed to the early death of three out of four grandparents, I believe strongly in tackling these issues. But we made a series of questionable judgements in the past. The first is the constant increase in tax rates and excise on tobacco. This makes it a more desirable product because the cost basis of production is becoming increasingly distant from the price of consumption. That gap, or the consumer surplus that grows with the increase in the tax rate, means that it becomes a more desirable product for organised crime, because the margins that can be secured from engaging in the trade are considerable. And that will not change. So long as we keep the excise at the rate that it is we will continue to encourage illegal gangs and those engaging in ill means to engage in the illicit tobacco trade. But we've doubled down on that by not just increasing the tax rate, increasing the consumer surplus and increasing the desirability and attractiveness of this trade by increasing the tax rate; we have also increased the desirability of this product by making it interchangeable. 


A couple of parliaments ago this parliament introduced plain packaging legislation in the Commonwealth of Australia. And what was the consequence of plain packaging? It took a product that was already of high value and had a high consumer surplus and said, 'Now it is interchangeable, indistinguishable.' That's the whole point of plain packaging legislation—to take a product and remove its branding so consumers can see no difference, while at the same time increasing and ratcheting up the price. So, its desirability goes up, it's capacity to be engaged in counterfeiting and illicit production increases even more dramatically, as do the benefits of illicit trade. This is the fundamental problem with this approach to dealing with issues around tobacco regulation. You're actually fuelling, or at least increasing the risk of fuelling, the illicit trade, mostly to the benefit of criminal gangs. That's what comes out very clearly in different pieces of research and reports. We know that illicit consumption is up. We know the illicit trade is up. We know that the loss to government revenue continues to increase, year on year, and it's aided and abetted by the measures that have been consistently applied by previous parliaments. 


The challenge for us, if we want to cut tobacco consumption—and I do—is to introduce measures that actually help cut consumption, reduce the desirability for criminal gangs to be involved in the trade and to take advantage of the consequences of our legislative arrangements, and look at measures that work. We actually did an entire inquiry, in the Standing Committee on Health, Aged Care and Sport, on the legal accessibility of e-cigarettes and vaporisers and the legalisation of vaping as an alternative to smoking. What the data showed from these reports, looking at international research and the experience of other countries—even when I was in Manchester only recently speaking to health officials—is a very clear and consistent message. People did not think that vaping was necessarily the best measure that they would like to see. They'd rather see people quit, as would I. If they don't quit, particularly those stubborn lifelong smokers, then in the absence of that finding a harm reduction alternative is incredibly important. Vaping fills that critical and important gap. That is so much so that, as I learned when I was in the UK recently and spoke to health officials in Manchester, they now actively promote it as a measure to help reduce people's consumption and behaviour in light of the circumstances. So we put that against the backdrop of what we've been doing in tobacco, which is making it more profitable and more substitutable for criminal gangs, but we haven't then gone on and said that we should support the measures that we need to make sure that we can actually cut smoking rates.


I have to say that I have real concerns about the framework of the approach that many people are taking in this policy space, because it's not actually cutting smoking rates. It is rewarding criminals. It's not helping the consumers. It's also not helping, of course, one of the critical bases on which we have been told we have to support various bits of legislation, which is to increase government revenue to offset the consequences of tobacco consumption. Sadly and tragically, this approach that we have taken, for which we have sometimes been extolled internationally for being a world leader, is being adopted everywhere else. That isn't to say that there isn't a role for tax as part of disincentivising people from consuming tobacco. That's true, and that is a critical part of what we need to do, because there are some people who do have an inelastic approach and do need that incentive. But it would be foolhardy to say that it has not gone to quite incredible extremes in recent years. As I said, when you overlay that with the issues around plain packaging, you see the same consequences. We know that other countries have followed suit and followed us. Despite extolling the virtues of the plans around these policies, the UK, Ireland, France and New Zealand have, frankly, had deeply questionable outcomes, as we have, in the efficacy of these policies.


Of course, when we talk about the efficacy of these policies, yes, we're talking about things like government revenue. That's an impact, but the real impact is on human lives. Sadly, there are too many health sociologists parading themselves as public health officials who would rather keep supporting bad ideas they've come up with and taken ownership of than do the right thing and change the laws to enable people to have a pathway to reduce their consumption and hopefully move towards cessation.


I would hope that this parliament takes note. I would hope that this parliament seeks to consider other alternatives to reduce tobacco consumption in Australia and to improve the livelihoods, the health and the wellbeing of Australians who are caught in the trap and curse of tobacco consumption and nicotine addiction. That is why I am a proud supporter of people being able to access vaporisers and vape legally, not just with vaporisers but also with the capsules. If you want to introduce a policy framework which actually cuts tobacco consumption, that is the pathway in which you do it, on top of constraining and suffocating the criminal gangs who engage in taking advantage of the consequences of the laws we now have on the book. The consequences of the laws are the increase in the price of a product, the increase in the consumer surplus and the increase in the gap between the production and the consumption and the price, which makes it a very profitable industry for those who want ill-gotten gains. The measures we have taken have also made it a substitutable product, which has only exacerbated the already existing problems of that regime.


That's why I support this bill, because ultimately it works to empower and enable those Customs officers to do what they need to do to suffocate that trade. But that trade can be supported in its suffocation by reducing demand from consumers, because people no longer see the advantage of engaging in tobacco consumption and see the advantage of alternatives as a pathway to at least harm minimisation and hopefully cessation. If we do that, we would have a healthier, happier, longer living nation of people, with reduced dependence on nicotine addiction.




Mr Hawke:
  Tell us a bit more about that, would you? Keep going. Give a bit of a recap!




Mr Tim Wilson:
  I know I'm not alone in supporting this important issue in this parliament. I know a number of other members have spoken very directly about the importance of reducing tobacco consumption, some on the other side of this parliament and some on this side of the chamber as well. I know that there are other members who have been steadfast, dutiful and loyal to the pursuit of trying to reduce consumption, like the member for North Sydney and the member for Bowman, who support me on the quest to try to remove the barriers that stop people from getting off tobacco and onto alternatives, particularly vaporisers. I congratulate them for their efforts, their leadership and their courage in standing and doing the right thing. I wish I could see many more people stand up and follow their leadership on this important issue.


In the same way, I'd like to see an honest assessment of and honest reflection on the challenges we face in the tobacco consumption space and a proper consideration of the laws that are already on the books. I remember that back in the day when legislative arrangements around plain packaging were introduced, people said it was going to deliver all these wonderful things. But the truth is that consumption largely stagnated. It didn't actually have that effect, but we've gone on and extolled its virtues all around the world, mostly to fan the notoriety, professionalism and awards showered on the former health minister. But has it actually delivered the outcome? It's a classic problem that many people, including people like Milton Friedman used to argue, which is that you shouldn't judge a policy on its intent, but on its outcomes. When you judge a policy on its intent and not its outcomes, this is the situation you end up with—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Rob Mitchell
):  Member for Goldstein, don't bang the desk any more. Enough! You've previously been warned by the Speaker.




Mr Tim Wilson:
  It's the passion I feel for the topic.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  It is not appropriate behaviour in the chamber.




Mr Tim Wilson:
  This is the consequence when you judge a policy on its intent and not its outcomes: you have a ballooning illicit trade, which is to the benefit of those people who, let's face it, are the scum of the earth—organised gangs and those who seek to take advantage of the legislative arrangements and work the consequences of legislation and regulation to their own commercial benefit. I would have thought that people in this parliament would look at that situation and say, 'It is a travesty.' We have, of course, seen this before. If we go back to the prohibition movement in the United States in the 1920s, unsurprisingly, people produced products at a low price but were able to charge high prices because of their seemingly illicit and illegal nature. What occurred, of course, was that people found ways to profiteer and to make enormous benefits out of it for their own personal gain. And, frankly, they left a trail of human tragedy and misery behind them; but that did not concern them, hence I use the expression 'scum of the earth'.


That is the problem that we continue to face in this policy space. That's why we have to reflect very seriously on our policy objectives and what we're seeking to do in terms of achieving them and implementing them. We know that where there is a regulation that is unjust or has some sort of exceptional consequence, particularly for an interchangeable product, there is a way around it. There has been a long tradition of this. I used the example going back to the prohibition movement, where people found justifications to continue their consumption of alcohol. Some people used to shroud it in the environment of their faith and that they needed it as part of their access to faith. But, more critically, even people who were trying to do the right thing and comply with the law found ways around it—like people selling hops, barley and water and putting warning signs up: 'Warning, if you mix these ingredients then you will break the law and create beer.' That's how people got around it and took advantage of the legislative arrangements. Those are the sorts of lessons we should learn from and not repeat.

Mr TAYLOR
 (Hume—Minister for Law Enforcement and Cyber Security) (12:44):  I'd like to thank all honourable members for their contributions to this debate on the Customs Amendment (Illicit Tobacco Offences) Bill 2018, including and particularly the contributions of the members for Fairfax and Goldstein and the other members who made their contributions. As those members well know—indeed, as some of them have raised it with me on prior occasions—criminals who profit from the trade in illicit tobacco undermine the government's strategies to promote good public health outcomes and they threaten the viability of law-abiding local business operators.


This bill enhances border and law enforcement agencies' ability to investigate and prosecute the illegal importation of tobacco and supports the new illicit tobacco offences contained in the related Treasury Laws Amendment (Illicit Tobacco Offences) Bill 2018. Together these two bills establish a comprehensive set of offences targeting the importation, possession, purchase, sale and production of illicit tobacco. The amendments will make it easier for the Australian Border Force and the Australian Taxation Office to investigate and prosecute criminals who are involved in the illicit tobacco trade, regardless of its origin, whether smuggled or grown domestically. New offences will allow enforcement officers to target a wider range of participants in the illicit tobacco trade and will enable our courts to impose severe fines and lengthy prison sentences on criminals who engage in deliberate and highly calculated defrauding of the Australian public.


The framework the government seeks to legislate is backed up by our commitment to over $70 million in funding to the ABF-led Illicit Tobacco Taskforce in the 2018-19 budget. Together with its predecessor, the Tobacco Strike Team, the Illicit Tobacco Taskforce has seen considerable operational success since its establishment, including as recently as last weekend. Last financial year the ABF detected more than 240 million cigarettes and 217 tonnes of tobacco at the border. Worth over $356 million, it evaded duty that would otherwise have belonged to the Australian taxpayers, the Australian public. While it has been illegal to grow tobacco in Australia for over a decade, since July 2016 the ATO has seized 231 tonnes of illicit tobacco, worth an estimated $194 million in forgone tobacco duty.


The Turnbull government is committed to stamping out the trade in illicit tobacco and disrupting the serious and organised criminal groups that profit from it. On that note, I commend the bill to the House.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Rob Mitchell
):  I thank the minister. The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Blair has moved an amendment that all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The immediate question is that the amendment be agreed to.

Mr JOSH WILSON
 (Fremantle) (13:30):  Yesterday, the government moved forward with its ridiculous plan to make life harder for prospective university students and graduates. At a time when our economic future depends on a smarter, better trained workforce, at a time when we should be working to reduce inequality and to improve access to education, this government has decided to whack low-income Australians. While it remains committed to giving away $17 billion to profitable banks and multinationals, it's put the squeeze on younger Australians and people who are seeking to retrain in the face of a changing jobs environment.


When HECS was introduced in 1990, the repayment threshold was $22,000. That was 73 per cent of average male earnings at the time. Now this Turnbull government has decided to drop the current threshold from $55,000 to $45,000, which is less than 60 per cent of average earnings. This change will likely have a particular effect, a particular impact, on women, who are already disadvantaged by the gender pay gap and who, in the case of single mums, will be dealing with a combined sharp impact of marginal tax rates and reduction in family support. That means that some women will know that, if they earn one dollar more than $45,000, they will instantly be worse off.


This punishment of graduates in my electorate and across Western Australia is in addition to the government's general hit on universities: cuts of $86 million to Curtin University, $49 million to Edith Cowan, $35 million to Murdoch, $38 million to the University of Western Australia— (Time expired)

"Butler, Mark, MP",ALP,2018-08-14,"



Mr BUTLER
 (Port Adelaide) (15:13):  All Australian households and all Australian businesses know all too deeply that a deep, profound energy crisis has emerged under this Prime Minister. That deep energy crisis has led to a collapse in confidence in our energy system, and it's seen power bills go up and up for households and for businesses. It's very clear what we need to start to bring that crisis to an end. We need sensible, centrist, bipartisan energy policy. But what we saw today by this Prime Minister was the final act of capitulation to the hard Right of the coalition party room on climate change and energy policy. We saw the big man at the press conference declaring victory over his nemesis, the former Prime Minister, but actually what happened in that coalition party room was a weak act of surrender. The white flag is flying high over the Prime Minister's office now because what he announced at the press conference was an energy plan that will not see a single renewable energy project built for a decade, an energy plan that will see the rates of installation of rooftop solar cut by a half and an energy plan that will channel billions and billions of taxpayers' money to building new coal-fired power stations. This is a plan that will smash jobs and investment in renewables. It will achieve no significant cuts in pollution from this sector that is responsible for a third of the total carbon pollution in our economy and it will push power prices up even further.


Whatever debate there was, and whatever media leaking and speculation there was, it is very clear that this was a victory for the right wing in the coalition party room. And the fact that the former Deputy Prime Minister, the member for New England, was able to support this energy plan tells you everything you need to know about it. This Prime Minister, who once said he would not lead a party that was not as committed to effective action on climate change as he was, has joined the war against renewable energy and bizarrely decided to spend billions of dollars of taxpayers' money on new coal-fired power stations. Any credibility this man had in supporting evidence-based policy and in taking serious action on climate change and power prices lies in tatters today.


For two years the Labor Party has been constructive about this policy area. On the emissions intensity scheme that the minister supported before he was vetoed by the former Deputy Prime Minister in 2016 and on the clean energy target, which, again, the Prime Minister and the minister for energy supported last year before being vetoed by the former Prime Minister, federal Labor offered its support in spite of the fact that they were not our preferred policy prescriptions.


On this National Energy Guarantee we have also been consistently constructive and consistently positive, but what the Prime Minister has offered up today is a plan to smash renewables and to channel taxpayers' money into building coal-fired power stations. We cannot support that. The National Energy Guarantee, which is still the subject of negotiations at the COAG process, is an investment framework, but you have to have a plan for investment to make it mean something. This government's plan for investment will not see a single new renewable energy project built for an entire decade. It will smash investment. The National Energy Guarantee is a vehicle for our energy system that this government intends to drive back to the 1950s. Australians will end up paying the price for this Prime Minister's abject weakness.


This plan will smash jobs in renewable energy. It will cause thousands of job losses, according to all modelling, in the renewable energy industry. Just as the former Prime Minister caused one in three jobs in the renewable energy sector to be lost in their last attack on this industry, according to the ABS, this plan will do nothing to cut pollution—nothing!


The firm that's done the modelling for the National Energy Guarantee for this government and the Energy Security Board, Acil Allen, has pointed out recently that a sector responsible for a third of the carbon pollution in our economy—the electricity sector—will do just one-twentieth of the job of reducing pollution to achieve this government's inadequate Paris targets, leaving all the rest of the heavy lifting to other sectors of the economy that don't have low-cost technology available to do it for them, because this Prime Minister is too weak to take the argument up for a serious and ambitious emissions reduction obligation on the electricity sector.


It will also do nothing on prices. Particularly this minister trumpets a $550 saving for households from his policy. Where have we heard that before? That's got an odd ring of familiarity to it for most Australian households, who very clearly remember this same party promising that the power bills for Australian households five years ago would go down by $550. I don't know about my colleagues on this side, or on the other side, but I suspect none of them have had a constituent come up and say how glad they are that the Liberal Party's promise was fulfilled—that their power bills went down by $550—because the experience across the country has been power bills going up and up under this government. The $550, or $400 anyway, according to the modelling—that merchant bankers' gobbledegook, to use the language of the member for Warringah—is connected to Labor's Renewable Energy Target, the bill to discharge the Renewable Energy Target, which this government, thankfully unsuccessfully, tried to abolish a few years ago. The other $150 is some theoretical decrease in borrowing costs for new energy projects. It is hard to see how that will end up in householders' pockets, when the government's own modelling shows that a not a single new project will actually be built. This is funny money that households will never end up seeing. What households will end up seeing under this government, particularly pensioner households and households in receipt of allowances, is a $365 cut to the energy supplement. If they are a couple they will see a cut of around $550 a year, not the $150 funny money through a reduction in borrowing costs. This is real money that this government has been trying for two years now to cut from some of our lowest income households.


According to all of the modelling and all of the expert advice, the surest way to bring down power prices is to expand renewable energy. Modelling by RepuTex released only a few weeks ago showed that wholesale power prices under Labor's more ambitious plan to cut emissions by 45 per cent would be 25 per cent lower through the course of the 2020s than under this government's inadequate plan, which will see no investment and no downward pressure on power prices.


But perhaps the most abjectly weak element of the Prime Minister's announcement today is that over the last few days he has decided to channel billions of taxpayers' dollars into building new coal-fired power plants, which the industry itself has said are uninvestable. Kerry Schott, the Chair of the Energy Security Board, the board providing advice on energy policy to this government, has said there is no way companies will be investing in new coal-fired power stations, not just because they take eight to 12 years to build, not just because they're massively more expensive than solar and wind power, a fact borne out by the government's own modelling, and not just because of the enormous carbon risk, the price risk and the regulatory risk that investors are shying away from, but because they're simply not going to work in the modern electricity market. The member for Eden-Monaro pointed out in his first question to the Prime Minister—and I'm sure he will have more to say about it this afternoon—that Snowy Hydro has made it very clear that you can have new coal or you can have Snowy 2.0. You simply cannot have both. Snowy 2.0 works only in an environment where there is substantial new building of renewable energy, something that the Prime Minister has weakly vetoed in his announcement today. For this government—which I originally thought had a plan to land an energy policy that would have broad political and industry support—to achieve that plan, this Prime Minister had to stare down the hard Right. We've seen today that he's too weak to do it. He has completely capitulated to the anti-renewables ideology of the hard right wing of the party room. Australians will pay the price. They will pay the price for his weakness. They will pay the price in fewer jobs, more pollution and higher power prices.

"Frydenberg, Josh, MP",LP,2018-08-14,"



Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong—Minister for the Environment and Energy) (15:23):  When the coalition came to government, it inherited a basket case of an energy system from the Labor Party. We all remember the chaos and dysfunction that characterised the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years. We remember prices going up each and every year. We remember Australian households being hit by a doubling of energy prices when Labor was in office. We remember that great Athenian model of democracy, the citizen's assembly. We remember Cash for Clunkers, that great idea that was right up there with pink batts. And we remember the dreaded carbon tax, which imposed a multibillion-dollar impost on Australian families and businesses, so much so that Labor had to spend billions of dollars of Australian taxpayers' money shovelling it out the door in one hit to the coal-fired generators. You don't hear them talk about that much anymore. That was the Labor Party's record when they were in office. We know that the member for Port Adelaide was quite embarrassed by it, because he put out a book called Climate Wars, in which he said:


The truth is that we in Labor had sent too many mixed signals about climate policy …


… we've made mistakes in … the design of our policies—


and, wait for it—


… Australia's voters were determined to see the back of the Labor Government.


That's the reality of what happened when Labor was in office. They also ignored the advice of their own Energy Market Operator about the impact that the large gas export industry on the east coast of Australia would have on the supply-demand dynamic, driving prices up and reliability down. That was the impact of their ignoring of the Energy Market Operator's advice in their own energy document.


We came to government with that situation. What did we do? We abolished the carbon tax. The member for Port Adelaide seems to dispute how much of a saving went to Australian families. The ABS said that the abolition of the carbon tax resulted in the single biggest drop in electricity prices ever recorded. I'm reading from an ACCC press release on 28 July 2015:


The ACCC believes that, given all the available information, the Commonwealth Treasury's estimated $550 cost savings to households is reasonable.


That is the ACCC. Since that time the Abbott and then Turnbull governments have been taking action across the board to reduce power prices. We've done a number of things. We've intervened in the gas market to ensure more gas goes to Australians before it's exported overseas. The ACCC have reported that making that available to the market has seen gas prices drop by up to 50 percent. That is good news not only for electricity users, because, as some of the big coal-fired generators have come out of the system, gas has been setting the price of electricity about twice as much as previously, but also for large energy users for whom gas is an important feedstock. I'm talking about the fertiliser, chemical and paper industries and so forth.


Wholesale electricity prices are falling significantly. The wholesale electricity price is down by about 25 per cent this year. Last week the wholesale spot price was around $68 per megawatt hour compared to $101 per megawatt hour at the same time last year. That is happening as a result of the Turnbull government's interventions. Network costs have also been cut. Rates of return when Labor was in office were about eight to 10 per cent. It has now fallen to around five to six per cent. That can be worth a couple of hundred dollars a year to households. I took legislation through this parliament successfully abolishing the limited merits review, which has meant that no longer are the networks gaming the system. If Labor had done that when they were in office, they would have saved Australian consumers $6.5 billion, but they didn't do it; it has been up to us. Now we have a new binding rate of return, which could also save significant costs to consumers.


We're helping customers to get a better deal through the retail market. Since the Prime Minister's meeting with retailers last August 1.6 million households on expired or default plans have been contacted and offered better deals, half a million households have moved off the expired or default plans to better deals, and another 1.3 million households have got better deals. There's also the government's Energy Made Easy website. For those who are listening on their radios across the country, energymadeeasy.gov.au is the government's comparator website. When you go on it, you can compare your electricity bill to those offered by other retailers and save hundreds of dollars that way. It has had over a million hits since the Prime Minister met with the retailers. Electricity prices turned the corner on 1 July this year when prices came down in Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia, and we're hoping to see the same thing happen when Victoria does a reset in January.


We have also invested in important energy infrastructure. Most importantly, as the member for Eden-Monaro celebrated, welcomed, was delighted, was excited, was jumping from his chair with joy, that the Turnbull government is delivering Snowy 2.0, a major energy infrastructure project, a pumped hydro scheme which will be the largest of its kind in this part of the world, that will be 2,000 megawatts, that will create 5,000 jobs, that will power 500,000 homes. That's the reliability that we are bringing to the east coast of Australia, which Labor never did. We're investing in pumped hydro projects, through ARENA and elsewhere, in Cultana in the Upper Spencer Gulf, in the member for Grey's electorate in South Australia, and in Kingston in Queensland. We've identified 14 high priority or highly probable pumped hydro projects and hydro projects across Tasmania, to help Tasmania become the battery of the nation. We've talked about a second interconnector to provide Tasmanians with energy security and also to provide more power into the east coast of Australia. 


All this work is having an impact, but it also leads us to the National Energy Guarantee, which I'm so pleased that my colleagues endorsed today to take to the next stage, when the states will hopefully sign on before the end of October. The states now have no excuse. They asked our party room to endorse it, and we did. The National Energy Guarantee was put together by the independent experts. Together with our other policies, it will drive electricity bills down by $550 for the average household, and wholesale prices by 20 per cent, which could be worth millions of dollars to the large energy users. It also has the enormous support of industry, business and energy consumer groups. Listen to what Energy Consumers Australia said: 


… the Final Detailed Design of the National Energy Guarantee … includes updated modelling which confirms that the Guarantee can deliver much needed savings for households and businesses.


That was Energy Consumers Australia. What about the Queensland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, representing more than 400,000 Queensland small businesses? I'm speaking to the member for Dawson, because the member for Dawson has many businesses that would be involved with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The Queensland Chamber of Commerce and Industry says:


At the end of the day, the National Energy Guarantee (NEG) promises what we’ve all been waiting for – a downward pressure on electricity prices and policy certainty.


In New South Wales, the 190-year-old New South Wales Business Chamber, with 19,000 businesses, said:


Australia can't afford more flip-flopping on energy policy. We need to get a national energy policy that provides certainty, improves energy affordability and security and reduces emissions before the end of 2018.


There are similar endorsements in Victoria, in Tasmania and across South Australia. We've seen BHP, we've seen Rio Tinto, we've seen Aurora, we've seen Dow Chemical, we've seen the National Farmers' Federation, we've seen BlueScope. We've seen Energy Users Association and Manufacturing Australia. We've just seen the Australian Industry Group; Chemistry Australia, representing a $40 billion industry—the likes of 3M, Dow, Ixom, Qenos, Orica. These are the companies that employ millions of Australians—blue-collar workers. They are imploring us to support the National Energy Guarantee. They say, 'Listen to the experts.' They say, 'Put aside your politicking and your posturing. Get behind a policy that puts consumers first. Get behind a policy that maintains our international competitiveness. Get behind a policy which will reduce the bills of Australian families.' That's why the Turnbull government is getting on with the National Energy Guarantee. That's why the Turnbull government can deliver lower power prices. (Time expired)

Mr CONROY
 (Shortland) (15:33):  I'm proud to rise to speak on this MPI. I'm very delighted to follow the minister, the member for Kooyong, who follows in the proud traditions of the most memorable member for Kooyong, the first colt. I think the current minister is probably the second colt. He certainly replicates Andrew Peacock in being all potential but never realised. That's the sad truth of the minister's contribution, because he skips over one important fact in his speech. He has been in power for five years. They have been in power for five years. They are responsible—



Honourable members interjecting—




Mr CONROY:
  In office, maybe, not in power. They're responsible, over those five years, for a doubling of wholesale energy prices and for the retirement of 5,000 megawatts of coal-fired power without adequate replacement. That is on his desk. That occurred on his watch, but he would have us forget all about that. He would have us forget it, think that we'd just woken up and that yesterday was September 2013 and now we're here, with nothing in between. But what we've had is five years of coalition infighting on energy policy that has led to a doubling of wholesale energy prices. We had Direct Action for three years—that 'fig leaf' and 'fiscal recklessness', as the Prime Minister referred to it. We had Josh's emissions intensity scheme for 12 hours, and what a glorious 12 hours it was! The minister did an interview with Fran Kelly in the morning, which was quite articulate, quite reasonable, quite sensible. Within 12 hours, he'd surrendered. I've had indigestion for longer than Josh's EIS policy! That's the sad truth of Josh's approach. 


We had the clean energy target for a year. Again, it was junked because he couldn't get it through the conservatives in his own party room. Now we've landed at the National Energy Guarantee, the NEG, founded on a six-page letter. We had the minister and the Prime Minister claiming credit today that they stood up to the bullies in the party room and they stood down the conservatives. They stood them down. Unfortunately, seven words undermine his argument completely. Seven words undermine his argument about the NEG: as endorsed by Barnaby Joyce. 'As endorsed by Barnaby Joyce' is the sad truth of this policy. This is abject surrender. This is the equivalent of a nation that's been invaded—as the foreign troops are walking down their main avenue—doing a press conference, saying, 'That was our plan all along. Having those foreign troops walking down our avenues was the plan all along.' It's a sad, sad indictment of energy policy in this country. Such is their abject surrender.


What would the NEG deliver in terms of decarbonising our economy? It would deliver four wind turbines over a decade—not four wind farms, four wind turbines. That is less than what we put in place each week! That is the sad truth of this policy: emissions reductions of fewer than two per cent over a decade. What's even worse is that we're now at a stage in the energy market where investing in renewable energy is also investing in lower power prices. So, by standing in opposition to renewable energy and decarbonising our economy, they are also standing in opposition to reducing power prices. That is the sad truth of their stance. It's been confirmed by RepuTex's economic modelling, which said that if Labor's policy of around 45 per cent emissions reduction is adopted then power prices will be 25 per cent lower than under the proposal by the coalition. Even if you look at the government's claimed $550 of power savings, $400 of the $550 comes from Labor's Renewable Energy Target, not their NEG. 


The sad truth is they are standing against the tide of history. The brutal economic facts are that if you support renewable energy you will not only decarbonise the economy; you will also drive lower power prices. You can achieve both. They stand in opposition to both, because the Prime Minister and the minister couldn't stand up to the former Prime Minister, the member for Warringah; they couldn't stand up to the member for New England; they couldn't stand up to all the other fossils in the party room. But it's not just them who will suffer. It's households in our electorates that will suffer. It's our children who will suffer. It's our grandchildren who will suffer. The government will be condemned by history for this abject surrender. They truly are the quislings, the Vichy French in this debate, giving up all the— (Time expired)

Mr TIM WILSON
 (Goldstein) (15:38):  Let's face it: that was five minutes of our lives that we will never get back! It was not a hole in one on the mini golf course speech. In fact, it was quite the reverse. It was a long diatribe off the worst drive down the fairway from the member for Shortland. But this is the problem that we now have with the Australian Labor Party and their position on energy—incoherent and lacking an understanding about the fundamental nature of the market and what is necessary to deliver cheaper prices to households and reductions in emissions, or how to make sure that when people turn on the switch the light comes on.


I make these remarks as somebody who, frankly, was proud to oppose the emissions trading scheme introduced by the former Labor government—proud of the fact that I fought the carbon tax, which was fundamentally bad policy. It would have undermined the security we needed in this country, it would have shifted too much of the burden onto technology that wasn't able to deliver the outcomes that Australians needed and, ultimately, it would have delivered price hikes well in excess of even the ones we incurred under the bad policies of the previous government. 


That is also why I support the National Energy Guarantee. It's the first policy put down on the table of the nation that actually allows for technologies that produce energy to be compared like for like because they carry obligations. Renewables, with their role of making sure that we provide energy using the forces of the earth, carry with them obligations that they have to be reliable at the same time and they have to compete in a fair marketplace. Fossil fuels—coal or gas, traditional and conventional fuels—have to meet emissions reduction obligations as part of competing against renewables. But you get like for like, apple for apple, not the current opposition's policy, which is simply to favour some technologies, force them into the market and pass the buck onto Australian households and consumers.


That's what the NEG seeks to do—stabilise the market to drive investment to improve the outcome for Australian households. It also spells the end of the bad policy that has infected the national energy grid, led by bad policymaking by people in this place in years past, and the end of programs by allowing them to go to a natural end, like the Renewable Energy Target, which no-one's disputing has forced a lot of renewable energy into the grid but at the incredible expense of reliability—having a stable market—and, of course, at the incredible expense of households, who have had to pick up the bill to subsidise the interests of multinational corporations. 


On the other side of this chamber, they're concerned about the top end of town, despite their protests, but they're only interested in the multinational renewable top end of town. They're interested not in consumers or in the interests of Australian households but merely in the people who come in from overseas and bring technology. And they think they should enjoy a subsidy along the way, often to the extent of tens of millions of dollars.


I compare the end of the RET and all these other programs, and what's being done with the NEG, to the end of tariffs, where you had huge distortions in the economy and the market that were mostly picked up by passing the costs on to consumers. The challenge for this government, which it is actually going to meet through the NEG, is to undo that damage to create a stable environment for new investment and to actually have a competitive market operating that seeks to drive down prices and deliver the outcomes that households and consumers need. 


What will we see if we go down the NEG path? Yes, we will see an increase in investment, and, yes, it will be technology neutral, so we're going to leave it to the market to decide what to invest. Yes, there will be an increase in supply, including of low-cost energy sources, which will deliver cheaper bills for Australian households. That's a pretty good outcome.

Dr MIKE KELLY
 (Eden-Monaro) (15:43):  Well, it's happened again, hasn't it? The Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, all of them, are selling out once again. Brave, brave Sir Malcolm, like a character out of Holy Grail, has bravely turned tail and fled! This man, in his cowering, craven capitulation to the carbon-captured members of his own party room, has given up on the very things he said in this chamber. We were all here, weren't we? We watched that speech he gave, backing in Labor's climate change and renewable energy policy and crossing the floor to vote for it. Where are those days now? Where is this hollow man?


And we've been discussing, of course, the effect of this NEG on the market, renewable energy and climate change. This Prime Minister and this policy are the biggest threat to the Snowy 2.0 project, which they've touted as their great vision. In fact, we know it wasn't. It was just a project Malcolm photobombed that the Snowy Hydro Corporation had in train well before he discovered it. They'd put in their feasibility funding application to ARENA, the body those opposite tried to destroy in February last year before Malcolm turned up in March. And, of course, the Snowy 2.0 project will be funded from their own money and from private investment—not a cent from this government. That's a critical factor: private investment. One of the most important factors of the Snowy 2.0 project was that an economic feasibility study was conducted by Marsden Jacob Associates. That report tells you everything you need to know about the way the market needs to go and about the relevance of Snowy 2.0. This government tried to bury that report. They told Snowy Hydro: 'Don't put that out there, for God's sake. Please don't do it.' That's been confirmed by Snowy Hydro. They've said their shareholder asked them not to put it out there. Eventually, Snowy Hydro did anyway because they had to. Why? Because their investors need to know this information. And the decision that's going to be made in December will be affected by the factors spelt out in this report.


And here is the report. This is it. It exists on the Snowy Hydro website. None of these guys have read it, and I think that is the greatest advertisement for the need for more investment in education, because these guys didn't read the Finkel report and they haven't read any of this. And some journalists need to have a closer look at this, too. What you'll see spelt out, when they talk about the economics, is that the long-term commitment on renewable energy makes the Snowy 2.0 project feasible economically. It gives it its greatest economic and market impact. And what is the long-term commitment that is spelt out in this report? There it is on page 4. That long-term commitment is a target of 60 per cent renewable generation by 2040. There it is in black and white, and it matches, by the way, perfectly with Labor's renewable energy target trajectory.


So it is an ambitious renewable energy target that makes Snowy 2.0 viable. That is the way it will work in relation to the market, by providing the firming to that transition to 100 per cent renewables, so any attempt to slow down that transition to renewables or to reintroduce coal-fired power will threaten the viability. And we know that because the CEO of Snowy Hydro and their chief operating officer have told us that. Paul Broad said: 'From our perspective, new coal doesn't stack up. We'll outcompete them on price and reliability. We can outcompete a new HELE plant. And Snowy 2.0 only stacks up when more coal power exits the market. The amount of coal base load that comes out of the market determines the viability of Snowy 2.0.' And, of course, that's been backed up by other experts, including David Carland, an energy finance specialist, who said that the government has a choice. This is really what underpinned my question today. He said:


The development of a major new coal-fired station will destroy the viability of Snowy 2.0. The federal government needs to make a choice: does it want Snowy 2.0 or does it want a major new coal-fired station.


And everything in this Marsden Jacob report underlines that coal is dead as a future source of power. It will gradually phase out. It spells out the time lines for the major power stations that will die. But it also says that carbon capture and storage and these technologies they tout are not sustainable for the future of the market. In fact, they say:


… the technology is not yet commercially deployed and is unlikely to be viable without a significant price on carbon … This technology has not been proven on a commercial or large scale, its costs are not known, and it is considered unlikely that it will be commercially viable until well into the 2030s.

Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey—Government Whip) (15:48):  One would read into the wording of this matter of public importance today—which is 'The division in the government over its energy policy'—that the Labor Party, of course, doesn't have any division on major issues. I welcome the fact that my party is able to discuss things in a robust way and that there are alternative points of view. I well remember the lead-up to the 2013 election when the member for Hunter was caught on television laughing at the Prime Minister's talking points. The Prime Minister at the time was Julia Gillard. The member for Hunter said: 'I brought the manual with me. I'll see what it says.' There is only one view from the Labor Party because having an alternative view means expulsion from the party. Are we to assume, for instance, by the wording of this MPI, that 100 per cent of Labor Party members are in favour of lifting the renewable target to 45 per cent by 2030 and there's no division in the party? Are we to assume that they are in favour of raising taxes on small and medium business owners? In fact, are we to assume that there is no dissent in their ranks over the policing of the integrity of our borders? Is it 100 per cent over there? Is there no alternative view in the Labor Party? Goodness me! What a load of rubbish! Well, of course there is in the Liberal Party. There are alternative views are on all major topics, and that's something we should be proud of, and we actually foster that within our ranks.


But let me tell you a little bit about electricity. I've said to my party room this morning that I have been around this story of electricity in Australia for, I think, longer than anyone in this House, because it was in 2011 that Alinta came to me and said: 'We are having trouble at our Northern Power Station. What's happening in South Australia is that we're getting an explosion of renewable energy under the auspices of the RET, and it's actually reducing the number of days on which we can sell electricity into the market at a profit.' In 2012 I met with the AEMO commissioner, and he said to me at the time: 'Don't worry about it, Mr Ramsey. Even if the Northern Power Station at Port Augusta closes, the upgraded interconnector will take care of that. South Australia will be all right. You've got nothing to worry about.' Well, he was wrong and I was right, unfortunately. We were plunged into darkness. South Australia currently has 52 per cent renewable energy, and let me tell you: even though there are no longer incentives there in the RET, people are still building. That's fine. I'm not upset about people building wind farms and solar farms. But every one that gets built undermines the business case of the baseload generators. It reduces the number of days a year that they can supply electricity into the market at a profit. But we need them. Even though it might be only 20 days a year or 40 days a year, we absolutely need them, because there are no other answers in the system at the moment.


What the NEG does is provide an incentive for operators to build baseload electricity, because at the moment, as long as those on that side of this House sit across there and say, 'Whatever you do, when we get into government we're going to undo it,' there will be no investment in baseload electricity. We've had an investment freeze for years now. We've got the business community on side. We've got the consumer groups on side. I think we'll get all of the state governments on side, but we've got most of them. What we need is for the Labor Party to come on side and say, 'All right, we accept that for Australia's benefit we need to land on some mutual ground, and we will not promise destruction if elected to parliament.' That's when you'll see the coffers of private investment open up, and they will start to invest in new generation capacity in Australia that will provide baseload electricity to us.


This is our best chance. We have nearly all the balls lined up. This morning in our party room, there was overwhelming support for pushing ahead with this course of action. I am very confident that the minister will reach agreement with the states in the next month or so. What we need—what Australia needs—is a signal from the Labor Party that they'll come on board too and we'll get bipartisanship. I heard a call for bipartisanship on the other side. This is your opportunity. Show the investors of Australia that you've got faith in Australia, you've got faith in the citizens and you want to help reduce power prices, not send power prices northward. Do you really want to go to the next election saying, 'I'm in favour of higher power prices?' (Time expired)

Dr ALY
 (Cowan) (15:54):  I note the member for Grey in his previous contribution kept on deflecting to Labor and calling for bipartisanship, but the biggest threat to energy security in this country is this coalition government's chaos and internal battles. National policy on energy security should deliver two things: it should deliver reliable energy and it should meet our renewable targets. The Prime Minister keeps trying to convince Labor that his government has the settings right, but it's not us that they need to convince. We know where we stand. In 2016, Labor supported an emissions intensity scheme. That scheme was vetoed in the coalition's party room by the backbench. In 2017, we supported the Clean Energy Target. Again, it was vetoed in the coalition's party room by the backbench. And now we get to see the real Prime Minister—a Prime Minister who is unable to lead a party, a Prime Minister who is held hostage by climate change deniers and right-wing ideologues, a Prime Minister who would sell out the future of Australia's energy security to appease a small, vocal minority in his party room.


At the 2018 Future Thinking Conference, hosted by the Energy Users Association of Australia, Dr Kerry Schott opened her presentation with some ideas and with an assurance that no new coal power would be built, NEG or no NEG. She said that there is no longer an investment case to build new coal-fired power stations in Australia, because 'the cost of coal is always going to be more than the cost of wind and sun'. Let me repeat that: 'the cost of coal is always going to be more than the cost of wind and sun'. She continued:


You are unlikely to see a new coal-fired generation plant built unless there is a change in technology and a decline in the price of coal.


The cost of running a clean-coal plant is much more expensive than running a combination of wind, solar and gas, or, better yet, wind, solar and pumped hydro.


She said that her view was 'not contentious at a factual level'. She added that there would be absolutely no way that anybody would be financing a new coal-fired generation plant.


What has been the response to this learned doctor's commentary on the government's proposed NEG? The member for Warringah said he was very disappointed and it suggests 'the system is not technology-neutral and that it is in fact anti-coal'. The member for New England called it 'utterly ridiculous' and the member for Hughes called it 'clueless' and 'misleading'. That is how this coalition government's backbench deals with advice from their own panel of experts.


In my electorate I have a company called Sunvertech, which is a small family-run business owned by Kevin Davies and his son, both of whom are engineers. For several years now they've invested their time, their knowledge, their skills and their resources into developing new renewable technology—into developing inverters and batteries for solar power. They've come a long way in what they've achieved, pouring their hearts and souls into their work. Kevin Davies came to see me the other day, concerned about this government's NEG, and particularly concerned, as we are, that the woefully low emissions targets will ensure that there will be no investment in renewables, despite the fact that renewables are cheaper. The low emissions target that this government has put forward, because this Prime Minister has capitulated to the right-wing of his backbench, will not encourage investment in any large-scale renewable projects for a decade. These are all facts. They are undeniable facts, and the Prime Minister needs to stand up and listen. (Time expired)

"Drum, Damian, MP",Nats,2018-08-14,"



Mr DRUM
 (Murray) (15:59):  Right now, for the first time in quite a while, there is an absolute gulf between the coalition's energy policies and those of the Labor Party. Whilst the Labor Party have previously been sitting on the fence, it now seems they are coming out in abject opposition to the National Energy Guarantee, and it seems as though they are now talking about the fact that higher electricity costs are not a problem for the Australian people but are in fact proof that the system is working. The Labor Party now has this modus operandi which effectively says, 'When we have really high electricity prices, that's proof that everything is just fine.' It's a huge gulf in policy. It's a difference in priorities between those of us representing regional areas, where we understand that many people are having trouble paying their energy bills, be they electricity or gas. More importantly, when they head off to work in high-energy industries and businesses, they're under pressure to hold their jobs, because of the sheer cost of running those businesses.


All this has happened in a state where the Labor Party has a moratorium on gas extraction and exploration. They have some scientific process to look at where the reserves of gas are, but if you want to cut through all the rubbish, you'll find that nothing has happened in relation to gas. They are scared senseless in Victoria, and the state Labor Party are doing absolutely nothing when it comes to onshore gas. They're happy for another part of Australia, like Western Australia, to develop a gas industry and pipe or ship gas over to Victoria, but they don't want any onshore gas in Victoria, because while it's okay for another state, somehow or other it's not okay for Victoria. They are quite happy for the cost of energy and electricity in Victoria to go through the roof, because they have a system of thinking that says, 'We're going to be the environmental guardians of our own state,' but are happy to bring gas into the system that has been extracted in other states. I heard the previous speaker talk about how we should be looking at more wind and solar, backed up by gas. That's fine for Western Australia. I hope that's what they do in Western Australia. We're not allowed to do that in Victoria, because Victoria has stopped any drilling or extraction of gas in that state.


Any onshore gas is taboo, even though none of the 1.5 million gas wells around the world have any scientific evidence to suggest contamination of aquifers or some health problems for the people surrounding them. However, the GetUp!s, the Lock the Gates, the Labor Party and the Greens are all still talking about the evils associated with extracting natural gas from wells around Australia. Unfortunately the poor people in Victoria have to wear this, because that's the leadership that they have. The arguments around gas were previously described by former Labor Party Queensland Premier Anna Bligh, I think, as the worst policy debate that Australia has ever had, because fear, sensationalism and lies have overcome the science. As we know, many of the people in the Greens, and the GetUp!s and the Lock the Gates, are continually putting to the National Party, 'Why don't you believe in climate change and accept the science?' I accept the science associated with climate change; why don't the Labor Party and the Greens accept the science when it comes to gas? They're too scared to accept that there is no science with a negative view of gas exploration.


The current main industry players in Australia are hugely supportive of the NEG. The vast majority of the government party room are hugely supportive of the NEG. The Labor Party seem to think it's a crime if you have a view outside that of the party room, but we in the National and Liberal parties think it the best thing ever that you can speak your mind in this parliament.

Ms TEMPLEMAN
 (Macquarie) (16:04):  What must it be like to know that the future you're leaving your precious grandchildren faces dangers that you could act upon, but those around you won't let you? What must it be like to say to Alice or Isla or Jack or Ronan, 'Sorry kids; as much as I love you, there were some big bullies who wouldn't let me do what I knew was right'?


It must be absolutely galling, but that's exactly what we're seeing opposite, with a hopeless division that means the Prime Minister faces something within his party room that he has no power to control. His weakness means that the future he is leaving, not just for his grandchildren but for all our grandchildren, is a much poorer future. The one legacy he might have been able to leave, the one ambition, the one that cost him his job first time round, the one policy that could have shaped Australia's future as a 21st century energy market and the one policy that could lower energy prices for consumers is yet another thing that the Prime Minister is profoundly failing at. He's too weak to fight the Neanderthal view within his party that we need new coal. That view is not shared by anyone with any credibility anywhere in the world. The chair of the Energy Security Board, Dr Kerry Schott, says the cost of building a new coal-fired power plant is always going to be more than the cost of wind and sun. Dr Schott says the cost of running a clean-coal plant is much more expensive than running a combination of wind, solar and gas, or, better yet, wind, solar and pumped hydro. She is one of many. There is consensus. Now all we need is consensus on that side of the House. That's what we're not getting. 


I have not come to this place in my 50s only to focus on what life is like for Australians in the second half of their lives. We need to focus on what life is like for my children now, for when they're my age, for their whole generation, for their children and for their children's children. It's time those opposite got their heads out of the sand. There is a clear and pressing need to act and to act now. The fight that they're having gives the lie to the fact that for years the industry investors have been saying they need a clear set of rules, a framework which allows them to make decisions and which doesn't get dumped from one government to another. 


In my work before parliament, with investors, I remember the relief at a policy announcement that Australia would have a price on carbon. There was the hope of certainty. That was years ago. Since then it's been a shambles because of the lack of leadership on that side of the chamber and by this Prime Minister. As soon as the investment framework is in place the industry will be able to move forward. It is so keen to move forward. It's vital for us to have a framework now and then to have enough ambition to drive investment. That's what the government's plan lacks. Their target will be reached before the NEG really starts, with rooftop solar alone helping it achieve that target. How ambitious is their target? We're talking two per cent. That's the actual target that we're really talking about.


The Australian National University found the proposal—reduction targets of 26 per cent on 2005 levels—will put Australia towards the bottom of 35 OECD countries. Guess what? That weakens our investment potential. The ANU College of Law researcher Dr James Prest said that Australia may even be at risk of failing its international obligations. Let's be clear: our international obligations under Paris were very, very modest. By international comparison, he says that Australia's aim for renewable energy is clearly quite unambitious. That's what we're talking about: ambition. My ambition is that we leave a better future for our children. This policy doesn't do that. Dr Prest says that the review of renewable targets in all OECD countries shows that only five of the 34 countries have a lower target than Australia and some of these already have high levels of renewable electricity production. Who will be below us? The Czech Republic, Hungary, Israel, Canada and—wait for it—the United States. 


What is the consequence of having such an unambitious target? It is a disaster for this country going forward. We're throwing $444 million at the Great Barrier Reef but not addressing the real issues that matter. We need decent targets that protect all our children and grandchildren. (Time expired)

"Laming, Andrew, MP",LP,2018-08-14,"



Mr LAMING
 (Bowman) (16:09):  Acknowledging the incredible passion around this topic, a topic that for 11 years has galvanised Australia like no other OECD economy, the debate between environment and energy, we are slowly getting to the point where experts have come together to design a structure that looks after three mutually exclusive fields: affordability, responsibility and reliability. You can toss a dime, and it's not going to land on an area that's going to cover those three areas adequately. I guess our great concern is that the Labor Party, until now, in their six years in government, simply watched energy prices double. The Labor Party, at federal and state level, continue to exacerbate the situation with their job-destroying bans and moratoria on exploration, and their unrealistic renewable targets—which at this point cannot be met in a way that allows pensioners to pay their power bills—and their open hostility to dispatchable, reliable baseload power. This is a real fatwa against these areas of power policy. 


The Turnbull government just takes another approach to this. We are taking action to fix this mess to make sure that people can afford their power bills. We are focusing on just keeping the lights on before we start worrying about renewable targets for 10 and 20 years in advance, when I'm sure we'll be apologising for the actions of Labor governments right now. The National Energy Guarantee cuts electricity prices, ends subsidies, ends the picking of winners and ends the passing on of these costs directly to consumers. We're endeavouring now to create a level playing field, an agnostic energy source approach that means more supply and ultimately lower prices. It's about having all forms of energy competing equally in Australia's energy mix. That $300 a year that we are reliably informed can be saved—an average of $550 a year deep into the 2020s—under the NEG will make a real difference to families. 


We're requiring power companies to cut better deals, to inform customers of the better arrangement and to secure gas supplies for Australia rather than exporting gas overseas and putting downward pressure on network costs. Labor's alternative indicates some scotoma—a blind spot—that they are unable to address. Our actions are already having some impact. Wholesale prices are already down, thanks to gas availability, by about 25 per cent. My state of Queensland has had an 8.5 per cent drop in small-business power prices, and around 5.4 per cent for households. Labor's alternative has primarily been one of blackouts and higher energy prices, which they get away with by offering small payouts to pensioners to keep them onside. We know that when Labor was last in office these prices doubled, and then we had a leader of the Labor Party with a 50 per cent renewable energy target and no idea of how we'll get there, no idea of what price will be paid by pensioners. We're going to put pensioners first, put low-income households first.


This new tax on electricity means that if Labor's back in office power bills could be $500 a year higher than they would otherwise need to be. That's way too much of a burden on Australians' shoulders. Let's put our shoulder to the wheel and do our part and allow others to do the same before reckless policies harm jobs—because once you lose a local job it often doesn't come back. This guarantee has been backed by the expert Energy Security Board. It's made of these two obligations. First of all, the thing you never hear Labor say, is the reliability obligation. It's set to deliver the right level of dispatchable energy from ready-to-use sources. That might be coal, gas, hydro or whatever, but it's got to be there, in the thousands of megawatts, to make sure that when wind and solar enters irregularly into the grid we can cope with it. This makes retailers responsible to have that base load available; otherwise, they can pay large penalties for failing to do so, and a price fall is the result.


People ask, 'How can the NEG reduce prices?' Well, it does so by reducing those spikes where power is inordinately expensive for very short periods of time. This allows Australians to have more money in their pockets. That's where they want the money. They don't want it going to energy retailers. Memo to Labor: we don't enjoy paying high power bills where we don't have to. When it comes to reliability, no longer should intermittent sources like wind and solar be surging into our grid, causing the risks of brownout and the inability to have base load go to go with it.


I want to thank a number of the groups that got behind the NEG: the BCA, ACCI, AiG, Manufacturing Australia, and all of the energy users—BHP, BlueScope, Rio, Santos, JBS, Origin, AGL, EnergyAustralia, Energy Networks—and all of the irrigators and the mineral councils, the forestry product producers, infrastructure partnerships, Grattan and energy consumers. They're all lined up against the Labor Party. They have this party in the crosshairs. Stand up for reliability and affordability and support the NEG.

Ms BUTLER
 (Griffith) (16:14):  Labor opposes the amendments. Labor is very concerned about the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018 as a whole. We voted against it last time it was before the House, because of the reduction in the repayment threshold for higher education contributions. We think that this is another example of the Turnbull government's war on young people. We've just heard this week of young people going without food while they're studying at university.


This government seems to be making it harder and harder for people to get a higher education. They've tried to cut university funding every single opportunity that they have had throughout the entire period that they've been in government since they were elected five years ago. They originally tried to implement a 20 per cent cut to public funding for universities and a reduction in the HECS repayment threshold. They then tried to make it a 7½ per cent cut, plus an additional cut on top of that. That also failed in the Senate. Then, last year, what did they do in MYEFO? They implemented a $2.2 billion cut to university funding, and that is being felt on university campuses around this country.


Why does this government have such a problem with higher education? Why is this government seeking to find ways to cut higher education funding every time it gets the opportunity, and why does it seek to make life harder for students and people who have recently been to university? Make no mistake: that's what this bill does. HECS, the Higher Education Contribution Scheme, was supposed to be an income-contingent loan scheme, because it purported to represent the private value of higher education.

Ms BUTLER
 (Griffith) (16:28):  It's important that we acknowledge that two tranches of amendments are being considered together: the first tranche by the government is to change some of the timing in relation to the implementation of these measures, and the second tranche that had come from the crossbench relates to loans fees in respect of the HECS arrangements and the FEE-HELP arrangements for certain table 2 institutions. 


Labor will oppose both sets of amendments. Obviously they're being considered together. We are very concerned about the continuation of the coalition's war on young people. This is yet another example of this government trying to make it harder for people to get a higher education and trying to make it harder for people who are on low incomes to be able to get by. This is a government that doesn't care about the housing affordability crisis facing young people in this country. They absolutely do not care about the fact that young people are finding it harder and harder to get a quality education. It's not just the $270 million that was cut from vocational education in this year's budget. There was also $2.2 billion cut out of universities in MYEFO alone last year. This is yet another example of the war on young people. The government is now seeking to decrease the point at which people make a higher education contribution. This is an attempt to make people who are worse off pay HECS, even though they are demonstrably not receiving a private benefit from their higher education. 


The purpose of HECS is for people to make a contribution in recognition of the private benefit they receive. How much private benefit is someone getting from their higher education if they're on 42 grand a year? How well off is someone on $42,000 or $45,000 a year? What do you think you're doing with these changes? You are making it harder for people to get by. You're making it harder for young people, particularly, to get by. We don't know, on this side of the House, why you hate young people so much. We don't know why the Turnbull government is so, so determined to make it harder for people to get a higher education.


Since the government were elected in 2013, they have taken every opportunity to attack the higher education sector. There was the 20 per cent public funding cut that they tried to bring in in the 2014 horror budget. They failed to get that through. Then there was the 7½ per cent funding cut plus an additional funding cut on top of that last year. They failed to get that through. They finally got through their $2.2 billion cut administratively, bypassing the parliament, in MYEFO, and now they're making a further attack on our university system and on young people, reducing the threshold so that people who are earning very low amounts of money have to start making an additional contribution to the Commonwealth government because they had the temerity to get above their station and go to university.


We know how the other side feels about us and the people that we represent going to university, because the Prime Minister has told us. The Prime Minister looked over at our side and said, 'Look at you people; you all went to university, ' as if having a higher education is something that we should be ashamed of. But we are proud of the fact that so many of us on this side of the parliament are the first in our family to go to university. Our parents might have left school at 15. Our grandparents might have had to live in a tent during the Depression. Our parents and our grandparents might have come from very, very working-class stock. But our parents worked hard and they helped put us through university. We understand aspiration on this side of the House. You lot like to talk about it. We like to demonstrate it. We are the living embodiment of it. That's why we'll stand up for students. That's why we'll stand up for people who go to university. 


What do you think this bill is going to do to someone who goes to work for a charity, for a community legal centre, in a low-paid occupation? Do you think there's going to be an incentive to work in the community sector? Why would people do it? They're already going to take a discount on wages. Why would you punish them further by taxing them, by making further higher education contributions required so that you can just gather a little bit more money from them, even though they're working in that lower paid occupation?


Well, we won't stand for it. We'll stand up for aspiration. We'll stand up for people who want to go to university. We'll stand up for low-paid working people, because they deserve champions, and they will have them in this place as long as Labor is here. We will stand up for working people, and that includes people who went to university. It also includes vocational education. It also includes making sure that we do something about housing affordability. This government might be waging a war on young people, but young people will always have a voice in the Labor Party. The young people of Australia, who are this nation's future, will always have a voice. That's why we'll fight so hard on climate change. That's why we'll fight so hard for funding for vocational education and we'll stand up for public TAFE. That's why we'll always fight your cuts to university funding. That's why we'll always stand up against your cuts to the pension. And that's why we will oppose these amendments and this bill, because this bill punishes young people and it punishes lower paid workers—and you should be ashamed.

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2018-08-14,"



Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (16:33):  We don't agree with these amendments and we don't support the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018, because it is one more example of this government's vandalism when it comes to education. This is a government that, just before Christmas, cut another $2.2 billion from our universities, not by taking it through the parliament and allowing us on this side to make clear our opposition to these university cuts but by pushing it through in the midyear economic update, just before Christmas—a $2.2 billion cut. All this government has done is make it harder for young Australians to get a university education. 


And what do we want? We want every young Australian to have the opportunity, if they're prepared to work hard and study hard, to get a great education—at university, at TAFE; it doesn't matter. But we know that most jobs of the future will require one of these. They will require either a university education or a TAFE education, and this government is wrecking both. It is wrecking universities, making them harder to afford and harder to attend, and it is wrecking TAFE, by ripping billions out of vocational education, apprenticeships and traineeships, including hundreds of millions in the last budget alone. We know that many Australians are already turning their backs on a university education because they just can't afford it. This week, just days ago, we heard that one in seven university students are regularly going without food, because they can't afford to study and eat.


I was speaking today to one of our major universities that says that a large proportion of the homeless young people in their city are university students who haven't got a place to live. We saw an article this week in The Conversation about young women in particular trading sex for accommodation, including students who were doing this. What are we doing to our young Australians that we are making it so impossible to make ends meet to invest their time and their energy in a university education that gives them hope for the future?


It is incredible that we are asking young people on lower and lower incomes to pay a larger share of their income, repaying their debt sooner. We know who this hits hardest. It hits people in lower paid jobs harder, because they will be spending a disproportionate amount of their income, that should be covering necessities, on repaying their education sooner. We know that most of these people will be women. These measures disproportionately affect women, and Labor has said so all along. Sixty per cent of all Australians with a HELP debt are women and two-thirds of the Australians impacted by these changes will be women.


Of course our investment in education as a nation benefits the people who get the education. But those students, when they graduate, we hope go on throughout their professional lives to earn well and repay their debt—not just their HECS debt but their broader debt to society. Through their increased taxation as their wages increase they are supporting other young Australians to get a university education. Investment in education doesn't just benefit the individuals who receive the education; it benefits our nation. We know that Australia cannot be a wealthy and successful nation when we continue to cut university funding, as those opposite have done, and cut access to university education, as those opposite have done, by freezing university funding.


Our investment in university education has a substantial economic return. Just today, we saw another report, commissioned by the Group of Eight universities—I think done by London Economics—saying that in 2016 $12 billion was spent on their universities and $66 billion was returned in economic growth through that investment. Research, discovery, innovation and learning—the economic activity of the people who are working to supply the universities, particularly in our regional communities—makes a huge difference.

"Andrews, Karen, MP",LP,2018-08-14,"



Mrs ANDREWS
 (McPherson—Assistant Minister for Vocational Education and Skills) (16:38):  I rise to speak on these amendments. There are two points in particular that I would like to make. Firstly, I support the amendments that will be before us, and potentially discussed in a little bit more detail shortly.


What I would like to say is that I am particularly keen to support the amendment that deals with the removal of the loan fees from students of the table B providers. In particular, that affects one of the universities in my electorate of McPherson on the Gold Coast—that is, Bond University. For some time I have worked with Bond University, with the Vice Chancellor, Professor Tim Brailsford, and with students at the university for the removal of the loan fees. It has been a contentious issue. I have fought long and hard to have those fees removed, so I'm absolutely delighted to support that amendment today.


The other point that I would particularly like to make is in respect of vocational education. Let me start by saying that we are most definitely the party that is going to produce the results in the vocational education field. When Labor were in government, they absolutely decimated the sector. I've said before and I will say again—and I will continue to say it—that Labor, when in government, brought vocational education in this country to its knees. They did that by significantly reducing employer incentives in the vocational education space, and apprenticeships in particular. Under the former Labor government, the number of apprentices that we had in training dropped dramatically. When I speak of apprentices, I am, of course, speaking of Australian apprenticeships, which include apprentices and trainees. This government has put $1.5 billion on the table to increase the number of apprentices that we have in training.


There are clearly some strong target areas that we need to look at, and we're working with a number of states. There are five states and territories that have signed on to the national partnership agreement: New South Wales, South Australia, Tasmania, the ACT and the Northern Territory. We are continuing to work with them on the projects that they will be implementing to improve the number of apprentices that we have in training, not just in the coming year but for four years in total under the national partnership agreement, because this government recognises how important apprentices are to the future of Australia. So we'll be working with the states and territories in some targeted areas. We're certainly going to be looking at health, at ageing and at the disability sector. We'll also be looking at manufacturing, and we'll be looking at agriculture. We will work with every single state and territory to make sure that we are addressing the skills shortages that currently exist in this country and will continue to exist unless urgent action is taken.


So, when I say that we are the party that will stand up for vocational education, I can assure you that we have got the runs on the board, and we will continue to do that. It was just recently—maybe six weeks ago or maybe eight weeks ago—that one of the key stakeholders in the vocational education sector said to me that, for the first time, they can see the green shoots in vocational education, because, after such a long time in the darkness under Labor, we are now seeing some significant gains being made in that space. There is clearly more work to be done, but we have done a lot already to clean up the nightmare that we were left with when we took government.


Apprentices are and will continue to be our target into the future, but we will continue to look holistically at education. I've said before in this place that we see education as a highway where you can start with early childhood and you can go through schools, you can go into vocational education and you can go into higher education. We will continue to strongly support education in this country to make sure that everyone has the opportunity for a quality education.


When we talk about education, one of the things that we must be mindful of at all times is ensuring that the education that we are providing to our young people, not just at school but through vocational education and in higher education, is of a high quality and that those coming through higher education or vocational education are, in fact, job ready and have the skills that industry is crying out for. This is what this government stands for: high-quality education at universities, at schools, in vocational training and in our early childhood centres. So what we will do is continue to take up the fight to make sure that our children in Australia have the opportunity for an ongoing high-quality education.

"Bird, Sharon, MP",ALP,2018-08-14,"



Ms BIRD
 (Cunningham) (16:43):  Young people across this nation must look at this government and think, 'What did we ever do to you?' This government is trading off the future of young people time and time again across significant portfolio areas, making it more and more difficult for them, and it comes into this place with a bill like the one before us, which adds to that burden.


Young people in my community—and, I'm sure, the communities of many of my colleagues across the board—are facing challenges in getting, firstly, into post-secondary education opportunities. We know the impacts of the freeze on higher education funding and what that will do to universities and the offerings that they can make to students. We know that that will put pressure on them to decrease the opportunity to get a university qualification if that's where your interests and your ability lie.


I have to say I really admire the assistant minister's capacity to try and spin a good story out of what has been the devastation of the vocational education sector on the government's watch. She consistently says that this government is a serious friend of vocational education, but you've just got to look at the figures—the massive drop in the number of people undertaking vocational education, the huge decrease in the number of apprentices and trainees. It's like they've got one little lifeline that they cling to in this space, so the assistant minister constantly raises the fact that Labor cut back the employer incentives for traineeships—not for traditional apprenticeships. That was because there was a misuse of traineeships going on. If the government are critical of Labor's ensuring integrity in the provision of apprenticeships and traineeships, which is what we did with those changes, then I can only assume that they don't have any interest in the rigour and integrity of the system.


Only a couple of weeks ago, I was meeting with people involved in the TAFE sector about their concerns about the impact on diploma enrolments at TAFEs across the country—across electorates, like my own—as a result, to a significant extent, of the changes that the government has made around the VET FEE-HELP loan arrangements. They're causing a real problem. We know that diplomas are right in that sweet spot where a lot of future career opportunities are going to lie. A lot of people, particularly those retraining or re-entering the workforce, and young people straight out of school, will go and do their certificate-level courses in areas where there's going to be huge job demand—aged care, child care, disability care—and then seek to add a diploma onto that. But we've seen a massive drop-off in diploma enrolments, something the government just doesn't have an answer for. It's the same with apprenticeships: there are over 140,000 fewer apprenticeships on their watch. If, as the shadow minister says, there was a problem with what Labor was doing, why have the government been digging the hole deeper? They haven't put in place a policy that has arrested, let alone reversed, that trend. And so, as we've seen, for young people across the board, post school, the pressures are mounting. 


Then let's add in the cost of housing. I've had many young people, under 30, say to me, 'I don't think I'll ever own a home.' This is what young people say to you now. They're struggling to pay rent because the market is so competitive for them. So they've got those cost burdens on them. Then they're trying to support themselves while they're studying. Let's not even get into the incompetence—how long it takes to get youth allowance processed and actually get payments coming into your bank account. I've heard stories of people who are entitled to youth allowance going a whole semester with no income. Then the government say, 'We'll get rid of their penalty rates,' if they've got a job that they work on a Sunday so they can actually make ends meet. 'Yes, we'll get rid of those too.' Then, just to top it off, they bring this bill into the parliament and say, 'Even though you're earning as little as $42,000,' which is not a lot of money—as the shadow minister said, the idea of HECS is to pay it back when you're reaping the benefits of that investment; on $42,000, you'd be lucky to be keeping your head above water—'we're going to rip into you and take some money from you now.' 


It is no wonder that young people will be looking at this government, asking: 'When are you going to give us a go? When are you going to give us a future that we can look forward to?' And I haven't even touched on policy areas such as climate change or health—talk to young people about private health insurance. This government is completely out of touch with young people's needs.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2018-08-14,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Whitlam) (16:48):  We do not agree to these amendments. We do not agree to these amendments, and the reason is this: a few moments ago, the Prime Minister and his entire frontbench got up and walked out of the chamber, turning their back on this debate just as they are turning their back on the young people of Australia. They are turning their back on the young people of Australia. Make no mistake about it. From a government which has lectured Australians and the Australian Labor Party on the need for tax cuts, what this policy represents is a tax increase on young people at a time in their lives when they can least afford it.


They are making it harder for students to get into university by increasing the tuition fees that they pay and by reducing the funding that is available to universities to support new students. They are making it harder for students to stay at university through a whole mix of policies, which the member for Cunningham has now just gone through. The fact is that it is harder for a young person to keep a job and to ensure that they're earning enough from that job, because of penalty rate cuts and because the jobs are not paying enough to keep pace with the cost of living increases. They are making it harder for them to get into university and stay in university, and they are making it harder for them to pay their debts once they have left university. That is why young people around the country are asking, 'What has this government got against us? They are loading us up with debt and making it harder and harder for us to meet those expenses when we leave university.' They have got nothing in their policy swag for the young people of Australia.


This is just part of the suite of education policies which are having a pernicious impact on young Australians. It goes hand in hand with the $17 billion worth of cuts to school education. These people over here think it is more important that we give big banks a $17 billion tax cut than it is to give a struggling public school or independent school assistance with their teaching, assistance with their school facilities and some additional funding to help struggling students meet their education needs now and into the future. It also comes hand in hand with their cuts to TAFE. I'm reliably informed that there are in excess of $3 billion worth of cuts to the TAFE system. So it's harder to go to school and harder to go to university. What are your options? Vocational education, generally. But this mob over here, with their born-to-rule attitude, are making it harder to get into TAFE as well by ensuring that they are cutting funding for TAFE and ripping the guts out of the vocational education system, with $2.2 billion worth of cuts across the vocational and higher education system. 


The people of Australia deserve better than what is on offer from this government. There used to be a time when the Prime Minister used to lecture Australians about the importance of being a smarter country. He used to tell us about how all Australians had an obligation to ensure that we pulled together and became a smarter country. You can't become a smarter country if you're ripping the guts out of the school education system, if you are ripping the guts out of the university system and if you are ripping the guts out of the vocational education system. 


he message to the Prime Minister, the message to all of those backbenchers who are feeling very, very nervous indeed after the last round of by-elections, is to come back to this place and reject these amendments. They have a choice. They can stand by their Prime Minister and go down the gurgler with their Prime Minister or they can stand up for their electorates. They can stand up for the young people in their electorates and reject these amendments, reject the cuts to the vocational education system and the school education system, and say quite clearly to their Prime Minister, 'We do not support the tax cuts to big business or the $17 billion giveaway to big banks. Let's invest that money into schools, universities and the vocational education system. Let's put our priorities where they should be.' It's in the young people of this country. Not the big banks, not the big corporations. Let's get our priorities right. We can't become a smarter country if we're doing dumb things like this.

"King, Madeleine, MP",ALP,2018-08-14,"



Ms MADELEINE KING
 (Brand) (16:53):  I too do not agree with these amendments that we see before us today. It's a rotten day when you have to stand here in this parliament and defend higher education and the opportunities available to young people in this country. This should be a non-partisan matter. What happens to this country when we stop supporting higher education and stop supporting universities and the students that attend them, day in and day out, to get themselves a better life? This should be non-partisan. Why is it that the Liberal Party always pick off the low-hanging fruit? The low-hanging fruit for them is universities. 


There are a number of universities around this country. I'm proud to have worked for one for about 10 years, at the University of Western Australia. It's where I learnt so many things. I was also an undergraduate there. Like many people on this side of the House, and I'm sure on the other side of the House, I'm the first in my family to graduate from a university. I was a state schoolkid—I went to Safety Bay Senior High School—and I've got to say, in speaking for the first time at the despatch box as a shadow minister, I'm very proud to have been a state schoolkid and to be defending higher education and universities in this country. 


As I said, I worked at the UWA for many years, and I've had a lot to do with the five universities in my state: Curtin University in Bentley; Murdoch University in South Street, close to my electorate and the member for Tangney's electorate—I don't see him speaking against the cuts to Murdoch University, which is desperately in need of good, adequate funding to help its research program; Edith Cowan University; and the private university, the University of Notre Dame Australia. The poor public universities need this funding to help the young people of Western Australia. A $2 billion cut to their income, to the competitive grant that they get, which is an effective freeze on places for Western Australian students in Western Australian universities, is denying Western Australian young people the opportunity to go to university. 


This government has no idea how the university sector is funded. We heard the Minister for Education and Training, Senator Birmingham, cry about the rivers of gold that he thinks universities have inherited over the last couple of years through the demand-driven system. What the demand-driven system did was allow more people—young people who would never have thought university was accessible to them—to go to university. That's what the demand-driven system, introduced by the Gillard government in this place, brought to the young people, to all people, of Australia—greater opportunities to go to university. And what does the current minister for education, Senator Birmingham, have to say about it? He calls it 'rivers of gold'. Well, go tell that to a vice-chancellor who has to spend several millions of dollars of their annual income trying to maintain things like, I don't know, libraries, museums or expensive art collections that they don't necessarily collect themselves but which have been gifted to them by people that are generous benefactors. They are great gifts to universities. These are some of the things universities have to maintain. 


What should we have? Should we have 100-year-old institutions just crumbling to the ground so that these rivers of gold can go elsewhere? Why do the government ignore the fact that there's a cross-subsidy between research and education in this country? The reason we have a research-teaching nexus in universities in this country is so students who attend universities as undergraduates can learn from the best researchers in the country and in the world. That is of great benefit to all of us. The members on this side spoke about the Prime Minister's ridiculous and empty innovation agenda. We saw where that went. Where did it go? It just popped up, we had a nice couple of graphics that whirled around for a while, and then it all petered out. Do you know where the real innovation is happening? It's where the actual science is happening, and that's in universities. It is done by students, research students as well as undergraduate students, and their lecturers. 


The bill we see today, which is going to bring down the threshold for when students have to pay back their HECS and HELP fees, is going to deny more people access to the greatest kind of education you can get. It's an amazing opportunity that this government are seeking to deny young people. It's an outrageous attack, and a continual, persistent and consistent attack, on young people in this country. The government just keep piling on the pressure on young people. They won't do anything about housing affordability. Oh, no, they won't do that. They won't do anything about penalty rates. Most young people are working in pubs and bars to try and make ends meet while they're at university, but they won't do a thing about penalty rates. Instead, the government are just going to make it harder for vulnerable people, for people from low-SES areas to go to university. That's a crying shame, and they should be ashamed of themselves.

"Hart, Ross, MP",ALP,2018-08-14,"



Mr HART
 (Bass) (16:54):  I rise to speak on the amendments to the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018. I thank the member for Brand for her contribution. She quite rightly paid particular attention to the fact that this Orwellian treatment—so-called sustainability—of higher education is in some way supporting the university sector and supporting the ability of people to go to university and advance themselves in life. We know, on this side of the chamber, that this represents the most grievous attack not just on the universities but also on young people and people in the regions.


I have the pleasure to represent—as does my friend the member for Braddon—Northern Tasmania, an area which historically has underperformed. There has been a lot of economic analysis as to what it is that holds back Northern Tasmania and Tasmania as a whole. Of course, the fact that the Tasmanian economy has significantly underperformed the equivalent economies even in regional Australia is something that has been the subject of economic analysis. One of the theories underpinning this is the fact that educational attainment, in particular higher educational attainment, is not keeping pace in Tasmania. So what we need is not less support for higher education and the higher education sector in areas like Northern Tasmania and other regional communities throughout Australia but more.


The important thesis is that average incomes in the regions are significantly below those in urban communities. We have better educational attainment in the urban communities, while the regional parts of states, particularly in a state like Tasmania, suffer from lower educational attainment. And in the cities we see a greater representation of people who have graduated with higher degrees. It is reasonable to suggest that investment in education—not denying investment in education—is the way this parliament should proceed. We know, on this side of the House, that investment in higher education and education generally is an investment in the economy in the long term. This government, as I've said previously, has a one-point plan for the economy in Australia—a one-point plan which involves shovelling $80 billion worth of money out the door, in particular to the big banks.


We know there's a better way to proceed. We know it's not coincidental that the amount of money that is being invested in the tax cuts for the big banks is roughly the same that is being denied to education.




Mr Laming:
  It's a conspiracy!




Mr HART:
  Thank you to the member for Bowman. He should know a conspiracy when he looks at it. The important thing is that the Labor Party, this side of politics, has recognised that investment in education is important, particularly for regional Tasmania. That's why, during the 2016 federal election campaign, we committed to the university transformation project in Northern Tasmania. We committed to the fact that we need to improve educational attainment in Northern Tasmania. We want to see higher education with better numbers of students graduating from university, higher incomes and higher productivity, particularly within the Tasmanian economy. Every small business in Northern Tasmania should aspire to the fact that they will have better productivity by paying their highly educated workforce more and, of course, improving the economic performance of their business.


Now, there is no doubt that people recognise that universities represent a significant opportunity for economic growth. Recent studies suggest that the mere presence of higher numbers of university graduates in an economy significantly drives employment not just within the graduate cohort but within the wider workforce. What's the response of this government? The response of this government is to make it more difficult for people to attend university or, if they do attend university, they'll have a higher education debt, which they'll pay off earlier, because this government simply don't see our young people or our people in regional Australia having the opportunity to get ahead. We know that regional Australia, regional economies and the other states throughout Australia need this investment in higher education. It's vitally important that we push back, that we reject these amendments and that we reject this legislation. Thank you.

"Hill, Julian, MP",ALP,2018-08-14,"



Mr HILL
 (Bruce) (17:04):  I want to echo what has already been said about the appalling impacts of the substantive provisions of the legislation to lower the thresholds and make young people repay their education debt earlier—but I'll touch on that in a moment. At the outset, I want to call out the appalling process that the government has gone through, which has been almost an abuse of the House. We have debated a version of this legislation twice at length. Sloppy reheated seconds came back when the government couldn't get the first go through, so they thought, 'We couldn't get $42,000 through; we'll try $45,000.' They shunted that off to the Senate. They read the writing on the wall that it was going to again fail in the Senate and die where it should've, and at the last minute they've cooked up a dodgy deal with the crossbench, which the House has not been briefed or advised on. We haven't had a moment to reflect on what it actually means. It's an appalling way to make education policy.


From what I've been told there is a second amendment. We are debating two amendments concurrently, and the debate so far has focused quite rightly on the awful impacts on young people in our communities, but the other amendment, which we're being told we have to debate and vote on concurrently, relates to extending loans to table B providers for private universities and removing loan fees for these institutions. That may be a good idea. I understand that Labor has an open mind to this. This is exactly the kind of issue we would publicly and transparently consider with consultation in a proper, grown-up policy process. All the government muppets who ran away from this debate are going to wander back in, stick their hands up and have no idea what they're actually voting on. In fact, hardly anyone in the House has any idea what we're voting on, because the government has done some dodgy deal with Senator Bernardi in the other place.


I don't understand the policy impacts or arguments around extending loans for table B providers for private universities. The extension of the loans in the system may have some value, but we have said that, in government, we would consider it in our national inquiry on post-secondary education, where everyone can have a say. It's probably old-fashioned, with the government's approach to making policy and legislation, to actually allow members to understand what they're voting on and put the detail in front of them; nevertheless, I think it is important that the House understands that we're voting on two very different things, one of which has never been part of the government's legislative proposal and has never been considered or debated in any sense by this House.


With regard to the other provision, the government's latest attempt to make life harder for young people, we hear from those opposite that lowering the repayment threshold, the income at which young people will be forced to repay their education debts, doesn't really matter, because it's just $5 or 10 bucks a week, not a lot of money. It might not be a lot of money to people in here—to those opposite, who just awarded themselves a tax cut worth $7,000 when it fully rolls out—but $5 is a lot of money to people in my community, to students struggling to make ends meet and put themselves through university while the government opposite cuts their penalty rates. On behalf of young people in my community I don't accept that $5 or $10 is a just little bit of money; it is significant.


I have to speak up on behalf of my electorate. During the last campaign I doorknocked more than 12,000 houses over 18 months and asked people, 'What matters most?' The No. 1 priority that kept coming back was education, whether I was talking to a young person thinking about their future, a grandparent worried about their grandkids, or a parent worried about how their kids are going to get to TAFE or university. Most particularly, migrants, who come to this country seeking a better life for their kids, with a laser-like focus on education. In the electorate that I've been proud to represent almost 60 per cent of people are born in another country. They come here, work hard and look for education. This bill takes us in the wrong direction. It makes it harder for young people to get into university.


When you think about our partners and friends in Asia—our competitors in the coming decades—the OECD and everyone else say we should invest in two things: infrastructure and education. A smart country would be lowering barriers to education so that the brightest kid from the poorest family can have a chance to go to university. That was part of my family story. My mum left school at 15 in Footscray. Her family could not afford the uniforms to go to a school that offered year 12. My father, on the other hand, had the opportunity to pay his way through university. He failed a bit and just kept paying. That was seared into my consciousness: every kid, no matter their circumstances, should be able to go to university.

Ms BUTLER
 (Griffith) (16:14):  Labor opposes the amendments. Labor is very concerned about the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018 as a whole. We voted against it last time it was before the House, because of the reduction in the repayment threshold for higher education contributions. We think that this is another example of the Turnbull government's war on young people. We've just heard this week of young people going without food while they're studying at university.


This government seems to be making it harder and harder for people to get a higher education. They've tried to cut university funding every single opportunity that they have had throughout the entire period that they've been in government since they were elected five years ago. They originally tried to implement a 20 per cent cut to public funding for universities and a reduction in the HECS repayment threshold. They then tried to make it a 7½ per cent cut, plus an additional cut on top of that. That also failed in the Senate. Then, last year, what did they do in MYEFO? They implemented a $2.2 billion cut to university funding, and that is being felt on university campuses around this country.


Why does this government have such a problem with higher education? Why is this government seeking to find ways to cut higher education funding every time it gets the opportunity, and why does it seek to make life harder for students and people who have recently been to university? Make no mistake: that's what this bill does. HECS, the Higher Education Contribution Scheme, was supposed to be an income-contingent loan scheme, because it purported to represent the private value of higher education.

Ms BUTLER
 (Griffith) (16:28):  It's important that we acknowledge that two tranches of amendments are being considered together: the first tranche by the government is to change some of the timing in relation to the implementation of these measures, and the second tranche that had come from the crossbench relates to loans fees in respect of the HECS arrangements and the FEE-HELP arrangements for certain table 2 institutions. 


Labor will oppose both sets of amendments. Obviously they're being considered together. We are very concerned about the continuation of the coalition's war on young people. This is yet another example of this government trying to make it harder for people to get a higher education and trying to make it harder for people who are on low incomes to be able to get by. This is a government that doesn't care about the housing affordability crisis facing young people in this country. They absolutely do not care about the fact that young people are finding it harder and harder to get a quality education. It's not just the $270 million that was cut from vocational education in this year's budget. There was also $2.2 billion cut out of universities in MYEFO alone last year. This is yet another example of the war on young people. The government is now seeking to decrease the point at which people make a higher education contribution. This is an attempt to make people who are worse off pay HECS, even though they are demonstrably not receiving a private benefit from their higher education. 


The purpose of HECS is for people to make a contribution in recognition of the private benefit they receive. How much private benefit is someone getting from their higher education if they're on 42 grand a year? How well off is someone on $42,000 or $45,000 a year? What do you think you're doing with these changes? You are making it harder for people to get by. You're making it harder for young people, particularly, to get by. We don't know, on this side of the House, why you hate young people so much. We don't know why the Turnbull government is so, so determined to make it harder for people to get a higher education.


Since the government were elected in 2013, they have taken every opportunity to attack the higher education sector. There was the 20 per cent public funding cut that they tried to bring in in the 2014 horror budget. They failed to get that through. Then there was the 7½ per cent funding cut plus an additional funding cut on top of that last year. They failed to get that through. They finally got through their $2.2 billion cut administratively, bypassing the parliament, in MYEFO, and now they're making a further attack on our university system and on young people, reducing the threshold so that people who are earning very low amounts of money have to start making an additional contribution to the Commonwealth government because they had the temerity to get above their station and go to university.


We know how the other side feels about us and the people that we represent going to university, because the Prime Minister has told us. The Prime Minister looked over at our side and said, 'Look at you people; you all went to university, ' as if having a higher education is something that we should be ashamed of. But we are proud of the fact that so many of us on this side of the parliament are the first in our family to go to university. Our parents might have left school at 15. Our grandparents might have had to live in a tent during the Depression. Our parents and our grandparents might have come from very, very working-class stock. But our parents worked hard and they helped put us through university. We understand aspiration on this side of the House. You lot like to talk about it. We like to demonstrate it. We are the living embodiment of it. That's why we'll stand up for students. That's why we'll stand up for people who go to university. 


What do you think this bill is going to do to someone who goes to work for a charity, for a community legal centre, in a low-paid occupation? Do you think there's going to be an incentive to work in the community sector? Why would people do it? They're already going to take a discount on wages. Why would you punish them further by taxing them, by making further higher education contributions required so that you can just gather a little bit more money from them, even though they're working in that lower paid occupation?


Well, we won't stand for it. We'll stand up for aspiration. We'll stand up for people who want to go to university. We'll stand up for low-paid working people, because they deserve champions, and they will have them in this place as long as Labor is here. We will stand up for working people, and that includes people who went to university. It also includes vocational education. It also includes making sure that we do something about housing affordability. This government might be waging a war on young people, but young people will always have a voice in the Labor Party. The young people of Australia, who are this nation's future, will always have a voice. That's why we'll fight so hard on climate change. That's why we'll fight so hard for funding for vocational education and we'll stand up for public TAFE. That's why we'll always fight your cuts to university funding. That's why we'll always stand up against your cuts to the pension. And that's why we will oppose these amendments and this bill, because this bill punishes young people and it punishes lower paid workers—and you should be ashamed.

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2018-08-14,"



Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (16:33):  We don't agree with these amendments and we don't support the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018, because it is one more example of this government's vandalism when it comes to education. This is a government that, just before Christmas, cut another $2.2 billion from our universities, not by taking it through the parliament and allowing us on this side to make clear our opposition to these university cuts but by pushing it through in the midyear economic update, just before Christmas—a $2.2 billion cut. All this government has done is make it harder for young Australians to get a university education. 


And what do we want? We want every young Australian to have the opportunity, if they're prepared to work hard and study hard, to get a great education—at university, at TAFE; it doesn't matter. But we know that most jobs of the future will require one of these. They will require either a university education or a TAFE education, and this government is wrecking both. It is wrecking universities, making them harder to afford and harder to attend, and it is wrecking TAFE, by ripping billions out of vocational education, apprenticeships and traineeships, including hundreds of millions in the last budget alone. We know that many Australians are already turning their backs on a university education because they just can't afford it. This week, just days ago, we heard that one in seven university students are regularly going without food, because they can't afford to study and eat.


I was speaking today to one of our major universities that says that a large proportion of the homeless young people in their city are university students who haven't got a place to live. We saw an article this week in The Conversation about young women in particular trading sex for accommodation, including students who were doing this. What are we doing to our young Australians that we are making it so impossible to make ends meet to invest their time and their energy in a university education that gives them hope for the future?


It is incredible that we are asking young people on lower and lower incomes to pay a larger share of their income, repaying their debt sooner. We know who this hits hardest. It hits people in lower paid jobs harder, because they will be spending a disproportionate amount of their income, that should be covering necessities, on repaying their education sooner. We know that most of these people will be women. These measures disproportionately affect women, and Labor has said so all along. Sixty per cent of all Australians with a HELP debt are women and two-thirds of the Australians impacted by these changes will be women.


Of course our investment in education as a nation benefits the people who get the education. But those students, when they graduate, we hope go on throughout their professional lives to earn well and repay their debt—not just their HECS debt but their broader debt to society. Through their increased taxation as their wages increase they are supporting other young Australians to get a university education. Investment in education doesn't just benefit the individuals who receive the education; it benefits our nation. We know that Australia cannot be a wealthy and successful nation when we continue to cut university funding, as those opposite have done, and cut access to university education, as those opposite have done, by freezing university funding.


Our investment in university education has a substantial economic return. Just today, we saw another report, commissioned by the Group of Eight universities—I think done by London Economics—saying that in 2016 $12 billion was spent on their universities and $66 billion was returned in economic growth through that investment. Research, discovery, innovation and learning—the economic activity of the people who are working to supply the universities, particularly in our regional communities—makes a huge difference.

"Andrews, Karen, MP",LP,2018-08-14,"



Mrs ANDREWS
 (McPherson—Assistant Minister for Vocational Education and Skills) (16:38):  I rise to speak on these amendments. There are two points in particular that I would like to make. Firstly, I support the amendments that will be before us, and potentially discussed in a little bit more detail shortly.


What I would like to say is that I am particularly keen to support the amendment that deals with the removal of the loan fees from students of the table B providers. In particular, that affects one of the universities in my electorate of McPherson on the Gold Coast—that is, Bond University. For some time I have worked with Bond University, with the Vice Chancellor, Professor Tim Brailsford, and with students at the university for the removal of the loan fees. It has been a contentious issue. I have fought long and hard to have those fees removed, so I'm absolutely delighted to support that amendment today.


The other point that I would particularly like to make is in respect of vocational education. Let me start by saying that we are most definitely the party that is going to produce the results in the vocational education field. When Labor were in government, they absolutely decimated the sector. I've said before and I will say again—and I will continue to say it—that Labor, when in government, brought vocational education in this country to its knees. They did that by significantly reducing employer incentives in the vocational education space, and apprenticeships in particular. Under the former Labor government, the number of apprentices that we had in training dropped dramatically. When I speak of apprentices, I am, of course, speaking of Australian apprenticeships, which include apprentices and trainees. This government has put $1.5 billion on the table to increase the number of apprentices that we have in training.


There are clearly some strong target areas that we need to look at, and we're working with a number of states. There are five states and territories that have signed on to the national partnership agreement: New South Wales, South Australia, Tasmania, the ACT and the Northern Territory. We are continuing to work with them on the projects that they will be implementing to improve the number of apprentices that we have in training, not just in the coming year but for four years in total under the national partnership agreement, because this government recognises how important apprentices are to the future of Australia. So we'll be working with the states and territories in some targeted areas. We're certainly going to be looking at health, at ageing and at the disability sector. We'll also be looking at manufacturing, and we'll be looking at agriculture. We will work with every single state and territory to make sure that we are addressing the skills shortages that currently exist in this country and will continue to exist unless urgent action is taken.


So, when I say that we are the party that will stand up for vocational education, I can assure you that we have got the runs on the board, and we will continue to do that. It was just recently—maybe six weeks ago or maybe eight weeks ago—that one of the key stakeholders in the vocational education sector said to me that, for the first time, they can see the green shoots in vocational education, because, after such a long time in the darkness under Labor, we are now seeing some significant gains being made in that space. There is clearly more work to be done, but we have done a lot already to clean up the nightmare that we were left with when we took government.


Apprentices are and will continue to be our target into the future, but we will continue to look holistically at education. I've said before in this place that we see education as a highway where you can start with early childhood and you can go through schools, you can go into vocational education and you can go into higher education. We will continue to strongly support education in this country to make sure that everyone has the opportunity for a quality education.


When we talk about education, one of the things that we must be mindful of at all times is ensuring that the education that we are providing to our young people, not just at school but through vocational education and in higher education, is of a high quality and that those coming through higher education or vocational education are, in fact, job ready and have the skills that industry is crying out for. This is what this government stands for: high-quality education at universities, at schools, in vocational training and in our early childhood centres. So what we will do is continue to take up the fight to make sure that our children in Australia have the opportunity for an ongoing high-quality education.

"Bird, Sharon, MP",ALP,2018-08-14,"



Ms BIRD
 (Cunningham) (16:43):  Young people across this nation must look at this government and think, 'What did we ever do to you?' This government is trading off the future of young people time and time again across significant portfolio areas, making it more and more difficult for them, and it comes into this place with a bill like the one before us, which adds to that burden.


Young people in my community—and, I'm sure, the communities of many of my colleagues across the board—are facing challenges in getting, firstly, into post-secondary education opportunities. We know the impacts of the freeze on higher education funding and what that will do to universities and the offerings that they can make to students. We know that that will put pressure on them to decrease the opportunity to get a university qualification if that's where your interests and your ability lie.


I have to say I really admire the assistant minister's capacity to try and spin a good story out of what has been the devastation of the vocational education sector on the government's watch. She consistently says that this government is a serious friend of vocational education, but you've just got to look at the figures—the massive drop in the number of people undertaking vocational education, the huge decrease in the number of apprentices and trainees. It's like they've got one little lifeline that they cling to in this space, so the assistant minister constantly raises the fact that Labor cut back the employer incentives for traineeships—not for traditional apprenticeships. That was because there was a misuse of traineeships going on. If the government are critical of Labor's ensuring integrity in the provision of apprenticeships and traineeships, which is what we did with those changes, then I can only assume that they don't have any interest in the rigour and integrity of the system.


Only a couple of weeks ago, I was meeting with people involved in the TAFE sector about their concerns about the impact on diploma enrolments at TAFEs across the country—across electorates, like my own—as a result, to a significant extent, of the changes that the government has made around the VET FEE-HELP loan arrangements. They're causing a real problem. We know that diplomas are right in that sweet spot where a lot of future career opportunities are going to lie. A lot of people, particularly those retraining or re-entering the workforce, and young people straight out of school, will go and do their certificate-level courses in areas where there's going to be huge job demand—aged care, child care, disability care—and then seek to add a diploma onto that. But we've seen a massive drop-off in diploma enrolments, something the government just doesn't have an answer for. It's the same with apprenticeships: there are over 140,000 fewer apprenticeships on their watch. If, as the shadow minister says, there was a problem with what Labor was doing, why have the government been digging the hole deeper? They haven't put in place a policy that has arrested, let alone reversed, that trend. And so, as we've seen, for young people across the board, post school, the pressures are mounting. 


Then let's add in the cost of housing. I've had many young people, under 30, say to me, 'I don't think I'll ever own a home.' This is what young people say to you now. They're struggling to pay rent because the market is so competitive for them. So they've got those cost burdens on them. Then they're trying to support themselves while they're studying. Let's not even get into the incompetence—how long it takes to get youth allowance processed and actually get payments coming into your bank account. I've heard stories of people who are entitled to youth allowance going a whole semester with no income. Then the government say, 'We'll get rid of their penalty rates,' if they've got a job that they work on a Sunday so they can actually make ends meet. 'Yes, we'll get rid of those too.' Then, just to top it off, they bring this bill into the parliament and say, 'Even though you're earning as little as $42,000,' which is not a lot of money—as the shadow minister said, the idea of HECS is to pay it back when you're reaping the benefits of that investment; on $42,000, you'd be lucky to be keeping your head above water—'we're going to rip into you and take some money from you now.' 


It is no wonder that young people will be looking at this government, asking: 'When are you going to give us a go? When are you going to give us a future that we can look forward to?' And I haven't even touched on policy areas such as climate change or health—talk to young people about private health insurance. This government is completely out of touch with young people's needs.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2018-08-14,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Whitlam) (16:48):  We do not agree to these amendments. We do not agree to these amendments, and the reason is this: a few moments ago, the Prime Minister and his entire frontbench got up and walked out of the chamber, turning their back on this debate just as they are turning their back on the young people of Australia. They are turning their back on the young people of Australia. Make no mistake about it. From a government which has lectured Australians and the Australian Labor Party on the need for tax cuts, what this policy represents is a tax increase on young people at a time in their lives when they can least afford it.


They are making it harder for students to get into university by increasing the tuition fees that they pay and by reducing the funding that is available to universities to support new students. They are making it harder for students to stay at university through a whole mix of policies, which the member for Cunningham has now just gone through. The fact is that it is harder for a young person to keep a job and to ensure that they're earning enough from that job, because of penalty rate cuts and because the jobs are not paying enough to keep pace with the cost of living increases. They are making it harder for them to get into university and stay in university, and they are making it harder for them to pay their debts once they have left university. That is why young people around the country are asking, 'What has this government got against us? They are loading us up with debt and making it harder and harder for us to meet those expenses when we leave university.' They have got nothing in their policy swag for the young people of Australia.


This is just part of the suite of education policies which are having a pernicious impact on young Australians. It goes hand in hand with the $17 billion worth of cuts to school education. These people over here think it is more important that we give big banks a $17 billion tax cut than it is to give a struggling public school or independent school assistance with their teaching, assistance with their school facilities and some additional funding to help struggling students meet their education needs now and into the future. It also comes hand in hand with their cuts to TAFE. I'm reliably informed that there are in excess of $3 billion worth of cuts to the TAFE system. So it's harder to go to school and harder to go to university. What are your options? Vocational education, generally. But this mob over here, with their born-to-rule attitude, are making it harder to get into TAFE as well by ensuring that they are cutting funding for TAFE and ripping the guts out of the vocational education system, with $2.2 billion worth of cuts across the vocational and higher education system. 


The people of Australia deserve better than what is on offer from this government. There used to be a time when the Prime Minister used to lecture Australians about the importance of being a smarter country. He used to tell us about how all Australians had an obligation to ensure that we pulled together and became a smarter country. You can't become a smarter country if you're ripping the guts out of the school education system, if you are ripping the guts out of the university system and if you are ripping the guts out of the vocational education system. 


he message to the Prime Minister, the message to all of those backbenchers who are feeling very, very nervous indeed after the last round of by-elections, is to come back to this place and reject these amendments. They have a choice. They can stand by their Prime Minister and go down the gurgler with their Prime Minister or they can stand up for their electorates. They can stand up for the young people in their electorates and reject these amendments, reject the cuts to the vocational education system and the school education system, and say quite clearly to their Prime Minister, 'We do not support the tax cuts to big business or the $17 billion giveaway to big banks. Let's invest that money into schools, universities and the vocational education system. Let's put our priorities where they should be.' It's in the young people of this country. Not the big banks, not the big corporations. Let's get our priorities right. We can't become a smarter country if we're doing dumb things like this.

"King, Madeleine, MP",ALP,2018-08-14,"



Ms MADELEINE KING
 (Brand) (16:53):  I too do not agree with these amendments that we see before us today. It's a rotten day when you have to stand here in this parliament and defend higher education and the opportunities available to young people in this country. This should be a non-partisan matter. What happens to this country when we stop supporting higher education and stop supporting universities and the students that attend them, day in and day out, to get themselves a better life? This should be non-partisan. Why is it that the Liberal Party always pick off the low-hanging fruit? The low-hanging fruit for them is universities. 


There are a number of universities around this country. I'm proud to have worked for one for about 10 years, at the University of Western Australia. It's where I learnt so many things. I was also an undergraduate there. Like many people on this side of the House, and I'm sure on the other side of the House, I'm the first in my family to graduate from a university. I was a state schoolkid—I went to Safety Bay Senior High School—and I've got to say, in speaking for the first time at the despatch box as a shadow minister, I'm very proud to have been a state schoolkid and to be defending higher education and universities in this country. 


As I said, I worked at the UWA for many years, and I've had a lot to do with the five universities in my state: Curtin University in Bentley; Murdoch University in South Street, close to my electorate and the member for Tangney's electorate—I don't see him speaking against the cuts to Murdoch University, which is desperately in need of good, adequate funding to help its research program; Edith Cowan University; and the private university, the University of Notre Dame Australia. The poor public universities need this funding to help the young people of Western Australia. A $2 billion cut to their income, to the competitive grant that they get, which is an effective freeze on places for Western Australian students in Western Australian universities, is denying Western Australian young people the opportunity to go to university. 


This government has no idea how the university sector is funded. We heard the Minister for Education and Training, Senator Birmingham, cry about the rivers of gold that he thinks universities have inherited over the last couple of years through the demand-driven system. What the demand-driven system did was allow more people—young people who would never have thought university was accessible to them—to go to university. That's what the demand-driven system, introduced by the Gillard government in this place, brought to the young people, to all people, of Australia—greater opportunities to go to university. And what does the current minister for education, Senator Birmingham, have to say about it? He calls it 'rivers of gold'. Well, go tell that to a vice-chancellor who has to spend several millions of dollars of their annual income trying to maintain things like, I don't know, libraries, museums or expensive art collections that they don't necessarily collect themselves but which have been gifted to them by people that are generous benefactors. They are great gifts to universities. These are some of the things universities have to maintain. 


What should we have? Should we have 100-year-old institutions just crumbling to the ground so that these rivers of gold can go elsewhere? Why do the government ignore the fact that there's a cross-subsidy between research and education in this country? The reason we have a research-teaching nexus in universities in this country is so students who attend universities as undergraduates can learn from the best researchers in the country and in the world. That is of great benefit to all of us. The members on this side spoke about the Prime Minister's ridiculous and empty innovation agenda. We saw where that went. Where did it go? It just popped up, we had a nice couple of graphics that whirled around for a while, and then it all petered out. Do you know where the real innovation is happening? It's where the actual science is happening, and that's in universities. It is done by students, research students as well as undergraduate students, and their lecturers. 


The bill we see today, which is going to bring down the threshold for when students have to pay back their HECS and HELP fees, is going to deny more people access to the greatest kind of education you can get. It's an amazing opportunity that this government are seeking to deny young people. It's an outrageous attack, and a continual, persistent and consistent attack, on young people in this country. The government just keep piling on the pressure on young people. They won't do anything about housing affordability. Oh, no, they won't do that. They won't do anything about penalty rates. Most young people are working in pubs and bars to try and make ends meet while they're at university, but they won't do a thing about penalty rates. Instead, the government are just going to make it harder for vulnerable people, for people from low-SES areas to go to university. That's a crying shame, and they should be ashamed of themselves.

"Hart, Ross, MP",ALP,2018-08-14,"



Mr HART
 (Bass) (16:54):  I rise to speak on the amendments to the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018. I thank the member for Brand for her contribution. She quite rightly paid particular attention to the fact that this Orwellian treatment—so-called sustainability—of higher education is in some way supporting the university sector and supporting the ability of people to go to university and advance themselves in life. We know, on this side of the chamber, that this represents the most grievous attack not just on the universities but also on young people and people in the regions.


I have the pleasure to represent—as does my friend the member for Braddon—Northern Tasmania, an area which historically has underperformed. There has been a lot of economic analysis as to what it is that holds back Northern Tasmania and Tasmania as a whole. Of course, the fact that the Tasmanian economy has significantly underperformed the equivalent economies even in regional Australia is something that has been the subject of economic analysis. One of the theories underpinning this is the fact that educational attainment, in particular higher educational attainment, is not keeping pace in Tasmania. So what we need is not less support for higher education and the higher education sector in areas like Northern Tasmania and other regional communities throughout Australia but more.


The important thesis is that average incomes in the regions are significantly below those in urban communities. We have better educational attainment in the urban communities, while the regional parts of states, particularly in a state like Tasmania, suffer from lower educational attainment. And in the cities we see a greater representation of people who have graduated with higher degrees. It is reasonable to suggest that investment in education—not denying investment in education—is the way this parliament should proceed. We know, on this side of the House, that investment in higher education and education generally is an investment in the economy in the long term. This government, as I've said previously, has a one-point plan for the economy in Australia—a one-point plan which involves shovelling $80 billion worth of money out the door, in particular to the big banks.


We know there's a better way to proceed. We know it's not coincidental that the amount of money that is being invested in the tax cuts for the big banks is roughly the same that is being denied to education.




Mr Laming:
  It's a conspiracy!




Mr HART:
  Thank you to the member for Bowman. He should know a conspiracy when he looks at it. The important thing is that the Labor Party, this side of politics, has recognised that investment in education is important, particularly for regional Tasmania. That's why, during the 2016 federal election campaign, we committed to the university transformation project in Northern Tasmania. We committed to the fact that we need to improve educational attainment in Northern Tasmania. We want to see higher education with better numbers of students graduating from university, higher incomes and higher productivity, particularly within the Tasmanian economy. Every small business in Northern Tasmania should aspire to the fact that they will have better productivity by paying their highly educated workforce more and, of course, improving the economic performance of their business.


Now, there is no doubt that people recognise that universities represent a significant opportunity for economic growth. Recent studies suggest that the mere presence of higher numbers of university graduates in an economy significantly drives employment not just within the graduate cohort but within the wider workforce. What's the response of this government? The response of this government is to make it more difficult for people to attend university or, if they do attend university, they'll have a higher education debt, which they'll pay off earlier, because this government simply don't see our young people or our people in regional Australia having the opportunity to get ahead. We know that regional Australia, regional economies and the other states throughout Australia need this investment in higher education. It's vitally important that we push back, that we reject these amendments and that we reject this legislation. Thank you.

Mr HILL
 (Bruce) (17:04):  I want to echo what has already been said about the appalling impacts of the substantive provisions of the legislation to lower the thresholds and make young people repay their education debt earlier—but I'll touch on that in a moment. At the outset, I want to call out the appalling process that the government has gone through, which has been almost an abuse of the House. We have debated a version of this legislation twice at length. Sloppy reheated seconds came back when the government couldn't get the first go through, so they thought, 'We couldn't get $42,000 through; we'll try $45,000.' They shunted that off to the Senate. They read the writing on the wall that it was going to again fail in the Senate and die where it should've, and at the last minute they've cooked up a dodgy deal with the crossbench, which the House has not been briefed or advised on. We haven't had a moment to reflect on what it actually means. It's an appalling way to make education policy.


From what I've been told there is a second amendment. We are debating two amendments concurrently, and the debate so far has focused quite rightly on the awful impacts on young people in our communities, but the other amendment, which we're being told we have to debate and vote on concurrently, relates to extending loans to table B providers for private universities and removing loan fees for these institutions. That may be a good idea. I understand that Labor has an open mind to this. This is exactly the kind of issue we would publicly and transparently consider with consultation in a proper, grown-up policy process. All the government muppets who ran away from this debate are going to wander back in, stick their hands up and have no idea what they're actually voting on. In fact, hardly anyone in the House has any idea what we're voting on, because the government has done some dodgy deal with Senator Bernardi in the other place.


I don't understand the policy impacts or arguments around extending loans for table B providers for private universities. The extension of the loans in the system may have some value, but we have said that, in government, we would consider it in our national inquiry on post-secondary education, where everyone can have a say. It's probably old-fashioned, with the government's approach to making policy and legislation, to actually allow members to understand what they're voting on and put the detail in front of them; nevertheless, I think it is important that the House understands that we're voting on two very different things, one of which has never been part of the government's legislative proposal and has never been considered or debated in any sense by this House.


With regard to the other provision, the government's latest attempt to make life harder for young people, we hear from those opposite that lowering the repayment threshold, the income at which young people will be forced to repay their education debts, doesn't really matter, because it's just $5 or 10 bucks a week, not a lot of money. It might not be a lot of money to people in here—to those opposite, who just awarded themselves a tax cut worth $7,000 when it fully rolls out—but $5 is a lot of money to people in my community, to students struggling to make ends meet and put themselves through university while the government opposite cuts their penalty rates. On behalf of young people in my community I don't accept that $5 or $10 is a just little bit of money; it is significant.


I have to speak up on behalf of my electorate. During the last campaign I doorknocked more than 12,000 houses over 18 months and asked people, 'What matters most?' The No. 1 priority that kept coming back was education, whether I was talking to a young person thinking about their future, a grandparent worried about their grandkids, or a parent worried about how their kids are going to get to TAFE or university. Most particularly, migrants, who come to this country seeking a better life for their kids, with a laser-like focus on education. In the electorate that I've been proud to represent almost 60 per cent of people are born in another country. They come here, work hard and look for education. This bill takes us in the wrong direction. It makes it harder for young people to get into university.


When you think about our partners and friends in Asia—our competitors in the coming decades—the OECD and everyone else say we should invest in two things: infrastructure and education. A smart country would be lowering barriers to education so that the brightest kid from the poorest family can have a chance to go to university. That was part of my family story. My mum left school at 15 in Footscray. Her family could not afford the uniforms to go to a school that offered year 12. My father, on the other hand, had the opportunity to pay his way through university. He failed a bit and just kept paying. That was seared into my consciousness: every kid, no matter their circumstances, should be able to go to university.



The SPEAKER:  The question is that the amendments be agreed to.

Mr GOODENOUGH
 (Moore) (17:19):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, I present the committee's report titled Human rights scrutiny report: report 7 of 2018.


Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Mr GOODENOUGH:
  by leave—Of the new bills examined in report 7, 12 have been assessed as not raising human rights concerns as they promote, permissibly limit, or do not engage, human rights. To complete its technical assessment of compatibility with Australia's international human rights law obligations, the committee has requested further information in relation to 10 bills and legislative instruments.


Of these bills and instruments, I would like to highlight four instruments made under the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013, which relate to:


the resolution of complaints about national disability insurance scheme (NDIS) providers;


incident management systems for NDIS providers to record reportable incidents;


the disclosure of information by the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commissioner; and


the conditions of registration for NDIS providers that use 'regulated restrictive practices' in delivering NDIS support.


As outlined, these instruments raise a range of issues relevant to the human rights of people with disabilities. Consequently, the committee has requested further information from the minister as to the human rights compatibility of these instruments, particularly regarding the scope of various measures and the adequacy of safeguards to protect human rights.


Chapter 2 of the report contains the committee's concluded examination of 10 bills and legislative instruments. It includes the committee's concluded examination of five park management plans made under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.


In relation to these instruments, the committee has sought further information from the minister as to whether the measures engage and permissibly limit the right to freedom of expression on the basis that they provided certain restrictions on media reporting. The minister's response contained additional information which enabled the committee to conclude that, while certain measures in the plans do limit freedom of expression, they are nevertheless likely to be compatible with this right, because they are sufficiently circumscribed and are only as extensive as necessary to achieve a legitimate objective. This illustrates the constructive process of liaising with legislation proponents to identify relevant information in order to assist the committee in its assessment of legislation.


I encourage my fellow members and others to examine the committee's report to better inform their consideration of proposed legislation.


With these comments, I commend the committee's Report 7 of 2018 to the chamber.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2018-08-14,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fenner) (17:24):  For the avoidance of any doubt, I will move the second reading amendment that has been circulated in my name, which I understand the member for Parramatta will second when I have concluded my remarks. I move:


That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:


""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House notes the Coalition’s failure to close multinational loopholes and its failure to improve tax haven transparency"".


Labor supports the Treasury Laws Amendment (OECD Multilateral Instrument) Bill 2018, which contains amendments to the International Tax Agreements Act to give force of law to the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, known for convenience as the multilateral convention. The multilateral convention is a tax treaty that enables jurisdictions to quickly modify their bilateral tax agreements to give effect to internationally agreed tax integrity rules and to improve dispute resolution mechanisms. The proposal was announced by the government on 8 June 2017, at which point they announced that Australia had signed the multilateral convention and that they would introduce a bill to give the convention the force of law in Australia. The measure is estimated to give an unquantifiable gain to revenue over the forward estimates.


The multilateral convention is just one of many action items in the OECD's and G20's base erosion and profit-shifting strategy to coordinate global action against tax avoidance and minimisation strategies by multinational firms. The project was initiated by the G20 in 2012 and is headed by the OECD. Although Australia has adopted many of the multilateral convention's articles, it has not agreed to article 10, an anti-abuse rule for permanent establishments situated in third jurisdictions, also known as tax havens. It has not agreed to article 12, the artificial avoidance of permanent establishment status through certain arrangements, despite an earlier Treasury paper indicating that Australia would adopt this article.


So, Labor are left in the position where, while we support the bill, we haven't received a clear indication from the government as to why they aren't supporting article 10 and article 12. Given the government's lack of action on multinational tax avoidance—in particular, their lack of action on tax havens—we're particularly concerned about the government's failure to agree to article 10. So I want to note now that the failure of the government to provide a clear rationale for not signing up to these two articles means that a future Labor government would use the resources of Treasury to explore the ramifications of not signing these two articles and consider whether or not that question would be revisited by a future Shorten Labor government.


Once the multilateral convention enters into force for Australia—and subject to the entry into force for the relevant partner jurisdictions—it will have the following impacts on Australia's existing tax agreements with partner jurisdictions: first, in respect of withholding tax on amounts paid or deemed to be paid by a nonresident on or after 1 January, occurring on or after the latter date of entry into force of the multilateral convention for Australia and the partner jurisdiction; second, in respect of other taxes levied by Australia in relation to income profits or gains of any income year beginning on or after six months after the latter date of entry into force of the multilateral convention for Australia and each of its relevant partner jurisdictions; and, third, in respect of the mutual agreement procedure and mandatory binding arbitration, generally the latter date of entry into force of the multilateral convention for Australia and each of the relevant partner jurisdictions.


The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommended that parliament ratify the instrument, but I would draw the House's attention to the additional comments from Labor members and senators where they said that the committee process was 'constrained by inexplicably vague information provided in evidence from Treasury', relating to some revenue details.. The only non-Treasury submission to the committee process was the Tax Justice Network's. While overall supportive of parliament ratifying the instrument, they noted disappointment that the government had chosen not to support articles relating to tax havens. It's our understanding that if the bill isn't passed by the government's intended time frame of this month then a year of implementation would be missed. As such, Labor can assure parliament of our support for the expeditious passage of this bill through the other place.


As we debate in this place the issue of multinational tax avoidance, we do so in the broader context of my second reading amendment, noting that many of Australia's largest firms have paid no tax for the past few years. While inequality is high and rising and while this government has been cutting health funding and education funding, its priority still remains an $80 billion tax cut to big Australian firms, $17 billion of which goes to the big banks.


We know that Australia is missing out on billions of dollars in tax revenue due to the government's failure to act on tax loopholes. Labor has a clear and costed plan and clear proposals on improving tax transparency, so the Australian people can see more tax being paid by multinationals and garner a clearer picture of exactly how multinational tax avoidance is affecting the public coffers. Labor has proposed public reporting of country-by-country reports which could help stem the flow of missing money. But we've seen from this Treasurer an unwillingness to close the loopholes. Corporate profits have soared. Australia's company tax rate is only in the middle of the G20 pack, and we now have the example of the United States, whose corporate tax cut has not flowed through to a significant increase in wage growth.


Despite all of that, the government remains wedded to a big-business tax cut. They talk a big game on multinational tax, but their ads, in many cases, have cost more than their measures have actually raised. They've spent more on patting themselves on the back over multinational tax avoidance than they've raised through attempting to close loopholes. They were walking around claiming that their multinational tax laws had clawed back some $4 billion in multinational tax revenue—a claim which unravelled when it was revealed that the revenue was for tax years prior to the commencement of the government's multinational anti-avoidance law and their diverted profits tax. On 22 August 2017, the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services claimed that, of that $4 billion 'about $2.9 billion came from just seven companies alone'. Labor legislation was being applied in all seven cases cited by Minister O'Dwyer. Specifically, the cases involved Labor's Tax Laws Amendment (Countering Tax Avoidance and Multinational Profit Shifting) Bill 2013 and the Tax Laws Amendment (Cross-Border Transfer Pricing) Bill (No. 1) 2012. The coalition voted against these bills in both houses.


That wasn't an isolated fib. There was extraordinary chutzpah from the Turnbull government when they tried to claim credit for the Australian tax office's victory over Chevron in the Federal Court by claiming their own piecemeal tax measures were 'working'. On the day of the Federal Court decision, Treasurer Morrison tweeted:


Chevron will pay more than $300m to the ATO proving the govt’s program of tax avoidance funding and new measures is working.


The thing that he didn't tell his Twitter followers was that he voted against the very laws which secured that judgement against Chevron. If Treasurer Morrison had had his way, if the parliament had gone the way he voted, then those laws wouldn't have got up, and the Chevron decision wouldn't have gone through, because, in 2012, the coalition voted against the then Labor government's Tax Laws Amendment (Cross-Border Transfer Pricing) Bill (No. 1) 2012. The Treasurer voted against it. The Minister for Revenue and Financial Services voted against it. Yet, when that very bill was used to secure a judgement against Chevron that improved the budget bottom line and slightly reduced the debt blow-out that is occurring under this government, the Treasurer and the minister for revenue didn't issue a mea culpa. They pretended to the Australian public that it was their laws which had secured that judgement. Their reason for voting against that 2012 loophole-closing bill was a claim that the law was retrospective, but, in reality, that law simply clarified the operation of our tax laws and made sure multinationals couldn't exploit loopholes.


What we've also seen is that, as well as misrepresenting their own votes, the government have misrepresented Labor's votes. They've said that Labor voted against the multinational anti-avoidance law—a simple mistruth. Labor never voted against the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law. What they may be confusing is Labor's voting against a dodgy deal between the Liberals and the Greens to water down tax transparency in Australia and take two-thirds of the private firms out of the tax transparency net by raising the threshold for tax transparency disclosure. I've got to say that, when I'm on my street stalls, I'm not besieged by constituents saying to me, 'The real problem is we have too much tax transparency in Australia!'


When we first came towards the first reporting deadline, we saw a farrago of confused excuses from this government as to why we oughtn't have tax transparency. They said it was a form of red tape. They said it would create security concerns, raise the kidnap risk for those running private firms, while later admitting that they had received no advice on kidnap risk from security or policing agencies, leading one tax expert to describe the purported kidnap risk as, 'The stupidest excuse for non-disclosure', that he had ever seen.


From this government we've seen an attempt to hide the truth from the Australian public about what big firms are paying. We've seen an attempt from this government to mislead the Australian people about their own record on multinational tax avoidance and about Labor's voting record in this place. Labor knows what needs to be done. We'll continue to lead the debate on multinational tax avoidance. If the Turnbull government were serious about tax fairness, it would adopt Labor's plan to close tax loopholes and crack down on tax evasion.


Labor's plan includes tightening debt deduction loopholes used by multinational firms, improving the budget by billions of dollars over the medium term. Labor's plan involves introducing public reporting of country-by-country reports, which is high-level information about where and how much tax was paid by large corporations—those with over $1 billion in global revenue.


Labor's tax plan involves providing protection for whistleblowers who report to the Australia Taxation Office on entities evading tax. Where whistleblowers information results in more tax being paid we would see them collecting a share of that tax penalty. It is not a radical idea, one which exists in an analogous form in the United States at the moment, and one which would ensure that we get greater compliance with our tax law.


Labor's multinational tax plan includes introducing a publicly accessible registry of the beneficial ownership of Australian listed companies and trusts. That will allow everyone to find out who really owns our firms. Shareholders shouldn't be able to use complex structures and sham ownership to avoid complying with corporate transparency rules. Yet, the government has explicitly said that while at some point in the undefined future they might do something about a beneficial ownership register, it won't include trusts. That beneficial ownership register itself is nowhere in sight and the government is devoting paltry resources towards introducing it.


Labor's multinational tax plan includes introducing mandatory shareholder reporting of tax haven exposure. If companies are doing business in a tax haven then they must disclose to shareholders that activity as a material tax risk. We would guide companies on which jurisdictions carry a material tax risk through a tax haven blacklist. Labor's multinational tax plan includes appointing a community sector representative to the Board of Taxation, ensuring community sector voices are heard in tax design and review processes. Labor's multinational tax plan includes introducing public reporting of Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre data and requiring the annual public release of international cash flow data. Our plan would require government tenderers to disclose their country of tax domicile if they're bidding for government contracts worth more than $200,000. Those with particular tax domiciles wouldn't be ruled out, but we believe that it's appropriate that, if a firm is headquartered outside Australia, the Australian taxpayer is aware of where that tenderer is headquartered for tax purposes.


Labor's multinational tax plan develops guidelines for tax haven investment by superannuation funds. Those guidelines will be developed by the Australian Taxation Office in collaboration with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. Labor's multinational tax plan would require that the Australian Taxation Office's annual report provide information on the number and size of tax settlements. Finally, Labor's multinational tax plan would deliver more tax transparency by restoring the original tax transparency thresholds. When Labor enacted tax transparency laws, under then Treasurer Wayne Swan and Assistant Treasurer David Bradbury, we had in place a $100 million threshold for both public and private firms. In a dodgy deal between the Liberals and the Greens political party, this was raised to $200 million for private firms. That had the effect of taking two-thirds of the private firms out of the tax transparency mix. While the Greens have belatedly backflipped on this, supporting our private senator's bill to restore a lower threshold for reporting, the government eventually gagged debate when that bill was returned to the House. If the government really cared about transparency, if they really cared more about making sure that Australians know what company tax is paid, rather than protecting their mates, then they would facilitate debate in this House on that bill.


The Liberals won't close tax loopholes. The Liberals won't crack down on tax havens. Since coming to office, the Liberals have cut over 4,000 staff from the Australian Taxation Office. Only Labor has a complete tax-haven plan. Only Labor can be trusted to get tough on multinational tax avoidance.

"Keogh, Matt, MP",ALP,2018-08-14,"



Mr KEOGH
 (Burt) (17:41):  It's my absolute pleasure to second the amendment and to speak to the Treasury Laws Amendment (OECD Multilateral Instrument) Bill 2018. The government's Treasury website states:


Australia is leading the global fight against multinational tax avoidance and is cracking-down on taxpayer tax evasion with a number of reforms announced as part of the 2016-17 Budget.


Well, how can that actually be possible when one in five of Australia's biggest companies have paid no tax in the last three years? Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison say they've been cracking down on tax avoidance, yet we know their true tricky priority is looking after their buddies in big business. They are not only not cracking down on tax avoidance but indeed are giving them a further $80 billion tax cut. What a joke. There's no way that Australia's biggest money-makers aren't contributing to our nation's tax reserves! But unfortunately that is precisely the case. In 2015-16, 17 of the top 50 companies paid no corporate tax, leaving just 33 to shoulder that burden. Between them, they provided just under $20 billion worth of tax. Interestingly, the Prime Minister's old employer, Goldman Sachs, is among these. While it had revenues of at least $1.8 billion over the last three years, with an operating profit in each of those years, it paid zero dollars of corporate tax.


Australia is being deprived of billions in tax revenue, thanks to loopholes that the Turnbull government refuses to act on, despite Labor's alternative of tax transparency laws showing just how the people of Australia are losing. There are numerous studies and analyses that show the extent to which multinational tax avoidance prevents national governments and their citizens from receiving the funds they are due. This in turn inevitably means the tax burden falls unfairly on domestic companies and individuals, that global inequality is sharpened, and that public goods and services are not funded or delivered. We know that fair taxation is an essential element of a well-managed domestic and global economy. It is both inefficient and indeed immoral when companies play tricky, complicated games in order to avoid contributing their fair share to society—the society from which they derive their existence and indeed their profits.


We know that the introduction of public reporting of country-by-country reports, as suggested by Labor in our policy on properly assessing and taxing, could help stem the flow of missing money. The Treasurer, on the other hand, doesn't want to get his boys in big business offside and doesn't want to close these loopholes. Despite soaring corporate profits and the fact that Australia's company tax rate actually places us in the middle of the G20 pack, the only policy he has is a big-business tax cut. The government continues to talk a big game on multinational tax, yet to date it has failed to actually deliver any significant results.


The multilateral convention that we are here to discuss as part of this legislation today is a tax treaty that enables jurisdictions to quickly modify their bilateral tax agreements to give effect to internationally agreed tax integrity rules and improved dispute-resolution mechanisms. The multilateral convention is one of many action items of the OECD in the G20's base erosion and profit shifting strategies to coordinate global action against tax avoidance and minimisation strategies by multinational companies. This is indeed a global effort and global push, but one that it seems the Turnbull government doesn't want to wholly sign up to. The multilateral instrument will enable jurisdictions to swiftly modify their bilateral tax treaties to implement measures designed to better address multinational tax avoidance.


Although Australia has adopted the majority of the convention's articles, there are two major components that for some reason this government has decided not to agree to. The first is article 10, an anti-abuse rule for permanent establishments situated in third jurisdictions, which is a euphemistic way of saying tax havens. This article denies treaty benefits where an entity that is a resident of a jurisdiction party to a bilateral tax agreement derives certain income from other jurisdictions. The Tax Justice Network is opposed to this decision of government. It believes the Australian government should adopt article 10 without reservation to further deter the use of secrecy jurisdictions to avoid paying tax. The OECD notes this particular article was intended to address:


… potential abuses that may result from the transfer of shares, debt-claims, rights or property to permanent establishments set up solely for that purpose in countries that offer preferential treatment to the income from such assets.


The network is deeply disappointed this government has not adopted the article as it provides a loophole for big business to continue to avoid taxation.


The second article that this government has refused to adopt from the treaty is article 12. The intention of this article was to ensure where an intermediary habitually concludes contracts or habitually plays the principle role in concluding substantially finalised business contracts in a jurisdiction on behalf of a foreign enterprise that arrangement would be deemed to constitute a permanent establishment. A permanent establishment is a taxable presence threshold for determining whether a jurisdiction can tax business profits derived by a foreign resident enterprise. This means, potentially, a foreign enterprise can avoid local taxation of business profits by implementing arrangements that circumvent the existing treaty based definition of a permanent establishment. The Tax Justice Network, again, have told us that they are deeply disappointed that the Australian government has decided to not adopt this provision, which is a reversal of their initial position. The network believes that this article would have assisted in further curbing foreign multinational entities from seeking to artificially avoid creating a permanent establishment. This, in turn, will prevent the government from taxing these businesses profits.


Despite these obvious flaws, Labor do support the treaty action overall. But we observe that this government has done virtually nothing to address the key issue of multinational tax avoidance through the refusal to take up these two critical articles. Even from opposition, Labor has been alone in carrying forward the vital policy work and policy arguments on this vital issue of multinational tax avoidance. Back in 2015 Labor proposed a comprehensive multinational tax package that included a number of measures specifically designed to address the scourge of debt deduction loopholes. This alone would have added $5.4 billion to the budget bottom line over a decade. Elements of this proposed package included the adoption of worldwide gearing ratios to address the issue of thin capitalisation; the implementation of a publicly accessible registry of the beneficial ownership of Australian legal entities, including trusts, as per the G20 principles that Australia has adopted; and the restoration of $100 million as the tax transparency threshold in relation to the public reporting of tax data for private companies. It would also have appointed a community sector representative to the Board of Taxation and delivered increased compliance funding for the Australian Taxation Office.


Meanwhile, the Turnbull government talk a big game on multinational taxation, but they've spent more on spruiking their laws than the legislation has actually directly raised, continuing the coalition's form of neglect of this pressing reform area. In 2012 the coalition opposed Labor's tax law amendment on cross-border transfer pricing, which, after passing, was integral to the ATO's recovery of some $300 million from Chevron. There are numerous studies and analyses that show the extent to which multinational tax avoidance prevents national governments and their citizens from receiving the funds that they are fairly due. This in turn leaves the tax burden on domestic business and on individuals in each nation. This result serves only to heighten global inequality and the lack of funding available for the vital services needed in our community for our citizens, for our people. Labor regards fair taxation as an intrinsic and essential element of a well-managed domestic and global economy. It is both inefficient and, as I said before, immoral when companies are able to play the game, use the loopholes, and put their funds and run their profits through tax-avoidance centres instead of paying their fair share under the tax regime that should fairly apply in Australia.


If the government were serious about tax fairness, it would adopt Labor's plan to close loopholes and crack down on tax havens; it would tighten debt deduction loopholes used by multinational companies, which would improve the budget bottom line by billions of dollars; it would introduce public country-by-country reporting of tax information specifically about where and how much tax was paid by large corporations; and it would provide protection for whistleblowers who report tax-evading entities to the ATO. We believe these whistleblowers should be rewarded where information provided by them results in more tax being paid, allowing them to collect a share of that tax penalty. Let's make sure we get the real word on what's happening. The joint parliamentary committee report was unanimous in its view as to the changes that we should see to whistleblowing laws here in Australia and, once again, the government squibbed on its proposed changes to whistleblowing legislation.


The government needs to introduce a publicly accessible register for the beneficial ownership of Australian listed companies and trusts. This will provide transparency. It will allow anyone to find out who the real owners of our firms are and to see if they are complying with tax requirements and laws, instead of using these structures to avoid taxation. The government should introduce mandatory shareholder reporting of tax-haven exposure. Companies must disclose to shareholders as a material tax risk if a company is doing business in a tax haven, because there are real risks for the ongoing profitability of those companies where they do this contrary to what not just should be the law of this country but is the law of many others. The government should get on with appointing a community sector representative to the Board of Taxation to ensure community views are heard in tax design and review processes.


Finally, it should be introducing public reporting of AUSTRAC data and requiring the annual public release of international cashflow data. But there's more the government could and should do. They should require government tenderers to disclose their country of tax domicile. All firms tendering for government contracts worth over $200,000 could be made to state their country of domicile for tax purposes. Given we'll provide them with taxpayer dollars, it probably makes sense to know where those dollars will end up. The government can develop guidelines for tax haven investment by superannuation funds. They could require the ATO to annually provide information on the number and size of tax settlements. They could deliver more tax transparency by restoring Labor's $100 million threshold for public reporting of tax data by private companies.


We support this bill, but we note it is still deficient in the way in which the government has signed up to this treaty. Without the resources of Treasury we're not in a position to know precisely why the government declined to adopt the treaty in full but, under a Shorten Labor government, we will review that decision. We want to best understand why the government is doing what it's doing. Why is it not signing up to ensure we have the tightest of tax laws in this country, to ensure we don't have leakage, to ensure we have the revenues we need to provide the services our community badly needs and in fact deserves? We will also, as it would seem we are left to, continue to lead the debate on multinational tax avoidance, because we know that when multinationals—or indeed anyone—don't pay their fair share of tax, the rest of us are left to pick up the tab. That's not fair to the Australian taxpayer or the Australian community, and it would seem that the government is quite happy to not be fair.

Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (17:54):  I'm speaking in support of the amendment moved by the member for Fenner. The Treasury Laws Amendment (OECD Multilateral Instrument) Bill 2018 contains amendments to the tax agreements act to give the force of law in Australia to the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting. Labor does support this bill, subject to the amendment that's been moved by the member for Fenner. But we note that the government has declined to adopt two of the articles in the convention that are designed to deter the use of tax havens. Under a Shorten Labor government we will review the decision not to sign up to those parts of the treaty, utilising the resources of Treasury.


Looking at the detail of the bill, the multilateral convention is a tax treaty that enables jurisdictions to quickly modify their bilateral tax arrangements. This helps to give effect to internationally agreed tax integrity rules and improve dispute resolution mechanisms. The multilateral convention is one of many action items of the OECD's and the G20's base erosion and profit shifting strategy to coordinate global action against tax avoidance and minimisation strategies by multinational companies. The project was initiated at the G20 in 2012 and is headed by the OECD. Although Australia has adopted the majority of the multilateral convention articles, it has not agreed to a number of key aspects. They are article 10, which is the anti-abuse rule for permanent establishments situated in third jurisdictions—or tax havens, as they are more commonly known—and article 12, which covers artificial avoidance of permanent establishment status through certain agreements. I want to note that, without a clear rationale from the Turnbull government about their refusal to sign these tax haven measures, a future Shorten Labor government, if we are elected at the next election, would utilise the resources of Treasury to explore the ramifications of not signing these two articles.


When it comes to tackling multinational tax avoidance, it's Labor that's been leading the way, with the Turnbull government following in our wake. One in five of Australia's biggest companies have paid no tax for at least the past three years. There's a lot of anger and resentment out there at the moment in the community about many of these corporations. We've seen that in the approach that many people have taken to the banking royal commission and to the disclosure of the amount of tax that big companies actually pay in this country and the enormous deductions that they're able to use to basically reduce their taxable income and in some cases pay no tax at all. It should never be forgotten that it was Labor that originally established these tax transparency rules to oblige those companies to disclose the amount of payments they are making to governments through the taxation system. And it was the coalition that got into bed with the Greens and watered down those tax laws. They reduced the number of companies that are subject to the law and therefore have to report on an annual basis.


This government claims that they're about tax transparency. But in practice they're actually doing the opposite, reducing the amount of transparency and the number of companies that need to disclose the tax that they pay to the Australian government. We all know that this government's priority at the moment is an $80 billion tax break for the biggest companies throughout the country. They want to give a tax cut to some of the largest corporations in Australia—which include those big banks that have done such a wonderful job by the Australian people over the course of the last decade! As we're seeing in the royal commission, they've been such great backers of Australian small businesses, farmers, and families and have been so generous in their approach to their insurance arms, to their wealth management arms and to disclosure and transparency! Yet this government wants to give those sorts of organisations and the people who run those organisations, and their shareholders, a tax cut. Well, Labor simply won't stand for it. We've had enough of these organisations ripping off the Australian people, being deceitful, being dishonest—sending farmers, small businesses and families to the wall—and getting a tax cut. It's not on, and we're going to stand up for those hardworking small businesspeople, the farmers, Australian workers and their families, and oppose this government's dastardly attempts to give those organisations a tax cut. 


Australia is also missing out on billions in tax revenue thanks to loopholes that the Turnbull government refuses to act on, despite Labor's tax transparency laws showing just how much the people of Australia are losing. The introduction of key public reporting of country-by-country reports, as suggested by Labor—in particular in the resources and extractive industries such as mining, oil and gas—could help stem the flow of missing tax revenue.


Labor's also leading the way in ensuring that large Australian resources companies are good corporate citizens and maintain accountability and transparency through systems that not only ensure they pay their fair share of tax but help combat corruption, particularly in countries where they're operating offshore mining and resources projects, many of them in our backyard in the Pacific. Our policy will require large extractive companies to disclose payments arising from any activity involving exploration, prospecting, discovery, development and extraction. Disclosure under the regime will be on a country-by-country and project-by-project basis. Payments to be disclosed include taxes on income; production and profits of companies; royalties; dividends; signature discovery and production bonuses; fees, including licence fees, rental fees and entry fees; other payments, licences and concessions; payments for infrastructure improvements; and production entitlements such as profit resources. Payments must be disclosed if they are made to any national, regional or local authority of the country, including a department, agency or state-owned enterprise. 


Disclosure under this regime should apply to large extractive companies in Australia. A large company shall be defined as a company that meets at least two of the following criteria: it has a balance sheet total that exceeds $50 million, its net turnover on the balance sheet date exceeds $100 million or the average number of employees during the financial year to which the balance sheet relates exceeds 250. A single or series of related payments within a financial year must be disclosed if the payments amount to at least $150,000. A mandatory reporting regime for extractive industries will increase the availability of verifiable, disaggregated information from company financial reports regarding payments made to governments, and this information would build public accountability and trust in companies and governments. 


A Shorten Labor government, if we're elected, will also establish a multistakeholder committee to work with the government on the implementation of the reporting regime, including defining project-level reporting and the establishment of an online reporting mechanism to ensure public transparency and accessibility. The legislation would include equivalency provisions so that companies captured by other jurisdictions due to cross-listing on stock exchanges would only be required to lodge one report. If we're elected, the extractive industries transparency regime will require subjected companies to begin reporting payments in 2020. 


In line with consultation from interested stakeholders, this policy mirrors as closely as possible the UK scheme and the equivalent provisions contained therein. Our policy, if we are elected, will ensure that extractive companies are among the most transparent and accountable in the world. Our companies will be adopting best practice when it comes to ensuring that they're disclosing payments to government and they're transparent, accountable and combatting corruption in the countries in which they operate. Improved transparency and accountability in extractive industries is an effective mechanism to combat corruption in developing and developed countries. 


Again, it's clear that the Turnbull government doesn't want to close some of the corporate tax loopholes that exist. Some of those relate to tax havens that are part of the OECD and the G20's base erosion and profit shifting agenda. That's evident in the fact that they're not signing up to that article contained in that plan. Despite soaring corporate profits and the fact that Australia's company tax rate places us in the middle of the G20 pack, the only policy that they have is one for a big business tax cut, not further transparency, and that's simply not good enough.


That's why Labor is proposing to look at those additional two articles that the government hasn't signed up to, and that's why we're proposing and promising that if we're elected we'll go further, with additional transparency and accountability, particularly in the resources and extractive industries, on a country-by-country and project-by-project basis. I urge all members to support the very sensible amendment that has been moved by the member for Fenner.

"O'Dwyer, Kelly, MP",LP,2018-08-14,"



Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins—Minister for Revenue and Financial Services, Minister for Women and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (18:05):  I listened carefully to the speech of the member for Kingsford Smith on the Treasury Laws Amendment (OECD Multilateral Instrument) Bill 2018, and I was a little disappointed to find that it was devoid of so many facts. So, I appreciate the opportunity to now set the record straight when it comes to the government's commitment to tackling multinational anti-avoidance of tax. If a multinational corporation makes money in Australia, it is right they pay tax in Australia. The Turnbull government has introduced new laws to close loopholes, to ensure that profits are taxed here. The Turnbull government is absolutely determined to make sure that everyone is paying the right amount of tax, and large multinationals must pay their share. Deliberate tax avoidance will not be tolerated, and tax cheats will be tracked down and will face the full force of the law.


Whilst the Turnbull government have taken strong action and introduced tough new laws, Labor, by contrast, when they were in government, did virtually nothing to combat tax avoiders, and in opposition they opposed our Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law and the introduction of the country-by-country reporting regime. Paying tax is not optional. The Turnbull government will ensure that multinational companies pay the tax that they owe in Australia. As a result of our new laws, more money will be invested here, benefitting our community and helping guarantee the essential services and infrastructure that Australians rely on.


Given the fact-free contribution by the member for Kingsford Smith, I'd like to place on record that, since the government established the Tax Avoidance Taskforce, the Australian Taxation Office has raised around $7 billion in income tax liabilities against large public groups and multinationals. The Australian Taxation Office has collected $4.1 billion in cash, with $3.1 billion of that amount from multinational enterprises. Of that $3.1 billion, the Australian Taxation Office has collected over $1 billion from ecommerce companies. The government's coordinated plan to tackle profit shifting and avoidance of Australian tax law will keep paying dividends as well. The Australian Taxation Office confirms that the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law alone has seen additional sales income of $7 billion each year now being returned in Australia. Furthermore, hundreds of millions of dollars of additional GST revenue is now being paid. The Australian Taxation Office has publicly indicated that there is a significant change in how multinational companies are approaching their Australian tax obligations as a result of the tough new anti-avoidance laws put in place by this government and not supported by those opposite. In fact, Australia is leading the way in combatting multinational tax avoidance—no thanks to those who are not trying to find solutions to the problems that we have identified and tackled.


I would, though, like to thank those who have made a contribution to this debate. This bill will help Australia to quickly and efficiently modify the majority of Australia's bilateral tax treaties to bring them into line with international best practice when it comes to tackling multinational tax avoidance. It will complement the other measures implemented by the government to enhance tax system integrity, including the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law, country-by-country reporting and the diverted profits tax. The multilateral instrument is a unique tool that is expected to update more than 1,100 bilateral tax treaties worldwide. At present, based on the known positions of other jurisdictions, the multilateral instrument will modify 31 of Australia's 44 existing bilateral treaties. Modifying these treaties through the multilateral instrument will save time and expense, significantly, for Australia, compared to the alternative of bilaterally renegotiating each treaty to achieve similar outcomes.


The multilateral instrument will ensure that multinational entities are no longer able to exploit Australia's bilateral tax treaties in order to avoid paying tax. Additionally, the multilateral instrument will provide greater certainty for taxpayers by strengthening current tax treaty related dispute resolution procedures. Australia has committed to working closely with its treaty partners to resolve treaty related tax disputes through the multilateral instrument. Where both treaty partners agree, taxpayers will also have access to independent and binding arbitration, thereby allowing disputes to be resolved more quickly.


Looking to the future, the government will continue to work with the G20 and the OECD bilaterally to ensure that the international tax system operates as efficiently, fairly and effectively as possible. The multilateral instrument clearly demonstrates the benefits of international cooperation, and the government encourages other jurisdictions to adopt it to the fullest extent possible. I commend the bill to the House.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fenner) (17:24):  For the avoidance of any doubt, I will move the second reading amendment that has been circulated in my name, which I understand the member for Parramatta will second when I have concluded my remarks. I move:


That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:


""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House notes the Coalition’s failure to close multinational loopholes and its failure to improve tax haven transparency"".


Labor supports the Treasury Laws Amendment (OECD Multilateral Instrument) Bill 2018, which contains amendments to the International Tax Agreements Act to give force of law to the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, known for convenience as the multilateral convention. The multilateral convention is a tax treaty that enables jurisdictions to quickly modify their bilateral tax agreements to give effect to internationally agreed tax integrity rules and to improve dispute resolution mechanisms. The proposal was announced by the government on 8 June 2017, at which point they announced that Australia had signed the multilateral convention and that they would introduce a bill to give the convention the force of law in Australia. The measure is estimated to give an unquantifiable gain to revenue over the forward estimates.


The multilateral convention is just one of many action items in the OECD's and G20's base erosion and profit-shifting strategy to coordinate global action against tax avoidance and minimisation strategies by multinational firms. The project was initiated by the G20 in 2012 and is headed by the OECD. Although Australia has adopted many of the multilateral convention's articles, it has not agreed to article 10, an anti-abuse rule for permanent establishments situated in third jurisdictions, also known as tax havens. It has not agreed to article 12, the artificial avoidance of permanent establishment status through certain arrangements, despite an earlier Treasury paper indicating that Australia would adopt this article.


So, Labor are left in the position where, while we support the bill, we haven't received a clear indication from the government as to why they aren't supporting article 10 and article 12. Given the government's lack of action on multinational tax avoidance—in particular, their lack of action on tax havens—we're particularly concerned about the government's failure to agree to article 10. So I want to note now that the failure of the government to provide a clear rationale for not signing up to these two articles means that a future Labor government would use the resources of Treasury to explore the ramifications of not signing these two articles and consider whether or not that question would be revisited by a future Shorten Labor government.


Once the multilateral convention enters into force for Australia—and subject to the entry into force for the relevant partner jurisdictions—it will have the following impacts on Australia's existing tax agreements with partner jurisdictions: first, in respect of withholding tax on amounts paid or deemed to be paid by a nonresident on or after 1 January, occurring on or after the latter date of entry into force of the multilateral convention for Australia and the partner jurisdiction; second, in respect of other taxes levied by Australia in relation to income profits or gains of any income year beginning on or after six months after the latter date of entry into force of the multilateral convention for Australia and each of its relevant partner jurisdictions; and, third, in respect of the mutual agreement procedure and mandatory binding arbitration, generally the latter date of entry into force of the multilateral convention for Australia and each of the relevant partner jurisdictions.


The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommended that parliament ratify the instrument, but I would draw the House's attention to the additional comments from Labor members and senators where they said that the committee process was 'constrained by inexplicably vague information provided in evidence from Treasury', relating to some revenue details.. The only non-Treasury submission to the committee process was the Tax Justice Network's. While overall supportive of parliament ratifying the instrument, they noted disappointment that the government had chosen not to support articles relating to tax havens. It's our understanding that if the bill isn't passed by the government's intended time frame of this month then a year of implementation would be missed. As such, Labor can assure parliament of our support for the expeditious passage of this bill through the other place.


As we debate in this place the issue of multinational tax avoidance, we do so in the broader context of my second reading amendment, noting that many of Australia's largest firms have paid no tax for the past few years. While inequality is high and rising and while this government has been cutting health funding and education funding, its priority still remains an $80 billion tax cut to big Australian firms, $17 billion of which goes to the big banks.


We know that Australia is missing out on billions of dollars in tax revenue due to the government's failure to act on tax loopholes. Labor has a clear and costed plan and clear proposals on improving tax transparency, so the Australian people can see more tax being paid by multinationals and garner a clearer picture of exactly how multinational tax avoidance is affecting the public coffers. Labor has proposed public reporting of country-by-country reports which could help stem the flow of missing money. But we've seen from this Treasurer an unwillingness to close the loopholes. Corporate profits have soared. Australia's company tax rate is only in the middle of the G20 pack, and we now have the example of the United States, whose corporate tax cut has not flowed through to a significant increase in wage growth.


Despite all of that, the government remains wedded to a big-business tax cut. They talk a big game on multinational tax, but their ads, in many cases, have cost more than their measures have actually raised. They've spent more on patting themselves on the back over multinational tax avoidance than they've raised through attempting to close loopholes. They were walking around claiming that their multinational tax laws had clawed back some $4 billion in multinational tax revenue—a claim which unravelled when it was revealed that the revenue was for tax years prior to the commencement of the government's multinational anti-avoidance law and their diverted profits tax. On 22 August 2017, the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services claimed that, of that $4 billion 'about $2.9 billion came from just seven companies alone'. Labor legislation was being applied in all seven cases cited by Minister O'Dwyer. Specifically, the cases involved Labor's Tax Laws Amendment (Countering Tax Avoidance and Multinational Profit Shifting) Bill 2013 and the Tax Laws Amendment (Cross-Border Transfer Pricing) Bill (No. 1) 2012. The coalition voted against these bills in both houses.


That wasn't an isolated fib. There was extraordinary chutzpah from the Turnbull government when they tried to claim credit for the Australian tax office's victory over Chevron in the Federal Court by claiming their own piecemeal tax measures were 'working'. On the day of the Federal Court decision, Treasurer Morrison tweeted:


Chevron will pay more than $300m to the ATO proving the govt’s program of tax avoidance funding and new measures is working.


The thing that he didn't tell his Twitter followers was that he voted against the very laws which secured that judgement against Chevron. If Treasurer Morrison had had his way, if the parliament had gone the way he voted, then those laws wouldn't have got up, and the Chevron decision wouldn't have gone through, because, in 2012, the coalition voted against the then Labor government's Tax Laws Amendment (Cross-Border Transfer Pricing) Bill (No. 1) 2012. The Treasurer voted against it. The Minister for Revenue and Financial Services voted against it. Yet, when that very bill was used to secure a judgement against Chevron that improved the budget bottom line and slightly reduced the debt blow-out that is occurring under this government, the Treasurer and the minister for revenue didn't issue a mea culpa. They pretended to the Australian public that it was their laws which had secured that judgement. Their reason for voting against that 2012 loophole-closing bill was a claim that the law was retrospective, but, in reality, that law simply clarified the operation of our tax laws and made sure multinationals couldn't exploit loopholes.


What we've also seen is that, as well as misrepresenting their own votes, the government have misrepresented Labor's votes. They've said that Labor voted against the multinational anti-avoidance law—a simple mistruth. Labor never voted against the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law. What they may be confusing is Labor's voting against a dodgy deal between the Liberals and the Greens to water down tax transparency in Australia and take two-thirds of the private firms out of the tax transparency net by raising the threshold for tax transparency disclosure. I've got to say that, when I'm on my street stalls, I'm not besieged by constituents saying to me, 'The real problem is we have too much tax transparency in Australia!'


When we first came towards the first reporting deadline, we saw a farrago of confused excuses from this government as to why we oughtn't have tax transparency. They said it was a form of red tape. They said it would create security concerns, raise the kidnap risk for those running private firms, while later admitting that they had received no advice on kidnap risk from security or policing agencies, leading one tax expert to describe the purported kidnap risk as, 'The stupidest excuse for non-disclosure', that he had ever seen.


From this government we've seen an attempt to hide the truth from the Australian public about what big firms are paying. We've seen an attempt from this government to mislead the Australian people about their own record on multinational tax avoidance and about Labor's voting record in this place. Labor knows what needs to be done. We'll continue to lead the debate on multinational tax avoidance. If the Turnbull government were serious about tax fairness, it would adopt Labor's plan to close tax loopholes and crack down on tax evasion.


Labor's plan includes tightening debt deduction loopholes used by multinational firms, improving the budget by billions of dollars over the medium term. Labor's plan involves introducing public reporting of country-by-country reports, which is high-level information about where and how much tax was paid by large corporations—those with over $1 billion in global revenue.


Labor's tax plan involves providing protection for whistleblowers who report to the Australia Taxation Office on entities evading tax. Where whistleblowers information results in more tax being paid we would see them collecting a share of that tax penalty. It is not a radical idea, one which exists in an analogous form in the United States at the moment, and one which would ensure that we get greater compliance with our tax law.


Labor's multinational tax plan includes introducing a publicly accessible registry of the beneficial ownership of Australian listed companies and trusts. That will allow everyone to find out who really owns our firms. Shareholders shouldn't be able to use complex structures and sham ownership to avoid complying with corporate transparency rules. Yet, the government has explicitly said that while at some point in the undefined future they might do something about a beneficial ownership register, it won't include trusts. That beneficial ownership register itself is nowhere in sight and the government is devoting paltry resources towards introducing it.


Labor's multinational tax plan includes introducing mandatory shareholder reporting of tax haven exposure. If companies are doing business in a tax haven then they must disclose to shareholders that activity as a material tax risk. We would guide companies on which jurisdictions carry a material tax risk through a tax haven blacklist. Labor's multinational tax plan includes appointing a community sector representative to the Board of Taxation, ensuring community sector voices are heard in tax design and review processes. Labor's multinational tax plan includes introducing public reporting of Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre data and requiring the annual public release of international cash flow data. Our plan would require government tenderers to disclose their country of tax domicile if they're bidding for government contracts worth more than $200,000. Those with particular tax domiciles wouldn't be ruled out, but we believe that it's appropriate that, if a firm is headquartered outside Australia, the Australian taxpayer is aware of where that tenderer is headquartered for tax purposes.


Labor's multinational tax plan develops guidelines for tax haven investment by superannuation funds. Those guidelines will be developed by the Australian Taxation Office in collaboration with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. Labor's multinational tax plan would require that the Australian Taxation Office's annual report provide information on the number and size of tax settlements. Finally, Labor's multinational tax plan would deliver more tax transparency by restoring the original tax transparency thresholds. When Labor enacted tax transparency laws, under then Treasurer Wayne Swan and Assistant Treasurer David Bradbury, we had in place a $100 million threshold for both public and private firms. In a dodgy deal between the Liberals and the Greens political party, this was raised to $200 million for private firms. That had the effect of taking two-thirds of the private firms out of the tax transparency mix. While the Greens have belatedly backflipped on this, supporting our private senator's bill to restore a lower threshold for reporting, the government eventually gagged debate when that bill was returned to the House. If the government really cared about transparency, if they really cared more about making sure that Australians know what company tax is paid, rather than protecting their mates, then they would facilitate debate in this House on that bill.


The Liberals won't close tax loopholes. The Liberals won't crack down on tax havens. Since coming to office, the Liberals have cut over 4,000 staff from the Australian Taxation Office. Only Labor has a complete tax-haven plan. Only Labor can be trusted to get tough on multinational tax avoidance.

Mr Buchholz

"Keogh, Matt, MP",ALP,2018-08-14,"



Mr KEOGH
 (Burt) (17:41):  It's my absolute pleasure to second the amendment and to speak to the Treasury Laws Amendment (OECD Multilateral Instrument) Bill 2018. The government's Treasury website states:


Australia is leading the global fight against multinational tax avoidance and is cracking-down on taxpayer tax evasion with a number of reforms announced as part of the 2016-17 Budget.


Well, how can that actually be possible when one in five of Australia's biggest companies have paid no tax in the last three years? Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison say they've been cracking down on tax avoidance, yet we know their true tricky priority is looking after their buddies in big business. They are not only not cracking down on tax avoidance but indeed are giving them a further $80 billion tax cut. What a joke. There's no way that Australia's biggest money-makers aren't contributing to our nation's tax reserves! But unfortunately that is precisely the case. In 2015-16, 17 of the top 50 companies paid no corporate tax, leaving just 33 to shoulder that burden. Between them, they provided just under $20 billion worth of tax. Interestingly, the Prime Minister's old employer, Goldman Sachs, is among these. While it had revenues of at least $1.8 billion over the last three years, with an operating profit in each of those years, it paid zero dollars of corporate tax.


Australia is being deprived of billions in tax revenue, thanks to loopholes that the Turnbull government refuses to act on, despite Labor's alternative of tax transparency laws showing just how the people of Australia are losing. There are numerous studies and analyses that show the extent to which multinational tax avoidance prevents national governments and their citizens from receiving the funds they are due. This in turn inevitably means the tax burden falls unfairly on domestic companies and individuals, that global inequality is sharpened, and that public goods and services are not funded or delivered. We know that fair taxation is an essential element of a well-managed domestic and global economy. It is both inefficient and indeed immoral when companies play tricky, complicated games in order to avoid contributing their fair share to society—the society from which they derive their existence and indeed their profits.


We know that the introduction of public reporting of country-by-country reports, as suggested by Labor in our policy on properly assessing and taxing, could help stem the flow of missing money. The Treasurer, on the other hand, doesn't want to get his boys in big business offside and doesn't want to close these loopholes. Despite soaring corporate profits and the fact that Australia's company tax rate actually places us in the middle of the G20 pack, the only policy he has is a big-business tax cut. The government continues to talk a big game on multinational tax, yet to date it has failed to actually deliver any significant results.


The multilateral convention that we are here to discuss as part of this legislation today is a tax treaty that enables jurisdictions to quickly modify their bilateral tax agreements to give effect to internationally agreed tax integrity rules and improved dispute-resolution mechanisms. The multilateral convention is one of many action items of the OECD in the G20's base erosion and profit shifting strategies to coordinate global action against tax avoidance and minimisation strategies by multinational companies. This is indeed a global effort and global push, but one that it seems the Turnbull government doesn't want to wholly sign up to. The multilateral instrument will enable jurisdictions to swiftly modify their bilateral tax treaties to implement measures designed to better address multinational tax avoidance.


Although Australia has adopted the majority of the convention's articles, there are two major components that for some reason this government has decided not to agree to. The first is article 10, an anti-abuse rule for permanent establishments situated in third jurisdictions, which is a euphemistic way of saying tax havens. This article denies treaty benefits where an entity that is a resident of a jurisdiction party to a bilateral tax agreement derives certain income from other jurisdictions. The Tax Justice Network is opposed to this decision of government. It believes the Australian government should adopt article 10 without reservation to further deter the use of secrecy jurisdictions to avoid paying tax. The OECD notes this particular article was intended to address:


… potential abuses that may result from the transfer of shares, debt-claims, rights or property to permanent establishments set up solely for that purpose in countries that offer preferential treatment to the income from such assets.


The network is deeply disappointed this government has not adopted the article as it provides a loophole for big business to continue to avoid taxation.


The second article that this government has refused to adopt from the treaty is article 12. The intention of this article was to ensure where an intermediary habitually concludes contracts or habitually plays the principle role in concluding substantially finalised business contracts in a jurisdiction on behalf of a foreign enterprise that arrangement would be deemed to constitute a permanent establishment. A permanent establishment is a taxable presence threshold for determining whether a jurisdiction can tax business profits derived by a foreign resident enterprise. This means, potentially, a foreign enterprise can avoid local taxation of business profits by implementing arrangements that circumvent the existing treaty based definition of a permanent establishment. The Tax Justice Network, again, have told us that they are deeply disappointed that the Australian government has decided to not adopt this provision, which is a reversal of their initial position. The network believes that this article would have assisted in further curbing foreign multinational entities from seeking to artificially avoid creating a permanent establishment. This, in turn, will prevent the government from taxing these businesses profits.


Despite these obvious flaws, Labor do support the treaty action overall. But we observe that this government has done virtually nothing to address the key issue of multinational tax avoidance through the refusal to take up these two critical articles. Even from opposition, Labor has been alone in carrying forward the vital policy work and policy arguments on this vital issue of multinational tax avoidance. Back in 2015 Labor proposed a comprehensive multinational tax package that included a number of measures specifically designed to address the scourge of debt deduction loopholes. This alone would have added $5.4 billion to the budget bottom line over a decade. Elements of this proposed package included the adoption of worldwide gearing ratios to address the issue of thin capitalisation; the implementation of a publicly accessible registry of the beneficial ownership of Australian legal entities, including trusts, as per the G20 principles that Australia has adopted; and the restoration of $100 million as the tax transparency threshold in relation to the public reporting of tax data for private companies. It would also have appointed a community sector representative to the Board of Taxation and delivered increased compliance funding for the Australian Taxation Office.


Meanwhile, the Turnbull government talk a big game on multinational taxation, but they've spent more on spruiking their laws than the legislation has actually directly raised, continuing the coalition's form of neglect of this pressing reform area. In 2012 the coalition opposed Labor's tax law amendment on cross-border transfer pricing, which, after passing, was integral to the ATO's recovery of some $300 million from Chevron. There are numerous studies and analyses that show the extent to which multinational tax avoidance prevents national governments and their citizens from receiving the funds that they are fairly due. This in turn leaves the tax burden on domestic business and on individuals in each nation. This result serves only to heighten global inequality and the lack of funding available for the vital services needed in our community for our citizens, for our people. Labor regards fair taxation as an intrinsic and essential element of a well-managed domestic and global economy. It is both inefficient and, as I said before, immoral when companies are able to play the game, use the loopholes, and put their funds and run their profits through tax-avoidance centres instead of paying their fair share under the tax regime that should fairly apply in Australia.


If the government were serious about tax fairness, it would adopt Labor's plan to close loopholes and crack down on tax havens; it would tighten debt deduction loopholes used by multinational companies, which would improve the budget bottom line by billions of dollars; it would introduce public country-by-country reporting of tax information specifically about where and how much tax was paid by large corporations; and it would provide protection for whistleblowers who report tax-evading entities to the ATO. We believe these whistleblowers should be rewarded where information provided by them results in more tax being paid, allowing them to collect a share of that tax penalty. Let's make sure we get the real word on what's happening. The joint parliamentary committee report was unanimous in its view as to the changes that we should see to whistleblowing laws here in Australia and, once again, the government squibbed on its proposed changes to whistleblowing legislation.


The government needs to introduce a publicly accessible register for the beneficial ownership of Australian listed companies and trusts. This will provide transparency. It will allow anyone to find out who the real owners of our firms are and to see if they are complying with tax requirements and laws, instead of using these structures to avoid taxation. The government should introduce mandatory shareholder reporting of tax-haven exposure. Companies must disclose to shareholders as a material tax risk if a company is doing business in a tax haven, because there are real risks for the ongoing profitability of those companies where they do this contrary to what not just should be the law of this country but is the law of many others. The government should get on with appointing a community sector representative to the Board of Taxation to ensure community views are heard in tax design and review processes.


Finally, it should be introducing public reporting of AUSTRAC data and requiring the annual public release of international cashflow data. But there's more the government could and should do. They should require government tenderers to disclose their country of tax domicile. All firms tendering for government contracts worth over $200,000 could be made to state their country of domicile for tax purposes. Given we'll provide them with taxpayer dollars, it probably makes sense to know where those dollars will end up. The government can develop guidelines for tax haven investment by superannuation funds. They could require the ATO to annually provide information on the number and size of tax settlements. They could deliver more tax transparency by restoring Labor's $100 million threshold for public reporting of tax data by private companies.


We support this bill, but we note it is still deficient in the way in which the government has signed up to this treaty. Without the resources of Treasury we're not in a position to know precisely why the government declined to adopt the treaty in full but, under a Shorten Labor government, we will review that decision. We want to best understand why the government is doing what it's doing. Why is it not signing up to ensure we have the tightest of tax laws in this country, to ensure we don't have leakage, to ensure we have the revenues we need to provide the services our community badly needs and in fact deserves? We will also, as it would seem we are left to, continue to lead the debate on multinational tax avoidance, because we know that when multinationals—or indeed anyone—don't pay their fair share of tax, the rest of us are left to pick up the tab. That's not fair to the Australian taxpayer or the Australian community, and it would seem that the government is quite happy to not be fair.

"Thistlethwaite, Matt, MP",ALP,2018-08-14,"



Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (17:54):  I'm speaking in support of the amendment moved by the member for Fenner. The Treasury Laws Amendment (OECD Multilateral Instrument) Bill 2018 contains amendments to the tax agreements act to give the force of law in Australia to the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting. Labor does support this bill, subject to the amendment that's been moved by the member for Fenner. But we note that the government has declined to adopt two of the articles in the convention that are designed to deter the use of tax havens. Under a Shorten Labor government we will review the decision not to sign up to those parts of the treaty, utilising the resources of Treasury.


Looking at the detail of the bill, the multilateral convention is a tax treaty that enables jurisdictions to quickly modify their bilateral tax arrangements. This helps to give effect to internationally agreed tax integrity rules and improve dispute resolution mechanisms. The multilateral convention is one of many action items of the OECD's and the G20's base erosion and profit shifting strategy to coordinate global action against tax avoidance and minimisation strategies by multinational companies. The project was initiated at the G20 in 2012 and is headed by the OECD. Although Australia has adopted the majority of the multilateral convention articles, it has not agreed to a number of key aspects. They are article 10, which is the anti-abuse rule for permanent establishments situated in third jurisdictions—or tax havens, as they are more commonly known—and article 12, which covers artificial avoidance of permanent establishment status through certain agreements. I want to note that, without a clear rationale from the Turnbull government about their refusal to sign these tax haven measures, a future Shorten Labor government, if we are elected at the next election, would utilise the resources of Treasury to explore the ramifications of not signing these two articles.


When it comes to tackling multinational tax avoidance, it's Labor that's been leading the way, with the Turnbull government following in our wake. One in five of Australia's biggest companies have paid no tax for at least the past three years. There's a lot of anger and resentment out there at the moment in the community about many of these corporations. We've seen that in the approach that many people have taken to the banking royal commission and to the disclosure of the amount of tax that big companies actually pay in this country and the enormous deductions that they're able to use to basically reduce their taxable income and in some cases pay no tax at all. It should never be forgotten that it was Labor that originally established these tax transparency rules to oblige those companies to disclose the amount of payments they are making to governments through the taxation system. And it was the coalition that got into bed with the Greens and watered down those tax laws. They reduced the number of companies that are subject to the law and therefore have to report on an annual basis.


This government claims that they're about tax transparency. But in practice they're actually doing the opposite, reducing the amount of transparency and the number of companies that need to disclose the tax that they pay to the Australian government. We all know that this government's priority at the moment is an $80 billion tax break for the biggest companies throughout the country. They want to give a tax cut to some of the largest corporations in Australia—which include those big banks that have done such a wonderful job by the Australian people over the course of the last decade! As we're seeing in the royal commission, they've been such great backers of Australian small businesses, farmers, and families and have been so generous in their approach to their insurance arms, to their wealth management arms and to disclosure and transparency! Yet this government wants to give those sorts of organisations and the people who run those organisations, and their shareholders, a tax cut. Well, Labor simply won't stand for it. We've had enough of these organisations ripping off the Australian people, being deceitful, being dishonest—sending farmers, small businesses and families to the wall—and getting a tax cut. It's not on, and we're going to stand up for those hardworking small businesspeople, the farmers, Australian workers and their families, and oppose this government's dastardly attempts to give those organisations a tax cut. 


Australia is also missing out on billions in tax revenue thanks to loopholes that the Turnbull government refuses to act on, despite Labor's tax transparency laws showing just how much the people of Australia are losing. The introduction of key public reporting of country-by-country reports, as suggested by Labor—in particular in the resources and extractive industries such as mining, oil and gas—could help stem the flow of missing tax revenue.


Labor's also leading the way in ensuring that large Australian resources companies are good corporate citizens and maintain accountability and transparency through systems that not only ensure they pay their fair share of tax but help combat corruption, particularly in countries where they're operating offshore mining and resources projects, many of them in our backyard in the Pacific. Our policy will require large extractive companies to disclose payments arising from any activity involving exploration, prospecting, discovery, development and extraction. Disclosure under the regime will be on a country-by-country and project-by-project basis. Payments to be disclosed include taxes on income; production and profits of companies; royalties; dividends; signature discovery and production bonuses; fees, including licence fees, rental fees and entry fees; other payments, licences and concessions; payments for infrastructure improvements; and production entitlements such as profit resources. Payments must be disclosed if they are made to any national, regional or local authority of the country, including a department, agency or state-owned enterprise. 


Disclosure under this regime should apply to large extractive companies in Australia. A large company shall be defined as a company that meets at least two of the following criteria: it has a balance sheet total that exceeds $50 million, its net turnover on the balance sheet date exceeds $100 million or the average number of employees during the financial year to which the balance sheet relates exceeds 250. A single or series of related payments within a financial year must be disclosed if the payments amount to at least $150,000. A mandatory reporting regime for extractive industries will increase the availability of verifiable, disaggregated information from company financial reports regarding payments made to governments, and this information would build public accountability and trust in companies and governments. 


A Shorten Labor government, if we're elected, will also establish a multistakeholder committee to work with the government on the implementation of the reporting regime, including defining project-level reporting and the establishment of an online reporting mechanism to ensure public transparency and accessibility. The legislation would include equivalency provisions so that companies captured by other jurisdictions due to cross-listing on stock exchanges would only be required to lodge one report. If we're elected, the extractive industries transparency regime will require subjected companies to begin reporting payments in 2020. 


In line with consultation from interested stakeholders, this policy mirrors as closely as possible the UK scheme and the equivalent provisions contained therein. Our policy, if we are elected, will ensure that extractive companies are among the most transparent and accountable in the world. Our companies will be adopting best practice when it comes to ensuring that they're disclosing payments to government and they're transparent, accountable and combatting corruption in the countries in which they operate. Improved transparency and accountability in extractive industries is an effective mechanism to combat corruption in developing and developed countries. 


Again, it's clear that the Turnbull government doesn't want to close some of the corporate tax loopholes that exist. Some of those relate to tax havens that are part of the OECD and the G20's base erosion and profit shifting agenda. That's evident in the fact that they're not signing up to that article contained in that plan. Despite soaring corporate profits and the fact that Australia's company tax rate places us in the middle of the G20 pack, the only policy that they have is one for a big business tax cut, not further transparency, and that's simply not good enough.


That's why Labor is proposing to look at those additional two articles that the government hasn't signed up to, and that's why we're proposing and promising that if we're elected we'll go further, with additional transparency and accountability, particularly in the resources and extractive industries, on a country-by-country and project-by-project basis. I urge all members to support the very sensible amendment that has been moved by the member for Fenner.

"O'Dwyer, Kelly, MP",LP,2018-08-14,"



Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins—Minister for Revenue and Financial Services, Minister for Women and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (18:05):  I listened carefully to the speech of the member for Kingsford Smith on the Treasury Laws Amendment (OECD Multilateral Instrument) Bill 2018, and I was a little disappointed to find that it was devoid of so many facts. So, I appreciate the opportunity to now set the record straight when it comes to the government's commitment to tackling multinational anti-avoidance of tax. If a multinational corporation makes money in Australia, it is right they pay tax in Australia. The Turnbull government has introduced new laws to close loopholes, to ensure that profits are taxed here. The Turnbull government is absolutely determined to make sure that everyone is paying the right amount of tax, and large multinationals must pay their share. Deliberate tax avoidance will not be tolerated, and tax cheats will be tracked down and will face the full force of the law.


Whilst the Turnbull government have taken strong action and introduced tough new laws, Labor, by contrast, when they were in government, did virtually nothing to combat tax avoiders, and in opposition they opposed our Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law and the introduction of the country-by-country reporting regime. Paying tax is not optional. The Turnbull government will ensure that multinational companies pay the tax that they owe in Australia. As a result of our new laws, more money will be invested here, benefitting our community and helping guarantee the essential services and infrastructure that Australians rely on.


Given the fact-free contribution by the member for Kingsford Smith, I'd like to place on record that, since the government established the Tax Avoidance Taskforce, the Australian Taxation Office has raised around $7 billion in income tax liabilities against large public groups and multinationals. The Australian Taxation Office has collected $4.1 billion in cash, with $3.1 billion of that amount from multinational enterprises. Of that $3.1 billion, the Australian Taxation Office has collected over $1 billion from ecommerce companies. The government's coordinated plan to tackle profit shifting and avoidance of Australian tax law will keep paying dividends as well. The Australian Taxation Office confirms that the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law alone has seen additional sales income of $7 billion each year now being returned in Australia. Furthermore, hundreds of millions of dollars of additional GST revenue is now being paid. The Australian Taxation Office has publicly indicated that there is a significant change in how multinational companies are approaching their Australian tax obligations as a result of the tough new anti-avoidance laws put in place by this government and not supported by those opposite. In fact, Australia is leading the way in combatting multinational tax avoidance—no thanks to those who are not trying to find solutions to the problems that we have identified and tackled.


I would, though, like to thank those who have made a contribution to this debate. This bill will help Australia to quickly and efficiently modify the majority of Australia's bilateral tax treaties to bring them into line with international best practice when it comes to tackling multinational tax avoidance. It will complement the other measures implemented by the government to enhance tax system integrity, including the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law, country-by-country reporting and the diverted profits tax. The multilateral instrument is a unique tool that is expected to update more than 1,100 bilateral tax treaties worldwide. At present, based on the known positions of other jurisdictions, the multilateral instrument will modify 31 of Australia's 44 existing bilateral treaties. Modifying these treaties through the multilateral instrument will save time and expense, significantly, for Australia, compared to the alternative of bilaterally renegotiating each treaty to achieve similar outcomes.


The multilateral instrument will ensure that multinational entities are no longer able to exploit Australia's bilateral tax treaties in order to avoid paying tax. Additionally, the multilateral instrument will provide greater certainty for taxpayers by strengthening current tax treaty related dispute resolution procedures. Australia has committed to working closely with its treaty partners to resolve treaty related tax disputes through the multilateral instrument. Where both treaty partners agree, taxpayers will also have access to independent and binding arbitration, thereby allowing disputes to be resolved more quickly.


Looking to the future, the government will continue to work with the G20 and the OECD bilaterally to ensure that the international tax system operates as efficiently, fairly and effectively as possible. The multilateral instrument clearly demonstrates the benefits of international cooperation, and the government encourages other jurisdictions to adopt it to the fullest extent possible. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr BURKE
 (Watson) (19:30):  'Do I give them what they want?' That's the question you always ask yourself when you hear an appalling speech. They want to incite a debate, and when you hit back, the debate is exactly what they hoped for. But there has to be a point when this parliament says enough. If we haven't reached that point tonight then for some of us there is apparently no limit at all. In the other place Senator Anning has just delivered his first speech and, in delivering the sort of bile that we get from time to time against Muslim Australians, decided to invoke the term 'final solution'—another speech belittling Australians, dividing the nation and inciting debate. To those who thought that the best thing may not be to give them what they want, I say, 'If we continue to hold back, they have exactly what they wanted.' Muslim Australians, African Australians, Chinese Australians and, when you invoke the 'final solution', Jewish Australians are now, in the same way as Greek Australians and Italian Australians were in years gone by, subject to prejudice. The bigotry of today is no different to the bigotry of yesterday, and right now we don't have the bipartisanship against it that we had in years gone by—and it must return. The words spoken in the other place are not the words of a proud Australian; they are the words of people who hate modern Australia and hate who we are as Australians.


Overseas voices have been encouraged and welcomed into this country. Lauren Southern turned up in my local area with a camera crew from North America, looked around and said, 'It's all monoculture'—just like when the so-called 'person in charge of multicultural affairs' claimed that we have all these monocultural areas throughout Australia. The film crew and the journo who was there were good enough to ask, 'Which monoculture? Is it the Arabic culture represented by this shop or the Vietnamese culture represented by that shop? The Pakistani or the Pacific islander? Which monoculture are you talking about?' to which Lauren Southern said, 'There isn't even an English pub.' And they replied, 'Actually there's one immediately behind you.'


Our diversity is nothing to be afraid of, but the silence from those opposite is everything to fear, because when modern Australia is under attack in this way, the fight is going to be won only when we get to the point of bipartisanship again, and be in no doubt: we are not there right now. For anyone who was wondering whether we were, a lot changed at the last election, at which members of One Nation were returned to the parliament. At that time, instead of adopting the sort of language that John Howard had adopted, the government members started to refer to One Nation today as being more sophisticated than they used to be. Bigotry is not sophisticated.


In the Longman by-election the government allocated preferences to One Nation, rather than follow John Howard's lead in putting One Nation last. The 18C legislation, not referred to during the election campaign, was suddenly brought on in parliament to give extra licence for racist hate speech. The immigration minister stood right there and referred to Australians not as second- and third-generation Australians but as second- and third-generation Lebanese Muslims, and then described them as a mistake. The government introduced university-level English tests which you didn't have to take if you were emigrating from the five English-speaking nations that are predominantly white: Canada, the United States, Ireland, the UK or New Zealand. They didn't have to do the test; only people from non-white countries had to do it, even if they had grown up with English. In his book Weatherboard and Iron the member for New England constantly referred to the poor, white, regional fringe. Why is the white reference there all the time? I say to those opposite that it's not good enough to turn up to community fundraisers and events, say all the right things there and think people won't notice what's been happening in the parliament. Don't apologise for racism, don't imitate it and don't preference it.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (16:00):  Carers form the backbone of our disability community in Blair. They deserve recognition. The census data from 2016 reveals that the number of people who care for someone with a disability is 20 per cent higher in Blair than the Queensland state average. Carers need support, and that support is provided by the many organisations around Blair that provide disability services. One such organisation is the Endeavour Foundation, who recently opened a new flagship learning and lifestyle centre in East Street in the Ipswich CBD. The Endeavour Foundation team in Ipswich offers services to people with a disability who have left school and are transitioning to various forms of independence. The centre provides lessons in lifestyle skills. There is an in-house kitchen for teaching cooking and domestic skills. They also teach hygiene, budgeting, home maintenance and organisation skills. Participants are taught about safety and awareness in public, banking and using public transport. 


The centre offers people with a disability the opportunity to socialise in friendly surrounds, to make connections and to undertake activities they enjoy. Participants are encouraged to take care of their mental and physical wellbeing as well as that of their family and friends. The learning and lifestyle centre's focus is on choice, providing people living with a disability the opportunity to find the skills, hobbies and employment opportunities they enjoy. One of the most important features is the virtual reality technology that provides participants with an innovative and unique experience with everyday activities. Clients are taken through tasks, ranging from using public transport to operating a forklift in a simulator controlled VR environment. 


The Endeavour Foundation have had a long history of working in Ipswich since they opened Claremont. They purchased that historic home near the banks of the Bremer River in 1957. The Endeavour Foundation now provide support for more than 85 people across Ipswich, including learning and lifestyle services, one-on-one support, community access, in-home support, and respite.


In November this year I'll be hosting the Blair Disability Links expo in Ipswich and launching the 2019 Blair Disability Links directory. Together with the Blair Seniors Links directory, we have given out more than 100,000 of these directories to people across Ipswich and the surrounding region. This year, following the success of the Blair Disability Links and the Blair Seniors Links directories, we'll be launching the inaugural Blair Sports Links. Ipswich is a sporting community that has produced many champions in their respective sports, including Allan Langer and Leah Neale, who was recently at the Olympics. The directory will connect sporting people from juniors to seniors and everyone in between to a range of sporting clubs. I ask everyone, whether they are working in disability, senior or sporting organisations, to contact my office if they want to be involved in the directories.

Mr GOSLING
 (Solomon) (16:50):  I rise to speak in support of the report Northern horizons—unleashing our tourism potential. Before I go on to make some remarks about the report and its significance for my electorate and the Northern Territory, I just want to acknowledge the good work of the committee and particularly the member for Leichhardt, the chair, and my friend and colleague the member for Lingiari, Warren Snowdon, the deputy chair, for their important work on this report.


The importance of tourism to the Northern Territory is massive, with 1.5 million domestic visitors and around 300,000 international visitors in 2017. In the Northern Territory, about 15½ thousand Territorians are employed either directly or indirectly in tourism, amounting to a whopping 11 per cent of the NT's total workforce. The NT government believes that tourism can be a $2.2 billion contributor to the Territory's economy by 2020, given the right support. There is no shortage of potential in northern Australia's tourism industry, and there is plenty in the Northern Territory. If managed properly, and if the challenges addressed in the report are met, Territory attractions like Uluru, Kakadu and Litchfield national parks can lead to increased international and domestic visitation, as well as more tourists returning for repeat visits.


I recently ran a tourism ideas-fest on the NT and Darwin in my electorate, where people came along and pitched their tourism ideas—and there were certainly plenty of those. But it requires investment, and it requires commitment. It requires the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, for example, to start supporting tourism in the NT.


I'm proud that a Shorten Labor government will inject $1 billion of the NAIF's funds into a northern Australia tourism infrastructure fund to provide financing and concessional loans to build new tourism infrastructure in northern Australia. We know that there is great international and domestic demand for unique cultural experiences. Obviously, the Northern Territory provides the perfect opportunity to grow the developing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander tourism ventures, as do Northern Queensland and the Kimberley. This international interest in our unique cultural experiences was confirmed when I ran another event recently, a forum that looked at how we can leverage off the direct flights between Darwin and mainland China that have now begun with Donghai Airlines. We ran that event to capture the lessons learned from the first month of direct flights from Darwin to mainland China, and Chinese tourists' interest in those unique experiences was absolutely confirmed.


I note that the report made 33 well-thought-out recommendations, but I am yet to see much from the government in terms of leadership on them. Recommendation 1, for example, states that the Darwin City Deal should be progressed as a matter of urgency. The current government and the current cities minister are not showing much urgency. In fact, it has been 444 days since the MOU for a City Deal between the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory government, a City Deal for Darwin, was signed. Other jurisdictions have had their City Deal confirmed much more quickly than that. Having provided all the information that the Commonwealth needs to confirm the City Deal, we are at a loss to understand why, after 445 days, the Prime Minister is unable to get on a plane, fly past the south, get into the Territory and just sign the deal. There is a huge opportunity in Darwin for business events. So the business community in Darwin is joining the call for the Prime Minister to visit Darwin, sign the City Deal and show some sort of interest.


But we're not going to wait for the Prime Minister to grace us with his presence in Darwin; we are bringing Darwin and the Northern Territory's business community to Parliament House when we again run the Facing North evening on 19 September this year. The economic contribution that we are missing out on in, for example, business events has been estimated to be worth well over $70 million. But it could be worth much more if that City Deal was confirmed and we could get on with building some more infrastructure in our city.


I say to those listening that if you haven't visited the NT, and if you haven't got out to Kakadu, you are really missing out. As Daryl Somers once said, 'if you never never go you'll never never know'. It's as true today as it was back then. I extend an invitation to the nation to get up to the Territory and visit our iconic parks. But what I want to say to those opposite is that the cuts to Kakadu National Park have meant that, even though the brand of Kakadu is well known, it is starting to look tired. It requires some effort and some input and some priority from the federal government. I am pleased to say that during the winter recess the shadow minister for northern Australia and member for Blaxland, Jason Clare, visited the Top End not once but twice, including getting out to Jabiru and understanding a bit more about what we need to polish the jewel in the Northern Territory's tourism crown that is Kakadu. Unfortunately we can't wait until we win the lottery—like the Great Barrier Reef Foundation! We are just asking for some funding for Kakadu. It needs some federal investment. We need the cuts to national park funding to cease. We need some investment but, unfortunately, we have seen nothing so far.


Another point of feedback that I have received from the consultations I have been doing with the tourism industry in the Top End and from the surveys coming back from the Chinese tourists on the direct flights with Donghai is that they are very interested in Australia and the Top End's World War II military history. Our military heritage is of increasing importance to the Darwin economy as a new generation of Australians take a keen interest in the defence of Australia in the two world wars. In particular, they want to visit Australia's Pearl Harbor—which, of course, is our city, Darwin, the capital of the north. The bombing was across the breadth of northern Australia. We are working on developing more tourism opportunities so that Australians can come on that pilgrimage to the north and understand our World War II history and see the resilience of a people in the Top End that rebuilt Darwin not just once but twice—after the Japanese bombings and after Cyclone Tracy.


Members would have heard me speak in the past about the Rushcutter. I am happy to be able to report to the House that we succeeded in getting the Rushcutter, the World War II patrol boat, off the beach in Darwin Harbour and into a cradle. It is now out of the water and supported in a cradle. We will soon begin the restoration of that incredible piece of our maritime and military history. Again, I commend the committee and, in particular, the member for Lingiari for the work on this report, and I commend it to the House.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2018-08-14,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (17:00):  I rise to make a contribution to the report Northern horizons—unleashing our tourism potential, and I do so as the shadow minister for tourism. In his book Island Home, Tim Winton said this about Australia:


It's good for the spirit, to be reminded as an individual or a community that there will always be something bigger, older, richer and more complex than ourselves to consider.


Northern Australia is home to vast and divergent landscapes, from the rainforests of the Daintree to the rocky outcrops of Kakadu and the brilliant white beaches of Broome. But we are also home to the oldest living culture in the world, our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, who have passed down their stories and practices through each generation. We are indeed privileged to be part of that culture. Northern Australia has so much to offer, both to its residents and to people from other parts of Australia, such as myself from Sydney, but also to international visitors. It is a very special place.


The federal government has a responsibility to work with state and local governments, as well as businesses and communities, to unlock the tourism potential of northern Australia. We know that tourism is a super growth sector. It employs one million Australians and generates more than $97 billion in economic activity a year. The Great Barrier Reef alone supports nearly 60,000 jobs in Australia. In the year ending March 2018, Australia received 8.3 million international visitors, up eight per cent, with a visitor spend of $42.3 billion. But this increase is, of course, not evenly shared around the nation. We need to ensure that cities, towns and smaller communities across northern Australia benefit from any policy actions the federal government takes as a consequence of this report. The fact is that, at the moment, the approach of the government is one that sometimes just undermines tourism opportunities in northern Australia.


Just this week, I was contacted by the Cairns based tourism operator Coral Expeditions. It's a cruise company whose vessels are crewed by Australians. They currently employ 150 seafarers, contribute to the development of skills and employment in the Australian maritime industry in northern Australia and deliver economic and community benefits. For 34 years this proud Australian business has managed to remain viable and is now planning to invest some $100 million over the next three years to acquire two additional vessels. To operate those vessels, they intend to recruit an additional 70 Australian seafarers—more local jobs. Their most popular cruises are to the waters around the Kimberley, Arnhem Land and the Cape York regions. They also offer expeditions along the length of the Great Barrier Reef. However, if the bill that is now being discussed before this House were to become law, it would jeopardise not only Coral Expedition's expansion plans and the jobs that it would create but, more significantly, the very existence of Australian based companies like themselves. In the words of the company's group general manager, Mark Fifield, and its commercial director, Jeff Gillies, this piece of legislation will have the unintended consequence of killing off the growing and globally respected Australian flagged expedition cruise ship industry. This will have a significant negative impact on sustainable tourism and the environment in remote and sensitive coastal areas in Australia and on the revival of Australian seafaring. The letter concludes with this simple request: 'We urge that the current restrictions on coastal trading for foreign flagged passenger ships be maintained in order to facilitate the steady and sustainable development of coastal tourism and the Australian seafaring industry.'


Of course, that echoes the calls from True North Adventure Cruises, based in north-west Western Australia. Bill Melby came and gave evidence in 2015 during the debate that occurred about the government's coastal trading legislation—the last time it was defeated. He warned the government that those changes would put him out of business. The government advised Mr Melby to sack his crew, reflag overseas and hire a foreign crew! This is the approach towards jobs in northern Australia of those opposite, particularly in the tourism sector. And this is high-value tourism. This is an industry that we should be cherishing, and yet it's dismissed by the government.


I'm also concerned about the recommendations in this report to remove cabotage when it comes to the aviation sector: recommendations 9 and 30. This would allow foreign airlines to fly domestic routes in northern Australia, having, of course, foreign crews being paid foreign wages, just like the government's approach towards the shipping sector. Such a policy would have in the very short-term a devastating impact on the tourism sector and on access, particularly in the smaller regional towns around northern Australia. What we have at the moment are the airlines, such as Qantas and Virgin, and other smaller airlines, like Airnorth, saying very clearly that what we would have is cherrypicking from overseas airlines in order to remove some of the cross-subsidisation that occurs on some of the smaller routes that fly around northern Australia. We certainly wouldn't have any commercial flights into places in Far North Queensland like Weipa and Normanton, or Mount Isa and Cloncurry for that matter. They would simply disappear, let alone Nhulunbuy in the Northern Territory or Kununurra in Western Australia. All of these destinations would be under pressure.


This is ideology before reality. We know that Australia already has the most liberal aviation regime in the world. The fact is that as part of our aviation white paper foreign airlines can gain greater access to the capital cities, to the primary international airports—Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and Perth—if they're prepared to fly through those secondary international airports, be they Darwin, Cairns, Broome or Townsville. Then those opportunities are available.


I think the fact is that we also need to support Indigenous tourism. I sat down in Western Australia recently for a round table, and WAITOC, the Western Australia Indigenous Tourism Operators Council, is a great example of Indigenous communities coming together and promoting experiences, particularly in remote areas, where people's lives could be enriched, literally, by having that experience. At the same time that is creating jobs for people in those regional communities, particularly Indigenous Australians.


Similarly, the opportunities that are there in the Northern Territory and in Far North Queensland are indeed substantial. We do need to look at the particular needs, as the previous speaker, the member for Solomon, said about Kakadu. I know that the member for Lingiari is a passionate supporter of Kakadu National Park and the opportunities that need to be taken at the time when we have withdrawal of mining around Jabiru. That is an opportunity; it's a challenge, but done right it can create economic opportunity for those communities. Indeed, that iconic site of Kakadu National Park is so important—that people are able to experience that wonderful part of Australia.


There is much more that we can do, but I say to the parliament that Labor is prepared to work with the government and, importantly, with communities to maximise employment outcomes.

"O'Toole, Cathy, MP",ALP,2018-08-14,"



Ms O'TOOLE
 (Herbert) (17:23):  As a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Northern Australia I had the privilege to travel across northern Australia, including the territories of Cocos (Keeling) and Christmas islands, to experience firsthand the challenges that communities are facing in developing tourism and employment opportunities for our First Nations people and local residents. Our committee talked with and listened to a wide range of community members, including First Nations people, business owners and industry and community groups, in order to deliver the final report—Northern horizons: unleashing our tourism potential.


Very quickly it became very obvious to me that, regardless of the location, the issues across northern Australia were very similar. Further growth in development is dependent upon investment in vital infrastructure that will encourage and deliver growth opportunities for all. It is no exaggeration to say that northern Australia has a significant role to play in the further development of our growth in and connection with the Asia-Pacific region. This is not only in the area of tourism. Our community-based services and agricultural, health, education and tourism industries all create opportunities for imports and exports, which in turn make a significant contribution to the nation's economy. Developing northern Australia across a diverse range of industries and sectors will also create numerous secure, quality and well-paid jobs for local communities, including apprenticeships and traineeships for our young people, including our First Nations youth. It will also open up a diverse range of business opportunities for First Nations people and other community members.


At Nitmiluk—which is the traditional owners', the Jawoyn people's, name for Katherine Gorge—I saw firsthand an inspirational collaboration between the Territory government, national parks and the Jawoyn people in a professional and diverse tourism operation that is creating local jobs for First Nations people and other community members. The challenges and barriers to developing tourism in northern Australia are clearly evident. But in my view they are not unsurmountable, which is evident in the Northern horizons: unleashing our tourism potential report. As a North Queenslander, I take an enormous amount of pride in northern Australia and its enormous potential. But I also acknowledge that success, and a fair go for all, in northern Australia will require a collaborative approach across the jurisdictions of Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia. We will be much more successful if we leverage off each other rather than compete with each other.


The report on the inquiry into opportunities and methods of stimulating the tourism industry in northern Australia demonstrates the clear need for the government to prioritise policy development and expenditure in the north, as clearly identified in the 33 recommendations. The single most significant issue that I noted at every hearing that I attended, regardless of the location, was access to timely, reliable and affordable flights. The release of this report is quite timely for North Queensland as this week a delegation of 90 political, business and community leaders from the north have arrived in Canberra to showcase our wonderful part of the country. They are here to have their voices heard and to network with the nation's politicians to discuss the priorities that we believe we need to move forward in our region.


Mayors from Townsville, Charters Towers, Hinchinbrook, Palm Island and the Burdekin are joining representatives from a range of business sectors, including the tourism sector, to discuss infrastructure projects that are vital for the north to grow and thrive into the future. The Townsville Enterprise Ltd Northern Queensland delegation has prepared a thoughtful list of priorities that have been agreed to across the northern region. Many of the identified priorities on the list will not be a surprise to the Turnbull government. It will be no surprise to the Turnbull government that the list of priorities for Townsville includes the following infrastructure projects. It includes $75 million for the Townsville port expansion and a long-term water security solution. We need the government to match Labor's commitment of $100 million for stage 2 of the Burdekin pipeline. On energy infrastructure, we also need the Turnbull government to match Labor's commitment of $200 million to develop hydro energy on the Burdekin Falls Dam.


Federal Labor understands that Townsville is the largest city in northern Australia, with a capacity and willingness to play a central role in the development of northern Australia. But we need real funding and vital infrastructure, not only in my community but across northern Australia. Infrastructure such as I have mentioned will boost Townsville's economy, increase business confidence and expand our connections in the Asia-Pacific, all of which will create secure local jobs.


To date, the Turnbull government has refused to invest one single cent into the infrastructure projects I have mentioned, which is simply unacceptable. The Northern horizons: unleashing our tourism potential report is now a catalyst for the Turnbull government to get behind the development of northern Australia and start allocating infrastructure funds to the northern Australia regions. The future of our region and northern Australia must not be used as a political football, because developing the northern part of this country is far too important. Northern Australia needs real investment—and we need it now, not just at election time.


The tourism industry already makes a significant contribution to employment and the economy in the north. In 2014-15, over 17 million tourists visited Australia and spent over $9.9 billion. However, northern Australia only attracts a small portion of overall visits to Australia. In 2013-14, approximately 9.3 per cent of international overnight stays and 12.7 percent of domestic overnight stays were in northern Australia. This only suggests that there are opportunities to expand the tourism industry to support increased visitation and expenditure across the north.


In order to stimulate tourism growth in northern Australia the committee identified a need to increase visitor awareness of northern Australia tourism destinations; to improve access to the north and between major tourism attractions; and to support the tourism industry to develop products, experiences and attractions on the ground that tourists will want to take the time to visit and, more importantly, to come back to again. The committee has made 33 recommendations, as I said, which focus on marketing, coordination, upgrading transport and telecommunications infrastructure, streamlining regulatory processes for tourism businesses, and enhancing and planning the coordination of tourism destinations and attractions across the north. I'm proud to say that Labor has committed $1 billion from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility to the Northern Australia Tourism Infrastructure Fund to ensure that we have the much-needed investment to grow tourism in northern Australia.


I was born, raised, educated and married in Townsville. It is where my husband and I have raised our children. I have called Townsville home my entire life, apart from 3.5 years when I moved overseas and south for further studies. Many years ago Townsville was a tourism hub. We were the Mecca for tourists to visit, stay and play. However, due to lack of investment and vision, Townsville's tourism goldmine has been relocated to our neighbour's regions around Cairns. There is an untapped potential for Townsville's tourism market. We have the Great Barrier Reef on our front doorstep. Magnetic Island, one of Australia's top 15 islands, is located only minutes away. We have the cultural history—a significant cultural history—of our First Nations people on Palm Island, and we have the numerous garrison sites around our town. Why would you not invest in growing and expanding tourism in Townsville?


The Townsville port expansion project is a no-brainer project and is absolutely essential for our tourism industry to grow. At present, Townsville can only dock cruise ships carrying 1,500 people. If the port widening project went ahead our city would be able to accept larger ships carrying over 3,000 passengers. This would only further benefit our tourism industry, not to mention increasing income for our accommodation and hospitality businesses. Cruise tourism is the world's fastest growing tourism sector, which is why Townsville must play a role and have our port expanded. To do this we need the Turnbull government to match Labor's commitment of $75 million to the port expansion project.


In conclusion, I would like to say that I hope that the government takes seriously the report Northern Horizons—unleashing our tourism potential that has just been produced, because this will give northern Australia the infrastructure that is vital to the growth and further development of our regions.


Debate adjourned.

"Gosling, Luke, MP",ALP,2018-08-14,"



Mr GOSLING
 (Solomon) (16:50):  I rise to speak in support of the report Northern horizons—unleashing our tourism potential. Before I go on to make some remarks about the report and its significance for my electorate and the Northern Territory, I just want to acknowledge the good work of the committee and particularly the member for Leichhardt, the chair, and my friend and colleague the member for Lingiari, Warren Snowdon, the deputy chair, for their important work on this report.


The importance of tourism to the Northern Territory is massive, with 1.5 million domestic visitors and around 300,000 international visitors in 2017. In the Northern Territory, about 15½ thousand Territorians are employed either directly or indirectly in tourism, amounting to a whopping 11 per cent of the NT's total workforce. The NT government believes that tourism can be a $2.2 billion contributor to the Territory's economy by 2020, given the right support. There is no shortage of potential in northern Australia's tourism industry, and there is plenty in the Northern Territory. If managed properly, and if the challenges addressed in the report are met, Territory attractions like Uluru, Kakadu and Litchfield national parks can lead to increased international and domestic visitation, as well as more tourists returning for repeat visits.


I recently ran a tourism ideas-fest on the NT and Darwin in my electorate, where people came along and pitched their tourism ideas—and there were certainly plenty of those. But it requires investment, and it requires commitment. It requires the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, for example, to start supporting tourism in the NT.


I'm proud that a Shorten Labor government will inject $1 billion of the NAIF's funds into a northern Australia tourism infrastructure fund to provide financing and concessional loans to build new tourism infrastructure in northern Australia. We know that there is great international and domestic demand for unique cultural experiences. Obviously, the Northern Territory provides the perfect opportunity to grow the developing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander tourism ventures, as do Northern Queensland and the Kimberley. This international interest in our unique cultural experiences was confirmed when I ran another event recently, a forum that looked at how we can leverage off the direct flights between Darwin and mainland China that have now begun with Donghai Airlines. We ran that event to capture the lessons learned from the first month of direct flights from Darwin to mainland China, and Chinese tourists' interest in those unique experiences was absolutely confirmed.


I note that the report made 33 well-thought-out recommendations, but I am yet to see much from the government in terms of leadership on them. Recommendation 1, for example, states that the Darwin City Deal should be progressed as a matter of urgency. The current government and the current cities minister are not showing much urgency. In fact, it has been 444 days since the MOU for a City Deal between the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory government, a City Deal for Darwin, was signed. Other jurisdictions have had their City Deal confirmed much more quickly than that. Having provided all the information that the Commonwealth needs to confirm the City Deal, we are at a loss to understand why, after 445 days, the Prime Minister is unable to get on a plane, fly past the south, get into the Territory and just sign the deal. There is a huge opportunity in Darwin for business events. So the business community in Darwin is joining the call for the Prime Minister to visit Darwin, sign the City Deal and show some sort of interest.


But we're not going to wait for the Prime Minister to grace us with his presence in Darwin; we are bringing Darwin and the Northern Territory's business community to Parliament House when we again run the Facing North evening on 19 September this year. The economic contribution that we are missing out on in, for example, business events has been estimated to be worth well over $70 million. But it could be worth much more if that City Deal was confirmed and we could get on with building some more infrastructure in our city.


I say to those listening that if you haven't visited the NT, and if you haven't got out to Kakadu, you are really missing out. As Daryl Somers once said, 'if you never never go you'll never never know'. It's as true today as it was back then. I extend an invitation to the nation to get up to the Territory and visit our iconic parks. But what I want to say to those opposite is that the cuts to Kakadu National Park have meant that, even though the brand of Kakadu is well known, it is starting to look tired. It requires some effort and some input and some priority from the federal government. I am pleased to say that during the winter recess the shadow minister for northern Australia and member for Blaxland, Jason Clare, visited the Top End not once but twice, including getting out to Jabiru and understanding a bit more about what we need to polish the jewel in the Northern Territory's tourism crown that is Kakadu. Unfortunately we can't wait until we win the lottery—like the Great Barrier Reef Foundation! We are just asking for some funding for Kakadu. It needs some federal investment. We need the cuts to national park funding to cease. We need some investment but, unfortunately, we have seen nothing so far.


Another point of feedback that I have received from the consultations I have been doing with the tourism industry in the Top End and from the surveys coming back from the Chinese tourists on the direct flights with Donghai is that they are very interested in Australia and the Top End's World War II military history. Our military heritage is of increasing importance to the Darwin economy as a new generation of Australians take a keen interest in the defence of Australia in the two world wars. In particular, they want to visit Australia's Pearl Harbor—which, of course, is our city, Darwin, the capital of the north. The bombing was across the breadth of northern Australia. We are working on developing more tourism opportunities so that Australians can come on that pilgrimage to the north and understand our World War II history and see the resilience of a people in the Top End that rebuilt Darwin not just once but twice—after the Japanese bombings and after Cyclone Tracy.


Members would have heard me speak in the past about the Rushcutter. I am happy to be able to report to the House that we succeeded in getting the Rushcutter, the World War II patrol boat, off the beach in Darwin Harbour and into a cradle. It is now out of the water and supported in a cradle. We will soon begin the restoration of that incredible piece of our maritime and military history. Again, I commend the committee and, in particular, the member for Lingiari for the work on this report, and I commend it to the House.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2018-08-14,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (17:00):  I rise to make a contribution to the report Northern horizons—unleashing our tourism potential, and I do so as the shadow minister for tourism. In his book Island Home, Tim Winton said this about Australia:


It's good for the spirit, to be reminded as an individual or a community that there will always be something bigger, older, richer and more complex than ourselves to consider.


Northern Australia is home to vast and divergent landscapes, from the rainforests of the Daintree to the rocky outcrops of Kakadu and the brilliant white beaches of Broome. But we are also home to the oldest living culture in the world, our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, who have passed down their stories and practices through each generation. We are indeed privileged to be part of that culture. Northern Australia has so much to offer, both to its residents and to people from other parts of Australia, such as myself from Sydney, but also to international visitors. It is a very special place.


The federal government has a responsibility to work with state and local governments, as well as businesses and communities, to unlock the tourism potential of northern Australia. We know that tourism is a super growth sector. It employs one million Australians and generates more than $97 billion in economic activity a year. The Great Barrier Reef alone supports nearly 60,000 jobs in Australia. In the year ending March 2018, Australia received 8.3 million international visitors, up eight per cent, with a visitor spend of $42.3 billion. But this increase is, of course, not evenly shared around the nation. We need to ensure that cities, towns and smaller communities across northern Australia benefit from any policy actions the federal government takes as a consequence of this report. The fact is that, at the moment, the approach of the government is one that sometimes just undermines tourism opportunities in northern Australia.


Just this week, I was contacted by the Cairns based tourism operator Coral Expeditions. It's a cruise company whose vessels are crewed by Australians. They currently employ 150 seafarers, contribute to the development of skills and employment in the Australian maritime industry in northern Australia and deliver economic and community benefits. For 34 years this proud Australian business has managed to remain viable and is now planning to invest some $100 million over the next three years to acquire two additional vessels. To operate those vessels, they intend to recruit an additional 70 Australian seafarers—more local jobs. Their most popular cruises are to the waters around the Kimberley, Arnhem Land and the Cape York regions. They also offer expeditions along the length of the Great Barrier Reef. However, if the bill that is now being discussed before this House were to become law, it would jeopardise not only Coral Expedition's expansion plans and the jobs that it would create but, more significantly, the very existence of Australian based companies like themselves. In the words of the company's group general manager, Mark Fifield, and its commercial director, Jeff Gillies, this piece of legislation will have the unintended consequence of killing off the growing and globally respected Australian flagged expedition cruise ship industry. This will have a significant negative impact on sustainable tourism and the environment in remote and sensitive coastal areas in Australia and on the revival of Australian seafaring. The letter concludes with this simple request: 'We urge that the current restrictions on coastal trading for foreign flagged passenger ships be maintained in order to facilitate the steady and sustainable development of coastal tourism and the Australian seafaring industry.'


Of course, that echoes the calls from True North Adventure Cruises, based in north-west Western Australia.

Ms O'TOOLE
 (Herbert) (17:23):  As a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Northern Australia I had the privilege to travel across northern Australia, including the territories of Cocos (Keeling) and Christmas islands, to experience firsthand the challenges that communities are facing in developing tourism and employment opportunities for our First Nations people and local residents. Our committee talked with and listened to a wide range of community members, including First Nations people, business owners and industry and community groups, in order to deliver the final report—Northern horizons: unleashing our tourism potential.


Very quickly it became very obvious to me that, regardless of the location, the issues across northern Australia were very similar. Further growth in development is dependent upon investment in vital infrastructure that will encourage and deliver growth opportunities for all. It is no exaggeration to say that northern Australia has a significant role to play in the further development of our growth in and connection with the Asia-Pacific region. This is not only in the area of tourism. Our community-based services and agricultural, health, education and tourism industries all create opportunities for imports and exports, which in turn make a significant contribution to the nation's economy. Developing northern Australia across a diverse range of industries and sectors will also create numerous secure, quality and well-paid jobs for local communities, including apprenticeships and traineeships for our young people, including our First Nations youth. It will also open up a diverse range of business opportunities for First Nations people and other community members.


At Nitmiluk—which is the traditional owners', the Jawoyn people's, name for Katherine Gorge—I saw firsthand an inspirational collaboration between the Territory government, national parks and the Jawoyn people in a professional and diverse tourism operation that is creating local jobs for First Nations people and other community members. The challenges and barriers to developing tourism in northern Australia are clearly evident. But in my view they are not unsurmountable, which is evident in the Northern horizons: unleashing our tourism potential report. As a North Queenslander, I take an enormous amount of pride in northern Australia and its enormous potential. But I also acknowledge that success, and a fair go for all, in northern Australia will require a collaborative approach across the jurisdictions of Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia. We will be much more successful if we leverage off each other rather than compete with each other.


The report on the inquiry into opportunities and methods of stimulating the tourism industry in northern Australia demonstrates the clear need for the government to prioritise policy development and expenditure in the north, as clearly identified in the 33 recommendations. The single most significant issue that I noted at every hearing that I attended, regardless of the location, was access to timely, reliable and affordable flights. The release of this report is quite timely for North Queensland as this week a delegation of 90 political, business and community leaders from the north have arrived in Canberra to showcase our wonderful part of the country. They are here to have their voices heard and to network with the nation's politicians to discuss the priorities that we believe we need to move forward in our region.


Mayors from Townsville, Charters Towers, Hinchinbrook, Palm Island and the Burdekin are joining representatives from a range of business sectors, including the tourism sector, to discuss infrastructure projects that are vital for the north to grow and thrive into the future. The Townsville Enterprise Ltd Northern Queensland delegation has prepared a thoughtful list of priorities that have been agreed to across the northern region. Many of the identified priorities on the list will not be a surprise to the Turnbull government. It will be no surprise to the Turnbull government that the list of priorities for Townsville includes the following infrastructure projects. It includes $75 million for the Townsville port expansion and a long-term water security solution. We need the government to match Labor's commitment of $100 million for stage 2 of the Burdekin pipeline. On energy infrastructure, we also need the Turnbull government to match Labor's commitment of $200 million to develop hydro energy on the Burdekin Falls Dam.


Federal Labor understands that Townsville is the largest city in northern Australia, with a capacity and willingness to play a central role in the development of northern Australia. But we need real funding and vital infrastructure, not only in my community but across northern Australia. Infrastructure such as I have mentioned will boost Townsville's economy, increase business confidence and expand our connections in the Asia-Pacific, all of which will create secure local jobs.


To date, the Turnbull government has refused to invest one single cent into the infrastructure projects I have mentioned, which is simply unacceptable. The Northern horizons: unleashing our tourism potential report is now a catalyst for the Turnbull government to get behind the development of northern Australia and start allocating infrastructure funds to the northern Australia regions. The future of our region and northern Australia must not be used as a political football, because developing the northern part of this country is far too important. Northern Australia needs real investment—and we need it now, not just at election time.


The tourism industry already makes a significant contribution to employment and the economy in the north. In 2014-15, over 17 million tourists visited Australia and spent over $9.9 billion. However, northern Australia only attracts a small portion of overall visits to Australia. In 2013-14, approximately 9.3 per cent of international overnight stays and 12.7 percent of domestic overnight stays were in northern Australia. This only suggests that there are opportunities to expand the tourism industry to support increased visitation and expenditure across the north.


In order to stimulate tourism growth in northern Australia the committee identified a need to increase visitor awareness of northern Australia tourism destinations; to improve access to the north and between major tourism attractions; and to support the tourism industry to develop products, experiences and attractions on the ground that tourists will want to take the time to visit and, more importantly, to come back to again. The committee has made 33 recommendations, as I said, which focus on marketing, coordination, upgrading transport and telecommunications infrastructure, streamlining regulatory processes for tourism businesses, and enhancing and planning the coordination of tourism destinations and attractions across the north. I'm proud to say that Labor has committed $1 billion from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility to the Northern Australia Tourism Infrastructure Fund to ensure that we have the much-needed investment to grow tourism in northern Australia.


I was born, raised, educated and married in Townsville. It is where my husband and I have raised our children. I have called Townsville home my entire life, apart from 3.5 years when I moved overseas and south for further studies. Many years ago Townsville was a tourism hub. We were the Mecca for tourists to visit, stay and play. However, due to lack of investment and vision, Townsville's tourism goldmine has been relocated to our neighbour's regions around Cairns. There is an untapped potential for Townsville's tourism market. We have the Great Barrier Reef on our front doorstep. Magnetic Island, one of Australia's top 15 islands, is located only minutes away. We have the cultural history—a significant cultural history—of our First Nations people on Palm Island, and we have the numerous garrison sites around our town. Why would you not invest in growing and expanding tourism in Townsville?


The Townsville port expansion project is a no-brainer project and is absolutely essential for our tourism industry to grow. At present, Townsville can only dock cruise ships carrying 1,500 people. If the port widening project went ahead our city would be able to accept larger ships carrying over 3,000 passengers. This would only further benefit our tourism industry, not to mention increasing income for our accommodation and hospitality businesses. Cruise tourism is the world's fastest growing tourism sector, which is why Townsville must play a role and have our port expanded. To do this we need the Turnbull government to match Labor's commitment of $75 million to the port expansion project.


In conclusion, I would like to say that I hope that the government takes seriously the report Northern Horizons—unleashing our tourism potential that has just been produced, because this will give northern Australia the infrastructure that is vital to the growth and further development of our regions.

Ms LAMB
 (Longman) (18:11):  I've made it pretty clear where I stand when it comes to healthcare services and funding. I've made it pretty clear that I want the very best for our community. I've made it pretty clear that I want to make sure that each and every person in my community has access to the health care that they need and they deserve. We need a healthcare system that is affordable. We need a system that is accessible, that continually grows and evolves and that properly services what is really a changing community where I live.


The bad news is that, under this government, we've seen nothing but cuts and missteps. The people in Caboolture, Narangba, Woodford and Bribie Island deserve much better than this. They deserve a government that listens to what their needs are, a government that cares, a government that prioritises the health and wellbeing of the people it is meant to represent. But this government doesn't listen. This government doesn't care. If it did, it would have heard what the people of Longman resoundingly called for during the recent by-election campaign. It would have heard the people in Kallangur, Burpengary, Morayfield and Bellmere calling for a stop to cuts to health care. It would have heard just how furious the people of Longman were that the government is ripping $2.9 million of vital funding from our Caboolture Hospital.


Instead, though, we've got a Prime Minister covering his ears and denying any wrongdoing at all. Well, the message to the Prime Minister and his government is very clear. The people of Longman have spoken. They are sick of being sick. I've heard from doctors, nurses, patients and affected family members, and each of them has told me that they are tired of the government cuts. It's completely arrogant to ignore people like this. It's completely out of touch to tell people that they are wrong. This is the difference: the government cuts, but Labor invests and builds up. Unlike this government, that doesn't want to listen, Labor has listened. We will reverse this government's cuts to the Caboolture Hospital. We will reverse the $2.9 million ripped out of our Caboolture Hospital. We will do what we can to properly provide top-quality health outcomes for the people of my community.


There's not a lot this government does to get it right on health, and if ever they finally end up on the right path you can always hold your breath, because it may get bundled. Take the government's My Health Record, for example. In theory, this should have been a game changer with the capacity to completely revolutionise healthcare delivery. To be very clear, Labor has always supported the electronic-health-record system. We have always supported that. I've spoken to a number of medical professionals about this matter in particular. With all of this government's endeavours, as we've seen, the My Health Record system, in its current state, is a far cry from the game changer that Australia had anticipated. Despite legislation initially underpinning My Health Record as an opt-in system, the government made the decision to instead shift to an opt-out model. Maybe through sheer arrogance, I don't know, the government was to incompetent to recognise that meant that privacy and security provisions would have to be strengthened by changing to this opt-out model. Although the government initially denied there were any issues, report after report has blatantly shown the opposite to be true.


It was only through immense pressure from Labor and the medical community that the government reluctantly agreed to a number of changes, but the government's steps do not go far enough. There's still more to be done. We in Labor have been calling on the government to suspend the My Health Record rollout until they have cleaned up the mess. As usual, the government hasn't listened and the mess is still here. That's why Labor announced today that we will lead a Senate inquiry into the today My Health Record fiasco. We have long supported an electronic-health-record system, but this system the government has introduced fails—it absolutely fails. 


We will be asking the crossbench to support a reference to the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee. This is the same committee that had previously inquired into the sale of Medicare numbers on the dark web, which was yet another government failure that put the security of Australia's medical data at risk. Knowing that their private information is secure is one of those things that Australians really like to have confidence in. What we saw with the Medicare numbers on the dark web was that people lost confidence in knowing that their personal information was secure. 


The inquiry that we're asking the crossbench to support will examine a range of concerns that relate to privacy and security, such as the adequacy of the system's login procedures and default settings. We intend that this inquiry will examine the government's decision to shift from that initial opt-in system to an opt-out system, and whether provisions were instated to properly prepare for this change. Australians want to have confidence in their personal information. Our health care and the health of our families and friends is very important, but just as important is the security of information when it comes to our medical history.


We have a lot of issues in Longman when it comes to health care. We've got the Medicare freeze on pathology and medical imaging, which is still in place. That is really hurting people in Longman. We've had $2.9 million ripped out of Caboolture Hospital. Caboolture Hospital sees around 55,000 presentations in the emergency department every single year, so it is a very, very busy hospital. I know that the electorate has many more health needs, which is why a Labor government will invest in a $10 million chemotherapy service at Caboolture Hospital, so people who live in places like Woodford or Bribie Island don't have to drive past their very own hospital to get access to a chemotherapy service.


The other investment that a Shorten Labor government will deliver is an urgent care clinic on Bribie Island. Anybody who has been to Bribie Island knows just what a magical and beautiful part of the world it is. However, Bribie Island is a good 30-minute drive from Caboolture Hospital, and it has an older population. At the time of need, when you need to see a doctor on a weekend or at night it is imperative that you have access to the health care you need. A $17 million urgent-care clinic right on Bribie Island to make sure that the people who live there have access to a healthcare service is very welcome and long overdue. It is very much needed.


I call upon this government to stop the cuts to health care. In the by-election people were very loud and very clear about their message to this government. They want their schools funded and they want their healthcare system, the services they need for their health care, funded. What they don't want is to see banks getting a handout from this government.
