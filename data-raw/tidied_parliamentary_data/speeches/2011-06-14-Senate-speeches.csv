ACTS INTERPRETATION AMENDMENT BILL 2011


This Bill amends the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 to improve its structure, language and application to modern technology.  


The Acts Interpretation Act is the statute most commonly referred to in the Commonwealth statute book.  It is a vital resource for judges, lawyers and parliamentarians to interpret Com­mon­wealth legislation.  This is the first time it has been comprehensively amended since its enactment in 1901.


Former High Court Chief Justice Gleeson aptly summarised the main purposes of this Act, as well as Interpretation Acts in general when he said:


For drafting convenience, they set out certain ground rules....[which] save unnecessary repetition and explanation.... Parliament enacts legislation upon an assumption that the meaning of what it says will be understood in accordance with those general rules.  Interpretation Acts [also] set out the working assumptions according to which legislation is framed by Parliament, and applied by the courts.1




What the Bill does 



The main purpose of this Bill is to re-structure the Acts Interpretation Act to make the important rules and definitions contained within it much easier to find.  For example, the Part 2 proposed in this Bill brings together the majority of definitions that are currently scattered throughout the Act.  Terms such as ‘document’, ‘Government printer’ and ‘Proclamation’ will now be collocated and listed in alphabetical order.


The Bill also updates the Act to bring it into the 21st century.  For example, it amends the provisions about meetings so that participants can be in different locations and can dial in using technology such as Skype and video-conferenc­ing.  This reflects the exponential advances in technology that have been achieved over the past 110 years.


Drafting practices have also evolved.  The Bill reflects this by clarifying that all material in an Act, from the first section to the last Schedule, is part of an Act.   This takes account of current practice of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel to include section headings and explanatory notes as part of Bills introduced into Parliament. Form­erly, these were added later by the Government Printer.


Including rules and definitions in the Acts Interpretation Act means they do not need to be repeated in other Commonwealth Acts.  This reduces the size of the Commonwealth statute book.  Most Commonwealth Acts contain ref­eren­ces to the Acts Interpretation Act so that readers are aware of and can easily find the definitions and rules that apply to the relevant provisions of legislation.  




Conclusion



This is consistent with the Government’s commitment to improving the accessibility of the civil justice system. Modernisation of one of the first Commonwealth Acts will help to reduce the complexity of legislation that has developed since federation.  


I would like to thank the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for the significant time and effort that went into preparing this Bill.  In addition to the substantial amount of drafting undertaken, a number of drafters were also involved in testing the workability of new definitions and rules to make sure they would operate as intended, by testing their application to Bills they had recently drafted.


I would also like to thank the individuals and organisations who made comments on the Bill when it was released as an exposure draft earlier this year.


Finally, I would like to mention the 1993 report of the House Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs – Clearer Common­wealth Law – which recommended that a public review of the Acts Interpretation Act be undertaken and led to the amendments that are included in this Bill.

AGED CARE AMENDMENT BILL 2011


The Australian Government has a strong commitment to caring for our older Australians.  In line with this commitment, the Gillard Government will spend around $10.9 billion on aged care in the 2010-11 financial year.  More­over, the Government is delivering on a range of significant aged care reforms to enhance the delivery of recipient-centred aged care services.


In tandem with these reforms, ensuring that appropriate safeguards are in place to adequately protect older Australians living in residential aged care, is of paramount importance to this Govern­ment. 


The Government takes this responsibility seriously and is committed to working with aged care residents, and industry to identify areas where improvements can be made.


In the 2010-11 Federal Budget, the Government announced it would increase protection for accommodation bonds and strengthen complaints management in aged care as part of its commitment to providing better health and better care for older Australians through the national health reform agenda. I am pleased to be delivering on these promises today by introducing the Aged Care Amendment Bill 2011.


Essentially, the amendments contained in the Bill increase protection for residents’ in two ways: First, it strengthens protections for accommodation bonds held by providers of residential and flexible aged care services and, second, it improves complaint management in aged care.


In addition, the Bill makes other minor amendments to remove redundant provisions relating to aged care which are no longer operational and can be misleading to aged care stakeholders. 


Protecting aged care residents’ savings 


Accommodation bonds were established to give approved providers a source of capital fund­ing for investment in residential aged care infrastructure.


Accommodation bonds are essentially an interest free loan from the aged care resident to an approved provider. The provider has the responsibility to repay the bond when the resident leaves the aged care service.  In the event that an approved provider goes into liquidation owing bond refunds, the Australian Government makes refunds through the Accommodation Bond Guarantee Scheme.


Since the introduction of the Aged Care Act in 1997, there has been strong growth in the value of accommodation bonds held by the aged care sector.  As at 30 June 2010: 


approved providers held more than $10.6 billion in bonds on behalf of more than 63,000 aged care residents;


the average total bond holding held by an individual approved provider was $11.2 million;  and


the average new accommodation bond charged during the financial year was around $232,000. 


The total value of accommodation bonds held by approved providers has more than doubled since 2004-05 – equating to an average increase of 20% per annum.


This is a significant amount of funds held by aged care providers on behalf of their residents.  And, as the Australian population continues to age and the demand for aged care increases, the funds loaned to approved providers through accommodation bonds will continue to grow.


Given the significant funds loaned by residents to their approved providers, it is important that this money is directed to residential and flexible aged care infrastructure and there are robust accountability mechanisms in place to underpin confidence in the safety of residents’ funds.


To date, the majority of approved providers have effectively met their obligation to refund bonds to their residents.  However, since the introduction of the Accommodation Bond Guar­antee Scheme in May 2006, it has been activated on five occasions with around 150 accom­modation bonds refunded at a cost of approximately $24.5 million.


This experience, together with that of the Department of Health and Ageing in undertaking prudential monitoring and compliance activity, has demonstrated that regulation of accom­modations bonds could be further enhanced.  In particular, there is a need to reinforce the role of bonds in financing capital investment in aged care.


This Bill provides greater clarity about the uses of accommodation bonds and strengthens the link to aged care.  Specifically, the Bill reinforces that bonds taken after 1 October 2011 should be used for capital expenditure at aged care services, repaying debt associated with capital works and refunding existing bonds.  The Bill also makes it clear that accommodation bonds can be used for financial investment.  For example, a number of approved providers invest bonds in term deposits prior to building a new facility.


Importantly, the reforms are structured to ensure that crucial investment in aged care infrastructure is maintained.  A broad approach is taken to capital expenditure and includes costs for activities directly associated with capital expenditure.  The design of the reforms also ensures that regulation does not unduly impact on effective corporate structuring and business arrangements. 


For many approved providers, the reforms are not expected to have a significant impact as they will already be using bonds for the permitted purposes.  However, a two-year transition period will be implemented to ensure that those approved providers that need to make changes have sufficient time to act to meet the new requirements.


Unfortunately, the risk that some entities may not act appropriately in dealing with accom­modation bonds cannot be completely removed by regulation.  Therefore, it is important to have strong incentives in place to discourage this type of behaviour.  Under the new arrange­ments, offences will apply when misuse has been identi­fied.  New criminal offences will apply where an approved provider has used bonds for a non-permitted purpose, is insolvent and unable to repay accommodation bonds when they fall due. 


In the very worst of cases, criminal offences will also apply to individuals within the organisa­tion. Individual offences will only apply in circumstances where (a) the approved provider has used bonds for a non-permitted purpose, is insolvent and unable to repay accommodation bonds and (b) where an individual was complicit in this. For example, where the individual was a key personnel of the approved provider (that is, in a senior position), knew the bonds were being used for a non-permitted use and were in a position to, but had not, taken reasonable steps to prevent the misuse.


The introduction of offence provisions for the misuse of bonds demonstrates the Government’s commitment to addressing the serious moral culpability of those who choose to misuse bonds which are essentially loans to approved providers by people in vulnerable positions.  Aged care residents need to be confident that their funds are being used for the intended purposes, that there is transparency about that use, and that there is sound regulation in place to monitor and protect their savings. 


As I have mentioned, the focus of the enhanced protection for accommodation bonds is to reduce the risk that approved providers are unable to make refunds to residents.  Given this emphasis, the Bill removes the current restrictions on the use of the income derived from bonds and accommodation charges.  Currently, these restric­tions are more significant than those related to the actual bond itself, but by removing the restrictions this will free up these funds for use by approved providers, reduce regulatory burden and ensure that regulation better targets the area of greater risk. 


To support all of the new arrangements, the Bill will also introduce information gathering powers in circumstances where, for example, concerns exist regarding the capacity of an approved provider to repay accommodation bonds.  This will improve the capacity of the Department of Health and Ageing to actively manage or monitor risks as they emerge. 




Improving the Handling of Aged Care Complaints 



The second key element of the Bill relates to the management and resolution of complaints about aged care services.


The Aged Care Complaints Investigation Scheme (the Scheme) provides a means through which concerns relating to the delivery of residential, community and flexible aged care services subsidised by the Government can be investigated. 


In July 2009, in response to industry and community concerns about the Scheme’s operation, an independent review to identify areas of improvement was completed.  A key outcome of that review was the recommendation to in­crease the consumer focus of the Scheme and strengthen the focus on resolution of complaints rather than investigation of complaints. 


While many of the review’s recommendations have already been implemented administratively, amendments proposed through this Bill will enable the implementation of the reforms to continue. 


To this end, the Bill proposes to enable the “Investigation Principles” to be replaced with new “Complaints Principles.” 


The proposed new Complaints Principles will describe the improved complaints scheme and will have a stronger focus on resolution of complaints. This will provide consumers with a more flexible scheme where a range of options are available for assisting to resolve a complaint, including: early resolution, conciliation and mediation. 




Other Amendments 



Other amendments contained in the Bill will make some minor, operational changes to remove redundant provisions relating to aged care, which have the potential to confuse the public.




Timing



Subject to the passage of the Bill through Parliament, it is proposed the reforms relating to bonds take effect from 1 October 2011.  A two year transition period will be in place until the end of October 2013 to allow the sector time to become familiar with the new requirements relating to the permitted uses for bonds.  This will assist to ensure a smooth transition. 




Changes relating to Complaints Principles take effect on 1 September 2011.



Minor amendments and removal of redundant provisions will take effect on Royal Assent.


These changes have been the subject of consultation with the aged care industry, banking and finance industry and consumer representative groups.  Their views have been instrumental in shap­ing these reforms.  To ensure smooth imple­mentation, the Government will continue to work collaboratively with key stakeholders, providers, care recipients and their families, and listen closely to their views.




Conclusion 



I am very pleased to introduce this Bill.  The amendments it contains ensure, as far as possible; that the financial interests of residents are protected, that effective regulatory safeguards are in place for accommodation bonds, and that a regulated source of capital funding is provided for investment in aged care infrastructure.


This Bill provides a regulatory framework that is commensurate to the risks associated with the strong growth of bond holdings in the aged care sector, which is currently over $10 billion.  It also provides for a shift in the way aged care com­plaints are dealt with, from one of investigation to one of resolution, facilitating pragmatic, resident-centred outcomes for all concerned parties. By doing so, this Bill will help promote public confidence in the aged care system.


 


CHILD SUPPORT (REGISTRATION AND COLLECTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2011


I am pleased to introduce the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Amendment Bill 2011. The Bill has two objectives. Firstly, the Bill proposes to allow the Child Support Registrar to delegate certain powers and functions to individuals outside the Department of Human Services. Secondly, the Bill amends several criminal penalty provisions to ensure the offences in those provisions can be prosecuted success­fully.


The Government believes it is vital that the children of separated parents receive the emotional and financial support they need. While most parents do the right thing and pay their child support in full and on time, not all parents meet their child support obligations.


The Child Support Program has identified that having the ability to outsource debt collection activity to external service providers on occasions should increase the successful collection of outstanding child support liabilities.


The first amendment in the Bill will enable the Child Support Registrar to delegate certain powers and functions to external service pro­viders. This approach is currently utilised by Centrelink for collection of outstanding liabilities.


This approach aims to improve the collection of child support by using the expertise of skilled external providers for specific collection activities. The outsourcing of collection activities is expected to lead to an increase in the successful identification and collection of outstanding child support debt.


Additionally, the outsourcing of collection activities allows Child Support Program staff to concentrate on other compliance activities and better serve other Child Support Customers.


The amendments to the delegation provisions under the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 are based on equivalent provisions under the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 and the Paid Parental Leave Act 2010. As the Department of Human Services moves towards an integrated model between its various agencies, these amendments will enable the Child Support Program to ensure consistency of service delivery options across agencies.


The second group of amendments are to certain criminal provisions under the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988. These provisions relate to the obligations of an employer when they are required to withhold money from an employee.


Employer withholding is a process whereby an employer withholds amounts from a paying parent’s wages or salary, only as required by the Child Support Program, to be paid to CSA in satisfaction of a child support liability.


The current offences relating to employer withholdings in the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 are somewhat ambiguous. The offence provisions create an obligation and provide a penalty, but do not specify whether the offence is created by an act or omission.


A literal reading of these provisions suggests that an employer could indeed be penalised for complying with the section. This makes it difficult for the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to prosecute an employer who is doing the wrong thing.  


The proposed amendments will make it clear that an offence is committed when an employer fails to take a certain action.


The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions has been consulted in the making of the proposed amendments.


These amendments will improve the prospect of successful prosecution under the Act. They make it clear that it is an offence when an employer fails to deduct or remit child support payments for the benefit of children. Improving the ability of the Child Support Program to successfully prosecute employers who fail to comply with requirements under the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 will also help protect the integrity of the Child Support Program, and, at the end of the day, better support the children of separated parents.


 


CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT (IMPROVING ACCOUNTABILITY ON DIRECTOR AND EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION) BILL 2011


Today, I introduce a Bill to strengthen the accountability and transparency of Australia’s executive remuneration framework and give shareholders more power over the pay of company directors and executives.


The Bill implements the Gillard Government’s response to the recommendations made by the Productivity Commission in its recent inquiry into Australia’s remuneration framework.


It is important that we have a system of remuneration that is not only internationally competitive, but that also appropriately rewards executives for their work and for the value that they bring to a company.


At the same time, directors should be accountable to shareholders for the level and composition of executive remuneration.


Shareholders are the owners of a company. They take on the risk of investing their capital and they share in a company’s profits and losses.


Shareholders, therefore, deserve more say over how the pay of company executives is set.


The Government has sought to encourage shareholder engagement through the transparent disclosure of the details surrounding remunera­tion. This ensures that shareholders have the information they need to convey their views through the non-binding shareholder vote, and to hold directors accountable for their remuneration decisions.


While Australia’s remuneration framework is relatively strong, the global financial crisis highlighted a number of issues relating to remunera­tion structures.


In particular, it illustrated the dangers of remuneration structures that focus on short-term results, reward excessive risk-taking and promote corporate greed.


In March 2009, the Government responded to these concerns by announcing reforms to curb excessive termination benefits or ‘golden handshake’ payments given to departing directors and executives. At the same time, the Govern­ment also announced that it would ask the Productivity Commission to undertake a broader review of Australia’s remuneration framework.


The Productivity Commission undertook a thorough and comprehensive inquiry. Over the nine-month review process, the Productivity Commission received a total of 170 submissions and conducted a series of roundtables and public hearings.


Overall, the Productivity Commission found that Australia’s corporate governance and remuneration framework is highly ranked internationally.


However, it also recommended a range of reforms to further strengthen Australia’s remuneration framework.


The Government, in its response to the inquiry, supported and further strengthened the majority of the recommendations. This Bill implements many of these recommendations, and will put in place measures that will empower shareholders to influence the remuneration decisions of their company.




The ‘two-strikes’ test



A key measure in the Bill is the ‘two-strikes’ test. This measure will subject the board of a company to greater accountability through the re-election process if it has not adequately respon­ded to shareholder concerns on remuneration issues over two consecutive years.


The Corporations Act currently requires listed companies to put their remuneration report to a non binding shareholder vote at the annual general meeting. While the introduction of the non-binding vote has seen a change in the way companies approach the compilation of their remuneration reports, shareholders currently have little recourse if boards choose to ignore strong ‘no’ votes.


The ‘two-strikes’ test gives shareholders more power to have their say.


Under this measure, the first strike is triggered where a company’s remuneration report receives a ‘no’ vote of 25 per cent or more. If this occurs, the company is required to explain in its subsequent remuneration report the action it has taken to address shareholders’ concerns. Alternatively, if those concerns have not been addressed, the company must outline the reasons why.


Some boards have already put in place processes to provide explanations of the issues surrounding remuneration to their shareholders, but it is not mandatory for them to do so. Formalising this practice for all listed companies will promote improved communication and engagement with shareholders.


If shareholders are still dissatisfied and the company receives another ‘no’ vote of 25 per cent or more at the following year’s annual general meeting, the second strike is triggered.


Once the second strike is triggered, shareholders are then given the opportunity to vote on a resolution to spill the board and subject the directors to re-election. If this spill resolution is passed by more than 50 per cent of eligible votes cast, then a spill meeting is to be held within 90 days, at which shareholders will be given the opportunity to vote on the re-election of the directors, one by one.


The Productivity Commission consulted extensively on this measure, particularly on the threshold level of a 25 per cent ‘no’ vote. The Productivity Commission concluded that a threshold of 25 per cent for each of the strikes was appropriate and is in line with the 75 per cent majority required for the passage of special resolutions.


A threshold of 25 per cent would better align with levels commonly accepted as demonstrating serious shareholder concern about remuneration, particularly in light of current voting patterns.


Whilst the threshold for each of the strikes will be set at 25 per cent, it should be noted that the threshold for the spill resolution will be set at 50 per cent.


This proposal targets the small number of boards that have not adequately addressed shareholder concerns over two consecutive years. The Government believes that it is appropriate that these boards be subject to this additional scrutiny and accountability.


This measure sends a clear signal that unresponsive directors will be held accountable for their decisions on executive remuneration.




Remuneration consultants



The Bill also contains measures to facilitate the independence of remuneration consultants.


The Productivity Commission inquiry con­cluded that the potential for conflicts of interest can arise where remuneration consultants report directly to the company executives and where they provide other services to the same company. Improved disclosure will help shareholders assess the independence of the advice that remuneration consultants provide to boards and their remuneration committees.


While the advice of remuneration consultants may be influential in determining a company’s remuneration decisions, it is important to recognise that the primary responsibility for remuneration arrangements rests with company directors.


The Bill contains measures to require boards or remuneration committees to approve the engagement of a remuneration consultant. The remuneration consultant will be required to declare that their recommendations are free from undue influence and must provide their advice to non-executive directors or the remuneration committee, rather than directly to company executives.


In addition, boards will be required to provide an independence declaration, stating whether, in their view, the remuneration consultant’s recommendations are free from undue influence, and the board’s reasons for reaching this view.


The company will also need to disclose in its remuneration report key details regarding the consultant, such as the consultant used, the amount they were paid for providing remuner­ation recommendations as well as other services to the company.


These measures will deliver greater trans­parency for shareholders, as they will be in a better position to assess potential conflicts of interest associated with the use of remuneration consultants. By placing the onus on boards to demonstrate to shareholders the steps taken to ensure the independence of remuneration advice, the Government also hopes to bring about a cultural change towards greater accountability around the use of remuneration consultants.




Prohibiting KMP from voting in remuneration matters



The Bill also addresses conflicts of interest by prohibiting the company’s directors and key executives (or key management personnel) and their closely related parties from voting their shares in the non-binding vote on the remuneration report.


Currently, the Corporations Act does not prohibit key management personnel who hold shares in the company from participating in the non binding shareholder vote on remuneration.


There is a real, as well as perceived, conflict of interest when key management personnel vote on their own remuneration packages.


As these directors and executives have an interest in approving their own remuneration arrangements, allowing them to participate in the non binding vote may result in a higher approval rating on the remuneration report than might otherwise be achieved.


The Bill prohibits key management personnel and their closely related parties that hold shares from participating in the non-binding vote on their own remuneration arrangements, as well as the spill resolution.


Key management personnel and their closely related parties would also be prohibited from voting undirected proxies on the remuneration report and spill resolution, except when they are acting as the chair of the meeting and the shareholder has indicated their informed consent on their proxy voting form for the chair to exercise the proxy. This exception for the chair is intended to apply to the non-binding vote required under section 250R of the Corporations Act.


Key management personnel continue to be permitted to vote directed proxies on remuneration related resolutions.




Prohibiting hedging of incentive remuneration



The Bill also ensures that executive remuner­ation remains linked to performance by prohibiting key management personnel from hedging their incentive remuneration.


Incentive remuneration aligns the interests of management with the interests of shareholders. However, it is currently possible for directors and executives to hedge their exposure to incentive remuneration.


This is a practice that is inconsistent with a key principle underlying Australia’s remuneration framework that remuneration should be linked to performance.


Under the new law, key management personnel and their closely related parties will be prohibited from hedging the key management personnel’s incentive remuneration.




No vacancy



The Bill also contains a measure to prevent boards declaring ‘no vacancy’ without explicit shareholder consent.


The ‘no vacancy’ rule allows a board to declare that it has no vacant positions even though the maximum number of directors allowed by the constitution has not been reached.


The ‘no vacancy’ rule provides boards with considerable power over the composition of the board, making it difficult for non board-endorsed candidates to be elected.


The Bill enhances the accountability of boards by ensuring that companies will be required to obtain the approval of their members for a declaration that there are no vacant board positions. A board may choose to declare ‘no vacancy’ where: its constitution allows such a declaration; there are fewer directors than the maximum number; and where a non board-endorsed candidate has nominated for a board position.




Cherry Picking



This Bill also introduces amendments which ensure the enfranchisement of each shareholder who chooses to exercise their vote at an annual general meeting or extraordinary general meeting.


Proxies are allocated to directors or the Chair by shareholders that are not able to attend a company meeting but still wish to vote. Shareholders can vote directed proxies, which specify how they wish to vote on a resolution.  However, under the current law all directors except the Chair have the ability not to exercise proxy votes that do not accord with their own views on a resolution, and to exercise only those proxy votes that do support their position. This is called cherry picking. Cherry picking disenfranchises shareholders who made specific declarations about their intentions to vote and can result in outcomes that do not clearly reflect shareholder views on a resolution.


This Bill ensures that all proxies will be voted. Either the nominated proxy holder will vote as directed or, if a proxy holder does not register at the meeting or the proxies are not voted by the proxy holder, the proxies will default to the Chair, who has a duty to vote them as directed. This Bill ensures that the wishes of shareholders can no longer be ignored.




Range of individuals named in the remuneration report



The Bill also contains a measure to limit the remuneration details required to be disclosed in the remuneration report to the key management personnel of the consolidated entity. This will simplify the disclosures in the remuneration report to enable shareholders to better understand the company’s remuneration arrangements. This will also reduce the regulatory burden on companies, while maintaining an appropriate level of accountability.




Government amendment to the application date of three measures



The Bill also contains Government amend­ments, agreed by the House of Representatives, that would delay the application date of three of its measures from 1 July 2011 to 1 August 2011. These measures are the prohibi­tion on key manage­ment personnel and their closely related parties from voting their shares in the non binding vote on remuneration and exercising undirected proxies on remuneration related resolutions, and the prevention of 'cherry picking' of proxy votes.


The amendments respond to concerns raised by business. They provide transitional relief to firms facing difficulties in their preparations, during May and June, for annual general meetings scheduled for July 2011, because the Bill remains subject to Parliamentary consideration.  As the delay in application affects only three measures, the broad policy purpose of the Bill would continue to be applicable from 1 July 2011.




Conclusion



While Australia’s current remuneration framework is strong, it is important that we are not complacent.


The Productivity Commission, while noting that Australia’s remuneration framework is highly ranked internationally, has recommended that the framework be further strengthened.


This Bill will give unprecedented power to shareholders, improve the accountability of company directors on remuneration issues, address conflicts of interest that exist in the remuner­ation setting process and promote a culture of responsible remuneration practices.


These are significant but responsible reforms that will maintain Australia’s international competitiveness, while ensuring that boards are accountable to shareholders and the processes for remunerating executives are transparent.


Finally, I can inform the Senate that the Ministerial Council for Corporations was consulted in relation to the amendments to the laws in the national corporate regulation scheme, and has approved them as required under the Corporations Agreement.


 


CRIMES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 2011


I am pleased to introduce the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2011. This Bill contains amendments that are integral to the Government’s efforts to tackle serious and organised crime, and to ensure the integrity of our law enforcement processes.


Firstly, the Bill contains amendments to the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006 to bring the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (Customs) within the jurisdiction of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity (the Commission).


The Commission was established in 2006 to investigate allegations of corruption and to enhance the integrity of Commonwealth law enforcement agencies.


It currently oversees all of the activities of the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Crime Commission and investigates allegations of corruption relating to the former National Crime Authority.


From 1 January 2011, the Commission has had oversight of the law enforcement functions of Customs, following the prescription of Customs in Regulations made under the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act.


The Bill being introduced today will amend the Act to enable the Commission to oversight all Customs’ functions.


It is important to ensure that the Commission has oversight of all Customs’ functions because of the close relationship between Customs’ law enforcement functions and many of its non-law enforcement functions. For example, admin­istrative staff and employees employed in other areas of Customs provide support or have access to the agency’s law enforcement functions, information and systems.


The Government considers it is appropriate, therefore, that Customs be brought under the Commission’s purview on a whole-of-agency basis. And this can only be achieved by including Customs in the Act.


Placing Customs within the Commission’s jurisdiction will also give effect to a recommendation of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity in its interim report on the inquiry into the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act.


The Government is committed to ensuring the integrity of federal law enforcement agencies in Australia, and equipping the Commission with the powers necessary to oversight these agencies.


Schedule 2 of the Bill contains the other key element of the Bill, and delivers an important Gillard Government election commitment to combat serious and organised crime.


Organised crime is estimated to cost Australia $10-15 billion each year. This is money that is created outside of the legal economy, is diverted from legitimate services, and often, is the result of fraud or theft from Australian citizens.


The Government has provided a comprehensive response to this threat; we established the Organised Crime Strategic Framework in 2009, and developed the Organised Crime Response Plan in 2010, both of which recognise the need for a multi-agency approach to combating organised crime. This Bill is the next step in this work.


Schedule 2 of the Bill will support the newly established Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce, led by the AFP, which will strike at the very heart of organised crime, its financial motivation.


The Taskforce commenced operations in January of this year, bringing together expertise in intelligence, operations, forensic accounting, litigation and specialist law enforcement to ensure a highly integrated approach to criminal asset confiscation. Its main objective is to enhance the identification of potential criminal asset confiscation matters and strengthen their pursuit.


To support this work, Schedule 2 of the Bill will amend the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 to enable the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police (AFP) to commence proceeds of crime litigation on behalf of the Government’s Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce.


Currently, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) is the only authority that is able to conduct proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act. The amendments contained in this Bill will ensure that the AFP has that same power.


Extending the Act to include the AFP will enable the Taskforce to become a specialised unit focused on proactively investigating and litigating proceeds of crime matters, which will lead to the more effective pursuit of criminal assets. And ultimately, the objective is to ensure that more proceeds of crime money is returned to the community for crime prevention and diversion initiatives.


Under these amendments, the DPP and AFP will also have the ability to transfer responsibility for proceeds of crime matters between the two agencies, allowing either authority to take over matters initiated by the other, where appropriate.


In addition, the Bill contains proceeds of crime-related amendments to the Family Law Act 1975. The Family Law Act currently sets out procedures for the stay of proceedings when action is being taken at the same time under the Commonwealth Proceeds of Crime Act. The amendments will make these same procedures available when action is being taken under State or Territory proceeds of crime legislation. This will allow family law proceedings relating to property and spousal maintenance to be stayed or set aside where there are Commonwealth, State or Territory proceeds of crime proceedings on foot. These amendments are consistent with the Government’s commitment to ensuring that proceeds of crime are vigorously pursued.


Schedule 2 also contains two amendments to the Proceeds of Crime Act to extend the definition of ‘property tracking document’ to ensure a Magistrate can issue a production order for documents relevant to unexplained wealth proceedings, and to improve the interaction between collection of tax related liabilities and proceeds of crime proceedings. These measures are aimed at ensuring the full picture is before the court when orders are made.


These elements of the Bill show the Government’s clear commitment to addressing serious and organised crime in our community, by targeting the proceeds of their illicit activity.


We know that organised crime crosses both state and national borders. We also know that organised crime groups rely on the profits from their crimes – money is the lifeblood of their organisations. The Taskforce is aimed at attacking the architecture of organised crime groups by taking the profit out of crime.


These changes are fundamental to achieving the proactive and dynamic approach to asset confiscation needed to detect and deter organised criminal activity in Australia, and I am confident the results will speak for themselves.


 


CUSTOMS AMENDMENT (ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES) BILL 2011


I am pleased to introduce the Customs Amendment (Anti-Dumping Measures) Bill 2011, which will amend certain provisions of the Customs Act 1901 concerning reviews of anti-dumping measures.  In brief, the amendments will clarify the circumstances in which the Minister may revoke anti-dumping measures as a consequence of such a review. 


The bill responds to a decision from last year of the   Full Federal Court in Minister of State for Home Affairs [and] Siam Polyethylene (the Siam decision), which considered the review pro­visions, and, in particular, the test for determining whether anti-dumping measures should be revoked.  


The Government believes the decision will lead to outcomes inconsistent with the objects of Australia’s anti-dumping system, and it is appropriate that we seek to rectify it.


The Siam decision is problematic for two reasons. 


First, the case highlighted a lack of clarity in the current review process, whereby affected parties must request one of three things: either (a) a complete revocation of existing anti-dumping measures, (b) an adjustment to existing measures, or (c) both a revocation or failing that, an adjustment, based on changed circumstances.


Secondly, the Court in its decision formulated a new test for determining whether anti-dumping measures ought to be revoked. The formulation will likely lead to measures being revoked where they remain warranted.


In relation to the first problem; it was established practice for Customs and Border Protection, prior to the Siam decision, to conduct reviews consistent with the nature of the review request. If there was no request for measures to be revoked, Customs would not consider whether measures ought to be revoked.   


The Siam decision changed this by leaving open the question whether revocation must be considered in every case.  It has led to a situation in which revocation is considered even in cases where an applicant has not specified that revocation is sought.  


In the case of Siam; that was a matter in which a request for revocation was made, but received late in the process of a review into whether measures ought to be adjusted. There was nothing explicit to prevent the revocation request being made at that point in time, but the lateness of the request constrained Customs in its ability to undertake a worthy examination of the relevant issues. 


As a result of the Siam decision, where an affected party lodges a request for revocation, the Minister is obliged to properly consider that request, no matter when in the review process the request for revocation is received.


The intention of these amendments is to make the process of applying for a revocation review clear to all affected parties. 


The amendments clarify that if affected parties want the Minister to revoke measures, they must apply for it, and they must do so at the outset of a review process or within forty days of a review commencing.  


The amendments cement Customs’ existing practice to treat revocation reviews as different in kind from reviews adjusting or updating the level of the measures, and will require an affected party to provide evidence that there are reasonable grounds for asserting that measures are no longer warranted.


The amendment will also improve procedural fairness, by giving affected parties advance knowledge of the process for seeking the revocation of measures, and will ensure that investigators have time to consider the issues before reporting to the Minister. Importantly the amendments will give interested parties adequate time to defend their interests.


The second problem raised by the Siam decision was the Full Federal Court’s con­struction of the revocation test.


In the absence of a legislative test, the Court determined that the Minister must revoke anti-dumping measures, unless satisfied that there would be dumping causing material injury to the Australian industry if measures were not in place. 


The formulation is problematic because, where dumping measures are in place, it will be difficult to establish dumping causing material injury.  In fact, if dumping measures are effective, then, at least in theory, there should be no injurious dumping. 


As a result of the Siam decision, it is now much more likely that a finding of no dumping or no injury during a review period will lead to revocation.


For these reasons it is appropriate to amend the review provisions to clarify the circumstances under which dumping measures should be revoked.


The proposed amendments insert a new test which will provide that the Customs CEO must recommend that the Minister revoke measures unless satisfied that the removal of the measures would lead, or be likely to lead, to a continuation of, or recurrence of, the dumping or subsidisation and the material injury that the anti-dumping measures are intended to prevent. 


It is a clearer test, which will avert the un­necessary revocation of effective anti-dumping measures.


The Government is committed to its anti-dumping system. These amendments will ensure that where measures have been put in place to address injury faced by Australian industry as a result of unfair trading practices, those measures remain effective.


 


CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT (2012 HARMONIZED SYSTEM CHANGES) BILL 2011


The Customs Tariff Amendment (2012 Harmonized System Changes) Bill 2011 contains approximately 800 amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995. 


These amendments implement changes resulting from the World Customs Organization fourth review of the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, commonly referred to as the Harmonized System.  


Australia is a signatory to the Harmonized System and since 1988, the Harmonized System has formed the basis of Australia’s commodity classifications for traded goods, both imports and exports.  


The Harmonized System is a hierarchical system that uniquely identifies all traded goods and commodities.  Over 200 countries use the Harmonized System.


Australia has implemented the Harmonized System domestically through the Customs Tariff Act 1995 for imports and the Australian Harmonized Export Commodity Classification for exports. 


As a signatory to the Harmonized System, Australia is required to implement the changes resulting from the fourth review on 1 January 2012.  


The amendments concentrate on environ­mental and social issues that are of global concern, including the use of the Harmonized System for identifying goods that are of importance to the food security programme of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations such as certain fish species and products.  


The Harmonized System changes will create new subheadings for specific chemicals.  These include pesticides such as tributyltin compounds and ozone-depleting substances such as halogen­ated derivatives of hydrocarbons.  This will facilitate the monitoring and control of international trade in these products under the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer.


The Bill will clarify texts to ensure the uniform application of the Harmonized System. 


The Customs Tariff Amendment (2012 Harmonized System Changes) Bill 2011 will also amend Schedules 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995.   


These schedules give effect to the application of customs duty on imported goods in accordance with Australia’s bilateral free trade agreements with the United States, Thailand and Chile and Australia’s regional agreement with ASEAN and New Zealand.


The Bill will preserve existing levels of industry protection and margins of tariff preference that apply to imported goods, including goods imported under the free trade agreements.  


This Bill will provide certainty for Australia’s importers and exporters and ensures that Australia classifies its goods and commodities in accordance with the Harmonised System and in a manner that is consistent with its major trading partners.


 


FAMILY LAW LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FAMILY VIOLENCE AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2011


The Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill 2011 addresses a matter of paramount concern to the Australian community.  


It is about the safety of our children.  


This Bill seeks to protect children and families within the family law system from family violence and child abuse.




[Introduction]



Children are the most vulnerable members of our community 


Many children thrive in happy and cohesive families who put the best interests of their children first.  Unfortunately, some children are not so lucky and experience significant conflict, fear, isolation and harm.


Their experiences often occur within the confines of the family home and involve trusted family members.  Conflict often escalates during family breakdown increasing the risk to these children.


Often there are strong intergenerational effects.  


It is not in any way proper or moral or beneficial to allow a child to suffer, to witness or hear, or to learn violence.  


As a Government, we cannot tolerate family violence or child abuse.




[Evidence base for the legislative reforms]



The damaging effects of family violence and child abuse have been recorded in a range of reports commissioned by the Government in recent years.  


In an evaluation of the 2006 family law reforms released by the Government last year, the Australian Institute of Families Studies  found that two-thirds of separated mothers and over half of separated fathers reported experiencing abuse, either emotional or physical, by the other parent.  


The Institute also found that one in five separated parents surveyed reported safety concerns associated with ongoing contact with their child’s other parent.  


A report by the Family Law Council highlights data that victims of family violence receive more psychiatric treatment and have an increased incidence of attempted suicide and alcohol abuse than the general population.  Violence is also a significant cause of homelessness.


These are disturbing findings.  


Perhaps more importantly, various research reports by leading social scientists and academics clearly show that exposure to family violence and child abuse leads to poor developmental outcomes for children.


Former Family Court judge, the Honourable Professor Richard Chisholm AM, in his Family Courts Violence Review, identified the importance of disclosing, understanding and acting where there is family violence.


Professor Chisholm has stated that many families before the family courts face the victim’s dilemma: ‘Do I report family violence to the court and risk losing my children, or should I stay silent?’  


It is unacceptable that our laws place people in this predicament.


There is no dilemma for this Government.  


This Bill will help to break those ghastly silences by encouraging disclosure of family violence; it will improve the understanding of what family violence is by clearly setting out the types of behaviour that are unacceptable; and it will ensure that appropriate action is taken to prioritise the safety of children.




[Key Features of the Bill]



The Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill will positively address family violence and child abuse in the family law system.


The Bill will amend the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth) to promote safer parenting arrangements for children.  




[Prioritising the safety of children]



Firstly, the Bill will prioritise the safety of children in family law proceedings.


This Government continues to support shared care and a child’s right to a meaningful relationship with both parents.  However, where family violence or abuse is a concern, the courts will be required to prioritise the safety of the child over maintaining a meaningful relationship with each parent.


Once amended, the Act will include an additional object to give effect to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which decision-makers may have regard to when dealing with children’s matters under the Family Law Act.




[Change definitions of family violence and abuse]



Second, the Bill will change the definitions of ‘family violence’ and ‘abuse’ to better capture harmful behaviour.  Family violence takes many forms and can affect any family member; adult or child, male or female.  


The definition of ‘family violence’ is consistent with the recommendations of the Australian and New South Wales Law Reform Commissions.  Behaviour such as assault, sexual assault, stalking, emotional and psychological abuse, and economic abuse are explicitly referenced in the definition.  


The definition of ‘abuse’ in relation to a child will include serious psychological harm as a result of exposure to family violence, and serious neglect.


This is a vital first step in helping the family law system to identify these problems and respond appropriately to them.  




[Strengthening the obligations of advisers]



Third, the Bill will strengthen the obligations of lawyers, family dispute resolution practitioners, family consultants and family counsellors to prioritise the safety of children.  


Under the proposed reforms, advisers must encourage families, in reaching parenting arrangements, to focus on the best interests of the child and in doing so prioritise the wellbeing and right to safety of their children.




[Getting better evidence before the courts]



Fourth, the Bill will ensure that courts get the information that they need to make safe parenting arrangements. To this end:


courts dealing with children’s matters will have to ask the parties to proceedings about family violence and child abuse


parties will have to report their concerns about those matters to the courts 


other people interested in the proceedings will be able to make similar reports to the courts


courts will be relieved of considering the extent to which a parent is ‘friendly’ according to the current definitions, and


families will no longer need to fear being saddled with a costs order for reporting family violence to the courts.


With all relevant information being made available, the courts can ensure that parenting orders will protect children from harm.




[Involvement of State and Territory child protection agencies]



Finally, the Bill will make it easier for Commonwealth, State and Territory child welfare agencies to participate in family law proceedings.




[Public Support for the Bill] 



The measures proposed in this Bill have received overwhelming support from the community and bodies and professionals working in the family law system.


Over 400 submissions were received in a public consultation conducted between November 2010 and January 2011.  


A massive 73 per cent of people making submissions supported measures proposed in the exposure draft Bill.  Another 10 per cent made no comment on the Bill but offered information about their personal experiences.


The Government has taken account of all submissions that were received in the public consultation and refined the measures that are proposed today in light of that process.


Part of the reason the Bill has received such support is because it keeps in place key reforms that encourage meaningful relationships between parents and their children where they are safe.


Various research reports have found that shared care generally works well where the parents have little conflict, can cooperate and live relatively close together.  


This Government supports creating happier, healthier outcomes for children.




[Other non-legislative measures]



In addition to this Bill, the Government is taking other actions to combat family violence and child abuse.  


Substantial inroads will continue to be made through: 


the National Framework for Protecting Australia’s Children 2009-2020 which was developed under the auspices of the Council of Australian Governments


the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children 2010–2022 recently endorsed by Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments


the development of a national scheme for recognition of domestic violence orders across Australian jurisdictions under the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General


a training package designed to equip mediators, family counsellors and lawyers to better identify family violence and to work with families to keep children safe


piloting a supportive model of family dispute resolution for safe mediation where violence is present, and


establishing a common framework to assess and screen for violence within the family law system.




[Technical amendments]



The Bill also includes a number of technical and procedural amendments to the Family Law Act and also to the Bankruptcy Act 1966.  These will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of family law proceedings generally, and correct certain anomalies.




[Conclusion]



In conclusion, the Australian public and hard-working members of the family law system have spoken overwhelmingly in support of the Bill.


Family violence and child abuse are too common in separating families.  


It is time for the Honourable Senators of this Parliament to confront these disturbing issues and to make a difference that is long overdue.  


 


INTELLIGENCE SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2011


The Intelligence Services Legislation Amendment Bill contains amendments to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 (ASIO Act), the Intelligence Services Act 2001, and the Criminal Code Act 1995.


The proposed amendments in this Bill have been identified through practical experience as measures that will improve the operation of key provisions in the legislation.  


I will briefly outline the key measures in the Bill.




Amendments to the ASIO Act



The Bill amends the definition of ‘foreign intelligence’ in the ASIO Act to ensure consistency with the Intelligence Services Act and the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979.  This follows on from a similar amendment to the Interception Act, which was made last year by the Anti-People Smuggling and Other Measures Act 2010.  The amendments ensure a consistent approach to the collection of foreign intelligence, and reflect that the modern national security context encompasses threats from both state and non-state actors.


The Bill also amends the ASIO Act to clarify that computer access warrants authorise ongoing access to the computer during the life of the warrant.  This amendment is not intended to change the operation of the provision.


Amendments are also included to exclude the communication of information relating to employment within the intelligence community from the operation of the security assessment provisions in Part IV of the ASIO Act.  This will put ASIO on the same footing as other intelligence agencies when it comes to communicating such information.  




Amendments to the Intelligence Services Act



The Bill also contains an amendment to the functions of the Defence Imagery and Geospatial Organisation (DIGO).  It will provide a specific function for DIGO to cooperate with and provide assistance to the Australian Defence Force.  This is consistent with a similar function of the Defence Signals Directorate.  


The Bill contains amendments to provide a new ground for granting Ministerial Authorisations for producing intelligence about Australian persons.  The new ground covers intelligence regarding activities related to the contravention of United Nations sanctions.  It will complement the existing ground that covers activities relating to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or the movement of goods listed on the Defence and Strategic Goods List. 


Clarification of the immunity provisions in the Intelligence Services Act and the Criminal Code computer offence provisions are included.  These amendments make it clear that the immunity provisions can only be overridden by express legislative intent.  This will ensure that those provisions are not vulnerable to being inadvertently overridden by later in time legislation.


Finally, the Bill contains amendments relating to the status of certain instruments under the Legislative Instruments Act 2003.  Consistent with the Government’s commitment to clearer laws, the Bill moves existing exemptions from the Legislative Instruments Regulations to make these exemptions express on the face of the Intelligence Services Act. 




Oversight and accountability



I would like to take this opportunity to remind Members that Australia’s intelligence and security agencies continue to be subject to a range of important oversight and accountability measures.


These include the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, and the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security.  


The Government is committed to ensuring that national security oversight bodies are well-equipped to undertake their vital roles.  


Members would recall that amendments to increase the size of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security were recently passed as part of the Telecommunications Interception and Intelligence Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2010.  The Committee plays a vital role in providing parliamentary oversight of the administration and expenditure of the agencies.  


The mandate of the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security was recently expanded in the National Security Legislation Amendment Act 2010, so that the Inspector General can extend inquiries outside the intelligence community in appropriate circumstances.  I note that this extended power has since been utilised for an inquiry currently being undertaken by the Inspector General.  




Conclusion



Ensuring our national security and law enforcement agencies have the ability to respond to threats to our national security is a key priority for this Government. 


This Bill, while small, is an important step in the Government’s ongoing review of National Security legislation, and will improve the practical operation of a number of provisions.  


 


INTERNATIONAL TAX AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 2011


Today I introduce this Bill which will amend the International Tax Agreements Act 1953 in two ways:


Firstly, Schedule 1 to the Bill will modify and streamline the structure of the Act and remove the majority of its existing Schedules, which contain the texts of Australia’s bilateral tax treaties. This will simplify the presentation of the operative provisions of the Act and incorporate the treaty texts by reference to accessible online resources.


This amendment is not intended to alter the entry into force or application of Australia’s tax treaties but it will substantially reduce the size of the Act, which has become one of the largest Acts on the Commonwealth’s statute books. 


Secondly, Schedule 2 to the Bill will give the force of law in Australia to new bilateral taxation agreements, with Aruba, Chile, the Cook Islands, Guernsey, Malaysia, Samoa and Turkey  




Chile and Turkey



The agreements with Chile and Turkey are comprehensive tax treaties that will promote closer economic cooperation between Australia and Chile and Australia and Turkey, by reducing taxation barriers to bilateral trade and investment, in particular by eliminating double taxation of income arising from overlapping tax jurisdictions.


The Chilean and Turkish treaties will also improve the integrity of the tax system by pro­viding the framework through which the Com­missioner of Taxation can cooperate bilaterally with his Chilean and Turkish counterparts to prevent tax evasion. 


The internationally accepted approach to meeting the above policy objectives is to conclude a bilateral tax treaty. These two treaties are largely based on the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital and the United Nations Model Double Taxation Convention between Developed and Developing Countries, with some mutually agreed variations reflecting the economic, legal and cultural interests of Australia, Chile and Turkey.




Malaysia



The agreement with Malaysia is a Protocol which will amend the current Australia-Malaysia tax treaty to update the exchange of information article in that treaty to the current international standard, as endorsed by the OECD, the G-20 and the United Nations. 


The updated exchange of information provisions are an important tool in Australia’s efforts to combat offshore tax evasion and will make it harder for taxpayers to evade Australian tax by increasing the probability of detection of abusive tax arrangements.  




Aruba, the Cook Islands, Guernsey and Samoa



The agreements with Aruba, the Cook Islands, Guernsey and Samoa seek to eliminate double taxation on certain income derived by individuals, in particular government workers, students and business apprentices, and pensioners and retirees. 


Aruba, the Cook Islands, Guernsey and Samoa are required to provide reciprocal taxation treatment in relation to Australian government employees, students and business apprentices, retirees and pensioners.


These four agreements will also provide a mutual agreement procedure for the resolution of taxpayer disputes involving transfer pricing adjustments.  


These agreements were prompted by Australia’s desire to conclude tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs) with Aruba, the Cook Islands, Guernsey and Samoa.  TIEAs establish a legal basis for the exchange of taxpayer information between two countries and are an important tool in Australia’s efforts to combat tax avoidance and evasion.


The agreements contained in this Bill are part of a package of additional benefits offered to Aruba, the Cook Islands, Guernsey and Samoa in order to secure the TIEAs signed in 2009 with each of those jurisdictions.  


Each of the new agreements with Aruba, Chile, the Cook Islands, Guernsey, Malaysia, Samoa and Turkey will enter into force after Australia exchanges diplomatic notes with each of the other countries advising of the completion of their respective domestic law requirements.


 


MIGRATION AMENDMENT (COMPLEMENTARY PROTECTION) BILL 2011


The Migration Amendment (Complementary Protection) Bill 2011 amends the Migration Act to eliminate a significant administrative hole in our protection visa application process.


Under the Migration Act, as it currently stands, only those people fleeing persecution for one of the five reasons outlined in the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees – race, religion, nationality, social group or political opinion – are eligible to receive a protection visa through the usual process.


Applicants who fall outside these categories are not considered refugees and, consequently, their applications must be rejected by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship and also by the Refugee Review Tribunal.


But some of these people are fleeing significant harm – be they women fleeing so-called “honour killings”, or homosexuals fleeing persecution on the basis of their sexual preference.


These people can fall outside the categories recognised by our current protection visa process.


So their applications will be rejected at first instance – and again at review – even where Australia’s non-refoulement obligations under other international treaties ensure that we cannot and will not send them back to their countries of origin.


These treaties are the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CROC).


Protection from return in situations that engage our non-refoulement obligations under these treaties is known as “complementary protection”, in the sense that it is “complementary” to the protection given under the Refugees Convention.


Under the current system, these people, who have often fled their countries in fear of their lives, must go through our administrative processes knowing they’re going to be rejected.


But at present we make them go through a process of applying, failing, seeking review and failing again, just so they are then able to apply to the Minister for personal intervention.


As things stand, the decision to grant a visa in such cases may only be made by the Minister personally. The Minister cannot be compelled to exercise this power; there is no requirement to provide reasons if the Minister does not exercise the power; and there is no merits review of the Minister’s decisions.


As a result, as you can understand, the current lengthy process is very time-consuming and extremely stressful.


So what this Bill does is to align our protection visa process with our existing international obligations and practices.


In 2009, a previous bill, the Migration Amendment (Complementary Protection) Bill 2009, was introduced into Parliament and was considered by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. That bill lapsed when Parliament was prorogued for the 2010 election.


The present Bill is based on the 2009 bill and incorporates certain changes to address matters raised in the report by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee.


The introduction of complementary protection into Australia’s protection visa process is supported by domestic and international stakeholders. It has been recommended by the Australian Human Rights Commission and several Parliamentary Committees.


The 2009 bill received positive feedback from external stakeholders including the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (the UNHCR), the Refugee Council of Australia and leading academics.


The Bill also brings Australia into line with many like minded countries, including New Zealand, Canada, the United States of America and many European countries.


Let me briefly run through some key aspects of the Bill.


Protection visa applicants will continue to have their claims first considered against the Refugees Convention-related criteria set out in Australia’s migration legislation.


Applicants who are found not to be refugees under the Refugees Convention will have their claims considered under the new complementary protection criteria.


This approach recognises the primacy of the Refugees Convention as an international protection instrument and is supported by the UNHCR.


The Bill establishes new criteria for the grant of a protection visa in circumstances that engage Australia’s non-refoulement obligations under human rights treaties other than the Refugees Convention.


Australia will not return a person to a place where there is a real risk that a person will suffer particular types of significant harm contained in the relevant human rights treaties, namely:


the arbitrary deprivation of life;


having the death penalty carried out;


being subjected to torture;


being subjected to cruel or inhuman treatment or punishment; or


being subjected to degrading treatment or punishment.


The prohibitions of these types of harm are found in Articles 6 and 7 of the ICCPR and in the Second Optional Protocol to the ICCPR.


Non-refoulement obligations may also be implied under the CROC, to the extent that the CROC contains obligations in the same terms as the ICCPR. In addition, an express non-refoulement obligation in relation to torture is contained in Article 3 of the CAT.


The Bill defines many of these concepts to assist assessing officers to interpret and implement these international obligations.


These definitions will enable Australia to meet its non-refoulement obligations, without expanding the relevant concepts in a way that goes beyond current international interpretations.


Non-refoulement obligations are not engaged in every case in which a person claims that they will suffer some type of harm if returned to another country.


In each case, there must be substantial grounds for believing that, as a necessary and foreseeable consequence of being returned, there is a real risk that a person will suffer significant harm.


The risk of significant harm must go beyond mere theory or suspicion to give rise to a non-refoulement obligation.


A real risk of significant harm has been found in instances where there is a personal or direct risk to the specific person This is as opposed to a general risk faced by the population of the country that is not faced personally by the person claiming protection. A personal or direct risk can be found in instances where the significant harm is faced by a broad group, so long as that harm is personally faced by the person seeking protection.


The risk must also be a real one that the person would face throughout the country. If a person can reasonably be expected to relocate within their own country to access protection, then international protection is not required.


Similarly, Australia’s protection will not be necessary if the person can obtain protection from the authorities of their own country, such that there would not be a real risk of significant harm occurring.


Australia’s protection will also be unnecessary if the person can safely relocate to another country where they have a right of entry and residence.


This legal threshold for Australia’s non-refoulement obligations to be engaged is reflected in the Bill.


The Bill contains provisions to ensure that only applicants who are in need of Australia’s protection will be eligible for a protection visa on complementary protection grounds.


Unlike obligations under the Refugees Con­vention, Australia’s non refoulement obligations under the ICCPR, CAT and CROC are absolute and cannot be derogated from.


While Australia accepts that this is the position under international law, the Government is committed to maintaining strong arrangements for protecting the Australian community. This Bill is specifically designed to ensure Australia does not become a safe haven for persons who have committed war crimes and others of serious character concern.


For this reason, specific provisions have been included in the Bill to refuse the grant of a protection visa:


where there are grounds for considering that the applicant has committed war crimes, crimes against humanity, serious non political crimes or other particularly serious crimes; or


where there are grounds for considering that the applicant is a danger to Australia’s security or to the Australian community.


These provisions mirror the existing exclusion provisions under Articles 1F and 33(2) of the Refugees Convention which apply to refugee claims.


By incorporating these exclusion provisions into the Migration Act, Australia will be following general international practice, particularly in the European Union, where similar clauses have been incorporated into most countries’ respective legislative versions of complementary protection.


International law does not impose an obligation on Australia to grant a particular type of visa to those people to whom non-refoulement obligations are owed.


In the small number of instances where non-refoulement obligations would arise for persons who are excluded on security or serious character grounds, determinations as to post-decision case management will remain with the Minister personally.


In all circumstances, Australia is committed to meeting its non-refoulement obligations in a way that best protects the Australian community.


Where a person’s protection visa application has been refused, including on the new complementary protection grounds, that person will be able to seek independent merits review of the decision within the existing merits review framework.


There are a range of consequential amendments throughout the Migration Act that are to be inserted by the Bill.


Amendments to the Migration Regulations 1994 will also be required to complete implementation of complementary protection in the protection visa subclass.


Moreover, once this Bill comes into effect, assessments under the Protection Obligations Determination process for Offshore Entry Persons will also take into account complementary protection.


The Gillard Labor Government is proud to introduce this Bill, which will provide a protection visa decision-making process that is more efficient, transparent and accountable.


It does so by enabling claims raising Australia’s protection obligations under the Refugees Convention, and claims raising Australia’s non refoulement obligations under the ICCPR, CAT or CROC, to be considered under a single integrated and timely protection visa process.


Australia has a long and proud tradition as a protector of human rights and this Bill presents us with the opportunity to continue in this tradition.


I urge everyone in this place to support it.


 


MIGRATION AMENDMENT (STRENGTHENING THE CHARACTER TEST AND OTHER PROVISIONS) BILL 2011


The purpose of this Bill is to ensure that a visa applicant or holder will fail the character test should they be convicted of any offence committed while they are in immigration detention; and to increase the maximum penalty for the manufacture, possession, use or distribution of weapons by immigration detainees from 3 to 5 years imprisonment.  These amendments are proposed in part to address issues arising from the recent criminal damage and riots at the Christmas Island Detention Centre in March and the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre in April 2011.  Major damage was caused to the facilities as a result of these disturbances and there was significant risk of harm to other detainees and to staff at the facilities as well as more broadly to public order and safety.  


The Bill is also intended to strengthen the powers under the Migration Act to provide a more significant disincentive for this sort of destructive behaviour now and in the future. The new provisions will apply to all people who are or have been in immigration detention: onshore and offshore arrivals, asylum seekers, or otherwise.


Under these new provisions, a person who has been convicted of a criminal offence while in immigration detention could be refused a visa or have a visa cancelled.  In keeping with Australia’s international protection obligations, in such cases we will not return people to a place where they have a well-founded fear of persecution.  Where it is not appropriate to remove people from Australia because they are owed protection, consideration could be given to the grant of a temporary visa to place them in the community until their removal from Australia is appropriate.


The public announcement on 26 April 2011 of this legislative change put all detainees on notice that the Australian government takes criminal behaviour by people in immigration detention very seriously and will take appropriate measures to deal with it.


It is essential that anyone convicted of an offence in relation to the recent events at Australian immigration detention centres is covered by these new provisions and has the amended character test applied to them. 


The Australian community expects there to be consequences for unlawful behaviour.  Commencing these amendments to the character provisions on 26 April 2011 ensures this Bill delivers those consequences and the Government’s objectives are met.  These changes will apply for the purposes of making a decision on or after 26 April 2011, whether the conviction or offence concerned occurred before, on or after that date. 


The Australian community also expects non-citizens who seek to remain in Australia to be of good character.  To meet this expectation, the Government must not only have the ability to act decisively and effectively, wherever necessary, to deal with criminal behaviour by immigration detainees, but also have the legislative basis to effect a refusal to grant a visa, or a cancellation of a visa for those non-citizens who are not of good character.  The Government must be able to remove those non-citizens who have convictions for crimes committed in immigration detention in Australia, where possible and consistent with our international obligations. 


Among other things, section 501 of the Migration Act currently deals with matters that constitute serious criminal offences where a person can fail the character test.  Non-citizens will fail the character test where they have been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 12 months or more, or where the length of several sentences aggregates to two years or more.  If a person fails the character test, this can be used as a basis for the refusal of a visa application or the cancellation of a visa that is held by a person.  The proposed measures will amend the character test in section 501 of the Migration Act so that a person will fail the character test if the person is convicted of any offence committed while they are in immigration detention, regardless of the sentence imposed. The intended amendment will not limit the application of the existing provisions relating to the character test. This Bill therefore seeks to establish an additional benchmark for criminal behaviour that will automatically lead to a visa applicant or holder failing the character test if they are convicted of an offence committed while they are in immigration detention.  


Similarly, section 500A of the Migration Act provides that the Minister may refuse the grant of a temporary safe haven visa or may cancel a temporary safe haven visa if a person has been sentenced to imprisonment of 12 months or more.  Without limiting the application of the existing character provisions relating to section 500A of the Migration Act, the proposed measures will amend section 500A of the Act so that the Minister may also refuse to grant a safe haven visa, or may cancel a safe haven visa if the person is convicted of any offence committed while they are in immigration detention.  


For both the section 501 and section 500A amendments it is intended, if a person escapes from immigration detention, that any conviction for the offence of escaping or for an offence committed during or following their escape – up to the time of their being returned to immigration detention – be included.


The amendments to sections 501 and 500A have been drafted to ensure that they apply only to persons who have been convicted of an offence by a court.  The amendments made to sections 501 and 500A will not apply to a person who is charged before a court with an offence or offences and the court is satisfied in respect of that charge, or more than one of those charges, that the charge is proved, but has discharged the person without a conviction on that charge, or any of those charges.  That is, there must be at least one conviction for the amendments to sections 501 and 500A to apply.


Currently section 197B of the Migration Act provides that an immigration detainee is guilty of an offence if he or she manufactures, possesses, uses or distributes a weapon.  A weapon includes a thing made or adapted for use for inflicting bodily injury; or a thing where the detainee who has the thing intends or threatens to use the thing, or intends that the thing be used, to inflict bodily injury.  The current maximum penalty is imprisonment for 3 years.  The proposed amendment to section 197B of the Migration Act will increase the maximum penalty to 5 years imprisonment.  The manufacture, possession, use and distribution of a weapon by a detainee puts at risk the personal safety of others in the immigration detention environment, including other detainees, Commonwealth officers, contracted detention services staff and visitors.  The Australian community expects that there be robust sanctions to deal with people in immigration detention who threaten or inflict harm on other people and the intended increase in the maximum penalty for this offence reflects the seriousness with which the community views this offence.




Conclusion



In summary, people in immigration detention who might contemplate criminal behaviour, including the manufacture, possession or use of weapons need to clearly understand the seriousness of such behaviour and legal consequences that could follow from that behaviour in terms of criminal convictions and visa outcomes. These changes will: strengthen the character test in section 501 of the Migration Act; strengthen the power to refuse or cancel a temporary safe haven visa in section 500A of the Migration Act; and provide further disincentive in relation to the manufacture and possession of weapons by detainees by increasing the maximum penalty in section 197B of the Migration Act.  These measures are intended to send a strong and clear message; that the kind of unacceptable behaviour recently seen at immigration detention centres will not be tolerated by the Government. 


 


SAFETY REHABILITATION AND COMPENSATION AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2011


This Bill implements the Government’s response to the review of the Comcare scheme, as well as introducing certain other associated amendments.


The Comcare scheme provides workers compensation and occupational health and safety arrangements for employees of the Australian Government and for some private sector corporations that self-insure their workers compensation liabilities under the scheme.


In late 2007, federal Labor undertook to review the Comcare scheme, in particular, its self insurance arrangements which provide for the entry of private sector corporations into the scheme. The review was to ensure that the Comcare scheme has suitable occupational health and safety and workers compensation arrangements for self insurers and their employees.


On 25 September 2009, the then Minister for Workplace Relations, Minister Gillard, announced a number of improvements to the Comcare scheme arising out of the review. On 26 November 2009, the Occupational Health and Safety and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009 was introduced into Parliament to implement these improvements; however the Bill lapsed when the Parliament was prorogued.


The Bill I am introducing today will implement the improvements arising from the review of the Comcare Scheme through amendments to the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (the SRC Act).


The Bill also makes amendments to respond to policy issues unrelated to the Review to address Comcare’s access to the consolidated revenue fund and also workers’ compensation coverage for employees working in high risk environments overseas.


To encourage timely determination of workers compensation claims, the Bill amends the SRC Act to enable the setting of statutory time limits within which claims must be determined. Claims determined quickly tend to be shorter in duration and less costly.


The Bill also reinstates workers compensation coverage for off-site recess breaks. This will realign the Comcare scheme with most jurisdictions and remove the inequity in coverage for employees whose employers do not provide on site facilities for meal breaks.


This amendment will cost Comcare $1.7 million in 2010-11, indexed for the out years. However since these injuries are currently only claimable through Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, reinstating coverage will result in a net saving to the PBS of $136,000 in 2010-11, also indexed for the out years.


Furthermore, the Bill amends the SRC Act so that medical and related costs will continue to be paid where a worker’s weekly compensation benefits are suspended for refusing to participate in the rehabilitation process.


Suspending weekly compensation benefits can be a useful incentive to encourage claimants to comply with the requirement to undergo appropriate rehabilitation and return to work programs. However, suspending medical and related payments can be counterproductive to early rehabilitation and return to work.


This reform will have a negligible financial impact on Comcare’s premiums pool of around $24,000 per annum in 2010-11, indexed for the out years.


Also as part of the response to the review, in early 2010, the then Minister for Workplace Relations, Minister Gillard, directed Comcare to strengthen its OHS prevention and enforcement approach, including through more proactive interventions and improving the expertise of its investigators.


The Minister also requested Comcare to develop guidance material for employers to improve consultation with all workers on occupational health and safety matters. This was intended to ensure that consultation arrangements reflect the modern workplace, and extend beyond the traditional employer/employee relationship.


Separately, under federal Labor the lump sum and weekly death benefits for the Comcare scheme were increased substantially from May 2008 to align them more closely with death benefits payable under the majority of state and territory workers compensation schemes.


These measures, as well as the measures proposed in the Bill, are designed to improve the Comcare scheme by reducing injuries; strengthening the focus on rehabilitation and return to work; and increasing benefits for injured workers.


The Bill also seeks to make a number of additional reforms to address issues that have arisen separately to the Comcare review.


In particular, the Bill amends the SRC Act to provide workers’ compensation coverage for injuries sustained while an employee is working in a ‘declared place’ outside Australia, or where the person is a member of a ‘declared category’ of employees whose work requires deployment to places outside Australia.


It does this by enabling the Minister to declare certain high risk places, for example, Afghanistan or Iraq, to be places where the SRC Act will be deemed to provide continuous coverage for all Commonwealth employees.


The Bill will also allow the Minister to declare certain classes of employees to be covered while outside Australia. The need for this flexibility arises specifically in relation to the establishment of the Australian Civilian Corps, who will assist in disaster relief, stabilisation and post-conflict resolution in developing countries and failed states.


The effect of these changes will be to provide 24/7 coverage under the SRC Act for employees exposed to unusually high risk while working outside Australia. The fiscal impact of these amendments will be in the order of $2 million per annum.


Other amendments to the SRC Act contained in the Bill will restore Comcare’s access to the consolidated revenue fund to pay for its workers’ compensation liabilities and associated expenses arising from long latency injury claims, such as those related to asbestos exposure.


Comcare’s access to the consolidated revenue fund was closed off as an indirect result of a Federal Court decision in 2006.


However, the intention of the SRC Act had been—and still is—that the consolidated revenue fund should fund these claims because they relate to employment-related injuries not covered by Comcare’s premium system.


The Bill also contains technical amendments to the SRC Act, the Occupational Health and Safety (Maritime Industry) Act 1993 and the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1992 to cater for new arrangements and terminology introduced by the Legislative Instruments Act 2003.


 


SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT (PARENTING PAYMENT TRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENT) BILL 2011


The Government’s Social Security Amendment (Parenting Payment Transitional Arrangement) Bill 2011 represents the first stage of the income support payment reforms contained in the Building Australia’s Future Workforce package. This package will provide greater incentives for parents to engage in the workforce, reduce their dependency on welfare, and will provide families with a greater measure of financial security. 


Joblessness among families represents one of the most immediate challenges facing Australia as an inclusive society. In a time of increasing national wealth, many Australian families risk being left behind and many Australian children are in danger of missing out on the opportunities that a dynamic and growing society has to offer.   


Evidence indicates that joblessness is closely linked with higher rates of poverty, lower achievement in education and training, and poorer health outcomes for both parents and their children. Families in which neither parent works, or in which single parents rely on welfare payments as their sole source of income, can produce entrenched problems leading to intergenerational disadvantage. This is especially a concern for single parent families who constitute 70 per cent of the total number of jobless families in Australia.


In order to break the cycle of joblessness and welfare dependence, the Government is enacting a range of measures to help parents address the barriers which prevent them and their children from taking advantage of the opportunities which Australian society has to offer.   


To this end, the Government is introducing changes to Parenting Payment and Newstart Allowance for single principal carer parents that will provide greater incentive for single parents to engage in paid work, to reduce their reliance on welfare, and to promote self-sufficiency. This will in turn serve to provide positive role models for the children of income support recipients and help reduce the chance of welfare dependence passing onto their children.  


Under the Building Australia’s Future Workforce reforms, single principal carer parents on Newstart Allowance will be able to retain more of their income support as their employment income rises. This will mean that single parent families will be able to earn almost $400 extra per fortnight before they lose eligibility for Newstart Allowance. This provides a strong incentive for single parents to undertake or increase their hours of work, and allows their family to see the immediate benefit of their labour.


These changes further build upon the Government’s More Flexible Participation Requirements for Parents reforms that were introduced in July 2010 which allowed parents greater flexibility in engaging in meaningful participation whilst balancing their parenting responsibilities.


As part of the broader changes to Parenting Payment, in this Bill the Government is taking a positive step towards reducing the inequity that exists between different Parenting Payment recipients based upon when they first applied for payment.  This inequity is a legacy of the 2006 Welfare to Work reforms of a previous Government. 


In July 2006, the Parenting Payment provisions in the Social Security Act were amended such that a person who claims Parenting Payment from 1 July 2006 can only qualify for Parenting Payment until their youngest child turned 8 (if they are single) or 6 (if they are a member of a couple). Prior to July 2006, a person could qualify for Parenting Payment until their youngest dependent child turned 16.


However, people who were in receipt of Parenting Payment immediately before 1 July 2006 were allowed to remain under the previous rules. These “grandfathered” recipients can continue to qualify for Parenting Payment until their youngest child turns 16. A full 8 years longer than new recipients if they are single or 10 years longer if they are partnered. 


In order to achieve more equitable and consistent eligibility rules for Parenting Payment, this Bill will amend the Social Security Act so that only children who were born to or came into the principal care of their parent before 1 July 2011 will count towards the grandfathered status of the Parenting Payment recipient.


This change will limit the ability of Parenting Payment recipients to extend their grandfathered status and will ensure that all Parenting Payment recipients will be treated equally in a shorter timeframe than would otherwise have been the case.  


This Bill is just the first step towards creating more equitable treatment for Parenting Payment recipients. Further changes will take effect from 1 January 2013 and will be included in a separate Bill which will be introduced later this year.


Overall, these changes will form an important element of the income support reforms that the Government is undertaking as part of the Building Australia’s Future Workforce Package. These reforms will encourage more parents to participate in and share in the benefits of paid work, will provide better support and assistance to parents, and is an important step to making the system fairer.


 


SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (JOB SEEKER COMPLIANCE) BILL 2011


This Bill delivers on our Government’s election commitment to modernise Australia’s welfare system and introduce tougher measures to ensure more unemployed people are getting back into work.


Our Government believes that the task of managing the Australian economy is important because it helps ensure that all Australians who are capable of work, have the opportunity to do so.


The Prime Minister has said that a job provides more far more than just a pay packet and she is correct.


With it, a job brings dignity and purpose to a person’s life; it provides economic security for a family now and into the future; and it connects people with their communities, building a more socially cohesive Australia.


It is because we understand the value of having a job that when the Global Financial Crisis threatened the jobs of so many Australians, it was this Government that stood up and took action - saving hundreds of thousands of Australians from losing their job.


Our stimulus strategy created work oppor­tunities for small businesses, tradespeople and suppliers in every community, in every town, in every city–right around the country.


Australia’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 5.0 per cent in February 2010–around half that of the United States and the Euro area.


But with our economy returning to strength and our mining sector booming, now is not a time for complacency. It is a time to turn our sights to what still needs to be done.


There remain too many Australians who are without a job, some for a full year or more; too many Australians who are not engaging in mainstream economic and social life; too many Australians who are capable of work but have to rely on unemployment benefits.


We know that most job seekers are genuine in their efforts to find work.


For most–unemployment is temporary. But for some unemployment has become long term. The Government is willingly doing our part to ensure that those people are supported financially while they look for a job.


The Government has advanced major reforms to Australia’s employment services that are providing much more effective assistance for job seekers. Engagement by job seekers with those services is vital.


That is what this Bill is about.


For many years the rate at which job seekers attend appointments with employment service providers has been around 55 per cent. While many are genuinely sick, suddenly find a job or have other valid reasons, I believe that attendance at appointments–appointments designed to help job seekers get into work–can and should improve.


A strengthening of the compliance system is warranted.


This Bill will introduce suspension of payment for job seekers following an initial failure to attend an appointment.


As soon as Centrelink is advised that a job seeker has missed an appointment with their employment services provider, or if the provider believes the job seeker has become disengaged from an activity they are supposed to be participating in, Centrelink will suspend the job seeker’s payment.


When Centrelink contacts the job seeker, another appointment will be booked for them. As part of this contact with Centrelink if the job seeker agrees to attend the rescheduled appointment, Centrelink will immediately release the job seeker’s payment, and they will get back payed. At that contact job seekers will be advised by Centrelink that any further missed appointment may result in both a suspension and a penalty through loss of payments.


All job seekers will be required to attend a rescheduled appointment–regardless of their reason for missing the first appointment. If the job seeker attends the rescheduled appointment, they will not be penalised.


However, if the job seeker does not attend the rescheduled appointment, payment will again be suspended. However this time–if they don’t have a reasonable excuse–they will lose payment for each day from the second missed appointment until they do attend a rescheduled appointment.


There will be no back payment for this period. This penalty will be deducted from their very next payment.


This Bill is not about punishing Australians who have a valid reason for missing an appointment. And suspension is not about punishing job seekers for punishment’s sake. The job seeker is either back paid in full or payment resumes when they do what is required of them.


But these changes will give the job seeker no choice but to agree to re-engage with the Government and be serious about finding work–if they want to be paid.


We want more job seekers actively engaging in work experience activities, in training, in programs like Work for the Dole–so that they are getting the skills and experience they need to find a sustainable job into the future.


Under current legislation, penalties for failing to reconnect can’t be deducted from the job seeker’s payment for the fortnight in which the penalty is applied–penalties must be deducted from a later payment.


The effect of this delay has been to disconnect the penalty from the failure to attend an appointment. By making the penalty more immediate we can provide a more direct deterrent for job seekers who aren’t taking their appointment responsibilities seriously.


Reasonable excuse provisions will also be tightened so that–even if a job seeker has a reasonable excuse on the day for not attending an appointment or activity–it will not be accepted if they could have given advance notice that they couldn’t attend but didn’t do so.


Employment service professionals have an important job. They should not have their time wasted by needlessly waiting for job seekers who don’t show up.


This is about expectations for job seekers that are equivalent to those they will experience when they re-enter the workforce.


A person who is working is expected to call their boss in the morning if they can’t come in because they are sick–it is reasonable to expect an unemployed person to do the same.


This Government is committed to lifting workforce participation and to extending the benefits of work to more Australians of working age.


We will do all we can to provide income sup­port recipients with opportunities to work, and in return we expect them to take responsibility for making the most of those opportunities.


All Australians on income support should have the opportunity of work–but with opportunity comes responsibility and with this Bill–we are going to firmly expect that people meet those responsibilities.


 


TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2011 MEASURES No. 2) BILL 2011


This Bill amends various taxation laws to implement a range of improvements to Australia’s tax laws.


Schedule 1 amends the list of deductible gift recipients or DGRs in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997.  Taxpayers can claim income tax deductions for certain gifts to organisations with DGR status.  DGR status will assist the listed organisations to attract public support for their activities.  


This Schedule adds two new organisations to the Act, namely, the Charlie Perkins Trust for Children & Students and the Roberta Sykes Indigenous Education Foundation.  The Charlie Perkins Trust was established in 2002 in memory of the late Dr Charlie Perkins AO, and its purpose is to advance the education of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people through the provision of scholarships to Indigenous people for study at overseas institutions, such as Oxford and Cambridge University.  


The Roberta Sykes Education Foundation works to advance the education and life opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, and provides additional assistance to female Indigenous scholars undertaking programs overseas, such as assisting with the cost of relocating families and partners.


Schedule 2 amends the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 to allow the regulations to prescribe rules in relation to investments in collectables and personal use assets by self managed superannuation funds.  


During the 2010 election the Government committed to allowing self managed super­annuation fund trustees to continue to invest in collectables and personal use assets provided that they comply with tighter legislative standards.  This commitment balanced the recommendations made by the Panel of the recently concluded Super System Review, chaired by Jeremy Cooper, and concerns raised by the self managed superannuation funds industry.


The amendments will allow the regulations to make rules relating to how self managed superannuation fund trustees make, hold and realise investments in collectables and personal use assets.  The purpose of the rules will be to ensure that these investments are made for retirement income purposes, not current day benefit.  The content of the regulations is being developed in consultation with industry. 


The amendments also remove a reference to a provision that was repealed on 24 September 2007.


Schedule 3 allows superannuation fund trustees and retirement savings account providers to use tax file numbers to locate member accounts without first using other methods and to facilitate the consolidation of multiple accounts. 


These amendments will be subject to approp­riate privacy safeguards.


This measure is a part of the Government’s package of Stronger Super reforms, which I announced on 16 December 2010.  Allowing for greater use of tax file numbers is the first of a number of initiatives from that package that will improve the administrative efficiency of the superannuation industry.


Regulations will be enacted to support the use of tax file numbers in facilitating the account consolidation process.  This will include require­ments for member consent and other procedures and processes that superannuation fund trustees and retirement savings account providers must follow before consolidating accounts. 


In keeping with the current guidelines governing the use of tax file numbers, it will remain voluntary for individuals to provide their tax file number to their superannuation fund or retirement savings account provider.  


Schedule 4 replaces the current mechanism for ensuring Australian taxes, fees and charges are not subject to the GST, with a legislative exemption.


The Government’s decision to replace the current mechanism was announced in the 2010-11 Budget on 11 May 2010.


This Schedule replaces this inefficient system by amending the GST Act to allow entities to self assess the GST treatment of a payment of an Australian tax or an Australian fee or charge.


Under these amendments, government entities will no longer need to have Australian taxes or Australian fees or charges listed on the Deter­mination in order for them to not be subject to GST.


Finally, Schedule 5 includes minor amend­ments to the tax laws.


These amendments ensure that the law operates as intended by correcting technical or drafting defects, removing anomalies, and addres­sing unintended outcomes.  These amendments are part of the Government’s commitment to the care and maintenance of the tax law.


This package also includes some legislative issues raised by the public through the Tax Issues Entry System, or TIES for short.


Full details of the measures in this Bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum.


 


TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2011 MEASURES No. 3) BILL 2011


This Bill amends various taxation laws to implement a range of improvements to Australia’s tax laws.


Schedule 1 to this Bill provides a 12-month export period for the supply of a recreational boat to be GST-free, subject to certain conditions, where the boat has been supplied under a contract entered into on or after 1 July 2011.  


The Schedule implements a measure announced by the Government in the 2010-11 Budget.  The measure overcomes a geographic disadvantage Australian boat builders face when competing in international markets. 


The distance and sailing conditions between Australia and foreign ports make it difficult for boat buyers intending to have an extended sailing holiday before taking the boat out of Australia to meet the existing 60-day export period for a GST-free supply.  On the other hand, it is relatively easy for boat purchasers in some other countries to meet the export requirements of comparable legislation because these countries are com­paratively closer.  


The Schedule makes the supply of a boat GST-free if the seller or purchaser exports the boat from Australia within 12 months of delivery.  The main conditions are that the boat must be a new recreational boat and the boat must not be used in any disqualifying activity.   


The first condition is designed to ensure that the 12 month export period applies only to boats of a type used for recreational purposes.  It is not intended to apply to boats of a type used for commercial gain.  The boat also has to be a new boat.  This will generally be one that has not been used or sold before, although certain activities before sale are allowed.  These include delivering the boat to a dealer or to a boat show, conducting speed trials on the boat or other uses in con­nection with the use of the boat as trading stock.   


The disqualifying activity test is, broadly, designed to ensure that the boat cannot be used for commercial or financial gain while it is in Australia.  


The Commissioner of Taxation will have a discretion to extend the 12-month export period.  The discretion could cover circumstances that reasonably explain the delay in exporting the boat, such as bad weather, serious illness to a crew member or significant accidental damage to the boat.


Schedule 2 amends the tax laws to remove a technical deficiency which prevents the ongoing imposition of the general interest charge in some cases.  The general interest charge is an interest charge imposed by the tax laws on the late payment of income tax and shortfall interest charge liabilities.


These amendments will restore the ongoing imposition of the general interest charge.  This ensures that all unpaid amounts of income tax and shortfall interest charge will be treated equally under the law and that the Commissioner’s ability to collect the general interest charge will remain uninterrupted.


Full details of the measures in this Bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum.


 


TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2011 MEASURES No. 4) BILL 2011


This Bill amends various taxation laws to implement a range of improvements to Australia’s tax laws.


Schedule 1 reduces the quarterly income tax instalments for the 2011-12 income year for those taxpayers whose instalments are adjusted for previous years’ gross domestic product growth. This is referred to as the GDP adjustment method of working out instalment amounts.


The great majority of taxpayers required to pay quarterly instalments use this method, including most small businesses and individual investors such as self-funded retirees.  


These amendments reduce the GDP adjustment factor for the 2011-12 income year from the default, which would be 8 per cent, to 4 per cent. This delivers small businesses and the other taxpayers using the GDP adjustment method a $700 million cash flow benefit in the 2011-12 income year.  


This provides eligible taxpayers with a smoother transition from the 2 per cent GDP adjustment factor that the Government applied for the 2009 10 and 2010-11 income years as the economy recovered from the global financial crisis.


This measure is part of the Government’s package of measures to improve the cash flow of small businesses and simplify their tax affairs. Those measures include the instant asset write-off for any asset costing less than $5,000, an immediate deduction of up to $5,000 for motor vehicles and reducing the small business company tax rate to 29 per cent.  The Government will have more to say on these measures when the legislation for them is introduced.


Schedule 2 removes the ability of children under 18 years of age to use the low income tax offset to offset tax due on their unearned income, such as dividends, interest, rent, royalties and other income from property.


The Government has taken important steps to reduce taxes on low-income earners by doubling the low income tax offset from $750 to $1,500. This delivers a benefit to taxpayers earning up to $67,500.


But increases in the low income tax offset have doubled the amount of non-work income that can be allocated to children tax-free. There is evidence that 200,000 distributions from trusts have increased in line with the increased low income tax offset, to take advantage of the opportunity to minimise tax by allocating income to children.


The low income tax offset was never meant to act as a tax minimisation vehicle.


This measure reduces the incentive for families to split income with their children — protecting the integrity and improving the fairness of the income tax system.


Children will still benefit from the full low income tax offset for their income from working.


Double orphans and children with disabilities will also be fully protected under this change.


The Government sees trusts as a legitimate business tool and remains committed to clarifying, updating and rewriting Australia’s trust law. This will greatly assist the 660,000 trusts in Australia. 


Meanwhile, the Liberal-National Coalition remain bitterly divided over the Opposition’s tax policy in relation to trusts, one minute they want to tax family, small business and farm trusts as companies, the next minute they have changed their mind and are arguing whether it was Opposition policy in the first place.


I think we know what the Shadow Treasurer’s real views are on taxing trusts, thanks to his 7 April speech in Melbourne to the Institute of Chartered Accountants.  


I think we can also be pretty confident about where the Leader of the National Party sits on this trusts issue – and it’s nowhere near his colleague the Shadow Treasurer.


Where the Leader of the Opposition sits on all this however is far less clear Mr Speaker.  


He evidently says one thing to one colleague and then turns around and says something very different to another colleague.


The Gillard Government has a clear tax framework that makes sure taxpayers pay their fair share, increases national savings and retirement income and simplifies the tax system for Australians. The Opposition not only lack a basic tax framework but they can’t even agree on individual policies.  


Schedule 3 contains amendments to streamline the process for claiming tax deductions for the cost of total and permanent disability (TPD) insurance provided through superannuation.  These amendments are designed to reduce costs for superannuation funds in complying with the law following the expiry of the current transitional relief which applies to these insurance policies.


Superannuation funds commonly take out death and disability insurance to cover liabilities they may incur to their members. Disability insurance taken out by superannuation funds includes TPD insurance.  


The cost of TPD insurance provided through superannuation is deductible to the extent the policies provide cover which is consistent with the definition of ‘disability superannuation benefit’ in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. Where broader insurance cover is provided, superannuation funds are required to obtain an actuary’s certificate to determine the deductible portion of the premium. 


These amendments allow the percentage of certain TPD insurance premiums that is deductible to be specified in regulations. This will assist superannuation funds by avoiding the need to engage an actuary to determine the deductible portion of premiums in many cases. The regulations containing the prescribed percentages will be developed following consultation with industry.


The Government introduced transitional provisions in 2010 which were designed to allow time for industry practice of deducting the full cost of broader disability insurance policies to be brought into alignment with the operation of the law.  These transitional provisions expire on 30 June 2011.


The amendments in this Schedule extend this transitional relief to funds that self insure their liability to provide disability benefits. This will provide equitable treatment between self insured funds and premium-paying funds, and will avoid the need for self insured funds to amend tax returns and obtain revised actuary’s certificates where they have claimed deductions for broader disability insurance for the relevant income years.


Schedule 4 introduces amendments to ensure additional employer contributions imposed by an industrial agreement, or the rules of a superannuation fund, will not be reportable employer superannuation contributions. 


Reportable employer superannuation contri­butions are contributions to superannuation above the minimum required by the Superannuation Guarantee that employees can influence, such as salary sacrifice and similar arrangements. Report­able employer superannuation contributions are counted as income when determining a person’s eligibility for government financial assistance programs.  


Contributions mandated by an industrial agreement, or a superannuation fund cannot be controlled by employees, and cannot be accepted by employees as income or other benefit.  These contributions should not be considered income when assessing a person’s eligibility for govern­ment financial assistance.


Full details of the measures in this Bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum. 


 


TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (MEDICARE LEVY AND MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE) BILL 2011


This Bill increases the Medicare levy and Medicare levy surcharge low income thresholds for individuals and families in line with increases in the consumer price index.  These changes, which historically have received bipartisan support, will ensure that low income individuals and families will continue to be exempt from the Medicare levy and/or the Medicare levy surcharge.


This Bill also increases the Medicare levy low income threshold for pensioners below Age Pension age to ensure that these pensioners also do not pay the Medicare levy when they do not have an income tax liability. 


These amendments will apply to the 2010 11 year of income and later income years.  Full details of this Bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum.


 


THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT (2011 MEASURES No. 1) BILL 2011


This Bill will make changes to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 to further enhance the regulatory framework for therapeutic goods and provide additional support for the new streamlined pro­cesses being implemented to bring improvements to the time within which prescription medicines are evaluated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration.


A number of initiatives were identified in a review of the application and evaluation pro­cesses for prescription medicines that could help eliminate unnecessary delays including those arising from the provision of incomplete or insufficient data. Implementation of these initiatives is expected to result in a reduction of the current 500 days for an application to be determined to approximately 300 days.


The TGA has been working to streamline the submission process both for the registration of new prescription medicines and for making changes to the entries of prescription medicines in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods Register. A twelve month implementation phase for the new streamlined submission and evaluation processes commenced on 1 November 2010.


Changes to the Act to support these processes were made by the Therapeutic Goods Amend­ment (2010 Measures No.1) Act 2010. This Bill includes further changes to add legislative support to the new processes.


Prior to implementation of the streamlined procedures prescription medicines application submissions were generally accepted for evaluation in the expectation that further docu­mentation could be lodged and information provided during the evaluation process. This, coupled with often lengthy response times to the requests from the TGA for further information or documents, substantially added to the evaluation completion time.


The amendment proposed in the Bill will provide that when an application is made to make changes to a prescription medicine’s entry in the Register which involves evaluation of clinical, pre-clinical or bioequivalence data, the applicant must provide adequate information in the required form and manner and pay any prescribed fee for the application to be effective and therefore accepted for evaluation. This requirement is designed to ensure that the necessary information will be supplied at the appropriate time to enable an evaluation to take place within agreed timeframes. Applications that do not meet these requirements will not be accepted for evaluation. This reflects the rules already in place under the Act in relation to applications for new entries in the Register for prescription medicines.


The new streamlined submission processes will provide greater clarity about TGA requirements for granting marketing approval for medicines and making changes to prescription medicine Register entries, encourage a higher standard of application submissions, provide more predictable timelines, increase transparency in the management of evaluations and, importantly, to remove unnecessary delays in the evaluation process.


This Bill will also make a change to the way evaluation fees are collected by the TGA. Completion of evaluations of prescription medicines is subject to prescribed timelines under the Therapeutic Goods Regulations. Where the TGA fails to meet these timelines, the evaluation fee payable by an applicant is reduced by 25 per cent. Currently, sponsors applying to register prescription medicines initially pay three quarters of the evaluation fee, with the remaining one quarter payable only if the TGA completes the evaluation within the timeframes set out in the Regulations.


Since the implementation of time limits for completing evaluations for prescription medicines in 1992, the TGA has only failed to complete evaluations on time on about 15 occasions. The collection of 75% of fees and the recovery of the remaining 25% owing applies only to applications requiring the evaluation of clinical, pre-clinical and bioequivalence data associated with prescription medicines. The administrative burden in invoicing applicants twice to recover the full evaluation fees payable, and monitoring each application until completion in order to send the second invoice to recover the remaining 25% of fees owing is not warranted given TGA's track record of completing evaluations on time. Additional administrative costs are passed onto industry as the TGA operates on a full cost recovery basis.


The amendment will mean the TGA collect the full evaluation fee when an application is accepted for evaluation, and must refund 25% of that fee if they do not complete the evaluation within the prescribed time limit. This is a more efficient way of recovering monies owing to the Commonwealth.


The final amendment included in the Bill relates to the operation of a ministerial power to make determinations for the purpose of imposing standard conditions on the registration or listing of therapeutic goods. These are mainly prescription, over-the-counter or complementary medicines and therapeutic devices.


The Therapeutic Goods Amendment (2009 Measures No.1) Act 2009 amended the Therapeutic Goods Act to enable a legislative instrument to be made by the Minister that would set out the “standard” conditions to be imposed on the registration or listing of these goods. These conditions may relate to, for example, the manufacture, supply, use, custody or disposal of therapeutic goods included in the Register.


The legislation currently provides that once the Minister makes such a determination, the new conditions will apply not only to the registration or listing of therapeutic goods after the instrument comes into effect, but also to therapeutic goods already on the Register. The removal of the old standard conditions is therefore necessary to ensure there will be no overlap or possible inconsistencies between the new conditions and those imposed as standard conditions on goods that have already been entered into the Register.


The Bill includes amendments to ensure that the old standard conditions cease to apply when the first instrument takes effect. Any unique or special conditions applying to specific therapeutic goods entered in the Register will continue to apply.


The Bill also contains an amendment enabling the instrument imposing the standard conditions to apply only to the to the registration or listing of therapeutic goods after the instrument comes into effect as there may be occasions when this is appropriate.


The measures in this Bill make important improvements to the operation of the regulatory framework for registered and listed therapeutic goods to the benefit of Australian consumers as well as industry. 


 


AUSTRALIAN TRANSACTION REPORTS AND ANALYSIS CENTRE SUPERVISORY COST RECOVERY LEVY BILL 2011


The Gillard Government recognises that organised crime is a significant national security threat, and a growing challenge, that costs the Australian community up to $15 billion a year. We are determined to protect the Australian community and businesses from the pernicious social and economic impacts of organised crime.


The Government’s Organised Crime Strategic Framework ensures that Commonwealth intelli­gence, policy, regulatory and law enforcement agencies are working together to prevent, disrupt, investigate and prosecute organised crime. Organised Crime Response Plans targeting the key organised crime risks; the Criminal Intelligence Fusion Centre and a new Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce are key elements of the Government’s plan to combat organised crime.


And the common basis of these elements, is tracking money flows, the life-blood of organised crime.


The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) is Australia’s specialist financial intelligence unit. It provides information about potentially criminal activity to law enforcement agencies, which put it together with other intelligence to detect people smuggling, drug importations, black market weapons trade, and other serious and violent crime. This financial intelligence has a broad public benefit, and is funded from our taxes.


In addition, AUSTRAC is Australia’s anti-money laundering and counter terrorism financing regulator. AUSTRAC’s regulatory activities mitigate the risk of money laundering, terrorism financing and other organised crime. 


Businesses regulated by AUSTRAC facilitate financial flows that provide opportunities for others to disguise the true origin or eventual use of funds. Regulation under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter terrorism Financing Act 2006 (AML/CTF Act), however, reduces the risk that business will be exploited for money laundering or terrorism financing purposes. Businesses that operate internationally also benefit from operating in a jurisdiction that meets international standards for combating money laundering and terrorism financing. It is appropriate that industry meet the costs of the regulatory systems that ensure the integrity of their operating environment.


Businesses that profit from services that are vulnerable to abuse for money laundering and terrorism financing have created the need for regulation by AUSTRAC. 


Since 2002, the Cost Recovery Guidelines have recognised as a matter of principle that entities that have created the need for Government regulation should bear the cost of that regulation. 


In the 2010-11 Budget the Government announced that from the 2011-12 financial year, AUSTRAC would recover the costs of its regulatory activities from the businesses regulated under the AML/CTF Act. Cost recovery has not previously been applied to AUSTRAC  as up until AML/CTF Act commenced in 2006, AUSTRAC's regulatory functions were limited, and the AML/CTF Act did not fully become operational until March 2010.


This bill, together with the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre Supervisory Cost Recovery (Collection) Bill 2011 and the Australian Transaction Reports and Analy­sis Centre Supervisory Cost Recovery (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2011, gives effect to that measure.


There has been extensive consultation with industry about how best to recover the costs of AUSTRAC’s regulatory activities. Throughout this consultation process, the Government has listened to the concerns of industry and substantial changes have been made to the proposed model to address these concerns.


In accordance with the Cost Recovery Guidelines AUSTRAC will be able to recover its supervisory budget. 


The supervisory budget consists of four parts:


The business-as-usual cost of AUSTRAC’s regulatory activities (including support services and costs associated with capital projects necessary to support regulation).


Support for small business to achieve better compliance outcomes. Some small businesses captured by the AML/CTF Act have faced challenges in implementing compliant AML/CTF programs.  This component will include the development of simplified guidance materials and the development of AUSTRAC’s website to enhance its usability for small business.


An amount to meet the legal costs associated with enforcement activities undertaken by AUSTRAC. 


The establishment and ongoing costs associated with implementing and administering cost recovery.


AUSTRAC has no power to use the levy to determine its supervisory budget. AUSTRAC’s supervisory budget will be determined as part of the usual budget process. For example, the effi­ciency dividend applies equally to AUSTRAC’s intelligence and supervisory budgets.


The 2011-12 Budget Papers estimate the amount to be collected over the next four years at less than $30 million each year.


The total amount to be collected under the levy cannot be greater than the cost of AUSTRAC’s regulatory activity. The amounts to be levied will be set in advance of the date at which the number of regulated entities enrolled with AUSTRAC is determined for levy purposes, accordingly there is a chance that AUSTRAC will over collect or under collect the levy. In the event of an over, or under, recovery of costs, a compensating adjustment will be made to the levy to be imposed in the subsequent year. The Bill provides for this eventuality by setting a statutory upper limit for the amount that can be collected which is marginally higher than the AUSTRAC supervisory budget, namely $33 million per annum, indexed. 


The Bill provides for the Minister to determine the amount payable by each business each year. This will be set out in a Ministerial Deter­mination, which is a disallowable instrument.


Under the Bill, A reporting entity’s liability to pay the levy in any particular year will be determined on the “census day”. The census day in the 2011-12 financial year is the day determined by the AUSTRAC CEO. In future years, the census day will be 1 July or such other day determined by the AUSTRAC CEO. 


The AUSTRAC levy is proposed to be a single annual charge comprising three components: a base component, a component for large entities and a component for transaction reporting activities.


The base component, to be paid by most businesses regulated by AUSTRAC, relates to the costs incurred by AUSTRAC in regulating all businesses. These expenses are incurred uni­formly for all businesses, and the base component will be uniform.


The large entity component, to be paid by businesses with high earnings, relates to the additional costs incurred by AUSTRAC in regulating larger businesses. The large entity component will be higher, the higher the business’s earnings. 


The transaction reporting component, to be paid by businesses depending on the volume and value of their reportable transactions, that is, threshold transaction reports and international funds transfer instructions. This relates to the additional costs incurred by AUSTRAC in regulating businesses which lodge large numbers of transaction reports, and or transaction reports relating to large amounts of money.


The Determination may specify a zero levy for an entity or class of entities. Remittance affiliates created by the Combating the Financing of People Smuggling and Other Measures Bill 2011 will be such a class of entities. This will include remittance affiliates like newsagents and post office agents.


Sole proprietors and partnerships with employees or businesses employing less than five people will also be exempt from the base component of the levy. These businesses will not be invoiced if the levy amount calculated for that business in the financial year is less than $100.00, indexed. 


Businesses that are not required to have or comply with an anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing program under Part 7 of the AML/CTF Act will not be subject to a levy. The AUSTRAC CEO has indicated his intention to exempt small gaming machine venues from Part 7 of the AML/CTF Act.  This would mean that these businesses would not be subject to the levy. 


A review of the calculation methodology is planned after five years, or earlier if there are material changes to the AUSTRAC operating environment. AUSTRAC will monitor the cost recovery approach on an ongoing basis.


The government appreciates the way in which businesses work collaboratively with AUSTRAC through our regulatory system to make it ever harder for organised crime and terrorist to move money around undetected. 


This Bill will ensure that AUSTRAC continues to provide a regulatory environment that maintains community confidence in financial flows, and minimises the risk to business of exploitation for money laundering or terrorism financing. 


 


AUSTRALIAN TRANSACTION REPORTS AND ANALYSIS CENTRE SUPERVISORY COST RECOVERY LEVY (COLLECTION) BILL 2011


This is the second of three bills that will give effect to the 2010-11 Budget announcement that from the 2011-12 financial year, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) would recover the costs of its regulatory activities from the businesses regulated under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-terrorism Financing Act 2006 (AML/CTF Act).


This bill enables AUSTRAC to collect the supervisory cost recovery levy from businesses under the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy Bill 2011.  It establishes the framework for administrating the levy, including matters relating to collection, invoicing, and dealing with late payments.




Liability to pay levy



Businesses that are not otherwise exempted from paying the levy will be required to pay it in any given financial year if they provided a designated service in the previous financial year and are enrolled or required to enrol at the census day.  


The census day will be the date on which an entity’s liability to pay the levy for the current financial year will be calculated. The census day is defined in the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy Bill 2011. Reporting entities that cease to provide designated services and are not enrolled at census day will not be liable to pay the levy.  This recognises that the legal status or business activities of reporting entities may change due to bankruptcy, merger or acquisition.




Facilitation of group payments



In keeping with the government’s commitment to reduce the regulatory burden, wherever possible, businesses regulated by AUSTRAC may nominate another entity to receive the levy invoice and to discharge the obligation on its behalf.  This will enable corporate groups to streamline the receipt and payment of invoices through a single entity. 




Waivers



The government recognises that there may be some circumstances in which a business may not be able to pay the levy or where imposing a late penalty payment is not appropriate. In these circumstances, the AUSTRAC CEO will have the capacity to waive the levy and/or the late payment penalty.   A decision by the AUSTRAC CEO to waive the levy or late payment penalty will be a reviewable decision before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.


 


AUSTRALIAN TRANSACTION REPORTS AND ANALYSIS CENTRE SUPERVISORY COST RECOVERY LEVY (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2011


This is the last of three bills that will give effect to the 2010-11 Budget announcement that from the 2011-12 financial year, the Australian Transaction and Reports Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) would recover the costs of its regulatory activities from the businesses regulated under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-terrorism Financing Act 2006 (AML/CTF Act).


This bill amends the AML/CTF Act to require reporting entities to enrol with AUSTRAC and allow infringement notices to be issued for failure to enrol and failure to appropriately maintain enrolment details.  




Mandatory Enrolment



Currently businesses required to be regulated by AUSTRAC are encouraged to voluntarily enrol with AUSTRAC by facilitating electronic reporting for those businesses that enrol through AUSTRAC on-line. As at January 2011, 17,888 businesses had enrolled with AUSTRAC – 1,590 more than in January 2010. 


In moving to a cost recovery environment, the government considers that enrolment must become mandatory to implement a transparent, efficient and effective cost recovery scheme.  Mandatory enrolment enables AUSTRAC to comprehensively identify its regulated population for the purpose of calculating and applying the AUSTRAC Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy. Failure to enrol attracts a civil penalty of up to 100,000 penalty units (currently $11 million) for businesses or 20,000 penalty units (currently $2.2 million) for individuals.


The levy for a particular business will be calculated in accordance with the information provided by the business on enrolment. Provision of false or misleading information to AUSTRAC is already a criminal offence under the AML/CTF Act regime.


Businesses regulated by AUSTRAC will be required to enrol within 28 days of providing or commencing to provide a designated service or within 28 days of the commencement of the relevant provisions of the Bill.


The details of what businesses will be required to provide to AUSTRAC will be contained in Rules. The AUSTRAC CEO will make the Rules under the AML/CTF Act, in consultation with affected businesses.  These Rules will require reporting entities to provide business and contact details, as well as specific details that facilitate the calculation of the levy.  To the greatest extent possible, these requirements mirror the information currently provided voluntarily by reporting entities to AUSTRAC.


Once enrolled, businesses will be required to keep their details up to date.   The penalty for failing to keep details up to date is also a civil penalty provision and may attract the same penalties as a failure to enrol.


In addition, businesses may make a request to the AUSTRAC CEO to have their name and details removed from the Roll.  Prior to doing this the AUSTRAC CEO may take into consideration whether the business has discharged its reporting obligations.




Infringement Notice Scheme



Schedule 2 of the bill extends the infringement notice scheme to the offences for failure to enrol and failure to appropriately maintain enrolment details. This infringement notices scheme will enable the AUSTRAC CEO to respond to breaches in a more efficient and proportionate way than proceeding to court.  The use of infringement notices in these instances is consistent with AUSTRAC’s use of infringement notices more broadly, and the powers and approach of other Commonwealth regulators.


Ordered that the bills be listed on the Notice Paper as separate orders of the day.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (14:00):  I, like many Australians, was shocked by the footage shown on Four Corners on 30 May. I was also shocked by the opposition's response on this issue too, quite frankly. The government shares the Australian community's concerns about animal welfare and is taking the necessary action to provide for a secure future for the live trade industry. But, as I have already announced, the government has suspended live animal exports to Indonesia until we are satisfied that the appropriate animal welfare standards can be met. I announced on 13 June 2011 that Mr Bill Farmer AO would also conduct an independent review into Australia's live export trade. Mr Farmer, of course, will examine each stage of the supply chain from paddock to the point of slaughter. But I have seen comments from Mr Abbott and Mr Truss on this and they seem to suggest that they would want to take—




Senator Colbeck:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order on relevance. I have given the minister a minute of his two minutes to consider the question, which was very specific, around when he, his department or his office first saw images of these inhumane slaughter practices. It was a very specific question and I would ask you to bring the minister to the question.




Senator Conroy:
  Mr President, on the point of order, I do not know how much more relevant you could be in answering that question. Senator Ludwig was absolutely answering—



Honourable senators interjecting—




The PRESIDENT:
  Senator Conroy, resume your seat. When the noise across the chamber ceases, we will proceed. Senator Conroy, you were responding to the point of order.




Senator Conroy:
  Senator Ludwig was absolutely answering the question. More importantly, he still has almost a minute—almost half of his available time—to complete his answer. The suggestion that he is not relevant to the question should be dismissed as absolutely spurious.




The PRESIDENT:
  The minister does have 56 seconds remaining. I do draw the minister's attention to the question.




Senator LUDWIG:
  Thank you. Can I work up to my point—



An opposition senator:  When?




Senator LUDWIG:
  Shortly. I have seen Mr Truss's and Mr Abbott's suggestions that they would want to take the risk that Australian animals continue to be exposed to the shocking conditions we have seen. The decision to suspend trade was not an easy one, but let us be clear: on the afternoon of 30 May—

The Indonesian government shares our concern that some animals are not being slaughtered in accordance with Indonesia's own animal welfare laws.

This is an important question that goes to the vision of the Gillard government's strategy, which is for Australia to become one of the world's leading digital economies by 2020. The strategy itself has eight key goals that will ensure that we as a nation take full advantage of the National Broadband Network to improve health service delivery, create new educational opportunities, assist small businesses to enter new markets and take advantage of increased business oppor­tunities, reduce the imbalance between metropolitan and regional and remote Australia, and support our growing and ageing population.


Since its release the strategy has received strong support from industry and community groups. Peter Strong, the CEO of COSBOA, the Council of Small Business of Australia, said:


It is without a doubt ambitious and that ambition is needed when it comes to the digital world which is changing constantly and at times dramatically.


Jonathan Nicholas, CEO of the Inspire Foundation, which supports youth mental health services, said the government's plan 'outlines a comprehensive strategy for leveraging the NBN to drive improved health outcomes in the Australian community'. The Australian Information Industry Association chief, Mr Ian Birks, said the strategy reflected 'bold and visionary leadership by Minister Conroy and the Gillard government'. I have to say Mr Birks went on to say—and I do not think anyone in the chamber could disagree with this—that it would be nice to see an intelligent response from the opposition. He stated:


I suspect its response will be around implementation and cost. But it would be nice to see an intelligent conversation about the NBN as we go forward.

 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (15:03):  I have further informa­tion which I seek leave to incorporate into Hansard in response to a question without notice from Senator Milne on 12 May 2011 to me representing the Minister for Health and Ageing in relation to hydraulic fracturing or 'fracking'.


Leave granted.




The answer read as follows—



Further information in response to a question without notice from Senator Milne on 12 May 2011 to Senator the Hon Joe Ludwig, Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing.


The process of extracting coal seam gas is known as hydraulic fracturing or ""fracking"". The process involves injecting a mixture of water, sand and chemical additives underground to break apart rock formations to free trapped gas and oil. Commonly 99% of the fracking fluid is water and sand.


Industrial chemicals are required to be listed on a national chemical inventory maintained by the National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme (NICNAS). The chemicals used in fracking are listed on the inventory, however, the majority of these chemicals have not been assessed by NICNAS.


Existing chemicals listed on the inventory are assessed by NICNAS on a priority basis and those assessments, which include recommendations about safe usage, are made available from the NICNAS website.


The Australian Government recognises that there is a large number of unassessed chemicals on the inventory and NICNAS is working with stakeholders on the development of a framework to address the issue. This framework will provide a mechanism to more rapidly and comprehensively provide advice about the risks of industrial chemicals in use in Australia.


Enforcement of NICNAS recommendations occurs through state and territory legislation.


The Government has no plans at this time to make health impact statements a compulsory component of major projects under Com­monwealth legislation.

Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (15:03):  I move:




That the Senate take note of answers given by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (Senator Ludwig) to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today relating to the live export of cattle to Indonesia.



What we have seen this afternoon regrettably has been an absolute abrogation of accountability and responsibility from this minister and far from his comments about the coalition not engaging or supporting I can assure you, Mr Deputy President, that up until he made his ill-considered decision to suspend the live export trade all he had was support from the coalition. Unfortunately, that has been a knee-jerk reaction to an ill-considered email campaign by a group of activists—




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  Order, Senator Back! There is far too much audible conversation in the chamber.




Senator BACK:
  I was saying that the minister's decision was a knee-jerk reaction to an ill considered email campaign by activists who knew little about the consequences of what they were doing or indeed the animal welfare issues that they will subject Australian cattle to. Unfortunately, the minister's action has been to penalise those abattoirs in Indonesia which, as Senate colleagues from this side have said, are performing to normal international standards and have long done so.


The best evidence that I have of this was the minister saying that he had to suspend the trade because he had no confidence about where animals would end up. I ask him then if he could tell me how the decision was made on 6 June, two days before he brought in this suspension, to disallow the shipment of 1,900 cattle from Port Hedland owned by the Northern Australian Cattle Company, a branch of Elders International, which were to go to an Elders owned feedlot on their way to an Elders owned abattoir of a calibre and quality that has met Australian standards for many years. This was two days before. Regrettably, the AQIS veterinarian involved had seen these cattle and had approved them for export. The ship was alongside, the cattle were waiting to be shipped and the veterinarian received advice from Canberra to say that he was not to sign off on that consignment of cattle to go into their own feedlot and their own abattoir. I would like to know from the minister what involvement he or his staff or indeed senior officers of the department had in interfering with normal, good, lawful trade. We still do not have an answer as to what happened. For the minister to stand here this afternoon and say that he had to bring in a complete suspension because he had no knowledge or confidence of cattle going into our approved abattoirs overseas is an absolute nonsense and it is a cop-out.


The question now to be asked of course is: what do the Indonesians do? What options do they have now that a valuable source of safe protein has been denied them? Speaking of safe protein I have to draw the attention of the Senate to the unfortunate circumstances in Europe over the last two or three weeks with the outbreaks of E. coli which has led to the deaths of more than 24 people in Europe. The Australian product is a safe product, the abattoirs that are approved for international use are safe.


Amongst other things this decision by this minister will expose Indonesians to standards of safety less than those that they can reasonably expect. But the unfortunate outcome for Indonesia, if they are denied access to our live cattle, is to look elsewhere and where they will look will be to India where there are hundreds of millions of cattle and buffalo and the country has an endemic problem with foot-and-mouth disease. The other countries that are lining up to take away the Australian trade are South American countries, including Brazil and Argentina, which also have foot-and-mouth disease. Australia worked hard some years ago in assisting Indonesia to make sure it was free of foot-and-mouth disease so that we could build a biosecurity barrier around Australia. If cattle from those countries come into Indonesia we will end up with foot-and-mouth disease in this country. The impact on animal welfare alone will be horrific. The losses of animals across Australia, including wildlife, as we try to eradicate foot-and-mouth disease will be on a scale never seen in this country. Quite apart from the fact that the best estimate is a cost of $14 billion alone and a doubling of unemployment in the first year after we get foot-and-mouth disease, quite apart from the impact on northern towns and communities from the loss of tourism and other activities, the question to be asked is: what has gone wrong? Why did this minister bring in a total suspension when all he needed to do was terminate the trade with those abattoirs that do not meet international standards? We in Australia do not think that the Australian border is the limit of animal welfare. We have an opportunity to increase animal welfare standards in Indonesia, and we must resume the trade.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:08):  Far from condemning the minister, those opposite should join with the government in congratulating Minister Ludwig on the actions that he has taken thus far. Far from earning condemnation, the minister should be receiving congratulations from those opposite for the actions he has taken thus far. What we started with was the Four Corners footage of the treatment of Australia's live cattle exports in Indonesian abattoirs, which was truly horrific. Nobody could watch that footage of animal mistreatment and think that it is acceptable. That is why, immediately after seeing the footage, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig, ordered an investigation into the footage. He also asked to be provided with all the regulatory and legislative actions available to him to address the immediate welfare issues for those animals. Equipped with that information, and with the investigation underway, the government firstly suspended live animal exports to the facilities identified by the evidence from the RSPCA and Animals Australia and agreed to add further facilities to the list of banned facilities; implemented a moratorium on the installation of the restraint boxes seen being used in the footage, a change that applies to the installation of any new boxes with Commonwealth funds across all global markets; asked the Chief Veterinary Officer to coordinate the independent scientific assessment of the restraint boxes used in Indonesia; and announced that the government would appoint an independent reviewer to investigate the complete supply chain for live exports up to and including the point of slaughter.


What is clear in all of this is that the producers and the community have been let down by the industry—and the government has taken the appropriate course of action in the circumstances. It is not possible in the current system to guarantee that cattle will not be exposed to the conditions that we have seen. That is why the total suspension order is in place. As those opposite distort the debate, we need to consider whether it is worth taking the risk that Australian animals will continue to be exposed to the shocking conditions we have seen. Cattle producers do not want to see cattle treated this way, nor do the community and the government. This suspension will allow the establishment of a transparent, verifiable system that will account for cattle in Australia right through the supply chain. That is the community standard, that is the government standard and it must be the industry standard.


Minister Ludwig has made it clear that the trade to Indonesia will only recommence when we are certain that the industry is able to comply with that supply chain assurance. The decision to suspend trade was not made easily, but the purpose of the suspension will ensure the better and humane treatment of Australian livestock into the future.


The government is committed to reaching the best possible outcomes for the livestock, for the industry and for our important relationship with Indonesia. To achieve the best possible outcomes the government is talking to industry and assessing the impact of the suspension. The next step is to develop a plan to ensure welfare compliance in the supply chain and also to ensure a sustainable domestic industry.


For those opposite to argue that the government has not previously taken any action to protect Australian livestock exports is completely untrue. Minister Ludwig has consistently expressed his concern about animal welfare outcomes in the live animal trade. As with any industry, it is appropriate to work with them to raise the standards. In fact, as we have heard here today, in January the minister wrote to the industry asking them to better address animal welfare. The plans presented by the industry in March and May were not accepted. The minister said publicly, including, as I understand it, at the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association conference, that the industry had to act on these issues. The minister has said previously, including in question time today, that the plans did not go far enough, that he did not have confidence that they addressed the issue of animal welfare.


Notwithstanding that, industry responses have not addressed the core of the problem, and that is a lack of transparency and verification across the system. We need a transparent and verifiable system that will account for cattle from Australia right through the supply chain. At the moment, the suspension order is necessary to ensure the welfare of Australian livestock. There is currently no guarantee that cattle from Australia are able to be exported to Indonesia and processed within an approved facility. As a result, the government— (Time expired)

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2011-06-14,"



Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Deputy Leader of The Nationals) (15:13):  I would like to start by commend­ing the minister on his first decision in this regard. It was a good decision and it was easy to understand. We have identified 11 abattoirs and processing facilities in Indonesia and the minister was able to dictate that no Australian animals would be allowed to go to those abattoirs. Now, something happened in the interim. Some would say that it might be an email chain. It might have been all sorts of pressures, but it was not seen to be tough enough. So the government just rolls out a highly politicised decision that seems to be good enough: they put a ban on the trade. One needs to understand the impacts on farmers and families; stock contractors; helicopter services—fine pilots and fine services, the Milton Joneses and the John Armstrongs of the world; the feed and pellet producers; and the truck companies.


Can you or any Australian imagine for a minute the impact it would have on you as a grocer, a chemist, a builder or a newsagent if it was suddenly said to you, 'You cannot trade; you can continue to do whatever you like but you cannot sell your product and, by the way, we're not actually giving you an answer about when that will start again so you can have some sort of a plan'? The only consistent thing happening in Northern Australia is that bills need to be paid and the banks are going to need their pound of flesh, and rightly so, every month.


To perhaps humanise this, we have been talking a lot about animal welfare and there is none on this side of the house who would accept that an Australian animal should be treated in any way differently overseas from here. Colin Fink runs a family operated feed mill at Tortilla Flats, just south of Darwin. He has grown, harvested and carted 3,000 tonnes of hay this year at a cost of $120 a tonne for which he does not have a market. He has just processed 160,000 tonnes of pellets to supply three live-cattle boats, but the contracts have stopped so there are no payments or prospects for this feed. He laid off four staff last week and, when all the hay is in, he will lay off another three staff, including his own son who works in the business. Colin spent eight years building this business and says that if this lasts a few more weeks he is going to have to shut down. The mill and the hay property will be vastly devalued if this continues. No-one is going to buy the feed mill, certainly with no market. These are the sorts of emails and stories that I am striking and I have dozens and dozens of people who are literally going to the wall. 


I touch on the impact of animal welfare by this decision to have a ban. People need to understand that the Bos indica stock across Northern Australia are fundamentally a breeding stock. You have a certain amount of land and on that land once a year you will turn off those animals. That land can only handle the breeding stock. It will handle over and after the wet season an increased number of animals that have been bred and are ready to be turned off. Keeping those animals on this country for a longer time is going to have a devastating effect both on the range lands—the country, the environment—and on the animals. Because there is less feed, the animals generally get weaker and I myself have witnessed so many times that when the animals get weaker there is less water, they get bogged and they generally come to a pretty grisly end courtesy of the wild pig population. It is a pretty grim circumstance.


This could all have been avoided if the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry had stood up here today and said that we need to have a food chain process and it all has to be accredited. At the moment there are at least four processing facilities that have an internal closed system. They know that the animals leave Australia in a perfectly functional vessel that is now set to world standards and they go to a perfectly functional feedlot that meets world standards and to a perfectly functioning slaughter­house, which was not seen on Four Corners,that meets and exceeds international standards.


So why would you not be more sophisticated in your approach to ensure that the Colins of this world are not getting beaten up over this process and to ensure that we can continue the trade? There is a legitimate trade that is going to legitimate processes. Everyone acknowledges that those processes now need to expand to take up the remainder of the trade. Those abattoirs that are ready to go now need to be accredited. As soon as they are accredited, the minister should simply make the very important announcement that the trade recommence.

Senator FURNER
 (Queensland) (15:18):  Mr Deputy President, I do not know where you were on Monday a fortnight ago, but I was at estimates and did not get an opportunity to watch the live footage of the Four Corners program on the subject of the live animal trade. But certainly a few nights on I watched it on-stream and it really shocked me. It shocked me to see the horror of this treatment of our animals in Indonesia. I am sure none of us in this chamber would want to sit idly by and allow that sort of conduct to continue.


I will never forget the images. One part of the footage showed an Indonesian man belting a cow with chains. I do not know what the purpose behind that was, but that sort of behaviour really troubled me. It has been suggested here today that we have acted on this issue as a result of an email campaign or that there were delayed responses from the government. I do not think that is the case. When you look at the examples and the feedback from the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry today during question time you see that is not the case. The suspension of the live-animal trade will be in place until appropriate safeguards can be established. The minister said that after the announcement last week. I really challenge anyone to go back and have a look at the footage again of the animal mistreatment. I think anyone will attest that it is totally unacceptable.


That is why it is clear that producers and the community have been let down by the industry. Under the current system, it is not possible to guarantee that cattle will not be exposed to the conditions that we have seen in that footage. Cattle producers do not want to see cattle treated that way, nor does the community and this government. This suspension will allow the establishment of a transparent, verifiable system that will account for cattle from Australia right through the supply chain. That is a community standard. That is the standard that this government stands by and a standard that must be in the industry. The decision to suspend trade was not really an easy one to take and not one that one takes off the back of little evidence and information. But let us be clear on this: it is a suspension that the government will lift as soon as the industry can establish a better system. We made the decision to suspend trade to bring about better treatment for Australian livestock into the future, and that remains our primary goal.


We do have a responsibility and, like many other countries, we have a respon­sibility to the rules of the World Trade Organisation. Australia has the right under the World Trade Organisation rules to take action to ensure that Australian cattle are treated in accordance with the international standards on animal welfare. The decision to suspend trade to Indonesia has been taken following evidence of the animals' mistreatment and advice from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. While action has been taken in response to evidence that has been provided to the Australian government detailing animal welfare abuses in Indonesia, the Australian government will appoint an independent person to review the live animal export chain for all Australia's livestock export destinations. We have a positive relationship with the Indonesian government. That has been demonstrated over the many years since we have been in government through our ability to make various changes not only to this particular area but also to other areas of concern in the Pacific. As a close partner of Indonesia, whose relationship with Australia is of such importance, we will be in a position to work through these changes with the Indonesian government.


The minister ordered a complete suspension of all livestock exports to Indonesia for the purpose of slaughter until the new safeguards are established for the trade. This suspension will be in place until the government and the industry establish sufficient safeguards to provide a verifiable and transparent supply-chain assurance up to and including the point of slaughter for every consignment that leaves Australia. The trade to Indonesia will only recommence when we are certain that the industry is able to comply with that supply-chain assurance. This decision was made following serious consideration of the advice and evidence that was presented to the government.


Reflecting once again, I think that if anybody has not had the opportunity to cite that footage from the Four Corners program, they should do so and see the reasons that we acted decisively on this area of concern to the public. There are numerous emails coming through to us expressing the concern in the community over what is happening to our livestock which is taken offshore, and no doubt that concern will continue until this matter is addressed.

Senator FISHER
 (South Australia) (15:24):   In rising to take note of answers given during question time today, I say that I am offended by the implication that seems to be being made by those senators who support the suspension of Australia's live cattle trade to Indonesia that those senators who disagree with the blanket suspension of the live cattle trade to Indonesia somehow do so on the basis that we are prepared to turn a blind eye to the horrific treatment to which we saw cattle being subjected in the Four Corners program. I find that implication offensive. I also find it offensive that this government seems to think it fit to impose upon the Australian community a policy—that is, the blanket suspension of the live cattle trade to Indonesia—which is all pain and no gain. There is no gain in the blanket suspension of the live cattle trade to Indonesia imposed by this government—there is no gain for the welfare of cattle, since cattle know no borders, and there is no gain for the welfare of cattle or, indeed, for the welfare of animals worldwide. But there is plenty of pain. There is pain for Australian beef cattle producers in the north, in the south and in the west. There is pain for the Australian community, especially small Australian communities. There is flow-on pain to the Australian economy. There is pain for those in poverty in Indonesia, who will have to pay more and so find it harder if they want to access protein through meat. There is pain for Australia's diplomatic relationship with Indonesia—it will potentially take decades to resurrect our trade relationship with Indonesia. There is potential pain for biosecurity and health and safety in Indonesia, as Indonesians without access to a reliable supply of electricity, and who are therefore without reliable refrigeration, are forced to source other, less safe markets for access to protein and their 'wet' meat. There is plenty of pain for Indonesian cattle, the 70 per cent of cattle being slaughtered daily, weekly, monthly in Indonesian abattoirs with techniques of the sort that we saw in the Four Corners footage. If you take away the 20 per cent of the market that Australia supplies to Indonesia through 'wet' meat, and if you take away the approximately 10 per cent that Indonesians consume by way of chilled meat, you are left with the 70 per cent of cattle, mainly Indonesian, that are slaughtered daily. This blanket suspension of Australia's live cattle trade to Indonesia does nothing to stop cruelty for the 70 per cent of cattle that are slaughtered in Indonesia.


Where is the evidence upon which the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and the government have based their decision? The minister has been cowed into submission. Indeed, he has been cowed into suspension; there is no evidence to back his decision to suspend the trade. Not only has this minister never visited a working Indonesian abattoir but he failed to commit to having been inside a working Australian abattoir. He has failed to identify any direct, practical knowledge upon which he based his decision. What has changed between the minister saying that he has raised this issue with the industry and his suspension of the trade? Has there been any change in treatment of cattle in Indonesia over those alleged months? No. What has changed is that we have seen a TV program, and that TV program and the resultant swelling of well-intentioned support in the community has cowed this government into suspension. 



It is all pain and no gain with this suspension of trade. This government has no courage and no policy conviction. They must resume the trade immediately with those five or so abattoirs that the industry says are compliant. (Time expired)

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2011-06-14,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (15:29):  I too would like to take note of the minister's answers on this issue, and note that he did not actually answer one of my questions, which asked: what is the government going to do about Meat and Livestock Australia's role in this whole business? They clearly had a responsibility to maintain—in fact, improve—animal welfare standards and clearly have not done that. I asked the question amongst all of the comments made here around the issues of evidence. I thought the evidence was pretty compelling when I saw Four Corners, I have to admit. Is the proposition here that we should go on allowing that sort of cruelty to occur while we collect even more evidence? It is quite plain that these animals were suffering terrible, inhumane treatment, and the government did the right thing, we believe, in suspending exports to Indonesia. That was the only humane approach that this government could take.


Having said that, we do believe that there are many, many questions unanswered. I know that the minister has an inquiry being undertaken, but he has not been clear about what he intends to do about the role that Meat and Livestock Australia took—what they knew about the ongoing treatment of these animals in Indonesia, what they did about and what the industry representatives knew about it. The representatives from these organisations have been in Indonesia; they have visited the abattoirs that we saw so graphically depicted on Four Corners. And they thought that sort of treatment was okay? How could our cattle industry be allowed to get into the crisis that it faces today? That is the big question. What were the industry representatives doing about that? Why were the MLA not taking action much earlier than they have?


The issue, then, is around compensation, which is what I asked the government about today. I must say that I was pleased that the government said that they are now going to be exercising their power to require Meat and Livestock Australia to open their contingency fund to help those producers that are affected by this decision. Meat and Livestock Australia should not have to be forced to open that contingency fund. They must bear at least some share of the responsibility for the outcome we have at this point for the industry. There is absolutely no doubt that they should have known what was going on, they should have taken action and they should not have allowed this sector to get into the position it is in now. Having not done that, they do not even want to open their contingency fund—funding that the industry has provided in order for them to improve welfare standards for these animals—and government now has to force them. They should have been dealing with this issue earlier. Now that they are, they need to act immediately so that funding can be made available. I would also like to know on what basis they think that the initial $5 million is adequate and whether they have done an analysis on how much funding is required.


We then need to be looking at how we can improve processing in this country so that this issue does not eventuate again. I think people are very clear about what the Greens' position is—that is, we do not support the live export of livestock for slaughter. We have made that very clear in our policies; we do not believe that should occur. What we believe we need to be doing is investing resources in this country so that we carry out processing in this country. Then we need to be using the marketing skills that bodies such as Meat and Livestock Australia are supposed to have to market processed and chilled meat, and we need to be generating jobs in regional Australia so that we are no longer exporting jobs and so that we can produce a quality product here in this country that supports our cattle industry and processing in this country but still enables us to export a quality product.


The Greens will be pursuing both a ban on the export of livestock for slaughter and we are also pursuing—and if people have read the motions that have been tabled or introduced today they will see that I have tabled a motion—referring Meat and Livestock Australia's role in this whole issue to a committee inquiry. We believe that we need to get to the bottom of exactly what role Meat and Livestock Australia had in this issue, how much they knew, what processes they have put in place to deal with those issues and how many times they have visited these abattoirs. First off, they told us in estimates that everything was okay; that animal practices in Indonesia were okay. Less than a week later, we saw that it was not okay on the Four Corners show. Less than a week before that, they were assuring a Senate committee that all was okay. (Time expired)

 (Western Australia—Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (15:34):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate records its deep regret at the death, on 14 May 2011, of Mr Andrew Murray Thomas, former senator for Western Australia from 1975 to 1983, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.


I did not know former senator Andrew Murray Thomas, but when I read the available information about him, a picture emerges of a hardworking, happy and caring family man who worked very hard to represent my own state of Western Australia at the federal level, as well as pursuing achievable objectives for his state at the regional and local level. Perhaps the measure of the man is best illustrated by his first Senate speech on 25 February 1976. Then, he stressed:


It seems obvious to me that if I try to apply myself to all of the matters that come before the Senate I will be of little value to anyone.


I think we all concur that we cannot possibly keep up with everything that comes before the Senate. He then drew attention to the importance to the future of Western Aust­ralia of Commonwealth-state relations, the state's agricultural potential and its very important export rural production, and these formed the framework for his future political contributions.


Former senator Thomas was born on 14 March 1936, in Blyth, South Australia. He was educated at the one-teacher Stanley Flat school and then attended the Clare High School for three years, leaving in 1951. He subsequently followed in his father's and grandfather's footsteps to become a farmer and stud sheep breeder. At 18, he was the youngest official judge for the South Australian Stud Merino Sheep Breeders Association. He married wife Jenny in 1958 in Adelaide and within four years they moved to Western Australia, having pur­chased a property in the Northampton district just north of Geraldton. It is amazing how many South Australians have moved to WA and then entered the Senate. There are a number of them, and he was obviously one of the first. Senator Bishop was one and Senator Cook was another, and there is member Julie Bishop, so it sounds as if former senator Andrew Thomas set a bit of a trend and saw the wisdom of moving to Western Australia. Someone coined the phrase that he was a joiner. He joined the executive of the Stud Merino Breeders Association of Western Australia and yet became president of the rival Australian Merino Society. He was on the advisory board of the Muresk Agricultural College, was a member of the national advisory council of the CSIRO and was elected to the board of the Westralian Farmers Limited, now known as Wesfarmers. At the local level he was active in the P&C Association, the local historical society, sporting clubs and the Freemasons, but his politics developed more pragmatically. I quote him: 'I joined the Pastoralists and Graziers Association only because their representative approached me and the farmers union didn't. I joined the Liberal Party because they had a branch in Northampton and the Country Party didn't.'


By 1974, he had become vice-president of the Western Australian division of the Liberal Party. In 1975, he was elected as senator for Western Australia after an unsuccessful bid a year earlier. He was re-elected in 1977 and served until 1983. He spoke with authority on aspects of primary industry, north-west development and government services to remote areas. He promoted the order-of-irrigation scheme, citing its suitability for the production of sugar cane. He also promoted the development of the Pilbara region with the commencement of the Woodside gas project on the Burrup Peninsula.


He was an industrious member of Senate committees, serving as chair on the Standing Committee on Natural Resources. Many of the committee reports touched on environmental issues such as solar energy, plant variety rights, water resources, rural research, alternatives to petrol based fuels and the aluminium industry. His committee's report on the aluminium industry contro­versially recommended a resource rent tax. His term of appointment as Deputy Government Whip in 1981 was not without tension. He threatened to cross the floor to vote with the Labor opposition on sunset amendments to the proposed two-airline agreement, but it seems that his decision to resign as deputy whip was the result of his decision to oppose the retrospectivity clauses of legislation which the Fraser government introduced in 1982 to outlaw the bottom-of-the-harbour tax schemes, which of course was a huge issue in Western Australia.


It is also clear that his association with the resource rent tax added to the pressures that he was experiencing not just in Canberra but also within the Liberal ranks in Western Australia. He was relegated to fifth position on the Senate ticket and was not re-elected after the double dissolution of parliament and the subsequent election of March 1983. He never sought a political appointment again and eventually went into business as a cabinet-maker rather than continuing his work as a stud sheep breeder. During this time of reflection, he produced his autobiography, entitled Her Five Husbands. It tells how his wife had five husbands in one man. He was in turn a farmer, a stud merino breeder, a senator, a cabinet-maker and, finally, an author.


Let me finish by quoting former Senator Fred Chaney's valedictory words, which surely position Andrew Thomas as a Western Australian senator: 'I draw attention to the great length of time that Senator Thomas spent travelling in the remoter parts of Western Australia during each parlia­mentary recess. It was a unique contribution. Wherever I went during the last election campaign, I received expressions of apprecia­tion for Andrew Thomas's representation of those people.'


I am sure that, on behalf of all senators, I convey our sincerest condolences to Andrew Thomas's widow, Jenny; his three children, Kim, Christopher and Elizabeth; and their 10 grandchildren. He obviously lived a full and productive life, and the Senate pays due tribute to that life.

",Senate,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Thomas, Mr Andrew Murray</title>",CONDOLENCES,10,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2011-06-14,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:41):  A man of strong conviction, former Senator Andrew Thomas was universally respected. When he left this place he was described as 'well regarded by everyone here' by the Liberals, 'a very good friend and colleague' by Labor and 'a happy character, a hard worker and a young man whose knowledge of the husbandry of the soil and stock was probably second to none' by the Nationals. We in the coalition mourn his passing.


Elected to this place in 1975 as a senator for Western Australia, he served as a strong advocate for rural and regional Australia and as a very effective deputy whip—a tradition continued by Senator Judith Adams. Although not in the Senate for long, he rose to prominence when he resigned as Deputy Government Whip to exercise the inalienable right of Liberal senators to cross the floor on a piece of legislation with which he did not agree. Prior to entering the parliament he was a respected and successful merino breeder in Western Australia. He was on the executive of the Stud Merino Breeders Association of Western Australia and also served as the inaugural president of the Australian Merino Society. He also served on the advisory board of the Muresk Agricultural College, the national advisory council of the CSIRO and the board of Wesfarmers. Former Senator Thomas and his wife took an active part in their local community, taking an active role on the Parents and Citizens Association and the local historical, agricultural and sporting societies.


The commitment to his local community allowed him to be regarded as a strong and effective local member—a great tribute for a senator. He broke the mould and, instead of having his electorate office in the same complex where all other Western Australians at the time had their electorate offices, established one in Geraldton to be closer to the people. In his first speech in this place he made the observation that many Western Australians rely on rural production for a large part of their income. He went on to say that a diminishing number of Australians are affected by the prosperity of farmers—a fact that is, unfortunately, true to this day.


His focus in this place was on the local interests of the north-western Kimberley regions of Western Australia, regularly asking questions in question time addressing the provision of government services to remote areas. That was when there was a greater freedom for backbenchers to ask questions without notice. I understand the President would call you and a whole host of senators would jump simultaneously. It was up to the President to choose. Clearly Senator Thomas received the call on num­erous occasions. After leaving this place he moved to Mandurah, where he went into business as a contract cabinet maker. I do not know if that was a development of what the Leader of the Government said in his speech: that he was known as a joiner because he joined a lot of organisations. He then became a cabinet maker. I wonder if that was an extension of his interest in joinery.




Senator Chris Evans:
  Please stop!




Senator ABETZ:
  I will stop there. He was involved in the issues of the day, expressing concern over the two-airline agreement, tariffs costing Australian competitiveness and productivity, doubting the appropriateness of retrospective tax legislation. He was passionate about federalism. He expressed concern about marketing boards for the rural sector. What he said about marketing boards in his first speech is very interesting:


Producers must be in a position to respond immediately to changes in market requirements, and this can be difficult if a guaranteed price disguises changes in world demand.


Very prophetic words when you have a look at what happened to our wool industry, in particular, after his departure. He went on to say:


I am an advocate of free marketing of rural products, but I accept that in some industries some controls are needed. However, I have found that generally farmers who in theory support private enterprise are imposing on themselves unbelievable controls and restrictions.


These too were very prophetic words. He also championed income equalisation deposits for farmers.


Going through some old newspaper clippings I could not help but notice his role as Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources. In an article on 7 March 1981, when he was chairman of the committee, he shared the committee's view of the then Secretary to the Treasury, one Mr John Stone, who later became a senator. Mr Stone, in his testimony before the committee, was highly critical of and dissociated himself from reports dealing with the Treasury's submission to the committee. Indeed, it was seen as a contempt of the committee and the parliament. Interestingly enough the journalist, 30 years ago, was Paul Kelly, who now enjoys a very high reputation in the press gallery here in Canberra.


In 2000, former Senator Thomas published an autobiography in which he revealed himself as a conscientious and fair-minded backbencher more at home with the opportunities for constructive analysis of policy provided by Senate committees than with the sometimes cutthroat factional politics of the party, a feature which saw him relegated to the fifth position in a double dissolution ticket, having been displaced. I note that on that occasion it was Senator Noel Crichton-Browne who got the third position, after two cabinet members.


Former Senator Andrew Thomas will be remembered as a well-regarded and respected gentleman who had the courage of his convictions, had the courage to stand up for his local community and had the courage to vehemently fight to make life better for rural and regional Western Australians. To his wife, Jenny, his three children and 10 grandchildren the coalition place on record our appreciation of his public service and our sympathy to the family in their bereavement.

 (Western Australia) (16:12):  Mr Deputy President, I seek leave to make a brief statement.




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  Leave is granted for two minutes.




Senator CORMANN:
  I thank the Senate. The coalition will not be supporting this motion, for two reasons. Firstly, the time to set up a sovereign wealth fund is when the budget is in surplus and at least government net debt has been paid off. That is exactly what the Howard government did—what John Howard and Peter Costello did—back in 2006. They paid off $96 billion worth of Labor debt. Then, after delivering successive surpluses, they set up the Future Fund. The Future Fund was exactly that—a sovereign wealth fund. It is true to say that this government has been blessed with the best terms of trade in 140 years. The budget should be in surplus. The budget should be in a much stronger position. Instead we are looking at $107 billion of government net debt—and the government has asked the parliament to raise the debt ceiling by another $50 billion to $250 billion. We are looking at the second highest deficit this financial year. So, unless the Greens are suggesting that the government should borrow in order to invest in a sovereign wealth fund, this is really not the time to go down that path. That would be Greenonomics rather than economics, if we went down that path.


Secondly, there are some unresolved issues about the Senate's authority to order the Productivity Commission to deliver certain reports. In November last year, the Senate passed an order requiring the Productivity Commission to deliver a report on the anticompetitive, closed shop arrangements that are currently in place in relation to the selection of default superannuation funds under modern awards; we were seeking to implement Labor Party policy. The Senate ordered the Productivity Commission to deliver a report, with a more open, transparent and competitive process recommended around the selection of default superannuation funds on the modern awards which has still not been delivered— (Time expired)

Senator HUTCHINS,ALP,2011-06-14,"



Senator HUTCHINS
 (New South Wales) (19:06):  In my time in this place I have been concerned with strategies to counter organised criminal networks operating in Australia, among the most insidious forms of which are those that profit from human misery through the trade in illicit drugs. Next week we will all be reminded of the importance of combating the scourge in society that this trade represents when Drug Action Week commences, during which over 700 events are planned across Australia to promote awareness of the dangers of illicit drug use.


As the purchasing power of the Australian dollar rises, it is not only profiteering retailers who are failing to lower their prices to take into account the lower cost of buying their stock; drug dealers also have kept their prices high to maximise their profit margins. For an international drug trafficker Australia is a very attractive and profitable market. International drug cartels have had their sights set on how much their drugs are worth here and how high they can push up their prices, and we are grateful that through ever-improving methods of detection and deterrence the government is making their entry extremely difficult. Other factors forcing up the price of illegal drugs have been the success of our Customs and Border Protection regime in keeping drugs out and the criminal penalties imposed on anyone who participates in the trade and use of these substances.


More can always be done to ensure that the market for drugs in Australia is difficult to trade in. We want to continue sending a clear message that illicit drug use will not be tolerated in Australian society. But some policies, while they may be well-intentioned, have unintended consequences that threaten to detrimentally impact on this strong record of preventing and discouraging criminal drug use. One such policy has been the creation of drug injecting rooms such as the Sydney Medically Supervised Injecting Centre, known as MSIC, in Kings Cross. This facility allows for the injection of illegally obtained drugs in a medically supervised environment. These places are often subsidised by the taxpayer either through direct contribution or because the operator is a tax-exempt entity. There is no compulsion among users to reduce drug use or to overcome their addiction, and the police do not ask questions about what goes on inside as these activities are protected from legal consequence. Sites such as these create a place where excessive and dangerous drug use is accepted and even encouraged as addicts are provided with an environment where their drug use is not condemned or penalised. An article in the Sunday Telegraph in 2006 examined an influx of ice users at the Kings Cross centre, which had become a magnet for this type of user because, as one participant was quoted as saying:


You can do what you want.


…   …   …




It's amnesty once you cross the door; cops can't touch you.



This influx was associated with increases in violence and destruction of property in the surrounding area. The article also quoted a police officer who referred to 'assault and malicious damage' as the main by-products of ice use in the centre. Even more worrying is evidence suggesting that the existence of these injecting rooms encourages users to take even greater risks than they usually would with the amount of drugs that they consume. Some have also been known to experiment with cocktails involving prescription medicines, commonly in combination with other drugs such as heroin. It is not purely illegal drugs that are being abused but also various combinations of substances. Some claim that every overdose or medical incident that takes place within the walls of an injecting centre is a life potentially saved on the street. But it is much more plausible that this overdose would not have occurred outside the environment provided by the centre which acted to encourage it in the first place.


In a 2003 study, an expert committee commissioned by Drug Free Australia found that the rate of overdose among clients prior to their attending the injection room was 42 times lower than the rate experienced by the clients inside the room. This is corroborated by evidence both from participants and from research commissioned by the Kings Cross centre. One former client of the centre has said of the overdosing there that users:




... 
feel a lot … safer, … because they know they can be brought back
 to life straight away.





…
   …
   …





… 
they feel it is a comfort zone, and no matter how much they use … they will be brought back.



Couple this statement with an evaluation conducted by the centre itself which concedes that the rate of heroin overdose at the centre is recognised to be many times higher than that experienced by users on the street, and the empirical conclusion is fairly logical and unsurprising: for an addict going for that increasingly elusive high, injecting rooms are a gift. Having the freedom to use as much as you like, knowing that there is someone in the next room with the ability to flush all the poison out of you, is a powerful incentive for attending the centre for the purpose of deliberately overdosing. A facility staffed by medically trained assistants condoning users' addictions by their silent complicity and filled with other addicts looking for a fix does nothing to reinforce the message that users should be working extremely hard to remove from their lives the destructive behaviour that they are engaging in. Far from helping to cure the addiction and combat the drug trade, these centres create a haven for the excessive use of drugs free from the penalty of law.


Considering the market element of this equation, drug injecting centres also assist organised crime in identifying potential customers. It may be difficult to sell drugs around the centres, as I am sure that close monitoring of such transactions would occur, but you can be sure that criminals have their eyes out for new buyers. The people who least need easy access to illicit drugs will be the first approached by the dealers, thanks to their attendance at these injecting rooms. Perversely, the combination of medical supervision and criminal amnesty does not create a centre where lives are saved, and it does not help users overcome their soul-destroying addiction to substances such as heroin and ice. The centre does not prevent the illegal trade in these substances and does not reduce the profitability of organised crime in any way. Instead, the centre encourages overdose and risky behaviour even in excess of the terrible risks that drug users face with every hit they take, and it helps criminals to find customers. But the most significant concern that I have with centres like Kings Cross, over and above these demonstrated negative outcomes, is also the most compelling case for their closure—the perception that illicit drug use is acceptable within the community. By undermining criminal sanctions against drug use, and by advertising a place where it is safe—and I use the word 'safe' with great qualification—to use drugs, injecting rooms by their very existence imply that illicit drug users can and should be able to find a way around the deterrence structure that society has developed in the interests of public safety and health.


By undermining the following principles—that no illicit drug use is safe, that trade in these substances is criminal, and that society will not tolerate it—we undermine the entire edifice that has made Australia one of the most difficult drug markets in the world to trade in, the same system that restricts the use of these chemicals and protects our community from all the social and financial side effects that accompany their consumption. I encourage all senators and members of the public to participate in Drug Action Week next week and show support for such efforts to create a society free of substance abuse through public awareness of the terrible toll that it takes on peoples' lives. As a community we should not allow this kind of behaviour to ever become mainstream or acceptable, and this is even more so the case for illicit drug use.

Senator Wong:
  The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:





Agency




Response






ABS




The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) does not consider that new or additional office accommodation may be required in the next two years, with the exception of operational requirements for the 2011 Census of Population and Housing. For the period of the Census, the ABS has signed a lease on small office space in Alice Springs to accommodate under five staff.






ACCC




As at the date of the senator's question, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is not seeking to expand on its currently negotiated lease arrangements in the next two years. 






AOFM




The Australian Office of Financial Management does not consider that new or additional office accommodation will be required for the agency in the next 2 years.






APRA




Yes. No. N/A






ASIC




ASIC currently has plans under way for renewed premises in Brisbane in 2011. This is a result of the lease expiring at one of the two premises ASIC currently has in Brisbane. The new lease is for larger premises at one of the existing locations and will result in the consolidation of the two Brisbane sites currently occupied. The consolidation of these two sites will reduce ASIC's total Brisbane tenancy space from 4066sqm to 3400sqm.


Whilst there are also planned changes for ASIC's Melbourne and Canberra offices in the next two years, these changes result (through achieving better efficiencies) in reductions of space.






CAMAC




No






IGT




Nil






NCC




The National Competition Council may relocate its office within the next 2 years. Any new accommodation will not be in Canberra.






RAM




The Royal Australian Mint anticipates that there will be no requirement for new or additional office accommodation in the next two years.






PC




The Productivity Commission's Melbourne office accommodation lease expires in June 2011 and options are currently under consideration, including possible re-location to other office accommodation in Melbourne. The Commission is not anticipating any requirement for additional accommodation in Canberra over the next two years.






CGC




The Commission advises that no new or additional accommodation will be required in the next 2 years.






AASB




No, the Australian Accounting Standards Board does not consider that it will require new or additional office accommodation in the next 2 years






Treasury




It is not envisaged that the Treasury will require new or additional office accommodation in the next two years;  this is assuming that the function and or staff numbers do not grow at more than previous trend data suggests (reference, the Treasury Strategic Property Plan 2010 – 2015).
